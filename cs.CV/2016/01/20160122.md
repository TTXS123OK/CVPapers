- **Summary**: Speech recognition is a challenging problem. Due to the acoustic limitations, using visual information is essential for improving the recognition accuracy in real-life unconstraint situations. One common approach is to model the visual recognition as nonlinear optimization problem. Measuring the distances between visual units is essential for solving this problem. Embedding the visual units on a manifold and using manifold kernels is one way to measure these distances. This work is intended to evaluate the performance of several manifold kernels for solving the problem of visual speech recognition. We show the theory behind each kernel. We apply manifold kernel partial least squares framework to OuluVs and AvLetters databases, and show empirical comparison between all kernels. This framework provides convenient way to explore different kernels.

- **Summary**: Clustering is a fundamental data mining tool that aims to divide data into groups of similar items. Generally, intuition about clustering reflects the ideal case -- exact data sets endowed with flawless dissimilarity between individual instances.   In practice however, these cases are in the minority, and clustering applications are typically characterized by noisy data sets with approximate pairwise dissimilarities. As such, the efficacy of clustering methods in practical applications necessitates robustness to perturbations.   In this paper, we perform a formal analysis of perturbation robustness, revealing that the extent to which algorithms can exhibit this desirable characteristic is inherently limited, and identifying the types of structures that allow popular clustering paradigms to discover meaningful clusters in spite of faulty data.

- **Summary**: Haze removal has been a very challenging problem due to its ill-posedness, which is more ill-posed if the input data is only a single hazy image. In this paper, we present a new approach for removing haze from a single input image. The proposed method combines the model widely used to describe the formation of a haze image with the assumption in Retinex that an image is the product of the illumination and the reflection. We assume that the depth and reflection functions are spatially piecewise smooth in the model, where the total variation is used for the regularization. The proposed model is defined as a constrained optimization problem, which is solved by an alternating minimization scheme and the fast gradient projection algorithm. Some theoretic analyses are given for the proposed model and algorithm. Finally, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate that our method can restore vivid and contrastive hazy images effectively.

- **Summary**: Sampling and budgeting training examples are two essential factors in tracking algorithms based on support vector machines (SVMs) as a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Recently, the circulant matrix formed by dense sampling of translated image patches has been utilized in correlation filters for fast tracking. In this paper, we derive an equivalent formulation of a SVM model with circulant matrix expression and present an efficient alternating optimization method for visual tracking. We incorporate the discrete Fourier transform with the proposed alternating optimization process, and pose the tracking problem as an iterative learning of support correlation filters (SCFs) which find the global optimal solution with real-time performance. For a given circulant data matrix with n^2 samples of size n*n, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is O(n^2*logn) whereas that of the standard SVM-based approaches is at least O(n^4). In addition, we extend the SCF-based tracking algorithm with multi-channel features, kernel functions, and scale-adaptive approaches to further improve the tracking performance. Experimental results on a large benchmark dataset show that the proposed SCF-based algorithms perform favorably against the state-of-the-art tracking methods in terms of accuracy and speed.

- **Summary**: We present a system for online monitoring of maritime activity over streaming positions from numerous vessels sailing at sea. It employs an online tracking module for detecting important changes in the evolving trajectory of each vessel across time, and thus can incrementally retain concise, yet reliable summaries of its recent movement. In addition, thanks to its complex event recognition module, this system can also offer instant notification to marine authorities regarding emergency situations, such as risk of collisions, suspicious moves in protected zones, or package picking at open sea. Not only did our extensive tests validate the performance, efficiency, and robustness of the system against scalable volumes of real-world and synthetically enlarged datasets, but its deployment against online feeds from vessels has also confirmed its capabilities for effective, real-time maritime surveillance.

- **Summary**: This paper exploits Geometric (Clifford) Algebra (GA) theory in order to devise and introduce a new adaptive filtering strategy. From a least-squares cost function, the gradient is calculated following results from Geometric Calculus (GC), the extension of GA to handle differential and integral calculus. The novel GA least-mean-squares (GA-LMS) adaptive filter, which inherits properties from standard adaptive filters and from GA, is developed to recursively estimate a rotor (multivector), a hypercomplex quantity able to describe rotations in any dimension. The adaptive filter (AF) performance is assessed via a 3D point-clouds registration problem, which contains a rotation estimation step. Calculating the AF computational complexity suggests that it can contribute to reduce the cost of a full-blown 3D registration algorithm, especially when the number of points to be processed grows. Moreover, the employed GA/GC framework allows for easily applying the resulting filter to estimating rotors in higher dimensions.

- **Summary**: We investigate topological descriptors for 3D surface analysis, i.e. the classification of surfaces according to their geometric fine structure. On a dataset of high-resolution 3D surface reconstructions we compute persistence diagrams for a 2D cubical filtration. In the next step we investigate different topological descriptors and measure their ability to discriminate structurally different 3D surface patches. We evaluate their sensitivity to different parameters and compare the performance of the resulting topological descriptors to alternative (non-topological) descriptors. We present a comprehensive evaluation that shows that topological descriptors are (i) robust, (ii) yield state-of-the-art performance for the task of 3D surface analysis and (iii) improve classification performance when combined with non-topological descriptors.



### 3-D/2-D Registration of Cardiac Structures by 3-D Contrast Agent Distribution Estimation

- **Summary**: For augmented fluoroscopy during cardiac catheter ablation procedures, a preoperatively acquired 3-D model of the left atrium of the patient can be registered to X-ray images. Therefore the 3D-model is matched with the contrast agent based appearance of the left atrium. Commonly, only small amounts of contrast agent (CA) are used to locate the left atrium. This is why we focus on robust registration methods that work also if the structure of interest is only partially contrasted. In particular, we propose two similarity measures for CA-based registration: The first similarity measure, explicit apparent edges, focuses on edges of the patient anatomy made visible by contrast agent and can be computed quickly on the GPU. The second novel similarity measure computes a contrast agent distribution estimate (CADE) inside the 3-D model and rates its consistency with the CA seen in biplane fluoroscopic images. As the CADE computation involves a reconstruction of CA in 3-D using the CA within the fluoroscopic images, it is slower. Using a combination of both methods, our evaluation on 11 well-contrasted clinical datasets yielded an error of 7.9+/-6.3 mm over all frames. For 10 datasets with little CA, we obtained an error of 8.8+/-6.7 mm. Our new methods outperform a registration based on the projected shadow significantly (p<0.05).

- **Summary**: We propose the first algorithm for non-rigid 2D-to-3D shape matching, where the input is a 2D shape represented as a planar curve and a 3D shape represented as a surface; the output is a continuous curve on the surface. We cast the problem as finding the shortest circular path on the product 3-manifold of the surface and the curve. We prove that the optimal matching can be computed in polynomial time with a (worst-case) complexity of $O(mn^2\log(n))$, where $m$ and $n$ denote the number of vertices on the template curve and the 3D shape respectively. We also demonstrate that in practice the runtime is essentially linear in $m\!\cdot\! n$ making it an efficient method for shape analysis and shape retrieval. Quantitative evaluation confirms that the method provides excellent results for sketch-based deformable 3D shape retrieval.

- **Summary**: Traditional methods for motion estimation estimate the motion field F between a pair of images as the one that minimizes a predesigned cost function. In this paper, we propose a direct method and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that when, at test time, is given a pair of images as input it produces a dense motion field F at its output layer. In the absence of large datasets with ground truth motion that would allow classical supervised training, we propose to train the network in an unsupervised manner. The proposed cost function that is optimized during training, is based on the classical optical flow constraint. The latter is differentiable with respect to the motion field and, therefore, allows backpropagation of the error to previous layers of the network. Our method is tested on both synthetic and real image sequences and performs similarly to the state-of-the-art methods.
