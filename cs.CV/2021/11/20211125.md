- **Summary**: Domain generalization (DG) is a difficult transfer learning problem aiming to learn a generalizable model for unseen domains. Recent foundation models (FMs) are robust to many distribution shifts and, therefore, should substantially improve the performance of DG. In this work, we study generic ways to adopt CLIP, a Visual-Language Foundation Model, for DG problems in image classification. While ERM greatly improves the accuracy with bigger backbones and training datasets using standard DG benchmarks, fine-tuning FMs is not practical in many real-world situations. We propose Domain Prompt Learning (DPL) as a novel approach for domain inference in the form of conditional prompt generation. DPL achieved a significant accuracy improvement with only training a lightweight prompt generator (a three-layer MLP), whose parameter is of equivalent scale to the classification projector in the previous DG literature. Combining \dplshort~with CLIP provides surprising performance, raising the accuracy of zero-shot CLIP from 73.7% to 79.3% on several standard datasets, namely PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and TerraIncognita. We hope the simplicity and success of our approach lead to broader adoption and analysis of foundation models in the domain generalization field.

- **Summary**: We formally demonstrate that the relative seriality model of Kallman, et al. maps exactly onto a simple type of convolutional neural network. This approach leads to a natural interpretation of feedforward connections in the convolutional layer and stacked intermediate pooling layers in terms of bystander effects and hierarchical tissue organization, respectively. These results serve as proof-of-principle for radiobiologically interpretable deep learning of normal tissue complication probability using large-scale imaging and dosimetry datasets.

- **Summary**: Deep networks provide state-of-the-art performance in multiple imaging inverse problems ranging from medical imaging to computational photography. However, most existing networks are trained with clean signals which are often hard or impossible to obtain. Equivariant imaging (EI) is a recent self-supervised learning framework that exploits the group invariance present in signal distributions to learn a reconstruction function from partial measurement data alone. While EI results are impressive, its performance degrades with increasing noise. In this paper, we propose a Robust Equivariant Imaging (REI) framework which can learn to image from noisy partial measurements alone. The proposed method uses Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) to obtain a fully unsupervised training loss that is robust to noise. We show that REI leads to considerable performance gains on linear and nonlinear inverse problems, thereby paving the way for robust unsupervised imaging with deep networks.

- **Summary**: Mask-based lensless cameras can be flat, thin, and light-weight, which makes them suitable for novel designs of computational imaging systems with large surface areas and arbitrary shapes. Despite recent progress in lensless cameras, the quality of images recovered from the lensless cameras is often poor due to the ill-conditioning of the underlying measurement system. In this paper, we propose to use coded illumination to improve the quality of images reconstructed with lensless cameras. In our imaging model, the scene/object is illuminated by multiple coded illumination patterns as the lensless camera records sensor measurements. We designed and tested a number of illumination patterns and observed that shifting dots (and related orthogonal) patterns provide the best overall performance. We propose a fast and low-complexity recovery algorithm that exploits the separability and block-diagonal structure in our system. We present simulation results and hardware experiment results to demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly improve the reconstruction quality.

- **Summary**: We propose a way of learning disentangled content-style representation of image, allowing us to extrapolate images to any style as well as interpolate between any pair of styles. By augmenting data set in a supervised setting and imposing triplet loss, we ensure the separation of information encoded by content and style representation. We also make use of cycle-consistency loss to guarantee that images could be reconstructed faithfully by their representation.

- **Summary**: Recent efforts in deploying Deep Neural Networks for object detection in real world applications, such as autonomous driving, assume that all relevant object classes have been observed during training. Quantifying the performance of these models in settings when the test data is not represented in the training set has mostly focused on pixel-level uncertainty estimation techniques of models trained for semantic segmentation. This paper proposes to exploit additional predictions of semantic segmentation models and quantifying its confidences, followed by classification of object hypotheses as known vs. unknown, out of distribution objects. We use object proposals generated by Region Proposal Network (RPN) and adapt distance aware uncertainty estimation of semantic segmentation using Radial Basis Functions Networks (RBFN) for class agnostic object mask prediction. The augmented object proposals are then used to train a classifier for known vs. unknown objects categories. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves parallel performance to state of the art methods for unknown object detection and can also be used effectively for reducing object detectors' false positive rate. Our method is well suited for applications where prediction of non-object background categories obtained by semantic segmentation is reliable.



### Less is More: Generating Grounded Navigation Instructions from Landmarks

- **Summary**: We study the automatic generation of navigation instructions from 360-degree images captured on indoor routes. Existing generators suffer from poor visual grounding, causing them to rely on language priors and hallucinate objects. Our MARKY-MT5 system addresses this by focusing on visual landmarks; it comprises a first stage landmark detector and a second stage generator -- a multimodal, multilingual, multitask encoder-decoder. To train it, we bootstrap grounded landmark annotations on top of the Room-across-Room (RxR) dataset. Using text parsers, weak supervision from RxR's pose traces, and a multilingual image-text encoder trained on 1.8b images, we identify 971k English, Hindi and Telugu landmark descriptions and ground them to specific regions in panoramas. On Room-to-Room, human wayfinders obtain success rates (SR) of 71% following MARKY-MT5's instructions, just shy of their 75% SR following human instructions -- and well above SRs with other generators. Evaluations on RxR's longer, diverse paths obtain 61-64% SRs on three languages. Generating such high-quality navigation instructions in novel environments is a step towards conversational navigation tools and could facilitate larger-scale training of instruction-following agents.

- **Summary**: In this work we investigate how to achieve equivariance to input transformations in deep networks, purely from data, without being given a model of those transformations. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for example, are equivariant to image translation, a transformation that can be easily modelled (by shifting the pixels vertically or horizontally). Other transformations, such as out-of-plane rotations, do not admit a simple analytic model. We propose an auto-encoder architecture whose embedding obeys an arbitrary set of equivariance relations simultaneously, such as translation, rotation, colour changes, and many others. This means that it can take an input image, and produce versions transformed by a given amount that were not observed before (e.g. a different point of view of the same object, or a colour variation). Despite extending to many (even non-geometric) transformations, our model reduces exactly to a CNN in the special case of translation-equivariance. Equivariances are important for the interpretability and robustness of deep networks, and we demonstrate results of successful re-rendering of transformed versions of input images on several synthetic and real datasets, as well as results on object pose estimation.



### Multiway Non-rigid Point Cloud Registration via Learned Functional Map Synchronization

- **Summary**: We present SyNoRiM, a novel way to jointly register multiple non-rigid shapes by synchronizing the maps relating learned functions defined on the point clouds. Even though the ability to process non-rigid shapes is critical in various applications ranging from computer animation to 3D digitization, the literature still lacks a robust and flexible framework to match and align a collection of real, noisy scans observed under occlusions. Given a set of such point clouds, our method first computes the pairwise correspondences parameterized via functional maps. We simultaneously learn potentially non-orthogonal basis functions to effectively regularize the deformations, while handling the occlusions in an elegant way. To maximally benefit from the multi-way information provided by the inferred pairwise deformation fields, we synchronize the pairwise functional maps into a cycle-consistent whole thanks to our novel and principled optimization formulation. We demonstrate via extensive experiments that our method achieves a state-of-the-art performance in registration accuracy, while being flexible and efficient as we handle both non-rigid and multi-body cases in a unified framework and avoid the costly optimization over point-wise permutations by the use of basis function maps.



### Active Learning at the ImageNet Scale

- **Summary**: Active learning (AL) algorithms aim to identify an optimal subset of data for annotation, such that deep neural networks (DNN) can achieve better performance when trained on this labeled subset. AL is especially impactful in industrial scale settings where data labeling costs are high and practitioners use every tool at their disposal to improve model performance. The recent success of self-supervised pretraining (SSP) highlights the importance of harnessing abundant unlabeled data to boost model performance. By combining AL with SSP, we can make use of unlabeled data while simultaneously labeling and training on particularly informative samples.   In this work, we study a combination of AL and SSP on ImageNet. We find that performance on small toy datasets -- the typical benchmark setting in the literature -- is not representative of performance on ImageNet due to the class imbalanced samples selected by an active learner. Among the existing baselines we test, popular AL algorithms across a variety of small and large scale settings fail to outperform random sampling. To remedy the class-imbalance problem, we propose Balanced Selection (BASE), a simple, scalable AL algorithm that outperforms random sampling consistently by selecting more balanced samples for annotation than existing methods.

- **Summary**: The diagnosis of early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for timely treatment to slow further deterioration. Visualizing the morphological features for the early stages of AD is of great clinical value. In this work, a novel Multidirectional Perception Generative Adversarial Network (MP-GAN) is proposed to visualize the morphological features indicating the severity of AD for patients of different stages. Specifically, by introducing a novel multidirectional mapping mechanism into the model, the proposed MP-GAN can capture the salient global features efficiently. Thus, by utilizing the class-discriminative map from the generator, the proposed model can clearly delineate the subtle lesions via MR image transformations between the source domain and the pre-defined target domain. Besides, by integrating the adversarial loss, classification loss, cycle consistency loss and \emph{L}1 penalty, a single generator in MP-GAN can learn the class-discriminative maps for multiple-classes. Extensive experimental results on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that MP-GAN achieves superior performance compared with the existing methods. The lesions visualized by MP-GAN are also consistent with what clinicians observe.



### Effectiveness of Detection-based and Regression-based Approaches for Estimating Mask-Wearing Ratio

- **Summary**: Estimating the mask-wearing ratio in public places is important as it enables health authorities to promptly analyze and implement policies. Methods for estimating the mask-wearing ratio on the basis of image analysis have been reported. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive research on both methodologies and datasets. Most recent reports straightforwardly propose estimating the ratio by applying conventional object detection and classification methods. It is feasible to use regression-based approaches to estimate the number of people wearing masks, especially for congested scenes with tiny and occluded faces, but this has not been well studied. A large-scale and well-annotated dataset is still in demand. In this paper, we present two methods for ratio estimation that leverage either a detection-based or regression-based approach. For the detection-based approach, we improved the state-of-the-art face detector, RetinaFace, used to estimate the ratio. For the regression-based approach, we fine-tuned the baseline network, CSRNet, used to estimate the density maps for masked and unmasked faces. We also present the first large-scale dataset, the ``NFM dataset,'' which contains 581,108 face annotations extracted from 18,088 video frames in 17 street-view videos. Experiments demonstrated that the RetinaFace-based method has higher accuracy under various situations and that the CSRNet-based method has a shorter operation time thanks to its compactness.

- **Summary**: Existing Voice Cloning (VC) tasks aim to convert a paragraph text to a speech with desired voice specified by a reference audio. This has significantly boosted the development of artificial speech applications. However, there also exist many scenarios that cannot be well reflected by these VC tasks, such as movie dubbing, which requires the speech to be with emotions consistent with the movie plots. To fill this gap, in this work we propose a new task named Visual Voice Cloning (V2C), which seeks to convert a paragraph of text to a speech with both desired voice specified by a reference audio and desired emotion specified by a reference video. To facilitate research in this field, we construct a dataset, V2C-Animation, and propose a strong baseline based on existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) VC techniques. Our dataset contains 10,217 animated movie clips covering a large variety of genres (e.g., Comedy, Fantasy) and emotions (e.g., happy, sad). We further design a set of evaluation metrics, named MCD-DTW-SL, which help evaluate the similarity between ground-truth speeches and the synthesised ones. Extensive experimental results show that even SoTA VC methods cannot generate satisfying speeches for our V2C task. We hope the proposed new task together with the constructed dataset and evaluation metric will facilitate the research in the field of voice cloning and the broader vision-and-language community.



### Attend to Who You Are: Supervising Self-Attention for Keypoint Detection and Instance-Aware Association

- **Summary**: This paper presents a new method to solve keypoint detection and instance association by using Transformer. For bottom-up multi-person pose estimation models, they need to detect keypoints and learn associative information between keypoints. We argue that these problems can be entirely solved by Transformer. Specifically, the self-attention in Transformer measures dependencies between any pair of locations, which can provide association information for keypoints grouping. However, the naive attention patterns are still not subjectively controlled, so there is no guarantee that the keypoints will always attend to the instances to which they belong. To address it we propose a novel approach of supervising self-attention for multi-person keypoint detection and instance association. By using instance masks to supervise self-attention to be instance-aware, we can assign the detected keypoints to their corresponding instances based on the pairwise attention scores, without using pre-defined offset vector fields or embedding like CNN-based bottom-up models. An additional benefit of our method is that the instance segmentation results of any number of people can be directly obtained from the supervised attention matrix, thereby simplifying the pixel assignment pipeline. The experiments on the COCO multi-person keypoint detection challenge and person instance segmentation task demonstrate the effectiveness and simplicity of the proposed method and show a promising way to control self-attention behavior for specific purposes.

- **Summary**: Consistency learning using input image, feature, or network perturbations has shown remarkable results in semi-supervised semantic segmentation, but this approach can be seriously affected by inaccurate predictions of unlabelled training images. There are two consequences of these inaccurate predictions: 1) the training based on the "strict" cross-entropy (CE) loss can easily overfit prediction mistakes, leading to confirmation bias; and 2) the perturbations applied to these inaccurate predictions will use potentially erroneous predictions as training signals, degrading consistency learning. In this paper, we address the prediction accuracy problem of consistency learning methods with novel extensions of the mean-teacher (MT) model, which include a new auxiliary teacher, and the replacement of MT's mean square error (MSE) by a stricter confidence-weighted cross-entropy (Conf-CE) loss. The accurate prediction by this model allows us to use a challenging combination of network, input data and feature perturbations to improve the consistency learning generalisation, where the feature perturbations consist of a new adversarial perturbation. Results on public benchmarks show that our approach achieves remarkable improvements over the previous SOTA methods in the field. Our code is available at https://github.com/yyliu01/PS-MT.

- **Summary**: We present CIRCLE, a framework for large-scale scene completion and geometric refinement based on local implicit signed distance functions. It is based on an end-to-end sparse convolutional network, CircNet, that jointly models local geometric details and global scene structural contexts, allowing it to preserve fine-grained object detail while recovering missing regions commonly arising in traditional 3D scene data. A novel differentiable rendering module enables test-time refinement for better reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that our concise framework is efficient and effective, achieving better reconstruction quality than the closest competitor while being 10-50x faster.



### Human and Scene Motion Deblurring using Pseudo-blur Synthesizer

- **Summary**: Present-day deep learning-based motion deblurring methods utilize the pair of synthetic blur and sharp data to regress any particular framework. This task is designed for directly translating a blurry image input into its restored version as output. The aforementioned approach relies heavily on the quality of the synthetic blurry data, which are only available before the training stage. Handling this issue by providing a large amount of data is expensive for common usage. We answer this challenge by providing an on-the-fly blurry data augmenter that can be run during training and test stages. To fully utilize it, we incorporate an unorthodox scheme of deblurring framework that employs the sequence of blur-deblur-reblur-deblur steps. The reblur step is assisted by a reblurring module (synthesizer) that provides the reblurred version (pseudo-blur) of its sharp or deblurred counterpart. The proposed module is also equipped with hand-crafted prior extracted using the state-of-the-art human body statistical model. This prior is employed to map human and non-human regions during adversarial learning to fully perceive the characteristics of human-articulated and scene motion blurs. By engaging this approach, our deblurring module becomes adaptive and achieves superior outcomes compared to recent state-of-the-art deblurring algorithms.

- **Summary**: In recent years, visual forgery has reached a level of sophistication that humans cannot identify fraud, which poses a significant threat to information security. A wide range of malicious applications have emerged, such as fake news, defamation or blackmailing of celebrities, impersonation of politicians in political warfare, and the spreading of rumours to attract views. As a result, a rich body of visual forensic techniques has been proposed in an attempt to stop this dangerous trend. In this paper, we present a benchmark that provides in-depth insights into visual forgery and visual forensics, using a comprehensive and empirical approach. More specifically, we develop an independent framework that integrates state-of-the-arts counterfeit generators and detectors, and measure the performance of these techniques using various criteria. We also perform an exhaustive analysis of the benchmarking results, to determine the characteristics of the methods that serve as a comparative reference in this never-ending war between measures and countermeasures.

- **Summary**: Effective semi-supervised learning (SSL) in medical image analysis (MIA) must address two challenges: 1) work effectively on both multi-class (e.g., lesion classification) and multi-label (e.g., multiple-disease diagnosis) problems, and 2) handle imbalanced learning (because of the high variance in disease prevalence). One strategy to explore in SSL MIA is based on the pseudo labelling strategy, but it has a few shortcomings. Pseudo-labelling has in general lower accuracy than consistency learning, it is not specifically designed for both multi-class and multi-label problems, and it can be challenged by imbalanced learning. In this paper, unlike traditional methods that select confident pseudo label by threshold, we propose a new SSL algorithm, called anti-curriculum pseudo-labelling (ACPL), which introduces novel techniques to select informative unlabelled samples, improving training balance and allowing the model to work for both multi-label and multi-class problems, and to estimate pseudo labels by an accurate ensemble of classifiers (improving pseudo label accuracy). We run extensive experiments to evaluate ACPL on two public medical image classification benchmarks: Chest X-Ray14 for thorax disease multi-label classification and ISIC2018 for skin lesion multi-class classification. Our method outperforms previous SOTA SSL methods on both datasets

- **Summary**: We present a new learning-based framework S-3D-RCNN that can recover accurate object orientation in SO(3) and simultaneously predict implicit shapes for outdoor rigid objects from stereo RGB images. In contrast to previous studies that map local appearance to observation angles, we explore a progressive approach by extracting meaningful Intermediate Geometrical Representations (IGRs) to estimate egocentric object orientation. This approach features a deep model that transforms perceived intensities to object part coordinates, which are mapped to a 3D representation encoding object orientation in the camera coordinate system. To enable implicit shape estimation, the IGRs are further extended to model visible object surface with a point-based representation and explicitly addresses the unseen surface hallucination problem. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed IGRs and S-3D-RCNN achieves superior 3D scene understanding performance using existing and proposed new metrics on the KITTI benchmark.

- **Summary**: Images acquired from rainy scenes usually suffer from bad visibility which may damage the performance of computer vision applications. The rainy scenarios can be categorized into two classes: moderate rain and heavy rain scenes. Moderate rain scene mainly consists of rain streaks while heavy rain scene contains both rain streaks and the veiling effect (similar to haze). Although existing methods have achieved excellent performance on these two cases individually, it still lacks a general architecture to address both heavy rain and moderate rain scenarios effectively. In this paper, we construct a hierarchical multi-direction representation network by using the contourlet transform (CT) to address both moderate rain and heavy rain scenarios. The CT divides the image into the multi-direction subbands (MS) and the semantic subband (SS). First, the rain streak information is retrieved to the MS based on the multi-orientation property of the CT. Second, a hierarchical architecture is proposed to reconstruct the background information including damaged semantic information and the veiling effect in the SS. Last, the multi-level subband discriminator with the feedback error map is proposed. By this module, all subbands can be well optimized. This is the first architecture that can address both of the two scenarios effectively. The code is available in https://github.com/cctakaet/ContourletNet-BMVC2021.

- **Summary**: Although recent learning-based calibration methods can predict extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters from a single image, the accuracy of these methods is degraded in fisheye images. This degradation is caused by mismatching between the actual projection and expected projection. To address this problem, we propose a generic camera model that has the potential to address various types of distortion. Our generic camera model is utilized for learning-based methods through a closed-form numerical calculation of the camera projection. Simultaneously to recover rotation and fisheye distortion, we propose a learning-based calibration method that uses the camera model. Furthermore, we propose a loss function that alleviates the bias of the magnitude of errors for four extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed method outperformed conventional methods on two largescale datasets and images captured by off-the-shelf fisheye cameras. Moreover, we are the first researchers to analyze the performance of learning-based methods using various types of projection for off-the-shelf cameras.

- **Summary**: Many mobile manufacturers recently have adopted Dual-Pixel (DP) sensors in their flagship models for faster auto-focus and aesthetic image captures. Despite their advantages, research on their usage for 3D facial understanding has been limited due to the lack of datasets and algorithmic designs that exploit parallax in DP images. This is because the baseline of sub-aperture images is extremely narrow and parallax exists in the defocus blur region. In this paper, we introduce a DP-oriented Depth/Normal network that reconstructs the 3D facial geometry. For this purpose, we collect a DP facial data with more than 135K images for 101 persons captured with our multi-camera structured light systems. It contains the corresponding ground-truth 3D models including depth map and surface normal in metric scale. Our dataset allows the proposed matching network to be generalized for 3D facial depth/normal estimation. The proposed network consists of two novel modules: Adaptive Sampling Module and Adaptive Normal Module, which are specialized in handling the defocus blur in DP images. Finally, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances over recent DP-based depth/normal estimation methods. We also demonstrate the applicability of the estimated depth/normal to face spoofing and relighting.

- **Summary**: In the field of pattern classification, the training of deep learning classifiers is mostly end-to-end learning, and the loss function is the constraint on the final output (posterior probability) of the network, so the existence of Softmax is essential. In the case of end-to-end learning, there is usually no effective loss function that completely relies on the features of the middle layer to restrict learning, resulting in the distribution of sample latent features is not optimal, so there is still room for improvement in classification accuracy. Based on the concept of Predefined Evenly-Distributed Class Centroids (PEDCC), this article proposes a Softmax-free loss function based on predefined optimal-distribution of latent features-POD Loss. The loss function only restricts the latent features of the samples, including the norm-adaptive Cosine distance between the latent feature vector of the sample and the center of the predefined evenly-distributed class, and the correlation between the latent features of the samples. Finally, Cosine distance is used for classification. Compared with the commonly used Softmax Loss, some typical Softmax related loss functions and PEDCC-Loss, experiments on several commonly used datasets on several typical deep learning classification networks show that the classification performance of POD Loss is always significant better and easier to converge.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce ML-Decoder, a new attention-based classification head. ML-Decoder predicts the existence of class labels via queries, and enables better utilization of spatial data compared to global average pooling. By redesigning the decoder architecture, and using a novel group-decoding scheme, ML-Decoder is highly efficient, and can scale well to thousands of classes. Compared to using a larger backbone, ML-Decoder consistently provides a better speed-accuracy trade-off. ML-Decoder is also versatile - it can be used as a drop-in replacement for various classification heads, and generalize to unseen classes when operated with word queries. Novel query augmentations further improve its generalization ability. Using ML-Decoder, we achieve state-of-the-art results on several classification tasks: on MS-COCO multi-label, we reach 91.4% mAP; on NUS-WIDE zero-shot, we reach 31.1% ZSL mAP; and on ImageNet single-label, we reach with vanilla ResNet50 backbone a new top score of 80.7%, without extra data or distillation.

- **Summary**: Self-training has greatly facilitated domain adaptive semantic segmentation, which iteratively generates pseudo labels on unlabeled target data and retrains the network. However, realistic segmentation datasets are highly imbalanced, pseudo labels are typically biased to the majority classes and basically noisy, leading to an error-prone and suboptimal model. In this paper, we propose a simple region-based active learning approach for semantic segmentation under a domain shift, aiming to automatically query a small partition of image regions to be labeled while maximizing segmentation performance. Our algorithm, Region Impurity and Prediction Uncertainty (RIPU), introduces a new acquisition strategy characterizing the spatial adjacency of image regions along with the prediction confidence. We show that the proposed region-based selection strategy makes more efficient use of a limited budget than image-based or point-based counterparts. Further, we enforce local prediction consistency between a pixel and its nearest neighbors on a source image. Alongside, we develop a negative learning loss to make the features more discriminative. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method only requires very few annotations to almost reach the supervised performance and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Most existing UDA approaches enable knowledge transfer via learning domain-invariant representation and sharing one classifier across two domains. However, ignoring the domain-specific information that are related to the task, and forcing a unified classifier to fit both domains will limit the feature expressiveness in each domain. In this paper, by observing that the Transformer architecture with comparable parameters can generate more transferable representations than CNN counterparts, we propose a Win-Win TRansformer framework (WinTR) that separately explores the domain-specific knowledge for each domain and meanwhile interchanges cross-domain knowledge. Specifically, we learn two different mappings using two individual classification tokens in the Transformer, and design for each one a domain-specific classifier. The cross-domain knowledge is transferred via source guided label refinement and single-sided feature alignment with respect to source or target, which keeps the integrity of domain-specific information. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art UDA methods, validating the effectiveness of exploiting both domain-specific and invariant

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art frameworks in self-supervised learning have recently shown that fully utilizing transformer-based models can lead to performance boost compared to conventional CNN models. Striving to maximize the mutual information of two views of an image, existing works apply a contrastive loss to the final representations. Motivated by self-distillation in the supervised regime, we further exploit this by allowing the intermediate representations to learn from the final layer via the contrastive loss. Through self-distillation, the intermediate layers are better suited for instance discrimination, making the performance of an early-exited sub-network not much degraded from that of the full network. This renders the pretext task easier also for the final layer, leading to better representations. Our method, Self-Distilled Self-Supervised Learning (SDSSL), outperforms competitive baselines (SimCLR, BYOL and MoCo v3) using ViT on various tasks and datasets. In the linear evaluation and k-NN protocol, SDSSL not only leads to superior performance in the final layers, but also in most of the lower layers. Furthermore, qualitative and quantitative analyses show how representations are formed more effectively along the transformer layers. Code is available at https://github.com/hagiss/SDSSL.

- **Summary**: Satellite video cameras can provide continuous observation for a large-scale area, which is important for many remote sensing applications. However, achieving moving object detection and tracking in satellite videos remains challenging due to the insufficient appearance information of objects and lack of high-quality datasets. In this paper, we first build a large-scale satellite video dataset with rich annotations for the task of moving object detection and tracking. This dataset is collected by the Jilin-1 satellite constellation and composed of 47 high-quality videos with 1,646,038 instances of interest for object detection and 3,711 trajectories for object tracking. We then introduce a motion modeling baseline to improve the detection rate and reduce false alarms based on accumulative multi-frame differencing and robust matrix completion. Finally, we establish the first public benchmark for moving object detection and tracking in satellite videos, and extensively evaluate the performance of several representative approaches on our dataset. Comprehensive experimental analyses and insightful conclusions are also provided. The dataset is available at https://github.com/QingyongHu/VISO.

- **Summary**: One major goal of the AI security community is to securely and reliably produce and deploy deep learning models for real-world applications. To this end, data poisoning based backdoor attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs) in the production stage (or training stage) and corresponding defenses are extensively explored in recent years. Ironically, backdoor attacks in the deployment stage, which can often happen in unprofessional users' devices and are thus arguably far more threatening in real-world scenarios, draw much less attention of the community. We attribute this imbalance of vigilance to the weak practicality of existing deployment-stage backdoor attack algorithms and the insufficiency of real-world attack demonstrations. To fill the blank, in this work, we study the realistic threat of deployment-stage backdoor attacks on DNNs. We base our study on a commonly used deployment-stage attack paradigm -- adversarial weight attack, where adversaries selectively modify model weights to embed backdoor into deployed DNNs. To approach realistic practicality, we propose the first gray-box and physically realizable weights attack algorithm for backdoor injection, namely subnet replacement attack (SRA), which only requires architecture information of the victim model and can support physical triggers in the real world. Extensive experimental simulations and system-level real-world attack demonstrations are conducted. Our results not only suggest the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed attack algorithm, but also reveal the practical risk of a novel type of computer virus that may widely spread and stealthily inject backdoor into DNN models in user devices. By our study, we call for more attention to the vulnerability of DNNs in the deployment stage.

- **Summary**: Bokeh effect is a natural shallow depth-of-field phenomenon that blurs the out-of-focus part in photography. In recent years, a series of works have proposed automatic and realistic bokeh rendering methods for artistic and aesthetic purposes. They usually employ cutting-edge data-driven deep generative networks with complex training strategies and network architectures. However, these works neglect that the bokeh effect, as a real phenomenon, can inevitably affect the subsequent visual intelligent tasks like recognition, and their data-driven nature prevents them from studying the influence of bokeh-related physical parameters (i.e., depth-of-the-field) on the intelligent tasks. To fill this gap, we study a totally new problem, i.e., natural & adversarial bokeh rendering, which consists of two objectives: rendering realistic and natural bokeh and fooling the visual perception models (i.e., bokeh-based adversarial attack). To this end, beyond the pure data-driven solution, we propose a hybrid alternative by taking the respective advantages of data-driven and physical-aware methods. Specifically, we propose the circle-of-confusion predictive network (CoCNet) by taking the all-in-focus image and depth image as inputs to estimate circle-of-confusion parameters for each pixel, which are employed to render the final image through a well-known physical model of bokeh. With the hybrid solution, our method could achieve more realistic rendering results with the naive training strategy and a much lighter network. Moreover, we propose the adversarial bokeh attack by fixing the CoCNet while optimizing the depth map w.r.t the visual perception tasks. Then, we are able to study the vulnerability of deep neural networks according to the depth variations in the real world.

- **Summary**: Metal artefacts in CT images may disrupt image quality and interfere with diagnosis. Recently many deep-learning-based CT metal artefact reduction (MAR) methods have been proposed. Current deep MAR methods may be troubled with domain gap problem, where methods trained on simulated data cannot perform well on practical data. In this work, we experimentally investigate two image-domain supervised methods, two dual-domain supervised methods and two image-domain unsupervised methods on a dental dataset and a torso dataset, to explore whether domain gap problem exists or is overcome. We find that I-DL-MAR and DudoNet are effective for practical data of the torso dataset, indicating the domain gap problem is solved. However, none of the investigated methods perform satisfactorily on practical data of the dental dataset. Based on the experimental results, we further analyze the causes of domain gap problem for each method and dataset, which may be beneficial for improving existing methods or designing new ones. The findings suggest that the domain gap problem in deep MAR methods remains to be addressed.

- **Summary**: Is intelligence realized by connectionist or classicist? While connectionist approaches have achieved superhuman performance, there has been growing evidence that such task-specific superiority is particularly fragile in systematic generalization. This observation lies in the central debate between connectionist and classicist, wherein the latter continually advocates an algebraic treatment in cognitive architectures. In this work, we follow the classicist's call and propose a hybrid approach to improve systematic generalization in reasoning. Specifically, we showcase a prototype with algebraic representation for the abstract spatial-temporal reasoning task of Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) and present the ALgebra-Aware Neuro-Semi-Symbolic (ALANS) learner. The ALANS learner is motivated by abstract algebra and the representation theory. It consists of a neural visual perception frontend and an algebraic abstract reasoning backend: the frontend summarizes the visual information from object-based representation, while the backend transforms it into an algebraic structure and induces the hidden operator on the fly. The induced operator is later executed to predict the answer's representation, and the choice most similar to the prediction is selected as the solution. Extensive experiments show that by incorporating an algebraic treatment, the ALANS learner outperforms various pure connectionist models in domains requiring systematic generalization. We further show the generative nature of the learned algebraic representation; it can be decoded by isomorphism to generate an answer.

- **Summary**: Automatic brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data plays an important role in assessing tumor response to therapy and personalized treatment stratification.Manual segmentation is tedious and subjective.Deep-learning-based algorithms for brain tumor segmentation have the potential to provide objective and fast tumor segmentation.However, the training of such algorithms requires large datasets which are not always available. Data augmentation techniques may reduce the need for large datasets.However current approaches are mostly parametric and may result in suboptimal performance.We introduce two non-parametric methods of data augmentation for brain tumor segmentation: the mixed structure regularization (MSR) and shuffle pixels noise (SPN).We evaluated the added value of the MSR and SPN augmentation on the brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) 2018 challenge dataset with the encoder-decoder nnU-Net architecture as the segmentation algorithm.Both MSR and SPN improve the nnU-Net segmentation accuracy compared to parametric Gaussian noise augmentation.Mean dice score increased from 80% to 82% and p-values=0.0022, 0.0028 when comparing MSR to non-parametric augmentation for the tumor core and whole tumor experiments respectively.The proposed MSR and SPN augmentations have the potential to improve neural-networks performance in other tasks as well.

- **Summary**: Can we train a single transformer model capable of processing multiple modalities and datasets, whilst sharing almost all of its learnable parameters? We present PolyViT, a model trained on image, audio and video which answers this question. By co-training different tasks on a single modality, we are able to improve the accuracy of each individual task and achieve state-of-the-art results on 5 standard video- and audio-classification datasets. Co-training PolyViT on multiple modalities and tasks leads to a model that is even more parameter-efficient, and learns representations that generalize across multiple domains. Moreover, we show that co-training is simple and practical to implement, as we do not need to tune hyperparameters for each combination of datasets, but can simply adapt those from standard, single-task training.

- **Summary**: Recently, Vision Transformers (ViT), with the self-attention (SA) as the de facto ingredients, have demonstrated great potential in the computer vision community. For the sake of trade-off between efficiency and performance, a group of works merely perform SA operation within local patches, whereas the global contextual information is abandoned, which would be indispensable for visual recognition tasks. To solve the issue, the subsequent global-local ViTs take a stab at marrying local SA with global one in parallel or alternative way in the model. Nevertheless, the exhaustively combined local and global context may exist redundancy for various visual data, and the receptive field within each layer is fixed. Alternatively, a more graceful way is that global and local context can adaptively contribute per se to accommodate different visual data. To achieve this goal, we in this paper propose a novel ViT architecture, termed NomMer, which can dynamically Nominate the synergistic global-local context in vision transforMer. By investigating the working pattern of our proposed NomMer, we further explore what context information is focused. Beneficial from this "dynamic nomination" mechanism, without bells and whistles, the NomMer can not only achieve 84.5% Top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet with only 73M parameters, but also show promising performance on dense prediction tasks, i.e., object detection and semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: Image manipulation with StyleGAN has been an increasing concern in recent years.Recent works have achieved tremendous success in analyzing several semantic latent spaces to edit the attributes of the generated images.However, due to the limited semantic and spatial manipulation precision in these latent spaces, the existing endeavors are defeated in fine-grained StyleGAN image manipulation, i.e., local attribute translation.To address this issue, we discover attribute-specific control units, which consist of multiple channels of feature maps and modulation styles. Specifically, we collaboratively manipulate the modulation style channels and feature maps in control units rather than individual ones to obtain the semantic and spatial disentangled controls. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to detect the attribute-specific control units. We move the modulation style along a specific sparse direction vector and replace the filter-wise styles used to compute the feature maps to manipulate these control units. We evaluate our proposed method in various face attribute manipulation tasks. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods. The manipulation results of real images further show the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: We address the problem of ensemble selection in transfer learning: Given a large pool of source models we want to select an ensemble of models which, after fine-tuning on the target training set, yields the best performance on the target test set. Since fine-tuning all possible ensembles is computationally prohibitive, we aim at predicting performance on the target dataset using a computationally efficient transferability metric. We propose several new transferability metrics designed for this task and evaluate them in a challenging and realistic transfer learning setup for semantic segmentation: we create a large and diverse pool of source models by considering 17 source datasets covering a wide variety of image domain, two different architectures, and two pre-training schemes. Given this pool, we then automatically select a subset to form an ensemble performing well on a given target dataset. We compare the ensemble selected by our method to two baselines which select a single source model, either (1) from the same pool as our method; or (2) from a pool containing large source models, each with similar capacity as an ensemble. Averaged over 17 target datasets, we outperform these baselines by 6.0% and 2.5% relative mean IoU, respectively.

- **Summary**: We develop a rotation equivariant model for generating 3D hand meshes from 2D RGB images. This guarantees that as the input image of a hand is rotated the generated mesh undergoes a corresponding rotation. Furthermore, this removes undesirable deformations in the meshes often generated by methods without rotation equivariance. By building a rotation equivariant model, through considering symmetries in the problem, we reduce the need for training on very large datasets to achieve good mesh reconstruction.   The encoder takes images defined on $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ and maps these to latent functions defined on the group $C_{8}$. We introduce a novel vector mapping function to map the function defined on $C_{8}$ to a latent point cloud space defined on the group $\mathrm{SO}(2)$. Further, we introduce a 3D projection function that learns a 3D function from the $\mathrm{SO}(2)$ latent space. Finally, we use an $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ equivariant decoder to ensure rotation equivariance. Our rotation equivariant model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a real-world dataset and we demonstrate that it accurately captures the shape and pose in the generated meshes under rotation of the input hand.

- **Summary**: Recent years have seen impressive progress in visual recognition on many benchmarks, however, generalization to the real-world in out-of-distribution setting remains a significant challenge. A state-of-the-art method for robust visual recognition is model ensembling. however, recently it was shown that similarly competitive results could be achieved with a much smaller cost, by using multi-input multi-output architecture (MIMO). In this work, a generalization of the MIMO approach is applied to the task of object detection using the general-purpose Faster R-CNN model. It was shown that using the MIMO framework allows building strong feature representation and obtains very competitive accuracy when using just two input/output pairs. Furthermore, it adds just 0.5\% additional model parameters and increases the inference time by 15.9\% when compared to the standard Faster R-CNN. It also works comparably to, or outperforms the Deep Ensemble approach in terms of model accuracy, robustness to out-of-distribution setting, and uncertainty calibration when the same number of predictions is used. This work opens up avenues for applying the MIMO approach in other high-level tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation.

- **Summary**: Machine learning in medical imaging during clinical routine is impaired by changes in scanner protocols, hardware, or policies resulting in a heterogeneous set of acquisition settings. When training a deep learning model on an initial static training set, model performance and reliability suffer from changes of acquisition characteristics as data and targets may become inconsistent. Continual learning can help to adapt models to the changing environment by training on a continuous data stream. However, continual manual expert labelling of medical imaging requires substantial effort. Thus, ways to use labelling resources efficiently on a well chosen sub-set of new examples is necessary to render this strategy feasible.   Here, we propose a method for continual active learning operating on a stream of medical images in a multi-scanner setting. The approach automatically recognizes shifts in image acquisition characteristics - new domains -, selects optimal examples for labelling and adapts training accordingly. Labelling is subject to a limited budget, resembling typical real world scenarios. To demonstrate generalizability, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method on three tasks: cardiac segmentation, lung nodule detection and brain age estimation. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms other active learning methods, while effectively counteracting catastrophic forgetting.

- **Summary**: Prior plays an important role in providing the plausible constraint on human motion. Previous works design motion priors following a variety of paradigms under different circumstances, leading to the lack of versatility. In this paper, we first summarize the indispensable properties of the motion prior, and accordingly, design a framework to learn the versatile motion prior, which models the inherent probability distribution of human motions. Specifically, for efficient prior representation learning, we propose a global orientation normalization to remove redundant environment information in the original motion data space. Also, a two-level, sequence-based and segment-based, frequency guidance is introduced into the encoding stage. Then, we adopt a denoising training scheme to disentangle the environment information from input motion data in a learnable way, so as to generate consistent and distinguishable representation. Embedding our motion prior into prevailing backbones on three different tasks, we conduct extensive experiments, and both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our motion prior. Our model and code are available at https://github.com/JchenXu/human-motion-prior.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Collecting amounts of distorted/clean image pairs in the real world is non-trivial, which seriously limits the practical applications of these supervised learning-based methods on real-world image super-resolution (RealSR). Previous works usually address this problem by leveraging unsupervised learning-based technologies to alleviate the dependency on paired training samples. However, these methods typically suffer from unsatisfactory texture synthesis due to the lack of supervision of clean images. To overcome this problem, we are the first to have a close look at the under-explored direction for RealSR, i.e., few-shot real-world image super-resolution, which aims to tackle the challenging RealSR problem with few-shot distorted/clean image pairs. Under this brand-new scenario, we propose Distortion Relation guided Transfer Learning (DRTL) for the few-shot RealSR by transferring the rich restoration knowledge from auxiliary distortions (i.e., synthetic distortions) to the target RealSR under the guidance of distortion relation. Concretely, DRTL builds a knowledge graph to capture the distortion relation between auxiliary distortions and target distortion (i.e., real distortions in RealSR). Based on the distortion relation, DRTL adopts a gradient reweighting strategy to guide the knowledge transfer process between auxiliary distortions and target distortions. In this way, DRTL could quickly learn the most relevant knowledge from the synthetic distortions for the target distortion. We instantiate DRTL with two commonly-used transfer learning paradigms, including pre-training and meta-learning pipelines, to realize a distortion relation-aware Few-shot RealSR. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and thorough ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our DRTL.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a simple attention mechanism, we call box-attention. It enables spatial interaction between grid features, as sampled from boxes of interest, and improves the learning capability of transformers for several vision tasks. Specifically, we present BoxeR, short for Box Transformer, which attends to a set of boxes by predicting their transformation from a reference window on an input feature map. The BoxeR computes attention weights on these boxes by considering its grid structure. Notably, BoxeR-2D naturally reasons about box information within its attention module, making it suitable for end-to-end instance detection and segmentation tasks. By learning invariance to rotation in the box-attention module, BoxeR-3D is capable of generating discriminative information from a bird's-eye view plane for 3D end-to-end object detection. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed BoxeR-2D achieves state-of-the-art results on COCO detection and instance segmentation. Besides, BoxeR-3D improves over the end-to-end 3D object detection baseline and already obtains a compelling performance for the vehicle category of Waymo Open, without any class-specific optimization.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel method for representation and classification of two-person interactions from 3D skeleton sequences. The key idea of our approach is to use Gaussian distributions to capture statistics on R n and those on the space of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. The main challenge is how to parametrize those distributions. Towards this end, we develop methods for embedding Gaussian distributions in matrix groups based on the theory of Lie groups and Riemannian symmetric spaces. Our method relies on the Riemannian geometry of the underlying manifolds and has the advantage of encoding high-order statistics from 3D joint positions. We show that the proposed method achieves competitive results in two-person interaction recognition on three benchmarks for 3D human activity understanding.

- **Summary**: We propose a learning-based method for light-path construction in path tracing algorithms, which iteratively optimizes and samples from what we refer to as spatio-directional Gaussian mixture models (SDMMs). In particular, we approximate incident radiance as an online-trained $5$D mixture that is accelerated by a $k$D-tree. Using the same framework, we approximate BSDFs as pre-trained $n$D mixtures, where $n$ is the number of BSDF parameters. Such an approach addresses two major challenges in path-guiding models. First, the $5$D radiance representation naturally captures correlation between the spatial and directional dimensions. Such correlations are present in e.g. parallax and caustics. Second, by using a tangent-space parameterization of Gaussians, our spatio-directional mixtures can perform approximate product sampling with arbitrarily oriented BSDFs. Existing models are only able to do this by either foregoing anisotropy of the mixture components or by representing the radiance field in local (normal aligned) coordinates, which both make the radiance field more difficult to learn. An additional benefit of the tangent-space parameterization is that each individual Gaussian is mapped to the solid sphere with low distortion near its center of mass. Our method performs especially well on scenes with small, localized luminaires that induce high spatio-directional correlation in the incident radiance.

- **Summary**: Data-driven paradigms using machine learning are becoming ubiquitous in image processing and communications. In particular, image-to-image (I2I) translation is a generic and widely used approach to image processing problems, such as image synthesis, style transfer, and image restoration. At the same time, neural image compression has emerged as a data-driven alternative to traditional coding approaches in visual communications. In this paper, we study the combination of these two paradigms into a joint I2I compression and translation framework, focusing on multi-domain image synthesis. We first propose distributed I2I translation by integrating quantization and entropy coding into an I2I translation framework (i.e. I2Icodec). In practice, the image compression functionality (i.e. autoencoding) is also desirable, requiring to deploy alongside I2Icodec a regular image codec. Thus, we further propose a unified framework that allows both translation and autoencoding capabilities in a single codec. Adaptive residual blocks conditioned on the translation/compression mode provide flexible adaptation to the desired functionality. The experiments show promising results in both I2I translation and image compression using a single model.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel approach for object segmentation from 3D images using modified minimal path Eikonal equation. The proposed method utilizes an implicit constraint - a second order correction to the inhomogeneous minimal path Eikonal - preventing the adjacent minimal path trajectories to diverge uncontrollably. The proposed modification greatly reduces the surface area uncovered by minimal paths allowing the use of the calculated minimal path set as parameter lines of an approximate surface. It also has a loose connection with the true minimal surface Eikonal equations that are also deduced.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a popular method in data-driven 3D reconstruction. Given its simplicity and high quality rendering, many NeRF applications are being developed. However, NeRF's big limitation is its slow speed. Many attempts are made to speeding up NeRF training and inference, including intricate code-level optimization and caching, use of sophisticated data structures, and amortization through multi-task and meta learning. In this work, we revisit the basic building blocks of NeRF through the lens of classic techniques before NeRF. We propose Voxel-Accelearated NeRF (VaxNeRF), integrating NeRF with visual hull, a classic 3D reconstruction technique only requiring binary foreground-background pixel labels per image. Visual hull, which can be optimized in about 10 seconds, can provide coarse in-out field separation to omit substantial amounts of network evaluations in NeRF. We provide a clean fully-pythonic, JAX-based implementation on the popular JaxNeRF codebase, consisting of only about 30 lines of code changes and a modular visual hull subroutine, and achieve about 2-8x faster learning on top of the highly-performative JaxNeRF baseline with zero degradation in rendering quality. With sufficient compute, this effectively brings down full NeRF training from hours to 30 minutes. We hope VaxNeRF -- a careful combination of a classic technique with a deep method (that arguably replaced it) -- can empower and accelerate new NeRF extensions and applications, with its simplicity, portability, and reliable performance gains.

- **Summary**: Even though it has extensively been shown that retrieval specific training of deep neural networks is beneficial for nearest neighbor image search quality, most of these models are trained and tested in the domain of landmarks images. However, some applications use images from various other domains and therefore need a network with good generalization properties - a general-purpose CBIR model. To the best of our knowledge, no testing protocol has so far been introduced to benchmark models with respect to general image retrieval quality. After analyzing popular image retrieval test sets we decided to manually curate GPR1200, an easy to use and accessible but challenging benchmark dataset with a broad range of image categories. This benchmark is subsequently used to evaluate various pretrained models of different architectures on their generalization qualities. We show that large-scale pretraining significantly improves retrieval performance and present experiments on how to further increase these properties by appropriate fine-tuning. With these promising results, we hope to increase interest in the research topic of general-purpose CBIR.

- **Summary**: A core challenge for an autonomous agent acting in the real world is to adapt its repertoire of skills to cope with its noisy perception and dynamics. To scale learning of skills to long-horizon tasks, robots should be able to learn and later refine their skills in a structured manner through trajectories rather than making instantaneous decisions individually at each time step. To this end, we propose the Soft Actor-Critic Gaussian Mixture Model (SAC-GMM), a novel hybrid approach that learns robot skills through a dynamical system and adapts the learned skills in their own trajectory distribution space through interactions with the environment. Our approach combines classical robotics techniques of learning from demonstration with the deep reinforcement learning framework and exploits their complementary nature. We show that our method utilizes sensors solely available during the execution of preliminarily learned skills to extract relevant features that lead to faster skill refinement. Extensive evaluations in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in refining robot skills by leveraging physical interactions, high-dimensional sensory data, and sparse task completion rewards.

- **Summary**: Scene Graph Generation has gained much attention in computer vision research with the growing demand in image understanding projects like visual question answering, image captioning, self-driving cars, crowd behavior analysis, activity recognition, and more. Scene graph, a visually grounded graphical structure of an image, immensely helps to simplify the image understanding tasks. In this work, we introduced a post-processing algorithm called Geometric Context to understand the visual scenes better geometrically. We use this post-processing algorithm to add and refine the geometric relationships between object pairs to a prior model. We exploit this context by calculating the direction and distance between object pairs. We use Knowledge Embedded Routing Network (KERN) as our baseline model, extend the work with our algorithm, and show comparable results on the recent state-of-the-art algorithms.

- **Summary**: A classical problem in computer vision is to infer a 3D scene representation from few images that can be used to render novel views at interactive rates. Previous work focuses on reconstructing pre-defined 3D representations, e.g. textured meshes, or implicit representations, e.g. radiance fields, and often requires input images with precise camera poses and long processing times for each novel scene.   In this work, we propose the Scene Representation Transformer (SRT), a method which processes posed or unposed RGB images of a new area, infers a "set-latent scene representation", and synthesises novel views, all in a single feed-forward pass. To calculate the scene representation, we propose a generalization of the Vision Transformer to sets of images, enabling global information integration, and hence 3D reasoning. An efficient decoder transformer parameterizes the light field by attending into the scene representation to render novel views. Learning is supervised end-to-end by minimizing a novel-view reconstruction error.   We show that this method outperforms recent baselines in terms of PSNR and speed on synthetic datasets, including a new dataset created for the paper. Further, we demonstrate that SRT scales to support interactive visualization and semantic segmentation of real-world outdoor environments using Street View imagery.

- **Summary**: Monitoring and managing Earth's forests in an informed manner is an important requirement for addressing challenges like biodiversity loss and climate change. While traditional in situ or aerial campaigns for forest assessments provide accurate data for analysis at regional level, scaling them to entire countries and beyond with high temporal resolution is hardly possible. In this work, we propose a method based on deep ensembles that densely estimates forest structure variables at country-scale with 10-meter resolution, using freely available satellite imagery as input. Our method jointly transforms Sentinel-2 optical images and Sentinel-1 synthetic-aperture radar images into maps of five different forest structure variables: 95th height percentile, mean height, density, Gini coefficient, and fractional cover. We train and test our model on reference data from 41 airborne laser scanning missions across Norway and demonstrate that it is able to generalize to unseen test regions, achieving normalized mean absolute errors between 11% and 15%, depending on the variable. Our work is also the first to propose a variant of so-called Bayesian deep learning to densely predict multiple forest structure variables with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates from satellite imagery. The uncertainty information increases the trustworthiness of the model and its suitability for downstream tasks that require reliable confidence estimates as a basis for decision making. We present an extensive set of experiments to validate the accuracy of the predicted maps as well as the quality of the predicted uncertainties. To demonstrate scalability, we provide Norway-wide maps for the five forest structure variables.

- **Summary**: With the popularity of Transformer architectures in computer vision, the research focus has shifted towards developing computationally efficient designs. Window-based local attention is one of the major techniques being adopted in recent works. These methods begin with very small patch size and small embedding dimensions and then perform strided convolution (patch merging) in order to reduce the feature map size and increase embedding dimensions, hence, forming a pyramidal Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) like design. In this work, we investigate local and global information modelling in transformers by presenting a novel isotropic architecture that adopts local windows and special tokens, called Super tokens, for self-attention. Specifically, a single Super token is assigned to each image window which captures the rich local details for that window. These tokens are then employed for cross-window communication and global representation learning. Hence, most of the learning is independent of the image patches $(N)$ in the higher layers, and the class embedding is learned solely based on the Super tokens $(N/M^2)$ where $M^2$ is the window size. In standard image classification on Imagenet-1K, the proposed Super tokens based transformer (STT-S25) achieves 83.5\% accuracy which is equivalent to Swin transformer (Swin-B) with circa half the number of parameters (49M) and double the inference time throughput. The proposed Super token transformer offers a lightweight and promising backbone for visual recognition tasks.

- **Summary**: Standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designs rarely focus on the importance of explicitly capturing diverse features to enhance the network's performance. Instead, most existing methods follow an indirect approach of increasing or tuning the networks' depth and width, which in many cases significantly increases the computational cost. Inspired by a biological visual system, we propose a Diverse and Adaptive Attention Convolutional Network (DA$^{2}$-Net), which enables any feed-forward CNNs to explicitly capture diverse features and adaptively select and emphasize the most informative features to efficiently boost the network's performance. DA$^{2}$-Net incurs negligible computational overhead and it is designed to be easily integrated with any CNN architecture. We extensively evaluated DA$^{2}$-Net on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR100, SVHN, and ImageNet, with various CNN architectures. The experimental results show DA$^{2}$-Net provides a significant performance improvement with very minimal computational overhead.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a self-supervised visual representation learning approach which involves both generative and discriminative proxies, where we focus on the former part by requiring the target network to recover the original image based on the mid-level features. Different from prior work that mostly focuses on pixel-level similarity between the original and generated images, we advocate for Semantic-aware Generation (SaGe) to facilitate richer semantics rather than details to be preserved in the generated image. The core idea of implementing SaGe is to use an evaluator, a deep network that is pre-trained without labels, for extracting semantic-aware features. SaGe complements the target network with view-specific features and thus alleviates the semantic degradation brought by intensive data augmentations. We execute SaGe on ImageNet-1K and evaluate the pre-trained models on five downstream tasks including nearest neighbor test, linear classification, and fine-scaled image recognition, demonstrating its ability to learn stronger visual representations.

- **Summary**: Disobeying the classical wisdom of statistical learning theory, modern deep neural networks generalize well even though they typically contain millions of parameters. Recently, it has been shown that the trajectories of iterative optimization algorithms can possess fractal structures, and their generalization error can be formally linked to the complexity of such fractals. This complexity is measured by the fractal's intrinsic dimension, a quantity usually much smaller than the number of parameters in the network. Even though this perspective provides an explanation for why overparametrized networks would not overfit, computing the intrinsic dimension (e.g., for monitoring generalization during training) is a notoriously difficult task, where existing methods typically fail even in moderate ambient dimensions. In this study, we consider this problem from the lens of topological data analysis (TDA) and develop a generic computational tool that is built on rigorous mathematical foundations. By making a novel connection between learning theory and TDA, we first illustrate that the generalization error can be equivalently bounded in terms of a notion called the 'persistent homology dimension' (PHD), where, compared with prior work, our approach does not require any additional geometrical or statistical assumptions on the training dynamics. Then, by utilizing recently established theoretical results and TDA tools, we develop an efficient algorithm to estimate PHD in the scale of modern deep neural networks and further provide visualization tools to help understand generalization in deep learning. Our experiments show that the proposed approach can efficiently compute a network's intrinsic dimension in a variety of settings, which is predictive of the generalization error.

- **Summary**: Face recognition technology has been widely adopted in many mission-critical scenarios like means of human identification, controlled admission, and mobile device access, etc. Security surveillance is a typical scenario of face recognition technology. Because the low-resolution feature of surveillance video and images makes it difficult for high-resolution face recognition algorithms to extract effective feature information, Algorithms applied to high-resolution face recognition are difficult to migrate directly to low-resolution situations. As face recognition in security surveillance becomes more important in the era of dense urbanization, it is essential to develop algorithms that are able to provide satisfactory performance in processing the video frames generated by low-resolution surveillance cameras. This paper study on the Correlation Features-based Face Recognition (CoFFaR) method which using for homogeneous low-resolution surveillance videos, the theory, experimental details, and experimental results are elaborated in detail. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the correlation features method that improves the accuracy of homogeneous face recognition in surveillance security scenarios.

- **Summary**: Insider threats are costly, hard to detect, and unfortunately rising in occurrence. Seeking to improve detection of such threats, we develop novel techniques to enable us to extract powerful features and augment attack vectors for greater classification power. Most importantly, we generate high quality color image encodings of user behavior that do not have the downsides of traditional greyscale image encodings. Combined, they form Computer Vision User and Entity Behavior Analytics, a detection system designed from the ground up to improve upon advancements in academia and mitigate the issues that prevent the usage of advanced models in industry. The proposed system beats state-of-art methods used in academia and as well as in industry on a gold standard benchmarking dataset.

- **Summary**: This paper presents and discusses an implementation of a multiple target tracking method, which is able to deal with target interactions and prevent tracker failures due to hijacking. The referenced approach uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling step to evaluate the filter and constructs an efficient proposal density to generate new samples. This density integrates target interaction terms based on Markov Random Fields (MRFs) generated per time step. The MRFs model the interactions between targets in an attempt to reduce tracking ambiguity that typical particle filters suffer from when tracking multiple targets. A test sequence of 662 grayscale frames containing 20 interacting ants in a confined space was used to test both the proposed approach and a set of importance sampling based independent particle filters, to establish a performance comparison. It is shown that the implemented approach of modeling target interactions using MRF successfully corrects many of the tracking errors made by the independent, interaction unaware, particle filters.

- **Summary**: The canonical approach to video captioning dictates a caption generation model to learn from offline-extracted dense video features. These feature extractors usually operate on video frames sampled at a fixed frame rate and are often trained on image/video understanding tasks, without adaption to video captioning data. In this work, we present SwinBERT, an end-to-end transformer-based model for video captioning, which takes video frame patches directly as inputs, and outputs a natural language description. Instead of leveraging multiple 2D/3D feature extractors, our method adopts a video transformer to encode spatial-temporal representations that can adapt to variable lengths of video input without dedicated design for different frame rates. Based on this model architecture, we show that video captioning can benefit significantly from more densely sampled video frames as opposed to previous successes with sparsely sampled video frames for video-and-language understanding tasks (e.g., video question answering). Moreover, to avoid the inherent redundancy in consecutive video frames, we propose adaptively learning a sparse attention mask and optimizing it for task-specific performance improvement through better long-range video sequence modeling. Through extensive experiments on 5 video captioning datasets, we show that SwinBERT achieves across-the-board performance improvements over previous methods, often by a large margin. The learned sparse attention masks in addition push the limit to new state of the arts, and can be transferred between different video lengths and between different datasets.

- **Summary**: Cancelable biometrics refers to a group of techniques in which the biometric inputs are transformed intentionally using a key before processing or storage. This transformation is repeatable enabling subsequent biometric comparisons. This paper introduces a new scheme for cancelable biometrics aimed at protecting the templates against potential attacks, applicable to any biometric-based recognition system. Our proposed scheme is based on time-varying keys obtained from morphing random biometric information. An experimental implementation of the proposed scheme is given for face biometrics. The results confirm that the proposed approach is able to withstand against leakage attacks while improving the recognition performance.

- **Summary**: We address the task of domain adaptation in object detection, where there is a domain gap between a domain with annotations (source) and a domain of interest without annotations (target). As an effective semi-supervised learning method, the teacher-student framework (a student model is supervised by the pseudo labels from a teacher model) has also yielded a large accuracy gain in cross-domain object detection. However, it suffers from the domain shift and generates many low-quality pseudo labels (\textit{e.g.,} false positives), which leads to sub-optimal performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose a teacher-student framework named Adaptive Teacher (AT) which leverages domain adversarial learning and weak-strong data augmentation to address the domain gap. Specifically, we employ feature-level adversarial training in the student model, allowing features derived from the source and target domains to share similar distributions. This process ensures the student model produces domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we apply weak-strong augmentation and mutual learning between the teacher model (taking data from the target domain) and the student model (taking data from both domains). This enables the teacher model to learn the knowledge from the student model without being biased to the source domain. We show that AT demonstrates superiority over existing approaches and even Oracle (fully-supervised) models by a large margin. For example, we achieve 50.9% (49.3%) mAP on Foggy Cityscape (Clipart1K), which is 9.2% (5.2%) and 8.2% (11.0%) higher than previous state-of-the-art and Oracle, respectively.

- **Summary**: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative learning of a deep learning model without sharing the data of participating sites. FL in medical image analysis tasks is relatively new and open for enhancements. In this study, we propose FedDropoutAvg, a new federated learning approach for training a generalizable model. The proposed method takes advantage of randomness, both in client selection and also in federated averaging process. We compare FedDropoutAvg to several algorithms in an FL scenario for real-world multi-site histopathology image classification task. We show that with FedDropoutAvg, the final model can achieve performance better than other FL approaches and closer to a classical deep learning model that requires all data to be shared for centralized training. We test the trained models on a large dataset consisting of 1.2 million image tiles from 21 different centers. To evaluate the generalization ability of the proposed approach, we use held-out test sets from centers whose data was used in the FL and for unseen data from other independent centers whose data was not used in the federated training. We show that the proposed approach is more generalizable than other state-of-the-art federated training approaches. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to use a randomized client and local model parameter selection procedure in a federated setting for a medical image analysis task.

- **Summary**: Despite the success of deep learning in computer vision, algorithms to recognize subtle and small objects (or regions) is still challenging. For example, recognizing a baseball or a frisbee on a ground scene or a bone fracture in an X-ray image can easily result in overfitting, unless a huge amount of training data is available. To mitigate this problem, we need a way to force a model should identify subtle regions in limited training data. In this paper, we propose a simple but efficient supervised augmentation method called Cut\&Remain. It achieved better performance on various medical image domain (internally sourced- and public dataset) and a natural image domain (MS-COCO$_s$) than other supervised augmentation and the explicit guidance methods.   In addition, using the class activation map, we identified that the Cut\&Remain methods drive a model to focus on relevant subtle and small regions efficiently. We also show that the performance monotonically increased along the Cut\&Remain ratio, indicating that a model can be improved even though only limited amount of Cut\&Remain is applied for, so that it allows low supervising (annotation) cost for improvement.

- **Summary**: Many tasks in deep learning involve optimizing over the \emph{inputs} to a network to minimize or maximize some objective; examples include optimization over latent spaces in a generative model to match a target image, or adversarially perturbing an input to worsen classifier performance. Performing such optimization, however, is traditionally quite costly, as it involves a complete forward and backward pass through the network for each gradient step. In a separate line of work, a recent thread of research has developed the deep equilibrium (DEQ) model, a class of models that foregoes traditional network depth and instead computes the output of a network by finding the fixed point of a single nonlinear layer. In this paper, we show that there is a natural synergy between these two settings. Although, naively using DEQs for these optimization problems is expensive (owing to the time needed to compute a fixed point for each gradient step), we can leverage the fact that gradient-based optimization can \emph{itself} be cast as a fixed point iteration to substantially improve the overall speed. That is, we \emph{simultaneously} both solve for the DEQ fixed point \emph{and} optimize over network inputs, all within a single ``augmented'' DEQ model that jointly encodes both the original network and the optimization process. Indeed, the procedure is fast enough that it allows us to efficiently \emph{train} DEQ models for tasks traditionally relying on an ``inner'' optimization loop. We demonstrate this strategy on various tasks such as training generative models while optimizing over latent codes, training models for inverse problems like denoising and inpainting, adversarial training and gradient based meta-learning.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised video action recognition tends to enable deep neural networks to achieve remarkable performance even with very limited labeled data. However, existing methods are mainly transferred from current image-based methods (e.g., FixMatch). Without specifically utilizing the temporal dynamics and inherent multimodal attributes, their results could be suboptimal. To better leverage the encoded temporal information in videos, we introduce temporal gradient as an additional modality for more attentive feature extraction in this paper. To be specific, our method explicitly distills the fine-grained motion representations from temporal gradient (TG) and imposes consistency across different modalities (i.e., RGB and TG). The performance of semi-supervised action recognition is significantly improved without additional computation or parameters during inference. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three video action recognition benchmarks (i.e., Kinetics-400, UCF-101, and HMDB-51) under several typical semi-supervised settings (i.e., different ratios of labeled data).

- **Summary**: Recent work has shown that imperceptible perturbations can be applied to craft unlearnable examples (ULEs), i.e. images whose content cannot be used to improve a classifier during training. In this paper, we reveal the road that researchers should follow for understanding ULEs and improving ULEs as they were originally formulated (ULEOs). The paper makes four contributions. First, we show that ULEOs exploit color and, consequently, their effects can be mitigated by simple grayscale pre-filtering, without resorting to adversarial training. Second, we propose an extension to ULEOs, which is called ULEO-GrayAugs, that forces the generated ULEs away from channel-wise color perturbations by making use of grayscale knowledge and data augmentations during optimization. Third, we show that ULEOs generated using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are effective in the case of complex Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers, suggesting that CNNs suffer specific vulnerability to ULEs. Fourth, we demonstrate that when a classifier is trained on ULEOs, adversarial training will prevent a drop in accuracy measured both on clean images and on adversarial images. Taken together, our contributions represent a substantial advance in the state of art of unlearnable examples, but also reveal important characteristics of their behavior that must be better understood in order to achieve further improvements.

- **Summary**: We present NeSF, a method for producing 3D semantic fields from posed RGB images alone. In place of classical 3D representations, our method builds on recent work in implicit neural scene representations wherein 3D structure is captured by point-wise functions. We leverage this methodology to recover 3D density fields upon which we then train a 3D semantic segmentation model supervised by posed 2D semantic maps. Despite being trained on 2D signals alone, our method is able to generate 3D-consistent semantic maps from novel camera poses and can be queried at arbitrary 3D points. Notably, NeSF is compatible with any method producing a density field, and its accuracy improves as the quality of the density field improves. Our empirical analysis demonstrates comparable quality to competitive 2D and 3D semantic segmentation baselines on complex, realistically rendered synthetic scenes. Our method is the first to offer truly dense 3D scene segmentations requiring only 2D supervision for training, and does not require any semantic input for inference on novel scenes.
