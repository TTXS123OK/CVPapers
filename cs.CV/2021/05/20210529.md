- **Summary**: Temporal action segmentation is a task to classify each frame in the video with an action label. However, it is quite expensive to annotate every frame in a large corpus of videos to construct a comprehensive supervised training dataset. Thus in this work we propose an unsupervised method, namely SSCAP, that operates on a corpus of unlabeled videos and predicts a likely set of temporal segments across the videos. SSCAP leverages Self-Supervised learning to extract distinguishable features and then applies a novel Co-occurrence Action Parsing algorithm to not only capture the correlation among sub-actions underlying the structure of activities, but also estimate the temporal path of the sub-actions in an accurate and general way. We evaluate on both classic datasets (Breakfast, 50Salads) and the emerging fine-grained action dataset (FineGym) with more complex activity structures and similar sub-actions. Results show that SSCAP achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets and can even outperform some weakly-supervised approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.

- **Summary**: Much environmental enforcement in the United States has historically relied on either self-reported data or physical, resource-intensive, infrequent inspections. Advances in remote sensing and computer vision, however, have the potential to augment compliance monitoring by detecting early warning signs of noncompliance. We demonstrate a process for rapid identification of significant structural expansion using Planet's 3m/pixel satellite imagery products and focusing on Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) in the US as a test case. Unpermitted building expansion has been a particular challenge with CAFOs, which pose significant health and environmental risks. Using new hand-labeled dataset of 145,053 images of 1,513 CAFOs, we combine state-of-the-art building segmentation with a likelihood-based change-point detection model to provide a robust signal of building expansion (AUC = 0.86). A major advantage of this approach is that it can work with higher cadence (daily to weekly), but lower resolution (3m/pixel), satellite imagery than previously used in similar environmental settings. It is also highly generalizable and thus provides a near real-time monitoring tool to prioritize enforcement resources in other settings where unpermitted construction poses environmental risk, e.g. zoning, habitat modification, or wetland protection.

- **Summary**: Recent years have seen the introduction of a range of methods for post-hoc explainability of image classifier predictions. However, these post-hoc explanations may not always be faithful to classifier predictions, which poses a significant challenge when attempting to debug models based on such explanations. To this end, we seek a methodology that can improve the faithfulness of an explanation method with respect to model predictions which does not require ground truth explanations. We achieve this through a novel explanation-driven data augmentation (EDDA) technique that augments the training data with occlusions inferred from model explanations; this is based on the simple motivating principle that \emph{if} the explainer is faithful to the model \emph{then} occluding salient regions for the model prediction should decrease the model confidence in the prediction, while occluding non-salient regions should not change the prediction. To verify that the proposed augmentation method has the potential to improve faithfulness, we evaluate EDDA using a variety of datasets and classification models. We demonstrate empirically that our approach leads to a significant increase of faithfulness, which can facilitate better debugging and successful deployment of image classification models in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Many animals and humans process the visual field with a varying spatial resolution (foveated vision) and use peripheral processing to make eye movements and point the fovea to acquire high-resolution information about objects of interest. This architecture results in computationally efficient rapid scene exploration. Recent progress in self-attention-based Vision Transformers, an alternative to the traditionally convolution-reliant computer vision systems. However, the Transformer models do not explicitly model the foveated properties of the visual system nor the interaction between eye movements and the classification task. We propose Foveated Transformer (FoveaTer) model, which uses pooling regions and eye movements to perform object classification tasks using a Vision Transformer architecture. Using square pooling regions or biologically-inspired radial-polar pooling regions, our proposed model pools the image features from the convolution backbone and uses the pooled features as an input to transformer layers. It decides on subsequent fixation location based on the attention assigned by the Transformer to various locations from past and present fixations. It dynamically allocates more fixation/computational resources to more challenging images before making the final image category decision. Using five ablation studies, we evaluate the contribution of different components of the Foveated model. We perform a psychophysics scene categorization task and use the experimental data to find a suitable radial-polar pooling region combination. We also show that the Foveated model better explains the human decisions in a scene categorization task than a Baseline model. We demonstrate our model's robustness against PGD adversarial attacks with both types of pooling regions, where we see the Foveated model outperform the Baseline model.

- **Summary**: Existing fiducial markers solutions are designed for efficient detection and decoding, however, their ability to stand out in natural environments is difficult to infer from relatively limited analysis. Furthermore, worsening performance in challenging image capture scenarios - such as poor exposure, motion blur, and off-axis viewing - sheds light on their limitations. E2ETag introduces an end-to-end trainable method for designing fiducial markers and a complimentary detector. By introducing back-propagatable marker augmentation and superimposition into training, the method learns to generate markers that can be detected and classified in challenging real-world environments using a fully convolutional detector network. Results demonstrate that E2ETag outperforms existing methods in ideal conditions and performs much better in the presence of motion blur, contrast fluctuations, noise, and off-axis viewing angles.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We propose a fully convolutional multi-person pose estimation framework using dynamic instance-aware convolutions, termed FCPose. Different from existing methods, which often require ROI (Region of Interest) operations and/or grouping post-processing, FCPose eliminates the ROIs and grouping post-processing with dynamic instance-aware keypoint estimation heads. The dynamic keypoint heads are conditioned on each instance (person), and can encode the instance concept in the dynamically-generated weights of their filters. Moreover, with the strong representation capacity of dynamic convolutions, the keypoint heads in FCPose are designed to be very compact, resulting in fast inference and making FCPose have almost constant inference time regardless of the number of persons in the image. For example, on the COCO dataset, a real-time version of FCPose using the DLA-34 backbone infers about 4.5x faster than Mask R-CNN (ResNet-101) (41.67 FPS vs. 9.26FPS) while achieving improved performance. FCPose also offers better speed/accuracy trade-off than other state-of-the-art methods. Our experiment results show that FCPose is a simple yet effective multi-person pose estimation framework.

- **Summary**: Compared with cheap addition operation, multiplication operation is of much higher computation complexity. The widely-used convolutions in deep neural networks are exactly cross-correlation to measure the similarity between input feature and convolution filters, which involves massive multiplications between float values. In this paper, we present adder networks (AdderNets) to trade these massive multiplications in deep neural networks, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for much cheaper additions to reduce computation costs. In AdderNets, we take the $\ell_1$-norm distance between filters and input feature as the output response. We first develop a theoretical foundation for AdderNets, by showing that both the single hidden layer AdderNet and the width-bounded deep AdderNet with ReLU activation functions are universal function approximators. An approximation bound for AdderNets with a single hidden layer is also presented. We further analyze the influence of this new similarity measure on the optimization of neural network and develop a special training scheme for AdderNets. Based on the gradient magnitude, an adaptive learning rate strategy is proposed to enhance the training procedure of AdderNets. AdderNets can achieve a 75.7% Top-1 accuracy and a 92.3% Top-5 accuracy using ResNet-50 on the ImageNet dataset without any multiplication in the convolutional layer.

- **Summary**: Conditional image synthesis aims to create an image according to some multi-modal guidance in the forms of textual descriptions, reference images, and image blocks to preserve, as well as their combinations. In this paper, instead of investigating these control signals separately, we propose a new two-stage architecture, M6-UFC, to unify any number of multi-modal controls. In M6-UFC, both the diverse control signals and the synthesized image are uniformly represented as a sequence of discrete tokens to be processed by Transformer. Different from existing two-stage autoregressive approaches such as DALL-E and VQGAN, M6-UFC adopts non-autoregressive generation (NAR) at the second stage to enhance the holistic consistency of the synthesized image, to support preserving specified image blocks, and to improve the synthesis speed. Further, we design a progressive algorithm that iteratively improves the non-autoregressively generated image, with the help of two estimators developed for evaluating the compliance with the controls and evaluating the fidelity of the synthesized image, respectively. Extensive experiments on a newly collected large-scale clothing dataset M2C-Fashion and a facial dataset Multi-Modal CelebA-HQ verify that M6-UFC can synthesize high-fidelity images that comply with flexible multi-modal controls.

- **Summary**: Transformers have become one of the dominant architectures in deep learning, particularly as a powerful alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer vision. However, Transformer training and inference in previous works can be prohibitively expensive due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention over a long sequence of representations, especially for high-resolution dense prediction tasks. To this end, we present a novel Less attention vIsion Transformer (LIT), building upon the fact that the early self-attention layers in Transformers still focus on local patterns and bring minor benefits in recent hierarchical vision Transformers. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical Transformer where we use pure multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to encode rich local patterns in the early stages while applying self-attention modules to capture longer dependencies in deeper layers. Moreover, we further propose a learned deformable token merging module to adaptively fuse informative patches in a non-uniform manner. The proposed LIT achieves promising performance on image recognition tasks, including image classification, object detection and instance segmentation, serving as a strong backbone for many vision tasks.

- **Summary**: Despite recent advances in semantic manipulation using StyleGAN, semantic editing of real faces remains challenging. The gap between the $W$ space and the $W$+ space demands an undesirable trade-off between reconstruction quality and editing quality. To solve this problem, we propose to expand the latent space by replacing fully-connected layers in the StyleGAN's mapping network with attention-based transformers. This simple and effective technique integrates the aforementioned two spaces and transforms them into one new latent space called $W$++. Our modified StyleGAN maintains the state-of-the-art generation quality of the original StyleGAN with moderately better diversity. But more importantly, the proposed $W$++ space achieves superior performance in both reconstruction quality and editing quality. Despite these significant advantages, our $W$++ space supports existing inversion algorithms and editing methods with only negligible modifications thanks to its structural similarity with the $W/W$+ space. Extensive experiments on the FFHQ dataset prove that our proposed $W$++ space is evidently more preferable than the previous $W/W$+ space for real face editing. The code is publicly available for research purposes at https://github.com/AnonSubm2021/TransStyleGAN.

- **Summary**: Adversarial training is one of the most effective approaches to improve model robustness against adversarial examples. However, previous works mainly focus on the overall robustness of the model, and the in-depth analysis on the role of each class involved in adversarial training is still missing. In this paper, we propose to analyze the class-wise robustness in adversarial training. First, we provide a detailed diagnosis of adversarial training on six benchmark datasets, i.e., MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, STL-10 and ImageNet. Surprisingly, we find that there are remarkable robustness discrepancies among classes, leading to unbalance/unfair class-wise robustness in the robust models. Furthermore, we keep investigating the relations between classes and find that the unbalanced class-wise robustness is pretty consistent among different attack and defense methods. Moreover, we observe that the stronger attack methods in adversarial learning achieve performance improvement mainly from a more successful attack on the vulnerable classes (i.e., classes with less robustness). Inspired by these interesting findings, we design a simple but effective attack method based on the traditional PGD attack, named Temperature-PGD attack, which proposes to enlarge the robustness disparity among classes with a temperature factor on the confidence distribution of each image. Experiments demonstrate our method can achieve a higher attack rate than the PGD attack. Furthermore, from the defense perspective, we also make some modifications in the training and inference phase to improve the robustness of the most vulnerable class, so as to mitigate the large difference in class-wise robustness. We believe our work can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of adversarial training as well as rethinking the class-wise properties in robust models.

- **Summary**: Orienting objects is a critical component in the automation of many packing and assembly tasks. We present an algorithm to orient novel objects given a depth image of the object in its current and desired orientation. We formulate a self-supervised objective for this problem and train a deep neural network to estimate the 3D rotation as parameterized by a quaternion, between these current and desired depth images. We then use the trained network in a proportional controller to re-orient objects based on the estimated rotation between the two depth images. Results suggest that in simulation we can rotate unseen objects with unknown geometries by up to 30{\deg} with a median angle error of 1.47{\deg} over 100 random initial/desired orientations each for 22 novel objects. Experiments on physical objects suggest that the controller can achieve a median angle error of 4.2{\deg} over 10 random initial/desired orientations each for 5 objects.

- **Journal**: Proc. International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2021
- **Summary**: We propose an end-to-end trainable framework that processes large-scale visual data tensors by looking at a fraction of their entries only. Our method combines a neural network encoder with a tensor train decomposition to learn a low-rank latent encoding, coupled with cross-approximation (CA) to learn the representation through a subset of the original samples. CA is an adaptive sampling algorithm that is native to tensor decompositions and avoids working with the full high-resolution data explicitly. Instead, it actively selects local representative samples that we fetch out-of-core and on-demand. The required number of samples grows only logarithmically with the size of the input. Our implicit representation of the tensor in the network enables processing large grids that could not be otherwise tractable in their uncompressed form. The proposed approach is particularly useful for large-scale multidimensional grid data (e.g., 3D tomography), and for tasks that require context over a large receptive field (e.g., predicting the medical condition of entire organs). The code is available at https://github.com/aelphy/c-pic.

- **Summary**: Photoacoustic (PA) computed tomography (PACT) shows great potentials in various preclinical and clinical applications. A great number of measurements are the premise that obtains a high-quality image, which implies a low imaging rate or a high system cost. The artifacts or sidelobes could pollute the image if we decrease the number of measured channels or limit the detected view. In this paper, a novel compressed sensing method for PACT using an untrained neural network is proposed, which decreases half number of the measured channels and recoveries enough details. This method uses a neural network to reconstruct without the requirement for any additional learning based on the deep image prior. The model can reconstruct the image only using a few detections with gradient descent. Our method can cooperate with other existing regularization, and further improve the quality. In addition, we introduce a shape prior to easily converge the model to the image. We verify the feasibility of untrained network based compressed sensing in PA image reconstruction, and compare this method with a conventional method using total variation minimization. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms 32.72% (SSIM) with the traditional compressed sensing method in the same regularization. It could dramatically reduce the requirement for the number of transducers, by sparsely sampling the raw PA data, and improve the quality of PA image significantly.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based methods represented as stochastic differential equations on a continuous-time domain have recently proven successful as a non-adversarial generative model. Training such models relies on denoising score matching, which can be seen as multi-scale denoising autoencoders. Here, we augment the denoising score matching framework to enable representation learning without any supervised signal. GANs and VAEs learn representations by directly transforming latent codes to data samples. In contrast, the introduced diffusion-based representation learning relies on a new formulation of the denoising score matching objective and thus encodes the information needed for denoising. We illustrate how this difference allows for manual control of the level of details encoded in the representation. Using the same approach, we propose to learn an infinite-dimensional latent code that achieves improvements of state-of-the-art models on semi-supervised image classification. We also compare the quality of learned representations of diffusion score matching with other methods like autoencoder and contrastively trained systems through their performances on downstream tasks.



### Detecting Backdoor in Deep Neural Networks via Intentional Adversarial Perturbations

- **Summary**: Recent researches show that deep learning model is susceptible to backdoor attacks. Many defenses against backdoor attacks have been proposed. However, existing defense works require high computational overhead or backdoor attack information such as the trigger size, which is difficult to satisfy in realistic scenarios. In this paper, a novel backdoor detection method based on adversarial examples is proposed. The proposed method leverages intentional adversarial perturbations to detect whether an image contains a trigger, which can be applied in both the training stage and the inference stage (sanitize the training set in training stage and detect the backdoor instances in inference stage). Specifically, given an untrusted image, the adversarial perturbation is added to the image intentionally. If the prediction of the model on the perturbed image is consistent with that on the unperturbed image, the input image will be considered as a backdoor instance. Compared with most existing defense works, the proposed adversarial perturbation based method requires low computational resources and maintains the visual quality of the images. Experimental results show that, the backdoor detection rate of the proposed defense method is 99.63%, 99.76% and 99.91% on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and GTSRB datasets, respectively. Besides, the proposed method maintains the visual quality of the image as the l2 norm of the added perturbation are as low as 2.8715, 3.0513 and 2.4362 on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and GTSRB datasets, respectively. In addition, it is also demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve high defense performance against backdoor attacks under different attack settings (trigger transparency, trigger size and trigger pattern). Compared with the existing defense work (STRIP), the proposed method has better detection performance on all the three datasets, and is more efficient than STRIP.

- **Summary**: Ensembles of independently trained neural networks are a state-of-the-art approach to estimate predictive uncertainty in Deep Learning, and can be interpreted as an approximation of the posterior distribution via a mixture of delta functions. The training of ensembles relies on non-convexity of the loss landscape and random initialization of their individual members, making the resulting posterior approximation uncontrolled. This paper proposes a novel and principled method to tackle this limitation, minimizing an $f$-divergence between the true posterior and a kernel density estimator (KDE) in a function space. We analyze this objective from a combinatorial point of view, and show that it is submodular with respect to mixture components for any $f$. Subsequently, we consider the problem of greedy ensemble construction. From the marginal gain on the negative $f$-divergence, which quantifies an improvement in posterior approximation yielded by adding a new component into the KDE, we derive a novel diversity term for ensemble methods. The performance of our approach is demonstrated on computer vision out-of-distribution detection benchmarks in a range of architectures trained on multiple datasets.

- **Summary**: Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain denoted by frequent seizures. The symptoms of seizure include confusion, abnormal staring, and rapid, sudden, and uncontrollable hand movements. Epileptic seizure detection methods involve neurological exams, blood tests, neuropsychological tests, and neuroimaging modalities. Among these, neuroimaging modalities have received considerable attention from specialist physicians. One method to facilitate the accurate and fast diagnosis of epileptic seizures is to employ computer-aided diagnosis systems (CADS) based on deep learning (DL) and neuroimaging modalities. This paper has studied a comprehensive overview of DL methods employed for epileptic seizures detection and prediction using neuroimaging modalities. First, DL-based CADS for epileptic seizures detection and prediction using neuroimaging modalities are discussed. Also, descriptions of various datasets, preprocessing algorithms, and DL models which have been used for epileptic seizures detection and prediction have been included. Then, research on rehabilitation tools has been presented, which contains brain-computer interface (BCI), cloud computing, internet of things (IoT), hardware implementation of DL techniques on field-programmable gate array (FPGA), etc. In the discussion section, a comparison has been carried out between research on epileptic seizure detection and prediction. The challenges in epileptic seizures detection and prediction using neuroimaging modalities and DL models have been described. In addition, possible directions for future works in this field, specifically for solving challenges in datasets, DL, rehabilitation, and hardware models, have been proposed. The final section is dedicated to the conclusion which summarizes the significant findings of the paper.

- **Summary**: Object pose detection and tracking has recently attracted increasing attention due to its wide applications in many areas, such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Among methods for object pose detection and tracking, deep learning is the most promising one that has shown better performance than others. However, survey study about the latest development of deep learning-based methods is lacking. Therefore, this study presents a comprehensive review of recent progress in object pose detection and tracking that belongs to the deep learning technical route. To achieve a more thorough introduction, the scope of this study is limited to methods taking monocular RGB/RGBD data as input and covering three kinds of major tasks: instance-level monocular object pose detection, category-level monocular object pose detection, and monocular object pose tracking. In our work, metrics, datasets, and methods of both detection and tracking are presented in detail. Comparative results of current state-of-the-art methods on several publicly available datasets are also presented, together with insightful observations and inspiring future research directions.

- **Summary**: Most existing Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems tend to overly rely on language bias and hence fail to reason from the visual clue. To address this issue, we propose a novel Language-Prior Feedback (LPF) objective function, to re-balance the proportion of each answer's loss value in the total VQA loss. The LPF firstly calculates a modulating factor to determine the language bias using a question-only branch. Then, the LPF assigns a self-adaptive weight to each training sample in the training process. With this reweighting mechanism, the LPF ensures that the total VQA loss can be reshaped to a more balanced form. By this means, the samples that require certain visual information to predict will be efficiently used during training. Our method is simple to implement, model-agnostic, and end-to-end trainable. We conduct extensive experiments and the results show that the LPF (1) brings a significant improvement over various VQA models, (2) achieves competitive performance on the bias-sensitive VQA-CP v2 benchmark.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation for medical images is important for clinical diagnosis. Existing automatic segmentation methods are mainly based on fully supervised learning and have an extremely high demand for precise annotations, which are very costly and time-consuming to obtain. To address this problem, we proposed an automatic CT segmentation method based on weakly supervised learning, by which one could train an accurate segmentation model only with weak annotations in the form of bounding boxes. The proposed method is composed of two steps: 1) generating pseudo masks with bounding box annotations by k-means clustering, and 2) iteratively training a 3D U-Net convolutional neural network as a segmentation model. Some data pre-processing methods are used to improve performance. The method was validated on four datasets containing three types of organs with a total of 627 CT volumes. For liver, spleen and kidney segmentation, it achieved an accuracy of 95.19%, 92.11%, and 91.45%, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is accurate, efficient, and suitable for clinical use.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we study multi-dimensional image recovery. Recently, transform-based tensor nuclear norm minimization methods are considered to capture low-rank tensor structures to recover third-order tensors in multi-dimensional image processing applications. The main characteristic of such methods is to perform the linear transform along the third mode of third-order tensors, and then compute tensor nuclear norm minimization on the transformed tensor so that the underlying low-rank tensors can be recovered. The main aim of this paper is to propose a nonlinear multilayer neural network to learn a nonlinear transform via the observed tensor data under self-supervision. The proposed network makes use of low-rank representation of transformed tensors and data-fitting between the observed tensor and the reconstructed tensor to construct the nonlinear transformation. Extensive experimental results on tensor completion, background subtraction, robust tensor completion, and snapshot compressive imaging are presented to demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method is better than that of state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In this paper we propose a novel point cloud generator that is able to reconstruct and generate 3D point clouds composed of semantic parts. Given a latent representation of the target 3D model, the generation starts from a single point and gets expanded recursively to produce the high-resolution point cloud via a sequence of point expansion stages. During the recursive procedure of generation, we not only obtain the coarse-to-fine point clouds for the target 3D model from every expansion stage, but also unsupervisedly discover the semantic segmentation of the target model according to the hierarchical/parent-child relation between the points across expansion stages. Moreover, the expansion modules and other elements used in our recursive generator are mostly sharing weights thus making the overall framework light and efficient. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our proposed point cloud generator has comparable or even superior performance on both generation and reconstruction tasks in comparison to various baselines, as well as provides the consistent co-segmentation among 3D instances of the same object class.

- **Summary**: We have presented a Spiking Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) that incorporates retinal foveal-pit inspired Difference of Gaussian filters and rank-order encoding. The model is trained using a variant of the backpropagation algorithm adapted to work with spiking neurons, as implemented in the Nengo library. We have evaluated the performance of our model on two publicly available datasets - one for digit recognition task, and the other for vehicle recognition task. The network has achieved up to 90% accuracy, where loss is calculated using the cross-entropy function. This is an improvement over around 57% accuracy obtained with the alternate approach of performing the classification without any kind of neural filtering. Overall, our proof-of-concept study indicates that introducing biologically plausible filtering in existing SCNN architecture will work well with noisy input images such as those in our vehicle recognition task. Based on our results, we plan to enhance our SCNN by integrating lateral inhibition-based redundancy reduction prior to rank-ordering, which will further improve the classification accuracy by the network.

- **Summary**: Deep learning techniques have been widely applied to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification and have achieved great success. However, the deep neural network model has a large parameter space and requires a large number of labeled data. Deep learning methods for HSI classification usually follow a patchwise learning framework. Recently, a fast patch-free global learning (FPGA) architecture was proposed for HSI classification according to global spatial context information. However, FPGA has difficulty extracting the most discriminative features when the sample data is imbalanced. In this paper, a spectral-spatial dependent global learning (SSDGL) framework based on global convolutional long short-term memory (GCL) and global joint attention mechanism (GJAM) is proposed for insufficient and imbalanced HSI classification. In SSDGL, the hierarchically balanced (H-B) sampling strategy and the weighted softmax loss are proposed to address the imbalanced sample problem. To effectively distinguish similar spectral characteristics of land cover types, the GCL module is introduced to extract the long short-term dependency of spectral features. To learn the most discriminative feature representations, the GJAM module is proposed to extract attention areas. The experimental results obtained with three public HSI datasets show that the SSDGL has powerful performance in insufficient and imbalanced sample problems and is superior to other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present results of processing Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) recordings of visual patterns with a retinal model based on foveal-pit inspired Difference of Gaussian (DoG) filters. A DVS sensor was stimulated with varying number of vertical white and black bars of different spatial frequencies moving horizontally at a constant velocity. The output spikes generated by the DVS sensor were applied as input to a set of DoG filters inspired by the receptive field structure of the primate visual pathway. In particular, these filters mimic the receptive fields of the midget and parasol ganglion cells (spiking neurons of the retina) that sub-serve the photo-receptors of the foveal-pit. The features extracted with the foveal-pit model are used for further classification using a spiking convolutional neural network trained with a backpropagation variant adapted for spiking neural networks.

- **Summary**: Corona virus or COVID-19 is a pandemic illness, which has influenced more than million of causalities worldwide and infected a few large number of individuals .Innovative instrument empowering quick screening of the COVID-19 contamination with high precision can be critically useful to the medical care experts. The primary clinical device presently being used for the analysis of COVID-19 is the Reverse record polymerase chain response as known as RT-PCR, which is costly, less-delicate and requires specific clinical work force. X-Ray imaging is an effectively available apparatus that can be a great option in the COVID-19 conclusion. This exploration was taken to examine the utility of computerized reasoning in the quick and exact recognition of COVID-19 from chest X-Ray pictures. The point of this paper is to propose a procedure for programmed recognition of COVID-19 from advanced chest X-Ray images applying pre-prepared profound learning calculations while boosting the discovery exactness. The point is to give over-focused on clinical experts a second pair of eyes through a learning picture characterization models. We distinguish an appropriate Convolutional Neural Network-CNN model through beginning similar investigation of a few mainstream CNN models.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation of breast cancer metastases in histopathological slides is a challenging task. In fact, significant variation in data characteristics of histopathology images (domain shift) make generalization of deep learning to unseen data difficult. Our goal is to address this challenge by using a conditional Fully Convolutional Network (co-FCN) whose output can be conditioned at run time, and which can improve its performance when a properly selected set of reference slides are used to condition the output. We adapted to our task a co-FCN originally applied to organs segmentation in volumetric medical images and we trained it on the Whole Slide Images (WSIs) from three out of five medical centers present in the CAMELYON17 dataset. We tested the performance of the network on the WSIs of the remaining centers. We also developed an automated selection strategy for selecting the conditioning subset, based on an unsupervised clustering process applied to a target-specific set of reference patches, followed by a selection policy that relies on the cluster similarities with the input patch. We benchmarked our proposed method against a U-Net trained on the same dataset with no conditioning. The conditioned network shows better performance that the U-Net on the WSIs with Isolated Tumor Cells and micro-metastases from the medical centers used as test. Our contributions are an architecture which can be applied to the histopathology domain and an automated procedure for the selection of conditioning data.

- **Summary**: We propose a three-dimensional (3D) multimodal medical imaging system that combines freehand ultrasound and structured light 3D reconstruction in a single coordinate system without requiring registration. To the best of our knowledge, these techniques have not been combined before as a multimodal imaging technique. The system complements the internal 3D information acquired with ultrasound, with the external surface measured with the structure light technique. Moreover, the ultrasound probe's optical tracking for pose estimation was implemented based on a convolutional neural network. Experimental results show the system's high accuracy and reproducibility, as well as its potential for preoperative and intraoperative applications. The experimental multimodal error, or the distance from two surfaces obtained with different modalities, was 0.12 mm. The code is available as a Github repository.

- **Summary**: As the roadside perception plays an increasingly significant role in the Connected Automated Vehicle Highway(CAVH) technologies, there are immediate needs of challenging real-world roadside datasets for bench marking and training various computer vision tasks such as 2D/3D object detection and multi-sensor fusion. In this paper, we firstly introduce a challenging BAAI-VANJEE roadside dataset which consist of LiDAR data and RGB images collected by VANJEE smart base station placed on the roadside about 4.5m high. This dataset contains 2500 frames of LiDAR data, 5000 frames of RGB images, including 20% collected at the same time. It also contains 12 classes of objects, 74K 3D object annotations and 105K 2D object annotations. By providing a real complex urban intersections and highway scenes, we expect the BAAI-VANJEE roadside dataset will actively assist the academic and industrial circles to accelerate the innovation research and achievement transformation in the field of intelligent transportation in big data era.

- **Summary**: The rapid advances in deep generative models over the past years have led to highly {realistic media, known as deepfakes,} that are commonly indistinguishable from real to human eyes. These advances make assessing the authenticity of visual data increasingly difficult and pose a misinformation threat to the trustworthiness of visual content in general. Although recent work has shown strong detection accuracy of such deepfakes, the success largely relies on identifying frequency artifacts in the generated images, which will not yield a sustainable detection approach as generative models continue evolving and closing the gap to real images. In order to overcome this issue, we propose a novel fake detection that is designed to re-synthesize testing images and extract visual cues for detection. The re-synthesis procedure is flexible, allowing us to incorporate a series of visual tasks - we adopt super-resolution, denoising and colorization as the re-synthesis. We demonstrate the improved effectiveness, cross-GAN generalization, and robustness against perturbations of our approach in a variety of detection scenarios involving multiple generators over CelebA-HQ, FFHQ, and LSUN datasets.

- **Summary**: Tracking the 6D pose of objects in video sequences is important for robot manipulation. This work presents se(3)-TrackNet, a data-driven optimization approach for long term, 6D pose tracking. It aims to identify the optimal relative pose given the current RGB-D observation and a synthetic image conditioned on the previous best estimate and the object's model. The key contribution in this context is a novel neural network architecture, which appropriately disentangles the feature encoding to help reduce domain shift, and an effective 3D orientation representation via Lie Algebra. Consequently, even when the network is trained solely with synthetic data can work effectively over real images. Comprehensive experiments over multiple benchmarks show se(3)-TrackNet achieves consistently robust estimates and outperforms alternatives, even though they have been trained with real images. The approach runs in real time at 90.9Hz. Code, data and supplementary video for this project are available at https://github.com/wenbowen123/iros20-6d-pose-tracking
