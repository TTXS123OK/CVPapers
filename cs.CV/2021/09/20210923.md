- **Summary**: Instance-aware segmentation of unseen objects is essential for a robotic system in an unstructured environment. Although previous works achieved encouraging results, they were limited to segmenting the only visible regions of unseen objects. For robotic manipulation in a cluttered scene, amodal perception is required to handle the occluded objects behind others. This paper addresses Unseen Object Amodal Instance Segmentation (UOAIS) to detect 1) visible masks, 2) amodal masks, and 3) occlusions on unseen object instances. For this, we propose a Hierarchical Occlusion Modeling (HOM) scheme designed to reason about the occlusion by assigning a hierarchy to a feature fusion and prediction order. We evaluated our method on three benchmarks (tabletop, indoors, and bin environments) and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Robot demos for picking up occluded objects, codes, and datasets are available at https://sites.google.com/view/uoais

- **Summary**: Satellite multi-view stereo (MVS) imagery is particularly suited for large-scale Earth surface reconstruction. Differing from the perspective camera model (pin-hole model) that is commonly used for close-range and aerial cameras, the cubic rational polynomial camera (RPC) model is the mainstream model for push-broom linear-array satellite cameras. However, the homography warping used in the prevailing learning based MVS methods is only applicable to pin-hole cameras. In order to apply the SOTA learning based MVS technology to the satellite MVS task for large-scale Earth surface reconstruction, RPC warping should be considered. In this work, we propose, for the first time, a rigorous RPC warping module. The rational polynomial coefficients are recorded as a tensor, and the RPC warping is formulated as a series of tensor transformations. Based on the RPC warping, we propose the deep learning based satellite MVS (SatMVS) framework for large-scale and wide depth range Earth surface reconstruction. We also introduce a large-scale satellite image dataset consisting of 519 5120${\times}$5120 images, which we call the TLC SatMVS dataset. The satellite images were acquired from a three-line camera (TLC) that catches triple-view images simultaneously, forming a valuable supplement to the existing open-source WorldView-3 datasets with single-scanline images. Experiments show that the proposed RPC warping module and the SatMVS framework can achieve a superior reconstruction accuracy compared to the pin-hole fitting method and conventional MVS methods.

- **Summary**: The ability to transfer adversarial attacks from one model (the surrogate) to another model (the victim) has been an issue of concern within the machine learning (ML) community. The ability to successfully evade unseen models represents an uncomfortable level of ease toward implementing attacks. In this work we note that as studied, current transfer attack research has an unrealistic advantage for the attacker: the attacker has the exact same training data as the victim. We present the first study of transferring adversarial attacks focusing on the data available to attacker and victim under imperfect settings without querying the victim, where there is some variable level of overlap in the exact data used or in the classes learned by each model. This threat model is relevant to applications in medicine, malware, and others. Under this new threat model attack success rate is not correlated with data or class overlap in the way one would expect, and varies with dataset. This makes it difficult for attacker and defender to reason about each other and contributes to the broader study of model robustness and security. We remedy this by developing a masked version of Projected Gradient Descent that simulates class disparity, which enables the attacker to reliably estimate a lower-bound on their attack's success.

- **Summary**: Transformers have shown preferable performance on many vision tasks. However, for the task of person re-identification (ReID), vanilla transformers leave the rich contexts on high-order feature relations under-exploited and deteriorate local feature details, which are insufficient due to the dramatic variations of pedestrians. In this work, we propose an Omni-Relational High-Order Transformer (OH-Former) to model omni-relational features for ReID. First, to strengthen the capacity of visual representation, instead of obtaining the attention matrix based on pairs of queries and isolated keys at each spatial location, we take a step further to model high-order statistics information for the non-local mechanism. We share the attention weights in the corresponding layer of each order with a prior mixing mechanism to reduce the computation cost. Then, a convolution-based local relation perception module is proposed to extract the local relations and 2D position information. The experimental results of our model are superior promising, which show state-of-the-art performance on Market-1501, DukeMTMC, MSMT17 and Occluded-Duke datasets.



### Clustering performance analysis using a new correlation-based cluster validity index

- **Summary**: There are various cluster validity indices used for evaluating clustering results. One of the main objectives of using these indices is to seek the optimal unknown number of clusters. Some indices work well for clusters with different densities, sizes, and shapes. Yet, one shared weakness of those validity indices is that they often provide only one optimal number of clusters. That number is unknown in real-world problems, and there might be more than one possible option. We develop a new cluster validity index based on a correlation between an actual distance between a pair of data points and a centroid distance of clusters that the two points occupy. Our proposed index constantly yields several local peaks and overcomes the previously stated weakness. Several experiments in different scenarios, including UCI real-world data sets, have been conducted to compare the proposed validity index with several well-known ones. An R package related to this new index called NCvalid is available at https://github.com/nwiroonsri/NCvalid.



### Predicting the Timing of Camera Movements From the Kinematics of Instruments in Robotic-Assisted Surgery Using Artificial Neural Networks

- **Summary**: Robotic-assisted surgeries benefit both surgeons and patients, however, surgeons frequently need to adjust the endoscopic camera to achieve good viewpoints. Simultaneously controlling the camera and the surgical instruments is impossible, and consequentially, these camera adjustments repeatedly interrupt the surgery. Autonomous camera control could help overcome this challenge, but most existing systems are reactive, e.g., by having the camera follow the surgical instruments. We propose a predictive approach for anticipating when camera movements will occur using artificial neural networks. We used the kinematic data of the surgical instruments, which were recorded during robotic-assisted surgical training on porcine models. We split the data into segments, and labeled each either as a segment that immediately precedes a camera movement, or one that does not. Due to the large class imbalance, we trained an ensemble of networks, each on a balanced sub-set of the training data. We found that the instruments' kinematic data can be used to predict when camera movements will occur, and evaluated the performance on different segment durations and ensemble sizes. We also studied how much in advance an upcoming camera movement can be predicted, and found that predicting a camera movement 0.25, 0.5, and 1 second before they occurred achieved 98%, 94%, and 84% accuracy relative to the prediction of an imminent camera movement. This indicates that camera movement events can be predicted early enough to leave time for computing and executing an autonomous camera movement and suggests that an autonomous camera controller for RAMIS may one day be feasible.

- **Summary**: Dense vertex-to-vertex correspondence between 3D faces is a fundamental and challenging issue for 3D&2D face analysis. While the sparse landmarks have anatomically ground-truth correspondence, the dense vertex correspondences on most facial regions are unknown. In this view, the current literatures commonly result in reasonable but diverse solutions, which deviate from the optimum to the 3D face dense registration problem. In this paper, we revisit dense registration by a dimension-degraded problem, i.e. proportional segmentation of a line, and employ an iterative dividing and diffusing method to reach the final solution uniquely. This method is then extended to 3D surface by formulating a local registration problem for dividing and a linear least-square problem for diffusing, with constraints on fixed features. On this basis, we further propose a multi-resolution algorithm to accelerate the computational process. The proposed method is linked to a novel local scaling metric, where we illustrate the physical meaning as smooth rearrangement for local cells of 3D facial shapes. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in various aspects. Generally, the proposed method leads to coherent local registrations and elegant mesh grid routines for fine-grained 3D face dense registrations, which benefits many downstream applications significantly. It can also be applied to dense correspondence for other format of data which are not limited to face. The core code will be publicly available at https://github.com/NaughtyZZ/3D_face_dense_registration.

- **Summary**: Recognizing the emotional state of people is a basic but challenging task in video understanding. In this paper, we propose a new task in this field, named Pairwise Emotional Relationship Recognition (PERR). This task aims to recognize the emotional relationship between the two interactive characters in a given video clip. It is different from the traditional emotion and social relation recognition task. Varieties of information, consisting of character appearance, behaviors, facial emotions, dialogues, background music as well as subtitles contribute differently to the final results, which makes the task more challenging but meaningful in developing more advanced multi-modal models. To facilitate the task, we develop a new dataset called Emotional RelAtionship of inTeractiOn (ERATO) based on dramas and movies. ERATO is a large-scale multi-modal dataset for PERR task, which has 31,182 video clips, lasting about 203 video hours. Different from the existing datasets, ERATO contains interaction-centric videos with multi-shots, varied video length, and multiple modalities including visual, audio and text. As a minor contribution, we propose a baseline model composed of Synchronous Modal-Temporal Attention (SMTA) unit to fuse the multi-modal information for the PERR task. In contrast to other prevailing attention mechanisms, our proposed SMTA can steadily improve the performance by about 1\%. We expect the ERATO as well as our proposed SMTA to open up a new way for PERR task in video understanding and further improve the research of multi-modal fusion methodology.

- **Summary**: Video grounding aims to localize the corresponding video moment in an untrimmed video given a language query. Existing methods often address this task in an indirect way, by casting it as a proposal-and-match or fusion-and-detection problem. Solving these surrogate problems often requires sophisticated label assignment during training and hand-crafted removal of near-duplicate results. Meanwhile, existing works typically focus on sparse video grounding with a single sentence as input, which could result in ambiguous localization due to its unclear description. In this paper, we tackle a new problem of dense video grounding, by simultaneously localizing multiple moments with a paragraph as input. From a perspective on video grounding as language conditioned regression, we present an end-to-end parallel decoding paradigm by re-purposing a Transformer-alike architecture (PRVG). The key design in our PRVG is to use languages as queries, and directly regress the moment boundaries based on language-modulated visual representations. Thanks to its simplicity in design, our PRVG framework can be applied in different testing schemes (sparse or dense grounding) and allows for efficient inference without any post-processing technique. In addition, we devise a robust proposal-level attention loss to guide the training of PRVG, which is invariant to moment duration and contributes to model convergence. We perform experiments on two video grounding benchmarks of ActivityNet Captions and TACoS, demonstrating that our PRVG can significantly outperform previous methods. We also perform in-depth studies to investigate the effectiveness of parallel regression paradigm on video grounding.

- **Summary**: Humans learn to recognize and manipulate new objects in lifelong settings without forgetting the previously gained knowledge under non-stationary and sequential conditions. In autonomous systems, the agents also need to mitigate similar behavior to continually learn the new object categories and adapt to new environments. In most conventional deep neural networks, this is not possible due to the problem of catastrophic forgetting, where the newly gained knowledge overwrites existing representations. Furthermore, most state-of-the-art models excel either in recognizing the objects or in grasp prediction, while both tasks use visual input. The combined architecture to tackle both tasks is very limited. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid model architecture consists of a dynamically growing dual-memory recurrent neural network (GDM) and an autoencoder to tackle object recognition and grasping simultaneously. The autoencoder network is responsible to extract a compact representation for a given object, which serves as input for the GDM learning, and is responsible to predict pixel-wise antipodal grasp configurations. The GDM part is designed to recognize the object in both instances and categories levels. We address the problem of catastrophic forgetting using the intrinsic memory replay, where the episodic memory periodically replays the neural activation trajectories in the absence of external sensory information. To extensively evaluate the proposed model in a lifelong setting, we generate a synthetic dataset due to lack of sequential 3D objects dataset. Experiment results demonstrated that the proposed model can learn both object representation and grasping simultaneously in continual learning scenarios.

- **Summary**: Deep learning methods have proven to outperform traditional computer vision methods in various areas of image processing. However, the application of deep learning in industrial surface defect detection systems is challenging due to the insufficient amount of training data, the expensive data generation process, the small size, and the rare occurrence of surface defects. From literature and a polymer products manufacturing use case, we identify design requirements which reflect the aforementioned challenges. Addressing these, we conceptualize design principles and features informed by deep learning research. Finally, we instantiate and evaluate the gained design knowledge in the form of actionable guidelines and strategies based on an industrial surface defect detection use case. This article, therefore, contributes to academia as well as practice by (1) systematically identifying challenges for the industrial application of deep learning-based surface defect detection, (2) strategies to overcome these, and (3) an experimental case study assessing the strategies' applicability and usefulness.

- **Summary**: Recent development of 3D sensors allows the acquisition of extremely dense 3D point clouds of large-scale scenes. The main challenge of processing such large point clouds remains in the size of the data, which induce expensive computational and memory cost. In this context, the full resolution cloud is particularly hard to process, and details it brings are rarely exploited. Although fine-grained details are important for detection of small objects, they can alter the local geometry of large structural parts and mislead deep learning networks. In this paper, we introduce a new generic deep learning pipeline to exploit the full precision of large scale point clouds, but only for objects that require details. The core idea of our approach is to split up the process into multiple sub-networks which operate on different resolutions and with each their specific classes to retrieve. Thus, the pipeline allows each class to benefit either from noise and memory cost reduction of a sub-sampling or from fine-grained details.

- **Summary**: Research in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has made outstanding progress over the past years. SLAM systems are nowadays transitioning from academic to real world applications. However, this transition has posed new demanding challenges in terms of accuracy and robustness. To develop new SLAM systems that can address these challenges, new datasets containing cutting-edge hardware and realistic scenarios are required. We propose the Hilti SLAM Challenge Dataset. Our dataset contains indoor sequences of offices, labs, and construction environments and outdoor sequences of construction sites and parking areas. All these sequences are characterized by featureless areas and varying illumination conditions that are typical in real-world scenarios and pose great challenges to SLAM algorithms that have been developed in confined lab environments. Accurate sparse ground truth, at millimeter level, is provided for each sequence. The sensor platform used to record the data includes a number of visual, lidar, and inertial sensors, which are spatially and temporally calibrated. The purpose of this dataset is to foster the research in sensor fusion to develop SLAM algorithms that can be deployed in tasks where high accuracy and robustness are required, e.g., in construction environments. Many academic and industrial groups tested their SLAM systems on the proposed dataset in the Hilti SLAM Challenge. The results of the challenge, which are summarized in this paper, show that the proposed dataset is an important asset in the development of new SLAM algorithms that are ready to be deployed in the real-world.



### Towards Generalized and Incremental Few-Shot Object Detection

- **Summary**: Real-world object detection is highly desired to be equipped with the learning expandability that can enlarge its detection classes incrementally. Moreover, such learning from only few annotated training samples further adds the flexibility for the object detector, which is highly expected in many applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, etc. However, such sequential learning scenario with few-shot training samples generally causes catastrophic forgetting and dramatic overfitting. In this paper, to address the above incremental few-shot learning issues, a novel Incremental Few-Shot Object Detection (iFSOD) method is proposed to enable the effective continual learning from few-shot samples. Specifically, a Double-Branch Framework (DBF) is proposed to decouple the feature representation of base and novel (few-shot) class, which facilitates both the old-knowledge retention and new-class adaption simultaneously. Furthermore, a progressive model updating rule is carried out to preserve the long-term memory on old classes effectively when adapt to sequential new classes. Moreover, an inter-task class separation loss is proposed to extend the decision region of new-coming classes for better feature discrimination. We conduct experiments on both Pascal VOC and MS-COCO, which demonstrate that our method can effectively solve the problem of incremental few-shot detection and significantly improve the detection accuracy on both base and novel classes.

- **Summary**: Point cloud registration plays a critical role in a multitude of computer vision tasks, such as pose estimation and 3D localization. Recently, a plethora of deep learning methods were formulated that aim to tackle this problem. Most of these approaches find point or feature correspondences, from which the transformations are computed. We give a different perspective and frame the registration problem as a Markov Decision Process. Instead of directly searching for the transformation, the problem becomes one of finding a sequence of translation and rotation actions that is equivalent to this transformation. To this end, we propose an artificial agent trained end-to-end using deep supervised learning. In contrast to conventional reinforcement learning techniques, the observations are sampled i.i.d. and thus no experience replay buffer is required, resulting in a more streamlined training process. Experiments on ModelNet40 show results comparable or superior to the state of the art in the case of clean, noisy and partially visible datasets.

- **Summary**: In contrast to batch learning where all training data is available at once, continual learning represents a family of methods that accumulate knowledge and learn continuously with data available in sequential order. Similar to the human learning process with the ability of learning, fusing, and accumulating new knowledge coming at different time steps, continual learning is considered to have high practical significance. Hence, continual learning has been studied in various artificial intelligence tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the recent progress of continual learning in computer vision. In particular, the works are grouped by their representative techniques, including regularization, knowledge distillation, memory, generative replay, parameter isolation, and a combination of the above techniques. For each category of these techniques, both its characteristics and applications in computer vision are presented. At the end of this overview, several subareas, where continuous knowledge accumulation is potentially helpful while continual learning has not been well studied, are discussed.

- **Summary**: In recent years, various applications in computer vision have achieved substantial progress based on deep learning, which has been widely used for image fusion and shown to achieve adequate performance. However, suffering from limited ability in modeling the spatial correspondence of different source images, it still remains a great challenge for existing unsupervised image fusion models to extract appropriate feature and achieves adaptive and balanced fusion. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-attention-guided image fusion network, which is a unified and unsupervised framework for multi-modal image fusion, multi-exposure image fusion, and multi-focus image fusion. Different from the existing self-attention module, our cross-attention module focus on modeling the cross-correlation between different source images. Using the proposed cross attention module as a core block, a densely connected cross attention-guided network is built to dynamically learn the spatial correspondence to derive better alignment of important details from different input images. Meanwhile, an auxiliary branch is also designed to model the long-range information, and a merging network is attached to finally reconstruct the fusion image.

- **Summary**: We investigate the incorporation of visual relationships into the task of supervised image caption generation by proposing a model that leverages detected objects and auto-generated visual relationships to describe images in natural language. To do so, we first generate a scene graph from raw image pixels by identifying individual objects and visual relationships between them. This scene graph then serves as input to our graph-to-text model, which generates the final caption. In contrast to previous approaches, our model thus explicitly models the detection of objects and visual relationships in the image. For our experiments we construct a new dataset from the intersection of Visual Genome and MS COCO, consisting of images with both a corresponding gold scene graph and human-authored caption. Our results show that our methods outperform existing state-of-the-art end-to-end models that generate image descriptions directly from raw input pixels when compared in terms of the BLEU and METEOR evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: We present Hand ArticuLated Occupancy (HALO), a novel representation of articulated hands that bridges the advantages of 3D keypoints and neural implicit surfaces and can be used in end-to-end trainable architectures. Unlike existing statistical parametric hand models (e.g.~MANO), HALO directly leverages 3D joint skeleton as input and produces a neural occupancy volume representing the posed hand surface. The key benefits of HALO are (1) it is driven by 3D key points, which have benefits in terms of accuracy and are easier to learn for neural networks than the latent hand-model parameters; (2) it provides a differentiable volumetric occupancy representation of the posed hand; (3) it can be trained end-to-end, allowing the formulation of losses on the hand surface that benefit the learning of 3D keypoints. We demonstrate the applicability of HALO to the task of conditional generation of hands that grasp 3D objects. The differentiable nature of HALO is shown to improve the quality of the synthesized hands both in terms of physical plausibility and user preference.

- **Summary**: We present Hierarchical Memory Matching Network (HMMN) for semi-supervised video object segmentation. Based on a recent memory-based method [33], we propose two advanced memory read modules that enable us to perform memory reading in multiple scales while exploiting temporal smoothness. We first propose a kernel guided memory matching module that replaces the non-local dense memory read, commonly adopted in previous memory-based methods. The module imposes the temporal smoothness constraint in the memory read, leading to accurate memory retrieval. More importantly, we introduce a hierarchical memory matching scheme and propose a top-k guided memory matching module in which memory read on a fine-scale is guided by that on a coarse-scale. With the module, we perform memory read in multiple scales efficiently and leverage both high-level semantic and low-level fine-grained memory features to predict detailed object masks. Our network achieves state-of-the-art performance on the validation sets of DAVIS 2016/2017 (90.8% and 84.7%) and YouTube-VOS 2018/2019 (82.6% and 82.5%), and test-dev set of DAVIS 2017 (78.6%).

- **Summary**: We present a method that decomposes, or "unwraps", an input video into a set of layered 2D atlases, each providing a unified representation of the appearance of an object (or background) over the video. For each pixel in the video, our method estimates its corresponding 2D coordinate in each of the atlases, giving us a consistent parameterization of the video, along with an associated alpha (opacity) value. Importantly, we design our atlases to be interpretable and semantic, which facilitates easy and intuitive editing in the atlas domain, with minimal manual work required. Edits applied to a single 2D atlas (or input video frame) are automatically and consistently mapped back to the original video frames, while preserving occlusions, deformation, and other complex scene effects such as shadows and reflections. Our method employs a coordinate-based Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) representation for mappings, atlases, and alphas, which are jointly optimized on a per-video basis, using a combination of video reconstruction and regularization losses. By operating purely in 2D, our method does not require any prior 3D knowledge about scene geometry or camera poses, and can handle complex dynamic real world videos. We demonstrate various video editing applications, including texture mapping, video style transfer, image-to-video texture transfer, and segmentation/labeling propagation, all automatically produced by editing a single 2D atlas image.

- **Summary**: Human visual system is modeled in engineering field providing feature-engineered methods which detect contrasted/surprising/unusual data into images. This data is "interesting" for humans and leads to numerous applications. Deep learning (DNNs) drastically improved the algorithms efficiency on the main benchmark datasets. However, DNN-based models are counter-intuitive: surprising or unusual data is by definition difficult to learn because of its low occurrence probability. In reality, DNN-based models mainly learn top-down features such as faces, text, people, or animals which usually attract human attention, but they have low efficiency in extracting surprising or unusual data in the images. In this paper, we propose a new visual attention model called DeepRare2021 (DR21) which uses the power of DNNs feature extraction and the genericity of feature-engineered algorithms. This algorithm is an evolution of a previous version called DeepRare2019 (DR19) based on a common framework. DR21 1) does not need any training and uses the default ImageNet training, 2) is fast even on CPU, 3) is tested on four very different eye-tracking datasets showing that the DR21 is generic and is always in the within the top models on all datasets and metrics while no other model exhibits such a regularity and genericity. Finally DR21 4) is tested with several network architectures such as VGG16 (V16), VGG19 (V19) and MobileNetV2 (MN2) and 5) it provides explanation and transparency on which parts of the image are the most surprising at different levels despite the use of a DNN-based feature extractor.

- **Summary**: Seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful geophysical imaging technique that produces high-resolution subsurface models by iteratively minimizing the misfit between the simulated and observed seismograms. Unfortunately, conventional FWI with least-squares function suffers from many drawbacks such as the local-minima problem and computation of explicit gradient. It is particularly challenging with the contaminated measurements or poor starting models. Recent works relying on partial differential equations and neural networks show promising performance for two-dimensional FWI. Inspired by the competitive learning of generative adversarial networks, we proposed an unsupervised learning paradigm that integrates wave equation with a discriminate network to accurately estimate the physically consistent models in a distribution sense. Our framework needs no labelled training data nor pretraining of the network, is flexible to achieve multi-parameters inversion with minimal user interaction. The proposed method faithfully recovers the well-known synthetic models that outperforms the classical algorithms. Furthermore, our work paves the way to sidestep the local-minima issue via reducing the sensitivity to initial models and noise.

- **Summary**: Outdoor scene completion is a challenging issue in 3D scene understanding, which plays an important role in intelligent robotics and autonomous driving. Due to the sparsity of LiDAR acquisition, it is far more complex for 3D scene completion and semantic segmentation. Since semantic features can provide constraints and semantic priors for completion tasks, the relationship between them is worth exploring. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end semantic segmentation-assisted scene completion network, including a 2D completion branch and a 3D semantic segmentation branch. Specifically, the network takes a raw point cloud as input, and merges the features from the segmentation branch into the completion branch hierarchically to provide semantic information. By adopting BEV representation and 3D sparse convolution, we can benefit from the lower operand while maintaining effective expression. Besides, the decoder of the segmentation branch is used as an auxiliary, which can be discarded in the inference stage to save computational consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI dataset with low latency. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/jokester-zzz/SSA-SC.

- **Summary**: Given a text description, Temporal Language Grounding (TLG) aims to localize temporal boundaries of the segments that contain the specified semantics in an untrimmed video. TLG is inherently a challenging task, as it requires comprehensive understanding of both sentence semantics and video contents. Previous works either tackle this task in a fully-supervised setting that requires a large amount of temporal annotations or in a weakly-supervised setting that usually cannot achieve satisfactory performance. Since manual annotations are expensive, to cope with limited annotations, we tackle TLG in a semi-supervised way by incorporating self-supervised learning, and propose Self-Supervised Semi-Supervised Temporal Language Grounding (S^4TLG). S^4TLG consists of two parts: (1) A pseudo label generation module that adaptively produces instant pseudo labels for unlabeled samples based on predictions from a teacher model; (2) A self-supervised feature learning module with inter-modal and intra-modal contrastive losses to learn video feature representations under the constraints of video content consistency and video-text alignment. We conduct extensive experiments on the ActivityNet-CD-OOD and Charades-CD-OOD datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed S^4TLG can achieve competitive performance compared to fully-supervised state-of-the-art methods while only requiring a small portion of temporal annotations.

- **Summary**: The evaluation of infectious disease processes on radiologic images is an important and challenging task in medical image analysis. Pulmonary infections can often be best imaged and evaluated through computed tomography (CT) scans, which are often not available in low-resource environments and difficult to obtain for critically ill patients. On the other hand, X-ray, a different type of imaging procedure, is inexpensive, often available at the bedside and more widely available, but offers a simpler, two dimensional image. We show that by relying on a model that learns to generate CT images from X-rays synthetically, we can improve the automatic disease classification accuracy and provide clinicians with a different look at the pulmonary disease process. Specifically, we investigate Tuberculosis (TB), a deadly bacterial infectious disease that predominantly affects the lungs, but also other organ systems. We show that relying on synthetically generated CT improves TB identification by 7.50% and distinguishes TB properties up to 12.16% better than the X-ray baseline.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose the first self-distillation framework for general object detection, termed LGD (Label-Guided self-Distillation). Previous studies rely on a strong pretrained teacher to provide instructive knowledge that could be unavailable in real-world scenarios. Instead, we generate an instructive knowledge based only on student representations and regular labels. Our framework includes sparse label-appearance encoder, inter-object relation adapter and intra-object knowledge mapper that jointly form an implicit teacher at training phase, dynamically dependent on labels and evolving student representations. They are trained end-to-end with detector and discarded in inference. Experimentally, LGD obtains decent results on various detectors, datasets, and extensive tasks like instance segmentation. For example in MS-COCO dataset, LGD improves RetinaNet with ResNet-50 under 2x single-scale training from 36.2% to 39.0% mAP (+ 2.8%). It boosts much stronger detectors like FCOS with ResNeXt-101 DCN v2 under 2x multi-scale training from 46.1% to 47.9% (+ 1.8%). Compared with a classical teacher-based method FGFI, LGD not only performs better without requiring pretrained teacher but also reduces 51% training cost beyond inherent student learning.

- **Summary**: Grasping objects whose physical properties are unknown is still a great challenge in robotics. Most solutions rely entirely on visual data to plan the best grasping strategy. However, to match human abilities and be able to reliably pick and hold unknown objects, the integration of an artificial sense of touch in robotic systems is pivotal. This paper describes a novel model-based slip detection pipeline that can predict possibly failing grasps in real-time and signal a necessary increase in grip force. As such, the slip detector does not rely on manually collected data, but exploits physics to generalize across different tasks. To evaluate the approach, a state-of-the-art vision-based tactile sensor that accurately estimates distributed forces was integrated into a grasping setup composed of a six degrees-of-freedom cobot and a two-finger gripper. Results show that the system can reliably predict slip while manipulating objects of different shapes, materials, and weights. The sensor can detect both translational and rotational slip in various scenarios, making it suitable to improve the stability of a grasp.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses a fundamental question: how good are our current self-supervised visual representation learning algorithms relative to humans? More concretely, how much "human-like" natural visual experience would these algorithms need in order to reach human-level performance in a complex, realistic visual object recognition task such as ImageNet? Using a scaling experiment, here we estimate that the answer is several orders of magnitude longer than a human lifetime: typically on the order of a million to a billion years of natural visual experience (depending on the algorithm used). We obtain even larger estimates for achieving human-level performance in ImageNet-derived robustness benchmarks. The exact values of these estimates are sensitive to some underlying assumptions, however even in the most optimistic scenarios they remain orders of magnitude larger than a human lifetime. We discuss the main caveats surrounding our estimates and the implications of these surprising results.

- **Summary**: Deep learning techniques have emerged as a promising approach to highly accelerated MRI. However, recent reconstruction challenges have shown several drawbacks in current deep learning approaches, including the loss of fine image details even using models that perform well in terms of global quality metrics. In this study, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for image reconstruction and pathology detection, which enables a clinically aware evaluation of deep learning reconstruction quality. The solution is demonstrated for a use case in detecting meniscal tears on knee MRI studies, ultimately finding a loss of fine image details with common reconstruction methods expressed as a reduced ability to detect important pathology like meniscal tears. Despite the common practice of quantitative reconstruction methodology evaluation with metrics such as SSIM, impaired pathology detection as an automated pathology-based reconstruction evaluation approach suggests existing quantitative methods do not capture clinically important reconstruction outcomes.

- **Summary**: Political activity on social media presents a data-rich window into political behavior, but the vast amount of data means that almost all content analyses of social media require a data labeling step. However, most automated machine classification methods ignore the multimodality of posted content, focusing either on text or images. State-of-the-art vision-and-language models are unusable for most political science research: they require all observations to have both image and text and require computationally expensive pretraining. This paper proposes a novel vision-and-language framework called multimodal representations using modality translation (MARMOT). MARMOT presents two methodological contributions: it can construct representations for observations missing image or text, and it replaces the computationally expensive pretraining with modality translation. MARMOT outperforms an ensemble text-only classifier in 19 of 20 categories in multilabel classifications of tweets reporting election incidents during the 2016 U.S. general election. Moreover, MARMOT shows significant improvements over the results of benchmark multimodal models on the Hateful Memes dataset, improving the best result set by VisualBERT in terms of accuracy from 0.6473 to 0.6760 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) from 0.7141 to 0.7530.

- **Summary**: In this work, we introduce a fast and accurate method for unsupervised 3D medical image registration. This work is built on top of a recent algorithm SAM, which is capable of computing dense anatomical/semantic correspondences between two images at the pixel level. Our method is named SAME, which breaks down image registration into three steps: affine transformation, coarse deformation, and deep deformable registration. Using SAM embeddings, we enhance these steps by finding more coherent correspondences, and providing features and a loss function with better semantic guidance. We collect a multi-phase chest computed tomography dataset with 35 annotated organs for each patient and conduct inter-subject registration for quantitative evaluation. Results show that SAME outperforms widely-used traditional registration techniques (Elastix FFD, ANTs SyN) and learning based VoxelMorph method by at least 4.7% and 2.7% in Dice scores for two separate tasks of within-contrast-phase and across-contrast-phase registration, respectively. SAME achieves the comparable performance to the best traditional registration method, DEEDS (from our evaluation), while being orders of magnitude faster (from 45 seconds to 1.2 seconds).

- **Summary**: Depth estimation from a single image is an active research topic in computer vision. The most accurate approaches are based on fully supervised learning models, which rely on a large amount of dense and high-resolution (HR) ground-truth depth maps. However, in practice, color images are usually captured with much higher resolution than depth maps, leading to the resolution-mismatched effect. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly-supervised framework to train a monocular depth estimation network to generate HR depth maps with resolution-mismatched supervision, i.e., the inputs are HR color images and the ground-truth are low-resolution (LR) depth maps. The proposed weakly supervised framework is composed of a sharing weight monocular depth estimation network and a depth reconstruction network for distillation. Specifically, for the monocular depth estimation network the input color image is first downsampled to obtain its LR version with the same resolution as the ground-truth depth. Then, both HR and LR color images are fed into the proposed monocular depth estimation network to obtain the corresponding estimated depth maps. We introduce three losses to train the network: 1) reconstruction loss between the estimated LR depth and the ground-truth LR depth; 2) reconstruction loss between the downsampled estimated HR depth and the ground-truth LR depth; 3) consistency loss between the estimated LR depth and the downsampled estimated HR depth. In addition, we design a depth reconstruction network from depth to depth. Through distillation loss, features between two networks maintain the structural consistency in affinity space, and finally improving the estimation network performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance than unsupervised and semi-supervised learning based schemes, and is competitive or even better compared to supervised ones.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised video representation methods typically focus on the representation of temporal attributes in videos. However, the role of stationary versus non-stationary attributes is less explored: Stationary features, which remain similar throughout the video, enable the prediction of video-level action classes. Non-stationary features, which represent temporally varying attributes, are more beneficial for downstream tasks involving more fine-grained temporal understanding, such as action segmentation. We argue that a single representation to capture both types of features is sub-optimal, and propose to decompose the representation space into stationary and non-stationary features via contrastive learning from long and short views, i.e. long video sequences and their shorter sub-sequences. Stationary features are shared between the short and long views, while non-stationary features aggregate the short views to match the corresponding long view. To empirically verify our approach, we demonstrate that our stationary features work particularly well on an action recognition downstream task, while our non-stationary features perform better on action segmentation. Furthermore, we analyse the learned representations and find that stationary features capture more temporally stable, static attributes, while non-stationary features encompass more temporally varying ones.

- **Summary**: Feature encoding is essential for point cloud analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel point convolution operator named Shell Point Convolution (SPConv) for shape encoding and local context learning. Specifically, SPConv splits 3D neighborhood space into shells, aggregates local features on manually designed kernel points, and performs convolution on the shells. Moreover, SPConv incorporates a simple yet effective attention module that enhances local feature aggregation. Based upon SPConv, a deep neural network named SPNet is constructed to process large-scale point clouds. Poisson disk sampling and feature propagation are incorporated in SPNet for better efficiency and accuracy. We provided details of the shell design and conducted extensive experiments on challenging large-scale point cloud datasets. Experimental results show that SPConv is effective in local shape encoding, and our SPNet is able to achieve top-ranking performances in semantic segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: We present a novel lightweight convolutional neural network for point cloud analysis. In contrast to many current CNNs which increase receptive field by downsampling point cloud, our method directly operates on the entire point sets without sampling and achieves good performances efficiently. Our network consists of point voxel convolution (PVC) layer as building block. Each layer has two parallel branches, namely the voxel branch and the point branch. For the voxel branch specifically, we aggregate local features on non-empty voxel centers to reduce geometric information loss caused by voxelization, then apply volumetric convolutions to enhance local neighborhood geometry encoding. For the point branch, we use Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to extract fine-detailed point-wise features. Outputs from these two branches are adaptively fused via a feature selection module. Moreover, we supervise the output from every PVC layer to learn different levels of semantic information. The final prediction is made by averaging all intermediate predictions. We demonstrate empirically that our method is able to achieve comparable results while being fast and memory efficient. We evaluate our method on popular point cloud datasets for object classification and semantic segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: Sharing collective perception messages (CPM) between vehicles is investigated to decrease occlusions so as to improve the perception accuracy and safety of autonomous driving. However, highly accurate data sharing and low communication overhead is a big challenge for collective perception, especially when real-time communication is required among connected and automated vehicles. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective keypoints-based deep feature fusion framework built on the 3D object detector PV-RCNN, called Fusion PV-RCNN (FPV-RCNN for short), for collective perception. We introduce a high-performance bounding box proposal matching module and a keypoints selection strategy to compress the CPM size and solve the multi-vehicle data fusion problem. Besides, we also propose an effective localization error correction module based on the maximum consensus principle to increase the robustness of the data fusion. Compared to a bird's-eye view (BEV) keypoints feature fusion, FPV-RCNN achieves improved detection accuracy by about 9% at a high evaluation criterion (IoU 0.7) on the synthetic dataset COMAP dedicated to collective perception. In addition, its performance is comparable to two raw data fusion baselines that have no data loss in sharing. Moreover, our method also significantly decreases the CPM size to less than 0.3 KB, and is thus about 50 times smaller than the BEV feature map sharing used in previous works. Even with further decreased CPM feature channels, i.e., from 128 to 32, the detection performance does not show apparent drops. The code of our method is available at https://github.com/YuanYunshuang/FPV_RCNN.

- **Summary**: We present a passive stereo depth system that produces dense and accurate point clouds optimized for human environments, including dark, textureless, thin, reflective and specular surfaces and objects, at 2560x2048 resolution, with 384 disparities, in 30 ms. The system consists of an algorithm combining learned stereo matching with engineered filtering, a training and data-mixing methodology, and a sensor hardware design. Our architecture is 15x faster than approaches that perform similarly on the Middlebury and Flying Things Stereo Benchmarks. To effectively supervise the training of this model, we combine real data labelled using off-the-shelf depth sensors, as well as a number of different rendered, simulated labeled datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our system by presenting a large number of qualitative results in the form of depth maps and point-clouds, experiments validating the metric accuracy of our system and comparisons to other sensors on challenging objects and scenes. We also show the competitiveness of our algorithm compared to state-of-the-art learned models using the Middlebury and FlyingThings datasets.

- **Summary**: In this work we propose a new task: artistic visualization of classical Chinese poems, where the goal is to generatepaintings of a certain artistic style for classical Chinese poems. For this purpose, we construct a new dataset called Paint4Poem. Thefirst part of Paint4Poem consists of 301 high-quality poem-painting pairs collected manually from an influential modern Chinese artistFeng Zikai. As its small scale poses challenges for effectively training poem-to-painting generation models, we introduce the secondpart of Paint4Poem, which consists of 3,648 caption-painting pairs collected manually from Feng Zikai's paintings and 89,204 poem-painting pairs collected automatically from the web. We expect the former to help learning the artist painting style as it containshis most paintings, and the latter to help learning the semantic relevance between poems and paintings. Further, we analyze Paint4Poem regarding poem diversity, painting style, and the semantic relevance between poems and paintings. We create abenchmark for Paint4Poem: we train two representative text-to-image generation models: AttnGAN and MirrorGAN, and evaluate theirperformance regarding painting pictorial quality, painting stylistic relevance, and semantic relevance between poems and paintings.The results indicate that the models are able to generate paintings that have good pictorial quality and mimic Feng Zikai's style, but thereflection of poem semantics is limited. The dataset also poses many interesting research directions on this task, including transferlearning, few-shot learning, text-to-image generation for low-resource data etc. The dataset is publicly available.(https://github.com/paint4poem/paint4poem)
