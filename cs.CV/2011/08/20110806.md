- **Summary**: This paper proposes a robust approach for face detection and gender classification in color images. Previous researches about gender recognition suppose an expensive computational and time-consuming pre-processing step in order to alignment in which face images are aligned so that facial landmarks like eyes, nose, lips, chin are placed in uniform locations in image. In this paper, a novel technique based on mathematical analysis is represented in three stages that eliminates alignment step. First, a new color based face detection method is represented with a better result and more robustness in complex backgrounds. Next, the features which are invariant to affine transformations are extracted from each face using scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) method. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, experiments have been conducted by employing a SVM classifier on a database of face images which contains 500 images from distinct people with equal ratio of male and female.
