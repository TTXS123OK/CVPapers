- **Summary**: Training Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) models using pixel-based regression losses can achieve high distortion metrics scores (e.g., PSNR and SSIM), but often results in blurry images due to insufficient recovery of high-frequency details. Conversely, using GAN or perceptual losses can produce sharp images with high perceptual metric scores (e.g., LPIPS), but may introduce artifacts and incorrect textures. Balancing these two types of losses can help achieve a trade-off between distortion and perception, but the challenge lies in tuning the loss function weights. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that incorporates Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) into the training process of SISR models to balance perceptual quality and distortion. We conceptualize the relationship between loss weights and image quality assessment (IQA) metrics as black-box objective functions to be optimized within our Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization Super-Resolution (MOBOSR) framework. This approach automates the hyperparameter tuning process, reduces overall computational cost, and enables the use of numerous loss functions simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOBOSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both perceptual quality and distortion, significantly advancing the perception-distortion Pareto frontier. Our work points towards a new direction for future research on balancing perceptual quality and fidelity in nearly all image restoration tasks.

- **Summary**: Fine-grained image classification has witnessed significant advancements with the advent of deep learning and computer vision technologies. However, the scarcity of detailed annotations remains a major challenge, especially in scenarios where obtaining high-quality labeled data is costly or time-consuming. To address this limitation, we introduce Precision-Enhanced Pseudo-Labeling(PEPL) approach specifically designed for fine-grained image classification within a semi-supervised learning framework. Our method leverages the abundance of unlabeled data by generating high-quality pseudo-labels that are progressively refined through two key phases: initial pseudo-label generation and semantic-mixed pseudo-label generation. These phases utilize Class Activation Maps (CAMs) to accurately estimate the semantic content and generate refined labels that capture the essential details necessary for fine-grained classification. By focusing on semantic-level information, our approach effectively addresses the limitations of standard data augmentation and image-mixing techniques in preserving critical fine-grained features. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over existing semi-supervised strategies, with notable boosts in accuracy and robustness.Our code has been open sourced at https://github.com/TianSuya/SemiFG.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly transformed visual content generation, yet their application in specialized fields such as interior design remains underexplored. In this paper, we present RoomDiffusion, a pioneering diffusion model meticulously tailored for the interior design industry. To begin with, we build from scratch a whole data pipeline to update and evaluate data for iterative model optimization. Subsequently, techniques such as multiaspect training, multi-stage fine-tune and model fusion are applied to enhance both the visual appeal and precision of the generated results. Lastly, leveraging the latent consistency Distillation method, we distill and expedite the model for optimal efficiency. Unlike existing models optimized for general scenarios, RoomDiffusion addresses specific challenges in interior design, such as lack of fashion, high furniture duplication rate, and inaccurate style. Through our holistic human evaluation protocol with more than 20 professional human evaluators, RoomDiffusion demonstrates industry-leading performance in terms of aesthetics, accuracy, and efficiency, surpassing all existing open source models such as stable diffusion and SDXL.

- **Summary**: DeepFake technology has gained significant attention due to its ability to manipulate facial attributes with high realism, raising serious societal concerns. Face-Swap DeepFake is the most harmful among these techniques, which fabricates behaviors by swapping original faces with synthesized ones. Existing forensic methods, primarily based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), effectively expose these manipulations and have become important authenticity indicators. However, these methods mainly concentrate on capturing the blending inconsistency in DeepFake faces, raising a new security issue, termed Active Fake, emerges when individuals intentionally create blending inconsistency in their authentic videos to evade responsibility. This tactic is called DeepFake Camouflage. To achieve this, we introduce a new framework for creating DeepFake camouflage that generates blending inconsistencies while ensuring imperceptibility, effectiveness, and transferability. This framework, optimized via an adversarial learning strategy, crafts imperceptible yet effective inconsistencies to mislead forensic detectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, highlighting the need for further research in active fake detection.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved performance across various image-language applications. Recently, there has been a growing interest in adapting image pre-trained MLLMs for video-related tasks. However, most efforts concentrate on enhancing the vision encoder and projector components, while the core part, Large Language Models (LLMs), remains comparatively under-explored. In this paper, we propose two strategies to enhance the model's capability in video understanding tasks by improving inter-layer attention computation in LLMs. Specifically, the first approach focuses on the enhancement of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) with Temporal-Aware Dual RoPE, which introduces temporal position information to strengthen the MLLM's temporal modeling capabilities while preserving the relative position relationships of both visual and text tokens. The second approach involves enhancing the Attention Mask with the Frame-wise Block Causal Attention Mask, a simple yet effective method that broadens visual token interactions within and across video frames while maintaining the causal inference mechanism. Based on these proposed methods, we adapt LLaVA for video understanding tasks, naming it Temporal-Considered LLaVA (TC-LLaVA). Our TC-LLaVA achieves new state-of-the-art performance across various video understanding benchmarks with only supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on video-related datasets.

- **Summary**: Stable diffusion has demonstrated strong image synthesis ability to given text descriptions, suggesting it to contain strong semantic clue for grouping objects. Inspired by this, researchers have explored employing stable diffusion for trainingfree segmentation. Most existing approaches either simply employ cross-attention map or refine it by self-attention map, to generate segmentation masks. We believe that iterative refinement with self-attention map would lead to better results. However, we mpirically demonstrate that such a refinement is sub-optimal likely due to the self-attention map containing irrelevant global information which hampers accurately refining cross-attention map with multiple iterations. To address this, we propose an iterative refinement framework for training-free segmentation, named iSeg, having an entropy-reduced self-attention module which utilizes a gradient descent scheme to reduce the entropy of self-attention map, thereby suppressing the weak responses corresponding to irrelevant global information. Leveraging the entropy-reduced self-attention module, our iSeg stably improves refined crossattention map with iterative refinement. Further, we design a category-enhanced cross-attention module to generate accurate cross-attention map, providing a better initial input for iterative refinement. Extensive experiments across different datasets and diverse segmentation tasks reveal the merits of proposed contributions, leading to promising performance on diverse segmentation tasks. For unsupervised semantic segmentation on Cityscapes, our iSeg achieves an absolute gain of 3.8% in terms of mIoU compared to the best existing training-free approach in literature. Moreover, our proposed iSeg can support segmentation with different kind of images and interactions.



### Bi-capacity Choquet Integral for Sensor Fusion with Label Uncertainty

- **Summary**: Sensor fusion combines data from multiple sensor sources to improve reliability, robustness, and accuracy of data interpretation. The Fuzzy Integral (FI), in particular, the Choquet integral (ChI), is often used as a powerful nonlinear aggregator for fusion across multiple sensors. However, existing supervised ChI learning algorithms typically require precise training labels for each input data point, which can be difficult or impossible to obtain. Additionally, prior work on ChI fusion is often based only on the normalized fuzzy measures, which bounds the fuzzy measure values between [0, 1]. This can be limiting in cases where the underlying scales of input data sources are bipolar (i.e., between [-1, 1]). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Choquet integral-based fusion framework, named Bi-MIChI (pronounced "bi-mi-kee"), which uses bi-capacities to represent the interactions between pairs of subsets of the input sensor sources on a bi-polar scale. This allows for extended non-linear interactions between the sensor sources and can lead to interesting fusion results. Bi-MIChI also addresses label uncertainty through Multiple Instance Learning, where training labels are applied to "bags" (sets) of data instead of per-instance. Our proposed Bi-MIChI framework shows effective classification and detection performance on both synthetic and real-world experiments for sensor fusion with label uncertainty. We also provide detailed analyses on the behavior of the fuzzy measures to demonstrate our fusion process.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising approach for 3D scene representation, offering a reduction in computational overhead compared to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). However, 3DGS is susceptible to high-frequency artifacts and demonstrates suboptimal performance under sparse viewpoint conditions, thereby limiting its applicability in robotics and computer vision. To address these limitations, we introduce SVS-GS, a novel framework for Sparse Viewpoint Scene reconstruction that integrates a 3D Gaussian smoothing filter to suppress artifacts. Furthermore, our approach incorporates a Depth Gradient Profile Prior (DGPP) loss with a dynamic depth mask to sharpen edges and 2D diffusion with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss to enhance geometric consistency in novel view synthesis. Experimental evaluations on the MipNeRF-360 and SeaThru-NeRF datasets demonstrate that SVS-GS markedly improves 3D reconstruction from sparse viewpoints, offering a robust and efficient solution for scene understanding in robotics and computer vision applications.

- **Summary**: Multi-modality image fusion aims to integrate the merits of images from different sources and render high-quality fusion images. However, existing feature extraction and fusion methods are either constrained by inherent local reduction bias and static parameters during inference (CNN) or limited by quadratic computational complexity (Transformers), and cannot effectively extract and fuse features. To solve this problem, we propose a dual-branch image fusion network called Tmamba. It consists of linear Transformer and Mamba, which has global modeling capabilities while maintaining linear complexity. Due to the difference between the Transformer and Mamba structures, the features extracted by the two branches carry channel and position information respectively. T-M interaction structure is designed between the two branches, using global learnable parameters and convolutional layers to transfer position and channel information respectively. We further propose cross-modal interaction at the attention level to obtain cross-modal attention. Experiments show that our Tmamba achieves promising results in multiple fusion tasks, including infrared-visible image fusion and medical image fusion. Code with checkpoints will be available after the peer-review process.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Partially-supervised multi-organ medical image segmentation aims to develop a unified semantic segmentation model by utilizing multiple partially-labeled datasets, with each dataset providing labels for a single class of organs. However, the limited availability of labeled foreground organs and the absence of supervision to distinguish unlabeled foreground organs from the background pose a significant challenge, which leads to a distribution mismatch between labeled and unlabeled pixels. Although existing pseudo-labeling methods can be employed to learn from both labeled and unlabeled pixels, they are prone to performance degradation in this task, as they rely on the assumption that labeled and unlabeled pixels have the same distribution. In this paper, to address the problem of distribution mismatch, we propose a labeled-to-unlabeled distribution alignment (LTUDA) framework that aligns feature distributions and enhances discriminative capability. Specifically, we introduce a cross-set data augmentation strategy, which performs region-level mixing between labeled and unlabeled organs to reduce distribution discrepancy and enrich the training set. Besides, we propose a prototype-based distribution alignment method that implicitly reduces intra-class variation and increases the separation between the unlabeled foreground and background. This can be achieved by encouraging consistency between the outputs of two prototype classifiers and a linear classifier. Extensive experimental results on the AbdomenCT-1K dataset and a union of four benchmark datasets (including LiTS, MSD-Spleen, KiTS, and NIH82) demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art partially-supervised methods by a considerable margin, and even surpasses the fully-supervised methods.

### Unveiling Context-Related Anomalies: Knowledge Graph Empowered Decoupling of Scene and Action for Human-Related Video Anomaly Detection

- **Summary**: Detecting anomalies in human-related videos is crucial for surveillance applications. Current methods primarily include appearance-based and action-based techniques. Appearance-based methods rely on low-level visual features such as color, texture, and shape. They learn a large number of pixel patterns and features related to known scenes during training, making them effective in detecting anomalies within these familiar contexts. However, when encountering new or significantly changed scenes, i.e., unknown scenes, they often fail because existing SOTA methods do not effectively capture the relationship between actions and their surrounding scenes, resulting in low generalization. In contrast, action-based methods focus on detecting anomalies in human actions but are usually less informative because they tend to overlook the relationship between actions and their scenes, leading to incorrect detection. For instance, the normal event of running on the beach and the abnormal event of running on the street might both be considered normal due to the lack of scene information. In short, current methods struggle to integrate low-level visual and high-level action features, leading to poor anomaly detection in varied and complex scenes. To address this challenge, we propose a novel decoupling-based architecture for human-related video anomaly detection (DecoAD). DecoAD significantly improves the integration of visual and action features through the decoupling and interweaving of scenes and actions, thereby enabling a more intuitive and accurate understanding of complex behaviors and scenes. DecoAD supports fully supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised settings.

- **Summary**: The current state-of-the-art in severe weather removal predominantly focuses on single-task applications, such as rain removal, haze removal, and snow removal. However, real-world weather conditions often consist of a mixture of several weather types, and the degree of weather mixing in autonomous driving scenarios remains unknown. In the presence of complex and diverse weather conditions, a single weather removal model often encounters challenges in producing clear images from severe weather images. Therefore, there is a need for the development of multi-task severe weather removal models that can effectively handle mixed weather conditions and improve image quality in autonomous driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-task severe weather removal model that can effectively handle complex weather conditions in an adaptive manner. Our model incorporates a weather task sequence generator, enabling the self-attention mechanism to selectively focus on features specific to different weather types. To tackle the challenge of repairing large areas of weather degradation, we introduce Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) to increase the receptive field. Additionally, we propose an adaptive upsampling technique that effectively processes both the weather task information and underlying image features by selectively retaining relevant information. Our proposed model has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available dataset.

- **Summary**: We propose a Ground IoU (Gr-IoU) to address the data association problem in multi-object tracking. When tracking objects detected by a camera, it often occurs that the same object is assigned different IDs in consecutive frames, especially when objects are close to each other or overlapping. To address this issue, we introduce Gr-IoU, which takes into account the 3D structure of the scene. Gr-IoU transforms traditional bounding boxes from the image space to the ground plane using the vanishing point geometry. The IoU calculated with these transformed bounding boxes is more sensitive to the front-to-back relationships of objects, thereby improving data association accuracy and reducing ID switches. We evaluated our Gr-IoU method on the MOT17 and MOT20 datasets, which contain diverse tracking scenarios including crowded scenes and sequences with frequent occlusions. Experimental results demonstrated that Gr-IoU outperforms conventional real-time methods without appearance features.

- **Summary**: In actual scenarios, whether manually or automatically annotated, label noise is inevitably generated in the training data, which can affect the effectiveness of deep CNN models. The popular solutions require data cleaning or designing additional optimizations to punish the data with mislabeled data, thereby enhancing the robustness of models. However, these methods come at the cost of weakening or even losing some data during the training process. As we know, content is the inherent attribute of an image that does not change with changes in annotations. In this study, we propose a general granular-ball computing (GBC) module that can be embedded into a CNN model, where the classifier finally predicts the label of granular-ball ($gb$) samples instead of each individual samples. Specifically, considering the classification task: (1) in forward process, we split the input samples as $gb$ samples at feature-level, each of which can correspond to multiple samples with varying numbers and share one single label; (2) during the backpropagation process, we modify the gradient allocation strategy of the GBC module to enable it to propagate normally; and (3) we develop an experience replay policy to ensure the stability of the training process. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the robustness of CNN models with no additional data or optimization.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in interactive keypoint estimation methods have enhanced accuracy while minimizing user intervention. However, these methods require user input for error correction, which can be costly in vertebrae keypoint estimation where inaccurate keypoints are densely clustered or overlap. We introduce a novel approach, KeyBot, specifically designed to identify and correct significant and typical errors in existing models, akin to user revision. By characterizing typical error types and using simulated errors for training, KeyBot effectively corrects these errors and significantly reduces user workload. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on three public datasets confirm that KeyBot significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in interactive vertebrae keypoint estimation.

- **Summary**: Talking Head Generation (THG), typically driven by audio, is an important and challenging task with broad application prospects in various fields such as digital humans, film production, and virtual reality. While diffusion model-based THG methods present high quality and stable content generation, they often overlook the intrinsic style which encompasses personalized features such as speaking habits and facial expressions of a video. As consequence, the generated video content lacks diversity and vividness, thus being limited in real life scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework named Style-Enhanced Vivid Portrait (SVP) which fully leverages style-related information in THG. Specifically, we first introduce the novel probabilistic style prior learning to model the intrinsic style as a Gaussian distribution using facial expressions and audio embedding. The distribution is learned through the 'bespoked' contrastive objective, effectively capturing the dynamic style information in each video. Then we finetune a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model to inject the learned intrinsic style as a controlling signal via cross attention. Experiments show that our model generates diverse, vivid, and high-quality videos with flexible control over intrinsic styles, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The rise of multi-modal large language models(MLLMs) has spurred their applications in autonomous driving. Recent MLLM-based methods perform action by learning a direct mapping from perception to action, neglecting the dynamics of the world and the relations between action and world dynamics. In contrast, human beings possess world model that enables them to simulate the future states based on 3D internal visual representation and plan actions accordingly. To this end, we propose OccLLaMA, an occupancy-language-action generative world model, which uses semantic occupancy as a general visual representation and unifies vision-language-action(VLA) modalities through an autoregressive model. Specifically, we introduce a novel VQVAE-like scene tokenizer to efficiently discretize and reconstruct semantic occupancy scenes, considering its sparsity and classes imbalance. Then, we build a unified multi-modal vocabulary for vision, language and action. Furthermore, we enhance LLM, specifically LLaMA, to perform the next token/scene prediction on the unified vocabulary to complete multiple tasks in autonomous driving. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OccLLaMA achieves competitive performance across multiple tasks, including 4D occupancy forecasting, motion planning, and visual question answering, showcasing its potential as a foundation model in autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: Automatic chart understanding is crucial for content comprehension and document parsing. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chart understanding through domain-specific alignment and fine-tuning. However, the application of alignment training within the chart domain is still underexplored. To address this, we propose ChartMoE, which employs the mixture of expert (MoE) architecture to replace the traditional linear projector to bridge the modality gap. Specifically, we train multiple linear connectors through distinct alignment tasks, which are utilized as the foundational initialization parameters for different experts. Additionally, we introduce ChartMoE-Align, a dataset with over 900K chart-table-JSON-code quadruples to conduct three alignment tasks (chart-table/JSON/code). Combined with the vanilla connector, we initialize different experts in four distinct ways and adopt high-quality knowledge learning to further refine the MoE connector and LLM parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the MoE connector and our initialization strategy, e.g., ChartMoE improves the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art from 80.48% to 84.64% on the ChartQA benchmark.

- **Summary**: We study the problem of training an unbiased and accurate model given a dataset with multiple biases. This problem is challenging since the multiple biases cause multiple undesirable shortcuts during training, and even worse, mitigating one may exacerbate the other. We propose a novel training method to tackle this challenge. Our method first groups training data so that different groups induce different shortcuts, and then optimizes a linear combination of group-wise losses while adjusting their weights dynamically to alleviate conflicts between the groups in performance; this approach, rooted in the multi-objective optimization theory, encourages to achieve the minimax Pareto solution. We also present a new benchmark with multiple biases, dubbed MultiCelebA, for evaluating debiased training methods under realistic and challenging scenarios. Our method achieved the best on three datasets with multiple biases, and also showed superior performance on conventional single-bias datasets.

- **Summary**: It is very important to detect traffic signs efficiently and accurately in autonomous driving systems. However, the farther the distance, the smaller the traffic signs. Existing object detection algorithms can hardly detect these small scaled signs.In addition, the performance of embedded devices on vehicles limits the scale of detection models.To address these challenges, a YOLO PPA based traffic sign detection algorithm is proposed in this paper.The experimental results on the GTSDB dataset show that compared to the original YOLO, the proposed method improves inference efficiency by 11.2%. The mAP 50 is also improved by 93.2%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed YOLO PPA.

- **Summary**: In the realm of multimedia data analysis, the extensive use of image datasets has escalated concerns over privacy protection within such data. Current research predominantly focuses on privacy protection either in data sharing or upon the release of trained machine learning models. Our study pioneers a comprehensive privacy protection framework that safeguards image data privacy concurrently during data sharing and model publication. We propose an interactive image privacy protection framework that utilizes generative machine learning models to modify image information at the attribute level and employs machine unlearning algorithms for the privacy preservation of model parameters. This user-interactive framework allows for adjustments in privacy protection intensity based on user feedback on generated images, striking a balance between maximal privacy safeguarding and maintaining model performance. Within this framework, we instantiate two modules: a differential privacy diffusion model for protecting attribute information in images and a feature unlearning algorithm for efficient updates of the trained model on the revised image dataset. Our approach demonstrated superiority over existing methods on facial datasets across various attribute classifications.

- **Summary**: Measuring 3D geometric structures of indoor scenes requires dedicated depth sensors, which are not always available. Echo-based depth estimation has recently been studied as a promising alternative solution. All previous studies have assumed the use of echoes in the audible range. However, one major problem is that audible echoes cannot be used in quiet spaces or other situations where producing audible sounds is prohibited. In this paper, we consider echo-based depth estimation using inaudible ultrasonic echoes. While ultrasonic waves provide high measurement accuracy in theory, the actual depth estimation accuracy when ultrasonic echoes are used has remained unclear, due to its disadvantage of being sensitive to noise and susceptible to attenuation. We first investigate the depth estimation accuracy when the frequency of the sound source is restricted to the high-frequency band, and found that the accuracy decreased when the frequency was limited to ultrasonic ranges. Based on this observation, we propose a novel deep learning method to improve the accuracy of ultrasonic echo-based depth estimation by using audible echoes as auxiliary data only during training. Experimental results with a public dataset demonstrate that our method improves the estimation accuracy.

- **Summary**: The application of activity recognition in the "AI + Education" field is gaining increasing attention. However, current work mainly focuses on the recognition of activities in manually captured videos and a limited number of activity types, with little attention given to recognizing activities in surveillance images from real classrooms. In real classroom settings, normal teaching activities such as reading, account for a large proportion of samples, while rare non-teaching activities such as eating, continue to appear. This requires a model that can learn non-teaching activities from few samples without forgetting the normal teaching activities, which necessitates fewshot continual learning (FSCL) capability. To address this gap, we constructed a continual learning dataset focused on classroom surveillance image activity recognition called ARIC (Activity Recognition in Classroom). The dataset has advantages such as multiple perspectives, a wide variety of activities, and real-world scenarios, but it also presents challenges like similar activities and imbalanced sample distribution. To overcome these challenges, we designed a few-shot continual learning method that combines supervised contrastive learning (SCL) and an adaptive covariance classifier (ACC). During the base phase, we proposed a SCL approach based on feature augmentation to enhance the model's generalization ability. In the incremental phase, we employed an ACC to more accurately describe the distribution of new classes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other existing methods on the ARIC dataset.

- **Summary**: Enabled by large annotated datasets, tracking and segmentation of objects in videos has made remarkable progress in recent years. Despite these advancements, algorithms still struggle under degraded conditions and during fast movements. Event cameras are novel sensors with high temporal resolution and high dynamic range that offer promising advantages to address these challenges. However, annotated data for developing learning-based mask-level tracking algorithms with events is not available. To this end, we introduce: ($i$) a new task termed \emph{space-time instance segmentation}, similar to video instance segmentation, whose goal is to segment instances throughout the entire duration of the sensor input (here, the input are quasi-continuous events and optionally aligned frames); and ($ii$) \emph{\dname}, a dataset for the new task, containing aligned grayscale frames and events. It includes annotated ground-truth labels (pixel-level instance segmentation masks) of a group of up to seven freely moving and interacting mice. We also provide two reference methods, which show that leveraging event data can consistently improve tracking performance, especially when used in combination with conventional cameras. The results highlight the potential of event-aided tracking in difficult scenarios. We hope our dataset opens the field of event-based video instance segmentation and enables the development of robust tracking algorithms for challenging conditions.\url{https://github.com/tub-rip/MouseSIS}

- **Summary**: Deep learning has shown great potential for automated medical image segmentation to improve the precision and speed of disease diagnostics. However, the task presents significant difficulties due to variations in the scale, shape, texture, and contrast of the pathologies. Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) models have certain limitations when it comes to effectively modelling multiscale context information and facilitating information interaction between skip connections across levels. To overcome these limitations, a novel deep learning architecture is introduced for medical image segmentation, taking advantage of CNNs and vision transformers. Our proposed model, named TBConvL-Net, involves a hybrid network that combines the local features of a CNN encoder-decoder architecture with long-range and temporal dependencies using biconvolutional long-short-term memory (LSTM) networks and vision transformers (ViT). This enables the model to capture contextual channel relationships in the data and account for the uncertainty of segmentation over time. Additionally, we introduce a novel composite loss function that considers both the segmentation robustness and the boundary agreement of the predicted output with the gold standard. Our proposed model shows consistent improvement over the state of the art on ten publicly available datasets of seven different medical imaging modalities.

- **Summary**: One common belief is that with complex models and pre-training on large-scale datasets, transformer-based methods for referring expression comprehension (REC) perform much better than existing graph-based methods. We observe that since most graph-based methods adopt an off-the-shelf detector to locate candidate objects (i.e., regions detected by the object detector), they face two challenges that result in subpar performance: (1) the presence of significant noise caused by numerous irrelevant objects during reasoning, and (2) inaccurate localization outcomes attributed to the provided detector. To address these issues, we introduce a plug-and-adapt module guided by sub-expressions, called dynamic gate constraint (DGC), which can adaptively disable irrelevant proposals and their connections in graphs during reasoning. We further introduce an expression-guided regression strategy (EGR) to refine location prediction. Extensive experimental results on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, Flickr30K, RefClef, and Ref-reasoning datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the DGC module and the EGR strategy in consistently boosting the performances of various graph-based REC methods. Without any pretaining, the proposed graph-based method achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) transformer-based methods.

- **Summary**: Existing low-light image enhancement methods are difficult to fit the complex nonlinear relationship between normal and low-light images due to uneven illumination and noise effects. The recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) feature spline-based convolutional layers and learnable activation functions, which can effectively capture nonlinear dependencies. In this paper, we design a KAN-Block based on KANs and innovatively apply it to low-light image enhancement. This method effectively alleviates the limitations of current methods constrained by linear network structures and lack of interpretability, further demonstrating the potential of KANs in low-level vision tasks. Given the poor perception of current low-light image enhancement methods and the stochastic nature of the inverse diffusion process, we further introduce frequency-domain perception for visually oriented enhancement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of our method on benchmark datasets. The code will be available at: https://github.com/AXNing/KSID}{https://github.com/AXNing/KSID.

- **Summary**: We propose TG-LMM (Text-Guided Large Multi-Modal Model), a novel approach that leverages textual descriptions of organs to enhance segmentation accuracy in medical images. Existing medical image segmentation methods face several challenges: current medical automatic segmentation models do not effectively utilize prior knowledge, such as descriptions of organ locations; previous text-visual models focus on identifying the target rather than improving the segmentation accuracy; prior models attempt to use prior knowledge to enhance accuracy but do not incorporate pre-trained models. To address these issues, TG-LMM integrates prior knowledge, specifically expert descriptions of the spatial locations of organs, into the segmentation process. Our model utilizes pre-trained image and text encoders to reduce the number of training parameters and accelerate the training process. Additionally, we designed a comprehensive image-text information fusion structure to ensure thorough integration of the two modalities of data. We evaluated TG-LMM on three authoritative medical image datasets, encompassing the segmentation of various parts of the human body. Our method demonstrated superior performance compared to existing approaches, such as MedSAM, SAM and nnUnet.

- **Summary**: Multimodel Large Language Models(MLLMs) have achieved promising OCR-free Document Understanding performance by increasing the supported resolution of document images. However, this comes at the cost of generating thousands of visual tokens for a single document image, leading to excessive GPU memory and slower inference times, particularly in multi-page document comprehension. In this work, to address these challenges, we propose a High-resolution DocCompressor module to compress each high-resolution document image into 324 tokens, guided by low-resolution global visual features. With this compression module, to strengthen multi-page document comprehension ability and balance both token efficiency and question-answering performance, we develop the DocOwl2 under a three-stage training framework: Single-image Pretraining, Multi-image Continue-pretraining, and Multi-task Finetuning. DocOwl2 sets a new state-of-the-art across multi-page document understanding benchmarks and reduces first token latency by more than 50%, demonstrating advanced capabilities in multi-page questioning answering, explanation with evidence pages, and cross-page structure understanding. Additionally, compared to single-image MLLMs trained on similar data, our DocOwl2 achieves comparable single-page understanding performance with less than 20% of the visual tokens. Our codes, models, and data are publicly available at https://github.com/X-PLUG/mPLUG-DocOwl/tree/main/DocOwl2.

- **Summary**: In this article, we introduce a novel normalization technique for neural network weight matrices, which we term weight conditioning. This approach aims to narrow the gap between the smallest and largest singular values of the weight matrices, resulting in better-conditioned matrices. The inspiration for this technique partially derives from numerical linear algebra, where well-conditioned matrices are known to facilitate stronger convergence results for iterative solvers. We provide a theoretical foundation demonstrating that our normalization technique smoothens the loss landscape, thereby enhancing convergence of stochastic gradient descent algorithms. Empirically, we validate our normalization across various neural network architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViT), Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), and 3D shape modeling. Our findings indicate that our normalization method is not only competitive but also outperforms existing weight normalization techniques from the literature.

- **Summary**: Background: The 2024 Mpox outbreak, particularly severe in Africa with clade 1b emergence, has highlighted critical gaps in diagnostic capabilities in resource-limited settings. This study aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven, on-device screening tool for Mpox, designed to function offline in low-resource environments.   Methods: We developed a YOLOv8n-based deep learning model trained on 2,700 images (900 each of Mpox, other skin conditions, and normal skin), including synthetic data. The model was validated on 360 images and tested on 540 images. A larger external validation was conducted using 1,500 independent images. Performance metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, sensitivity, and specificity.   Findings: The model demonstrated high accuracy (96%) in the final test set. For Mpox detection, it achieved 93% precision, 97% recall, and an F1-score of 95%. Sensitivity and specificity for Mpox detection were 97% and 96%, respectively. Performance remained consistent in the larger external validation, confirming the model's robustness and generalizability.   Interpretation: This AI-driven screening tool offers a rapid, accurate, and scalable solution for Mpox detection in resource-constrained settings. Its offline functionality and high performance across diverse datasets suggest significant potential for improving Mpox surveillance and management, particularly in areas lacking traditional diagnostic infrastructure.

- **Summary**: Due to the diverse geographical environments, intricate landscapes, and high-density settlements, the automatic identification of urban village boundaries using remote sensing images remains a highly challenging task. This paper proposes a novel and efficient neural network model called UV-Mamba for accurate boundary detection in high-resolution remote sensing images. UV-Mamba mitigates the memory loss problem in lengthy sequence modeling, which arises in state space models with increasing image size, by incorporating deformable convolutions. Its architecture utilizes an encoder-decoder framework and includes an encoder with four deformable state space augmentation blocks for efficient multi-level semantic extraction and a decoder to integrate the extracted semantic information. We conducted experiments on two large datasets showing that UV-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, our model achieves 73.3% and 78.1% IoU on the Beijing and Xi'an datasets, respectively, representing improvements of 1.2% and 3.4% IoU over the previous best model while also being 6x faster in inference speed and 40x smaller in parameter count.

- **Summary**: Virtual faces are crucial content in the metaverse. Recently, attempts have been made to generate virtual faces for privacy protection. Nevertheless, these virtual faces either permanently remove the identifiable information or map the original identity into a virtual one, which loses the original identity forever. In this study, we first attempt to address the conflict between privacy and identifiability in virtual faces, where a key-driven face anonymization and authentication recognition (KFAAR) framework is proposed. Concretely, the KFAAR framework consists of a head posture-preserving virtual face generation (HPVFG) module and a key-controllable virtual face authentication (KVFA) module. The HPVFG module uses a user key to project the latent vector of the original face into a virtual one. Then it maps the virtual vectors to obtain an extended encoding, based on which the virtual face is generated. By simultaneously adding a head posture and facial expression correction module, the virtual face has the same head posture and facial expression as the original face. During the authentication, we propose a KVFA module to directly recognize the virtual faces using the correct user key, which can obtain the original identity without exposing the original face image. We also propose a multi-task learning objective to train HPVFG and KVFA. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed HPVFG and KVFA modules, which effectively achieve both facial anonymity and identifiability.

- **Summary**: Existing methods for driver facial expression recognition (DFER) are often computationally intensive, rendering them unsuitable for real-time applications. In this work, we introduce a novel transfer learning-based dual architecture, named ShuffViT-DFER, which elegantly combines computational efficiency and accuracy. This is achieved by harnessing the strengths of two lightweight and efficient models using convolutional neural network (CNN) and vision transformers (ViT). We efficiently fuse the extracted features to enhance the performance of the model in accurately recognizing the facial expressions of the driver. Our experimental results on two benchmarking and public datasets, KMU-FED and KDEF, highlight the validity of our proposed method for real-time application with superior performance when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel method for updating 3D geospatial models, specifically targeting occlusion removal in large-scale maritime environments. Traditional 3D reconstruction techniques often face problems with dynamic objects, like cars or vessels, that obscure the true environment, leading to inaccurate models or requiring extensive manual editing. Our approach leverages deep learning techniques, including instance segmentation and generative inpainting, to directly modify both the texture and geometry of 3D meshes without the need for costly reprocessing. By selectively targeting occluding objects and preserving static elements, the method enhances both geometric and visual accuracy. This approach not only preserves structural and textural details of map data but also maintains compatibility with current geospatial standards, ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets. The results demonstrate significant improvements in 3D model fidelity, making this method highly applicable for maritime situational awareness and the dynamic display of auxiliary information.

- **Summary**: Multi-weather image restoration has witnessed incredible progress, while the increasing model capacity and expensive data acquisition impair its applications in memory-limited devices. Data-free distillation provides an alternative for allowing to learn a lightweight student model from a pre-trained teacher model without relying on the original training data. The existing data-free learning methods mainly optimize the models with the pseudo data generated by GANs or the real data collected from the Internet. However, they inevitably suffer from the problems of unstable training or domain shifts with the original data. In this paper, we propose a novel Data-free Distillation with Degradation-prompt Diffusion framework for multi-weather Image Restoration (D4IR). It replaces GANs with pre-trained diffusion models to avoid model collapse and incorporates a degradation-aware prompt adapter to facilitate content-driven conditional diffusion for generating domain-related images. Specifically, a contrast-based degradation prompt adapter is firstly designed to capture degradation-aware prompts from web-collected degraded images. Then, the collected unpaired clean images are perturbed to latent features of stable diffusion, and conditioned with the degradation-aware prompts to synthesize new domain-related degraded images for knowledge distillation. Experiments illustrate that our proposal achieves comparable performance to the model distilled with original training data, and is even superior to other mainstream unsupervised methods.

- **Summary**: We aim to address sparse-view reconstruction of a 3D scene by leveraging priors from large-scale vision models. While recent advancements such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable successes in 3D reconstruction, these methods typically necessitate hundreds of input images that densely capture the underlying scene, making them time-consuming and impractical for real-world applications. However, sparse-view reconstruction is inherently ill-posed and under-constrained, often resulting in inferior and incomplete outcomes. This is due to issues such as failed initialization, overfitting on input images, and a lack of details. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce LM-Gaussian, a method capable of generating high-quality reconstructions from a limited number of images. Specifically, we propose a robust initialization module that leverages stereo priors to aid in the recovery of camera poses and the reliable point clouds. Additionally, a diffusion-based refinement is iteratively applied to incorporate image diffusion priors into the Gaussian optimization process to preserve intricate scene details. Finally, we utilize video diffusion priors to further enhance the rendered images for realistic visual effects. Overall, our approach significantly reduces the data acquisition requirements compared to previous 3DGS methods. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through experiments on various public datasets, demonstrating its potential for high-quality 360-degree scene reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have made remarkable strides; however, they remain susceptible to vulnerabilities, particularly in the face of minor image perturbations that humans can easily recognize. This weakness, often termed as 'attacks', underscores the limited robustness of CNNs and the need for research into fortifying their resistance against such manipulations. This study introduces a novel Non-Uniform Illumination (NUI) attack technique, where images are subtly altered using varying NUI masks. Extensive experiments are conducted on widely-accepted datasets including CIFAR10, TinyImageNet, and CalTech256, focusing on image classification with 12 different NUI attack models. The resilience of VGG, ResNet, MobilenetV3-small and InceptionV3 models against NUI attacks are evaluated. Our results show a substantial decline in the CNN models' classification accuracy when subjected to NUI attacks, indicating their vulnerability under non-uniform illumination. To mitigate this, a defense strategy is proposed, including NUI-attacked images, generated through the new NUI transformation, into the training set. The results demonstrate a significant enhancement in CNN model performance when confronted with perturbed images affected by NUI attacks. This strategy seeks to bolster CNN models' resilience against NUI attacks.

- **Summary**: Research in efficient vision backbones is evolving into models that are a mixture of convolutions and transformer blocks. A smart combination of both, architecture-wise and component-wise is mandatory to excel in the speedaccuracy trade-off. Most publications focus on maximizing accuracy and utilize MACs (multiply accumulate operations) as an efficiency metric. The latter however often do not measure accurately how fast a model actually is due to factors like memory access cost and degree of parallelism. We analyzed common modules and architectural design choices for backbones not in terms of MACs, but rather in actual throughput and latency, as the combination of the latter two is a better representation of the efficiency of models in real applications. We applied the conclusions taken from that analysis to create a recipe for increasing hardware-efficiency in macro design. Additionally we introduce a simple slimmed-down version of MultiHead Self-Attention, that aligns with our analysis. We combine both macro and micro design to create a new family of hardware-efficient backbone networks called LowFormer. LowFormer achieves a remarkable speedup in terms of throughput and latency, while achieving similar or better accuracy than current state-of-the-art efficient backbones. In order to prove the generalizability of our hardware-efficient design, we evaluate our method on GPU, mobile GPU and ARM CPU. We further show that the downstream tasks object detection and semantic segmentation profit from our hardware-efficient architecture.

- **Summary**: Increased usage of automated tools like deep learning in medical image segmentation has alleviated the bottleneck of manual contouring. This has shifted manual labour to quality assessment (QA) of automated contours which involves detecting errors and correcting them. A potential solution to semi-automated QA is to use deep Bayesian uncertainty to recommend potentially erroneous regions, thus reducing time spent on error detection. Previous work has investigated the correspondence between uncertainty and error, however, no work has been done on improving the "utility" of Bayesian uncertainty maps such that it is only present in inaccurate regions and not in the accurate ones. Our work trains the FlipOut model with the Accuracy-vs-Uncertainty (AvU) loss which promotes uncertainty to be present only in inaccurate regions. We apply this method on datasets of two radiotherapy body sites, c.f. head-and-neck CT and prostate MR scans. Uncertainty heatmaps (i.e. predictive entropy) are evaluated against voxel inaccuracies using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall (PR) curves. Numerical results show that when compared to the Bayesian baseline the proposed method successfully suppresses uncertainty for accurate voxels, with similar presence of uncertainty for inaccurate voxels.

- **Summary**: Digital watermarking has demonstrated its effectiveness in protecting multimedia content. However, existing watermarking are predominantly tailored for specific media types, rendering them less effective for the protection of content displayed on computer screens, which is often multimodal and dynamic. Visual Screen Content (VSC), is particularly susceptible to theft and leakage via screenshots, a vulnerability that current watermarking methods fail to adequately address.To tackle these challenges, we propose ScreenMark, a robust and practical watermarking method designed specifically for arbitrary VSC protection. ScreenMark utilizes a three-stage progressive watermarking framework. Initially, inspired by diffusion principles, we initialize the mutual transformation between regular watermark information and irregular watermark patterns. Subsequently, these patterns are integrated with screen content using a pre-multiplication alpha blending technique, supported by a pre-trained screen decoder for accurate watermark retrieval. The progressively complex distorter enhances the robustness of the watermark in real-world screenshot scenarios. Finally, the model undergoes fine-tuning guided by a joint-level distorter to ensure optimal performance.To validate the effectiveness of ScreenMark, we compiled a dataset comprising 100,000 screenshots from various devices and resolutions. Extensive experiments across different datasets confirm the method's superior robustness, imperceptibility, and practical applicability.

- **Summary**: Due to lack of fully publicly available text-to-video models, current video editing methods tend to build on pre-trained text-to-image generation models, however, they still face grand challenges in dealing with the local editing of video with temporal information. First, although existing methods attempt to focus on local area editing by a pre-defined mask, the preservation of the outside-area background is non-ideal due to the spatially entire generation of each frame. In addition, specially providing a mask by user is an additional costly undertaking, so an autonomous masking strategy integrated into the editing process is desirable. Last but not least, image-level pretrained model hasn't learned temporal information across frames of a video which is vital for expressing the motion and dynamics. In this paper, we propose to adapt a image-level blended latent diffusion model to perform local video editing tasks. Specifically, we leverage DDIM inversion to acquire the latents as background latents instead of the randomly noised ones to better preserve the background information of the input video. We further introduce an autonomous mask manufacture mechanism derived from cross-attention maps in diffusion steps. Finally, we enhance the temporal consistency across video frames by transforming the self-attention blocks of U-Net into temporal-spatial blocks. Through extensive experiments, our proposed approach demonstrates effectiveness in different real-world video editing tasks.

- **Summary**: Recent Vision Transformer (ViT)-based methods for Image Super-Resolution have demonstrated impressive performance. However, they suffer from significant complexity, resulting in high inference times and memory usage. Additionally, ViT models using Window Self-Attention (WSA) face challenges in processing regions outside their windows. To address these issues, we propose the Low-to-high Multi-Level Transformer (LMLT), which employs attention with varying feature sizes for each head. LMLT divides image features along the channel dimension, gradually reduces spatial size for lower heads, and applies self-attention to each head. This approach effectively captures both local and global information. By integrating the results from lower heads into higher heads, LMLT overcomes the window boundary issues in self-attention. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly reduces inference time and GPU memory usage while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art ViT-based Image Super-Resolution methods.

- **Summary**: Due to the increasing workload of pathologists, the need for automation to support diagnostic tasks and quantitative biomarker evaluation is becoming more and more apparent. Foundation models have the potential to improve generalizability within and across centers and serve as starting points for data efficient development of specialized yet robust AI models. However, the training foundation models themselves is usually very expensive in terms of data, computation, and time. This paper proposes a supervised training method that drastically reduces these expenses. The proposed method is based on multi-task learning to train a joint encoder, by combining 16 different classification, segmentation, and detection tasks on a total of 912,000 patches. Since the encoder is capable of capturing the properties of the samples, we term it the Tissue Concepts encoder. To evaluate the performance and generalizability of the Tissue Concepts encoder across centers, classification of whole slide images from four of the most prevalent solid cancers - breast, colon, lung, and prostate - was used. The experiments show that the Tissue Concepts model achieve comparable performance to models trained with self-supervision, while requiring only 6% of the amount of training patches. Furthermore, the Tissue Concepts encoder outperforms an ImageNet pre-trained encoder on both in-domain and out-of-domain data.

- **Summary**: The emergence of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has recently established new baselines in image classification across multiple domains. However, the performance of VLMs in the specific task of artwork classification, particularly art style classification of paintings - a domain traditionally mastered by art historians - has not been explored yet. Artworks pose a unique challenge compared to natural images due to their inherently complex and diverse structures, characterized by variable compositions and styles. Art historians have long studied the unique aspects of artworks, with style prediction being a crucial component of their discipline. This paper investigates whether large VLMs, which integrate visual and textual data, can effectively predict the art historical attributes of paintings. We conduct an in-depth analysis of four VLMs, namely CLIP, LLaVA, OpenFlamingo, and GPT-4o, focusing on zero-shot classification of art style, author and time period using two public benchmarks of artworks. Additionally, we present ArTest, a well-curated test set of artworks, including pivotal paintings studied by art historians.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary segmentation poses significant challenges, as it requires segmenting and recognizing objects across an open set of categories in unconstrained environments. Building on the success of powerful vision-language (ViL) foundation models, such as CLIP, recent efforts sought to harness their zero-short capabilities to recognize unseen categories. Despite notable performance improvements, these models still encounter the critical issue of generating precise mask proposals for unseen categories and scenarios, resulting in inferior segmentation performance eventually. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach, FrozenSeg, designed to integrate spatial knowledge from a localization foundation model (e.g., SAM) and semantic knowledge extracted from a ViL model (e.g., CLIP), in a synergistic framework. Taking the ViL model's visual encoder as the feature backbone, we inject the space-aware feature into the learnable queries and CLIP features within the transformer decoder. In addition, we devise a mask proposal ensemble strategy for further improving the recall rate and mask quality. To fully exploit pre-trained knowledge while minimizing training overhead, we freeze both foundation models, focusing optimization efforts solely on a lightweight transformer decoder for mask proposal generation-the performance bottleneck. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FrozenSeg advances state-of-the-art results across various segmentation benchmarks, trained exclusively on COCO panoptic data, and tested in a zero-shot manner.

- **Summary**: In recent years, facial recognition (FR) models have become the most widely used biometric tool, achieving impressive results on numerous datasets. However, inherent hardware challenges or shooting distances often result in low-resolution images, which significantly impact the performance of FR models. To address this issue, several solutions have been proposed, including super-resolution (SR) models that generate highly realistic faces. Despite these efforts, significant improvements in FR algorithms have not been achieved. We propose a novel SR model FTLGAN, which focuses on generating high-resolution images that preserve individual identities rather than merely improving image quality, thereby maximizing the performance of FR models. The results are compelling, demonstrating a mean value of d' 21% above the best current state-of-the-art models, specifically having a value of d' = 1.099 and AUC = 0.78 for 14x14 pixels, d' = 2.112 and AUC = 0.92 for 28x28 pixels, and d' = 3.049 and AUC = 0.98 for 56x56 pixels. The contributions of this study are significant in several key areas. Firstly, a notable improvement in facial recognition performance has been achieved in low-resolution images, specifically at resolutions of 14x14, 28x28, and 56x56 pixels. Secondly, the enhancements demonstrated by FTLGAN show a consistent response across all resolutions, delivering outstanding performance uniformly, unlike other comparative models. Thirdly, an innovative approach has been implemented using triplet loss logic, enabling the training of the super-resolution model solely with real images, contrasting with current models, and expanding potential real-world applications. Lastly, this study introduces a novel model that specifically addresses the challenge of improving classification performance in facial recognition systems by integrating facial recognition quality as a loss during model training.

- **Summary**: Natural distribution shift causes a deterioration in the perception performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This comprehensive analysis for real-world traffic data addresses: 1) investigating the effect of natural distribution shift and weather augmentations on both detection quality and confidence estimation, 2) evaluating model performance for both classification and object localization, and 3) benchmarking two common uncertainty quantification methods - Ensembles and different variants of Monte-Carlo (MC) Dropout - under natural and close-to-natural distribution shift. For this purpose, a novel dataset has been curated from publicly available autonomous driving datasets. The in-distribution (ID) data is based on cutouts of a single object, for which both class and bounding box annotations are available. The six distribution-shift datasets cover adverse weather scenarios, simulated rain and fog, corner cases, and out-of-distribution data. A granular analysis of CNNs under distribution shift allows to quantize the impact of different types of shifts on both, task performance and confidence estimation: ConvNeXt-Tiny is more robust than EfficientNet-B0; heavy rain degrades classification stronger than localization, contrary to heavy fog; integrating MC-Dropout into selected layers only has the potential to enhance task performance and confidence estimation, whereby the identification of these layers depends on the type of distribution shift and the considered task.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated exceptional generative capabilities across various areas, while they are hindered by slow inference speeds and high computational demands during deployment. The most common way to accelerate DMs involves reducing the number of denoising steps during generation, achieved through faster sampling solvers or knowledge distillation (KD). In contrast to prior approaches, we propose a novel method that transfers the capability of large pretrained DMs to faster architectures. Specifically, we employ KD in a distinct manner to compress DMs by distilling their generative ability into more rapid variants. Furthermore, considering that the source data is either unaccessible or too enormous to store for current generative models, we introduce a new paradigm for their distillation without source data, termed Data-Free Knowledge Distillation for Diffusion Models (DKDM). Generally, our established DKDM framework comprises two main components: 1) a DKDM objective that uses synthetic denoising data produced by pretrained DMs to optimize faster DMs without source data, and 2) a dynamic iterative distillation method that flexibly organizes the synthesis of denoising data, preventing it from slowing down the optimization process as the generation is slow. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at using KD to distill DMs into any architecture in a data-free manner. Importantly, our DKDM is orthogonal to most existing acceleration methods, such as denoising step reduction, quantization and pruning. Experiments show that our DKDM is capable of deriving 2x faster DMs with performance remaining on par with the baseline. Notably, our DKDM enables pretrained DMs to function as "datasets" for training new DMs.

- **Summary**: Object-Centric Learning (OCL) represents dense image or video pixels as sparse object features. Representative methods utilize discrete representation composed of Variational Autoencoder (VAE) template features to suppress pixel-level information redundancy and guide object-level feature aggregation. The most recent advancement, Grouped Discrete Representation (GDR), further decomposes these template features into attributes. However, its naive channel grouping as decomposition may erroneously group channels belonging to different attributes together and discretize them as sub-optimal template attributes, which losses information and harms expressivity. We propose Organized GDR (OGDR) to organize channels belonging to the same attributes together for correct decomposition from features into attributes. In unsupervised segmentation experiments, OGDR is fully superior to GDR in augmentating classical transformer-based OCL methods; it even improves state-of-the-art diffusion-based ones. Codebook PCA and representation similarity analyses show that compared with GDR, our OGDR eliminates redundancy and preserves information better for guiding object representation learning.

- **Summary**: Despite their high accuracy, complex neural networks demand significant computational resources, posing challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones and embedded systems. Compression algorithms have been developed to address these challenges by reducing model size and computational demands while maintaining accuracy. Among these approaches, factorization methods based on tensor decomposition are theoretically sound and effective. However, they face difficulties in selecting the appropriate rank for decomposition. This paper tackles this issue by presenting a unified framework that simultaneously applies decomposition and optimal rank selection, employing a composite compression loss within defined rank constraints. Our approach includes an automatic rank search in a continuous space, efficiently identifying optimal rank configurations without the use of training data, making it computationally efficient. Combined with a subsequent fine-tuning step, our approach maintains the performance of highly compressed models on par with their original counterparts. Using various benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method through a comprehensive analysis.

- **Summary**: For the use of 6D pose estimation in robotic applications, reliable poses are of utmost importance to ensure a safe, reliable and predictable operational performance. Despite these requirements, state-of-the-art 6D pose estimators often do not provide any uncertainty quantification for their pose estimates at all, or if they do, it has been shown that the uncertainty provided is only weakly correlated with the actual true error. To address this issue, we investigate a simple but effective uncertainty quantification, that we call MaskVal, which compares the pose estimates with their corresponding instance segmentations by rendering and does not require any modification of the pose estimator itself. Despite its simplicity, MaskVal significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art ensemble method on both a dataset and a robotic setup. We show that by using MaskVal, the performance of a state-of-the-art 6D pose estimator is significantly improved towards a safe and reliable operation. In addition, we propose a new and specific approach to compare and evaluate uncertainty quantification methods for 6D pose estimation in the context of robotic manipulation.

- **Summary**: In many real-world applications, the frequency distribution of class labels for training data can exhibit a long-tailed distribution, which challenges traditional approaches of training deep neural networks that require heavy amounts of balanced data. Gathering and labeling data to balance out the class label distribution can be both costly and time-consuming. Many existing solutions that enable ensemble learning, re-balancing strategies, or fine-tuning applied to deep neural networks are limited by the inert problem of few class samples across a subset of classes. Recently, vision-language models like CLIP have been observed as effective solutions to zero-shot or few-shot learning by grasping a similarity between vision and language features for image and text pairs. Considering that large pre-trained vision-language models may contain valuable side textual information for minor classes, we propose to leverage text supervision to tackle the challenge of long-tailed learning. Concretely, we propose a novel text-guided mixup technique that takes advantage of the semantic relations between classes recognized by the pre-trained text encoder to help alleviate the long-tailed problem. Our empirical study on benchmark long-tailed tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal with a theoretical guarantee. Our code is available at https://github.com/rsamf/text-guided-mixup.

- **Summary**: Robustness is critical for machine learning (ML) classifiers to ensure consistent performance in real-world applications where models may encounter corrupted or adversarial inputs. In particular, assessing the robustness of classifiers to adversarial inputs is essential to protect systems from vulnerabilities and thus ensure safety in use. However, methods to accurately compute adversarial robustness have been challenging for complex ML models and high-dimensional data. Furthermore, evaluations typically measure adversarial accuracy on specific attack budgets, limiting the informative value of the resulting metrics. This paper investigates the estimation of the more informative adversarial distance using iterative adversarial attacks and a certification approach. Combined, the methods provide a comprehensive evaluation of adversarial robustness by computing estimates for the upper and lower bounds of the adversarial distance. We present visualisations and ablation studies that provide insights into how this evaluation method should be applied and parameterised. We find that our adversarial attack approach is effective compared to related implementations, while the certification method falls short of expectations. The approach in this paper should encourage a more informative way of evaluating the adversarial robustness of ML classifiers.

- **Summary**: A robust face recognition model must be trained using datasets that include a large number of subjects and numerous samples per subject under varying conditions (such as pose, expression, age, noise, and occlusion). Due to ethical and privacy concerns, large-scale real face datasets have been discontinued, such as MS1MV3, and synthetic face generators have been proposed, utilizing GANs and Diffusion Models, such as SYNFace, SFace, DigiFace-1M, IDiff-Face, DCFace, and GANDiffFace, aiming to supply this demand. Some of these methods can produce high-fidelity realistic faces, but with low intra-class variance, while others generate high-variance faces with low identity consistency. In this paper, we propose a Triple Condition Diffusion Model (TCDiff) to improve face style transfer from real to synthetic faces through 2D and 3D facial constraints, enhancing face identity consistency while keeping the necessary high intra-class variance. Face recognition experiments using 1k, 2k, and 5k classes of our new dataset for training outperform state-of-the-art synthetic datasets in real face benchmarks such as LFW, CFP-FP, AgeDB, and BUPT.

- **Summary**: Audio-driven talking face generation aims to synthesize video with lip movements synchronized to input audio. However, current generative techniques face challenges in preserving intricate regional textures (skin, teeth). To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel framework called SegTalker to decouple lip movements and image textures by introducing segmentation as intermediate representation. Specifically, given the mask of image employed by a parsing network, we first leverage the speech to drive the mask and generate talking segmentation. Then we disentangle semantic regions of image into style codes using a mask-guided encoder. Ultimately, we inject the previously generated talking segmentation and style codes into a mask-guided StyleGAN to synthesize video frame. In this way, most of textures are fully preserved. Moreover, our approach can inherently achieve background separation and facilitate mask-guided facial local editing. In particular, by editing the mask and swapping the region textures from a given reference image (e.g. hair, lip, eyebrows), our approach enables facial editing seamlessly when generating talking face video. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach can effectively preserve texture details and generate temporally consistent video while remaining competitive in lip synchronization. Quantitative and qualitative results on the HDTF and MEAD datasets illustrate the superior performance of our method over existing methods.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing the high-fidelity surface from multi-view images, especially sparse images, is a critical and practical task that has attracted widespread attention in recent years. However, existing methods are impeded by the memory constraint or the requirement of ground-truth depths and cannot recover satisfactory geometric details. To this end, we propose SuRF, a new Surface-centric framework that incorporates a new Region sparsification based on a matching Field, achieving good trade-offs between performance, efficiency and scalability. To our knowledge, this is the first unsupervised method achieving end-to-end sparsification powered by the introduced matching field, which leverages the weight distribution to efficiently locate the boundary regions containing surface. Instead of predicting an SDF value for each voxel, we present a new region sparsification approach to sparse the volume by judging whether the voxel is inside the surface region. In this way, our model can exploit higher frequency features around the surface with less memory and computational consumption. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks containing complex large-scale scenes show that our reconstructions exhibit high-quality details and achieve new state-of-the-art performance, i.e., 46% improvements with 80% less memory consumption.

- **Summary**: Formula recognition presents significant challenges due to the complicated structure and varied notation of mathematical expressions. Despite continuous advancements in formula recognition models, the evaluation metrics employed by these models, such as BLEU and Edit Distance, still exhibit notable limitations. They overlook the fact that the same formula has diverse representations and is highly sensitive to the distribution of training data, thereby causing the unfairness in formula recognition evaluation. To this end, we propose a Character Detection Matching (CDM) metric, ensuring the evaluation objectivity by designing a image-level rather than LaTex-level metric score. Specifically, CDM renders both the model-predicted LaTeX and the ground-truth LaTeX formulas into image-formatted formulas, then employs visual feature extraction and localization techniques for precise character-level matching, incorporating spatial position information. Such a spatially-aware and character-matching method offers a more accurate and equitable evaluation compared with previous BLEU and Edit Distance metrics that rely solely on text-based character matching. Experimentally, we evaluated various formula recognition models using CDM, BLEU, and ExpRate metrics. Their results demonstrate that the CDM aligns more closely with human evaluation standards and provides a fairer comparison across different models by eliminating discrepancies caused by diverse formula representations.

- **Summary**: In recent years, diffusion models have revolutionized visual generation, outperforming traditional frameworks like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, generating images of humans with realistic semantic parts, such as hands and faces, remains a significant challenge due to their intricate structural complexity. To address this issue, we propose a novel post-processing solution named RealisHuman. The RealisHuman framework operates in two stages. First, it generates realistic human parts, such as hands or faces, using the original malformed parts as references, ensuring consistent details with the original image. Second, it seamlessly integrates the rectified human parts back into their corresponding positions by repainting the surrounding areas to ensure smooth and realistic blending. The RealisHuman framework significantly enhances the realism of human generation, as demonstrated by notable improvements in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.

- **Summary**: Large-scale visuomotor policy learning is a promising approach toward developing generalizable manipulation systems. Yet, policies that can be deployed on diverse embodiments, environments, and observational modalities remain elusive. In this work, we investigate how knowledge from large-scale visual data of the world may be used to address one axis of variation for generalizable manipulation: observational viewpoint. Specifically, we study single-image novel view synthesis models, which learn 3D-aware scene-level priors by rendering images of the same scene from alternate camera viewpoints given a single input image. For practical application to diverse robotic data, these models must operate zero-shot, performing view synthesis on unseen tasks and environments. We empirically analyze view synthesis models within a simple data-augmentation scheme that we call View Synthesis Augmentation (VISTA) to understand their capabilities for learning viewpoint-invariant policies from single-viewpoint demonstration data. Upon evaluating the robustness of policies trained with our method to out-of-distribution camera viewpoints, we find that they outperform baselines in both simulated and real-world manipulation tasks.

- **Summary**: Generating high-quality 3D objects from textual descriptions remains a challenging problem due to computational cost, the scarcity of 3D data, and complex 3D representations. We introduce Geometry Image Diffusion (GIMDiffusion), a novel Text-to-3D model that utilizes geometry images to efficiently represent 3D shapes using 2D images, thereby avoiding the need for complex 3D-aware architectures. By integrating a Collaborative Control mechanism, we exploit the rich 2D priors of existing Text-to-Image models such as Stable Diffusion. This enables strong generalization even with limited 3D training data (allowing us to use only high-quality training data) as well as retaining compatibility with guidance techniques such as IPAdapter. In short, GIMDiffusion enables the generation of 3D assets at speeds comparable to current Text-to-Image models. The generated objects consist of semantically meaningful, separate parts and include internal structures, enhancing both usability and versatility.

- **Summary**: Subject-driven text-to-image generation has witnessed remarkable advancements in its ability to learn and capture characteristics of a subject using only a limited number of images. However, existing methods commonly rely on high-quality images for training and may struggle to generate reasonable images when the input images are blemished by artifacts. This is primarily attributed to the inadequate capability of current techniques in distinguishing subject-related features from disruptive artifacts. In this paper, we introduce ArtiFade to tackle this issue and successfully generate high-quality artifact-free images from blemished datasets. Specifically, ArtiFade exploits fine-tuning of a pre-trained text-to-image model, aiming to remove artifacts. The elimination of artifacts is achieved by utilizing a specialized dataset that encompasses both unblemished images and their corresponding blemished counterparts during fine-tuning. ArtiFade also ensures the preservation of the original generative capabilities inherent within the diffusion model, thereby enhancing the overall performance of subject-driven methods in generating high-quality and artifact-free images. We further devise evaluation benchmarks tailored for this task. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate the generalizability of ArtiFade in effective artifact removal under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Their ability to generalize to new tasks and datasets without retraining or needing an abundance of data makes them an appealing candidate for applications on specialist datasets. In this work, we compare the performance of FMs to finetuned pre-trained supervised models in the task of semantic segmentation on an entirely new dataset. We see that finetuned models consistently outperform the FMs tested, even in cases were data is scarce. We release the code and dataset for this work on GitHub.

- **Summary**: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have shown remarkable performance in visual synthesis but are computationally expensive due to the need for multiple evaluations during the sampling. Recent predictor-corrector diffusion samplers have significantly reduced the required number of function evaluations (NFE), but inherently suffer from a misalignment issue caused by the extra corrector step, especially with a large classifier-free guidance scale (CFG). In this paper, we introduce a new fast DPM sampler called DC-Solver, which leverages dynamic compensation (DC) to mitigate the misalignment of the predictor-corrector samplers. The dynamic compensation is controlled by compensation ratios that are adaptive to the sampling steps and can be optimized on only 10 datapoints by pushing the sampling trajectory toward a ground truth trajectory. We further propose a cascade polynomial regression (CPR) which can instantly predict the compensation ratios on unseen sampling configurations. Additionally, we find that the proposed dynamic compensation can also serve as a plug-and-play module to boost the performance of predictor-only samplers. Extensive experiments on both unconditional sampling and conditional sampling demonstrate that our DC-Solver can consistently improve the sampling quality over previous methods on different DPMs with a wide range of resolutions up to 1024$\times$1024. Notably, we achieve 10.38 FID (NFE=5) on unconditional FFHQ and 0.394 MSE (NFE=5, CFG=7.5) on Stable-Diffusion-2.1. Code is available at https://github.com/wl-zhao/DC-Solver

- **Summary**: Complex 3D scene understanding has gained increasing attention, with scene encoding strategies playing a crucial role in this success. However, the optimal scene encoding strategies for various scenarios remain unclear, particularly compared to their image-based counterparts. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive study that probes various visual encoding models for 3D scene understanding, identifying the strengths and limitations of each model across different scenarios. Our evaluation spans seven vision foundation encoders, including image-based, video-based, and 3D foundation models. We evaluate these models in four tasks: Vision-Language Scene Reasoning, Visual Grounding, Segmentation, and Registration, each focusing on different aspects of scene understanding. Our evaluations yield key findings: DINOv2 demonstrates superior performance, video models excel in object-level tasks, diffusion models benefit geometric tasks, and language-pretrained models show unexpected limitations in language-related tasks. These insights challenge some conventional understandings, provide novel perspectives on leveraging visual foundation models, and highlight the need for more flexible encoder selection in future vision-language and scene-understanding tasks.

- **Summary**: Integrating image and text data through multi-modal learning has emerged as a new approach in medical imaging research, following its successful deployment in computer vision. While considerable efforts have been dedicated to establishing medical foundation models and their zero-shot transfer to downstream tasks, the popular few-shot setting remains relatively unexplored. Following on from the currently strong emergence of this setting in computer vision, we introduce the first structured benchmark for adapting medical vision-language models (VLMs) in a strict few-shot regime and investigate various adaptation strategies commonly used in the context of natural images. Furthermore, we evaluate a simple generalization of the linear-probe adaptation baseline, which seeks an optimal blending of the visual prototypes and text embeddings via learnable class-wise multipliers. Surprisingly, such a text-informed linear probe yields competitive performances in comparison to convoluted prompt-learning and adapter-based strategies, while running considerably faster and accommodating the black-box setting. Our extensive experiments span three different medical modalities and specialized foundation models, nine downstream tasks, and several state-of-the-art few-shot adaptation methods. We made our benchmark and code publicly available to trigger further developments in this emergent subject: \url{https://github.com/FereshteShakeri/few-shot-MedVLMs}.

- **Summary**: Ground-roll wave is a common coherent noise in land field seismic data. This Rayleigh-type surface wave usually has low frequency, low apparent velocity, and high amplitude, therefore obscures the reflection events of seismic shot gathers. Commonly used techniques focus on the differences of ground-roll and reflection in transformed domain such as $f-k$ domain, wavelet domain, or curvelet domain. These approaches use a series of fixed atoms or bases to transform the data in time-space domain into transformed domain to separate different waveforms, thus tend to suffer from the complexity for a delicate design of the parameters of the transform domain filter. To deal with these problems, a novel way is proposed to separate ground-roll from reflections using convolutional neural network (CNN) model based method to learn to extract the features of ground-roll and reflections automatically based on training data. In the proposed method, low-pass filtered seismic data which is contaminated by ground-roll wave is used as input of CNN, and then outputs both ground-roll component and low-frequency part of reflection component simultaneously. Discriminative loss is applied together with similarity loss in the training process to enhance the similarity to their train labels as well as the difference between the two outputs. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real data, showing that CNN based method can separate ground roll from reflections effectively, and has generalization ability to a certain extent.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the development of deep learning approaches for the task of person re-identification led to impressive results. However, this comes with a limitation for industrial and practical real-world applications. Firstly, most of the existing works operate on closed-world scenarios, in which the people to re-identify (probes) are compared to a closed-set (gallery). Real-world scenarios often are open-set problems in which the gallery is not known a priori, but the number of open-set approaches in the literature is significantly lower. Secondly, challenges such as multi-camera setups, occlusions, real-time requirements, etc., further constrain the applicability of off-the-shelf methods. This work presents MICRO-TRACK, a Modular Industrial multi-Camera Re_identification and Open-set Tracking system that is real-time, scalable, and easy to integrate into existing industrial surveillance scenarios. Furthermore, we release a novel Re-ID and tracking dataset acquired in an industrial manufacturing facility, dubbed Facility-ReID, consisting of 18-minute videos captured by 8 surveillance cameras.

- **Summary**: In this study we provide empirical evidence demonstrating that the quality of training data impacts model performance in Human Pose Estimation (HPE). Inaccurate labels in widely used data sets, ranging from minor errors to severe mislabeling, can negatively influence learning and distort performance metrics. We perform an in-depth analysis of popular HPE data sets to show the extent and nature of label inaccuracies. Our findings suggest that accounting for the impact of faulty labels will facilitate the development of more robust and accurate HPE models for a variety of real-world applications. We show improved performance with cleansed data.

- **Summary**: Surface-based analysis of the cerebral cortex is ubiquitous in human neuroimaging with MRI. It is crucial for cortical registration, parcellation, and thickness estimation. Traditionally, these analyses require high-resolution, isotropic scans with good gray-white matter contrast, typically a 1mm T1-weighted scan. This excludes most clinical MRI scans, which are often anisotropic and lack the necessary T1 contrast. To enable large-scale neuroimaging studies using vast clinical data, we introduce recon-all-clinical, a novel method for cortical reconstruction, registration, parcellation, and thickness estimation in brain MRI scans of any resolution and contrast. Our approach employs a hybrid analysis method that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with domain randomization to predict signed distance functions (SDFs) and classical geometry processing for accurate surface placement while maintaining topological and geometric constraints. The method does not require retraining for different acquisitions, thus simplifying the analysis of heterogeneous clinical datasets. We tested recon-all-clinical on multiple datasets, including over 19,000 clinical scans. The method consistently produced precise cortical reconstructions and high parcellation accuracy across varied MRI contrasts and resolutions. Cortical thickness estimates are precise enough to capture aging effects independently of MRI contrast, although accuracy varies with slice thickness. Our method is publicly available at https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/recon-all-clinical, enabling researchers to perform detailed cortical analysis on the huge amounts of already existing clinical MRI scans. This advancement may be particularly valuable for studying rare diseases and underrepresented populations where research-grade MRI data is scarce.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a novel Multiscale Video Transformer Network (MVTN) for dynamic hand gesture recognition, since multiscale features can extract features with variable size, pose, and shape of hand which is a challenge in hand gesture recognition. The proposed model incorporates a multiscale feature hierarchy to capture diverse levels of detail and context within hand gestures which enhances the model's ability. This multiscale hierarchy is obtained by extracting different dimensions of attention in different transformer stages with initial stages to model high-resolution features and later stages to model low-resolution features. Our approach also leverages multimodal data, utilizing depth maps, infrared data, and surface normals along with RGB images from NVGesture and Briareo datasets. Experiments show that the proposed MVTN achieves state-of-the-art results with less computational complexity and parameters. The source code is available at https://github.com/mallikagarg/MVTN.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing image classification is a critical component of Earth observation (EO) systems, traditionally dominated by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other deep learning techniques. However, the advent of Transformer-based architectures and large-scale pre-trained models has significantly shifted, offering enhanced performance and efficiency. This study focuses on identifying the most effective pre-trained model for land use classification in onboard satellite processing, emphasizing achieving high accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness against noisy data conditions commonly encountered during satellite-based inference. Through extensive experimentation, we compared traditional CNN-based models, ResNet-based models, and various pre-trained vision Transformer models. Our findings demonstrate that pre-trained Transformer models, particularly MobileViTV2 and EfficientViT-M2, outperform models trained from scratch in accuracy and efficiency. These models achieve high performance with reduced computational requirements and exhibit greater resilience during inference under noisy conditions. While MobileViTV2 excelled on clean validation data, EfficientViT-M2 proved more robust when handling noise, making it the most suitable model for onboard satellite Earth observation tasks. In conclusion, EfficientViT-M2 is the optimal choice for reliable and efficient remote sensing image classification in satellite operations, achieving 98.76\% accuracy, precision, and recall. Specifically, EfficientViT-M2 delivered the highest performance across all metrics, excelled in training efficiency (1,000s) and inference time (10s), and demonstrated greater robustness (overall robustness score at 0.79).

- **Summary**: The use of image analysis in automated photography management is an increasing trend in heritage institutions. Such tools alleviate the human cost associated with the manual and expensive annotation of new data sources while facilitating fast access to the citizenship through online indexes and search engines. However, available tagging and description tools are usually designed around modern photographs in English, neglecting historical corpora in minoritized languages, each of which exhibits intrinsic particularities. The primary objective of this research is to study the quantitative contribution of generative systems in the description of historical sources. This is done by contextualizing the task of captioning historical photographs from the Catalan archives as a case study. Our findings provide practitioners with tools and directions on transfer learning for captioning models based on visual adaptation and linguistic proximity.

- **Summary**: While deep learning techniques have proven successful in image-related tasks, the exponentially increased data storage and computation costs become a significant challenge. Dataset distillation addresses these challenges by synthesizing only a few images for each class that encapsulate all essential information. Most current methods focus on matching. The problems lie in the synthetic images not being human-readable and the dataset performance being insufficient for downstream learning tasks. Moreover, the distillation time can quickly get out of bounds when the number of synthetic images per class increases even slightly. To address this, we train a class conditional latent diffusion model capable of generating realistic synthetic images with labels. The sampling time can be reduced to several tens of images per seconds. We demonstrate that models can be effectively trained using only a small set of synthetic images and evaluated on a large real test set. Our approach achieved rank \(1\) in The First Dataset Distillation Challenge at ECCV 2024 on the CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a method for unsupervised whole-image clustering of a target dataset of remote sensing scenes with no labels. The method consists of three main steps: (1) finetuning a pretrained deep neural network (DINOv2) on a labelled source remote sensing imagery dataset and using it to extract a feature vector from each image in the target dataset, (2) reducing the dimension of these deep features via manifold projection into a low-dimensional Euclidean space, and (3) clustering the embedded features using a Bayesian nonparametric technique to infer the number and membership of clusters simultaneously. The method takes advantage of heterogeneous transfer learning to cluster unseen data with different feature and label distributions. We demonstrate the performance of this approach outperforming state-of-the-art zero-shot classification methods on several remote sensing scene classification datasets.

- **Summary**: Generating realistic human motion is essential for many computer vision and graphics applications. The wide variety of human body shapes and sizes greatly impacts how people move. However, most existing motion models ignore these differences, relying on a standardized, average body. This leads to uniform motion across different body types, where movements don't match their physical characteristics, limiting diversity. To solve this, we introduce a new approach to develop a generative motion model based on body shape. We show that it's possible to train this model using unpaired data by applying cycle consistency, intuitive physics, and stability constraints, which capture the relationship between identity and movement. The resulting model generates diverse, physically plausible, and dynamically stable human motions that are both quantitatively and qualitatively more realistic than current state-of-the-art methods. More details are available on our project page https://CarstenEpic.github.io/humos/.

- **Summary**: We present TropNNC, a structured pruning framework for compressing neural networks with linear and convolutional layers and ReLU activations. Our approximation is based on a geometrical approach to machine/deep learning, using tropical geometry and extending the work of Misiakos et al. (2022). We use the Hausdorff distance of zonotopes in its standard continuous form to achieve a tighter approximation bound for tropical polynomials compared to Misiakos et al. (2022). This enhancement allows for superior functional approximations of neural networks, leading to a more effective compression algorithm. Our method is significantly easier to implement compared to other frameworks, and does not depend on the availability of training data samples. We validate our framework through extensive empirical evaluations on the MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet datasets. Our results demonstrate that TropNNC achieves performance on par with the state-of-the-art method ThiNet, even surpassing it in compressing linear layers, and to the best of our knowledge, it is the first method that achieves this using tropical geometry.
