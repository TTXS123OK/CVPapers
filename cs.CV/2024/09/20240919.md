- **Summary**: Visual signals can enhance audiovisual speech recognition accuracy by providing additional contextual information. Given the complexity of visual signals, an audiovisual speech recognition model requires robust generalization capabilities across diverse video scenarios, presenting a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce EVA, leveraging the mixture-of-Experts for audioVisual ASR to perform robust speech recognition for ``in-the-wild'' videos. Specifically, we first encode visual information into visual tokens sequence and map them into speech space by a lightweight projection. Then, we build EVA upon a robust pretrained speech recognition model, ensuring its generalization ability. Moreover, to incorporate visual information effectively, we inject visual information into the ASR model through a mixture-of-experts module. Experiments show our model achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks, which demonstrates the generalization ability of EVA across diverse video domains.

- **Summary**: We propose FD3, a fundus image enhancement method based on direct diffusion bridges, which can cope with a wide range of complex degradations, including haze, blur, noise, and shadow. We first propose a synthetic forward model through a human feedback loop with board-certified ophthalmologists for maximal quality improvement of low-quality in-vivo images. Using the proposed forward model, we train a robust and flexible diffusion-based image enhancement network that is highly effective as a stand-alone method, unlike previous diffusion model-based approaches which act only as a refiner on top of pre-trained models. Through extensive experiments, we show that FD3 establishes \add{superior quality} not only on synthetic degradations but also on in vivo studies with low-quality fundus photos taken from patients with cataracts or small pupils. To promote further research in this area, we open-source all our code and data used for this research at https://github.com/heeheee888/FD3

- **Summary**: Adversarial attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a model's decision boundaries through small, carefully crafted perturbations that lead to significant mispredictions. In 3D vision, the high dimensionality and sparsity of data greatly expand the attack surface, making 3D vision particularly vulnerable for safety-critical robotics. To enhance 3D vision's adversarial robustness, we propose a training objective that simultaneously minimizes prediction loss and mutual information (MI) under adversarial perturbations to contain the upper bound of misprediction errors. This approach simplifies handling adversarial examples compared to conventional methods, which require explicit searching and training on adversarial samples. However, minimizing prediction loss conflicts with minimizing MI, leading to reduced robustness and catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we integrate curriculum advisors in the training setup that gradually introduce adversarial objectives to balance training and prevent models from being overwhelmed by difficult cases early in the process. The advisors also enhance robustness by encouraging training on diverse MI examples through entropy regularizers. We evaluated our method on ModelNet40 and KITTI using PointNet, DGCNN, SECOND, and PointTransformers, achieving 2-5% accuracy gains on ModelNet40 and a 5-10% mAP improvement in object detection. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/nstrndrbi/Mine-N-Learn.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models can achieve high inference accuracy by extracting rich knowledge from massive well-annotated data, but may pose the risk of data privacy leakage in practical deployment. In this paper, we present an effective teacher-student learning approach to train privacy-preserving deep learning models via differentially private data-free distillation. The main idea is generating synthetic data to learn a student that can mimic the ability of a teacher well-trained on private data. In the approach, a generator is first pretrained in a data-free manner by incorporating the teacher as a fixed discriminator. With the generator, massive synthetic data can be generated for model training without exposing data privacy. Then, the synthetic data is fed into the teacher to generate private labels. Towards this end, we propose a label differential privacy algorithm termed selective randomized response to protect the label information. Finally, a student is trained on the synthetic data with the supervision of private labels. In this way, both data privacy and label privacy are well protected in a unified framework, leading to privacy-preserving models. Extensive experiments and analysis clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: Many real-world applications today like video surveillance and urban governance need to address the recognition of masked faces, where content replacement by diverse masks often brings in incomplete appearance and ambiguous representation, leading to a sharp drop in accuracy. Inspired by recent progress on amodal perception, we propose to migrate the mechanism of amodal completion for the task of masked face recognition with an end-to-end de-occlusion distillation framework, which consists of two modules. The \textit{de-occlusion} module applies a generative adversarial network to perform face completion, which recovers the content under the mask and eliminates appearance ambiguity. The \textit{distillation} module takes a pre-trained general face recognition model as the teacher and transfers its knowledge to train a student for completed faces using massive online synthesized face pairs. Especially, the teacher knowledge is represented with structural relations among instances in multiple orders, which serves as a posterior regularization to enable the adaptation. In this way, the knowledge can be fully distilled and transferred to identify masked faces. Experiments on synthetic and realistic datasets show the efficacy of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: The efficacy of deep learning-based Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) methods for skin diseases relies on analyzing multiple data modalities (i.e., clinical+dermoscopic images, and patient metadata) and addressing the challenges of multi-label classification. Current approaches tend to rely on limited multi-modal techniques and treat the multi-label problem as a multiple multi-class problem, overlooking issues related to imbalanced learning and multi-label correlation. This paper introduces the innovative Skin Lesion Classifier, utilizing a Multi-modal Multi-label TransFormer-based model (SkinM2Former). For multi-modal analysis, we introduce the Tri-Modal Cross-attention Transformer (TMCT) that fuses the three image and metadata modalities at various feature levels of a transformer encoder. For multi-label classification, we introduce a multi-head attention (MHA) module to learn multi-label correlations, complemented by an optimisation that handles multi-label and imbalanced learning problems. SkinM2Former achieves a mean average accuracy of 77.27% and a mean diagnostic accuracy of 77.85% on the public Derm7pt dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

- **Summary**: Physical adversarial patches have emerged as a key adversarial attack to cause misclassification of traffic sign recognition (TSR) systems in the real world. However, existing adversarial patches have poor stealthiness and attack all vehicles indiscriminately once deployed. In this paper, we introduce an invisible and triggered physical adversarial patch (ITPatch) with a novel attack vector, i.e., fluorescent ink, to advance the state-of-the-art. It applies carefully designed fluorescent perturbations to a target sign, an attacker can later trigger a fluorescent effect using invisible ultraviolet light, causing the TSR system to misclassify the sign and potentially resulting in traffic accidents. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation to investigate the effectiveness of ITPatch, which shows a success rate of 98.31% in low-light conditions. Furthermore, our attack successfully bypasses five popular defenses and achieves a success rate of 96.72%.

- **Summary**: Unpaired image-to-image translation is a challenging task due to the absence of paired examples, which complicates learning the complex mappings between the distinct distributions of the source and target domains. One of the most commonly used approach for this task is CycleGAN which requires the training of a new pair of generator-discriminator networks for each domain pair. In this paper, we propose a new image-to-image translation framework named Image-to-Image-Generative-Adversarial-CLIP (I2I-Galip) where we utilize a pre-trained multi-model foundation model (i.e., CLIP) to mitigate the need of separate generator-discriminator pairs for each source-target mapping while achieving better and more efficient multi-domain translation. By utilizing the massive knowledge gathered during pre-training a foundation model, our approach makes use of a single lightweight generator network with ~13M parameters for the multi-domain image translation task. Comprehensive experiments on translation performance in public MRI and CT datasets show the superior performance of the proposed framework over the existing approaches. Code will be available (https://github.com/yilmazkorkmaz1/I2I-Galip).

- **Summary**: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is one of the most important medical imaging modalities as it provides superior resolution of soft tissues, albeit with a notable limitation in scanning speed. The advent of deep learning has catalyzed the development of cutting-edge methods for the expedited reconstruction of MRI scans, utilizing convolutional neural networks and, more recently, vision transformers. Recently proposed structured state space models (e.g., Mamba) have gained some traction due to their efficiency and low computational requirements compared to transformer models. We propose an innovative MRI reconstruction framework that employs structured state space models at its core, aimed at amplifying both long-range contextual sensitivity and reconstruction efficacy. Comprehensive experiments on public brain MRI datasets show that our model sets new benchmarks beating state-of-the-art reconstruction baselines. Code will be available (https://github.com/yilmazkorkmaz1/MambaRecon).

- **Summary**: In autonomous driving, High Definition (HD) maps provide a complete lane model that is not limited by sensor range and occlusions. However, the generation and upkeep of HD maps involves periodic data collection and human annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we investigate automating the lane model generation and the use of sparse vehicle observations instead of dense sensor measurements. For our approach, a pre-processing step generates polylines by aligning and aggregating observed lane boundaries. Aligned driven traces are used as starting points for predicting lane pairs defined by the left and right boundary points. We propose Lane Model Transformer Network (LMT-Net), an encoder-decoder neural network architecture that performs polyline encoding and predicts lane pairs and their connectivity. A lane graph is formed by using predicted lane pairs as nodes and predicted lane connectivity as edges. We evaluate the performance of LMT-Net on an internal dataset that consists of multiple vehicle observations as well as human annotations as Ground Truth (GT). The evaluation shows promising results and demonstrates superior performance compared to the implemented baseline on both highway and non-highway Operational Design Domain (ODD).

- **Summary**: On-road air pollution exhibits substantial variability over short distances due to emission sources, dilution, and physicochemical processes. Integrating mobile monitoring data with street view images (SVIs) holds promise for predicting local air pollution. However, algorithms, sampling strategies, and image quality introduce extra errors due to a lack of reliable references that quantify their effects. To bridge this gap, we employed 314 taxis to monitor NO, NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 dynamically and sampled corresponding SVIs, aiming to develop a reliable strategy. We extracted SVI features from ~ 382,000 streetscape images, which were collected at various angles (0{\deg}, 90{\deg}, 180{\deg}, 270{\deg}) and ranges (buffers with radii of 100m, 200m, 300m, 400m, 500m). Also, three machine learning algorithms alongside the linear land-used regression (LUR) model were experimented with to explore the influences of different algorithms. Four typical image quality issues were identified and discussed. Generally, machine learning methods outperform linear LUR for estimating the four pollutants, with the ranking: random forest > XGBoost > neural network > LUR. Compared to single-angle sampling, the averaging strategy is an effective method to avoid bias of insufficient feature capture. Therefore, the optimal sampling strategy is to obtain SVIs at a 100m radius buffer and extract features using the averaging strategy. This approach achieved estimation results for each aggregation location with absolute errors almost less than 2.5 {\mu}g/m^2 or ppb. Overexposure, blur, and underexposure led to image misjudgments and incorrect identifications, causing an overestimation of road features and underestimation of human-activity features, contributing to inaccurate NO, NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 estimation.

- **Summary**: This manuscript presents an image segmentation algorithm developed for the Cross-Organ and Cross-Scanner Adenocarcinoma Segmentation (COSAS 2024) challenge. We adopted an organ-stratified and scanner-stratified approach to train multiple Upernet-based segmentation models and subsequently ensembled the results. Despite the challenges posed by the varying tumor characteristics across different organs and the differing imaging conditions of various scanners, our method achieved a final test score of 0.7643 for Task 1 and 0.8354 for Task 2. These results demonstrate the adaptability and efficacy of our approach across diverse conditions. Our model's ability to generalize across various datasets underscores its potential for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to segment camouflaged objects which exhibit very similar patterns with the surrounding environment. Recent research works have shown that enhancing the feature representation via the frequency information can greatly alleviate the ambiguity problem between the foreground objects and the background.With the emergence of vision foundation models, like InternImage, Segment Anything Model etc, adapting the pretrained model on COD tasks with a lightweight adapter module shows a novel and promising research direction. Existing adapter modules mainly care about the feature adaptation in the spatial domain. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency-guided spatial adaptation method for COD task. Specifically, we transform the input features of the adapter into frequency domain. By grouping and interacting with frequency components located within non overlapping circles in the spectrogram, different frequency components are dynamically enhanced or weakened, making the intensity of image details and contour features adaptively adjusted. At the same time, the features that are conducive to distinguishing object and background are highlighted, indirectly implying the position and shape of camouflaged object. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely adopted benchmark datasets and the proposed method outperforms 26 state-of-the-art methods with large margins. Code will be released.

- **Summary**: Recent texture generation methods achieve impressive results due to the powerful generative prior they leverage from large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. However, abstract textual prompts are limited in providing global textural or shape information, which results in the texture generation methods producing blurry or inconsistent patterns. To tackle this, we present FlexiTex, embedding rich information via visual guidance to generate a high-quality texture. The core of FlexiTex is the Visual Guidance Enhancement module, which incorporates more specific information from visual guidance to reduce ambiguity in the text prompt and preserve high-frequency details. To further enhance the visual guidance, we introduce a Direction-Aware Adaptation module that automatically designs direction prompts based on different camera poses, avoiding the Janus problem and maintaining semantically global consistency. Benefiting from the visual guidance, FlexiTex produces quantitatively and qualitatively sound results, demonstrating its potential to advance texture generation for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Multi-frame infrared small target (MIRST) detection in satellite videos is a long-standing, fundamental yet challenging task for decades, and the challenges can be summarized as: First, extremely small target size, highly complex clutters & noises, various satellite motions result in limited feature representation, high false alarms, and difficult motion analyses. Second, the lack of large-scale public available MIRST dataset in satellite videos greatly hinders the algorithm development. To address the aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we first build a large-scale dataset for MIRST detection in satellite videos (namely IRSatVideo-LEO), and then develop a recurrent feature refinement (RFR) framework as the baseline method. Specifically, IRSatVideo-LEO is a semi-simulated dataset with synthesized satellite motion, target appearance, trajectory and intensity, which can provide a standard toolbox for satellite video generation and a reliable evaluation platform to facilitate the algorithm development. For baseline method, RFR is proposed to be equipped with existing powerful CNN-based methods for long-term temporal dependency exploitation and integrated motion compensation & MIRST detection. Specifically, a pyramid deformable alignment (PDA) module and a temporal-spatial-frequency modulation (TSFM) module are proposed to achieve effective and efficient feature alignment, propagation, aggregation and refinement. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our scheme. The comparative results show that ResUNet equipped with RFR outperforms the state-of-the-art MIRST detection methods. Dataset and code are released at https://github.com/XinyiYing/RFR.

- **Summary**: Frequent monitoring is necessary to stratify individuals based on their likelihood of developing gastrointestinal (GI) cancer precursors. In clinical practice, white-light imaging (WLI) and complementary modalities such as narrow-band imaging (NBI) and fluorescence imaging are used to assess risk areas. However, conventional deep learning (DL) models show degraded performance due to the domain gap when a model is trained on one modality and tested on a different one. In our earlier approach, we used a superpixel-based method referred to as "SUPRA" to effectively learn domain-invariant information using color and space distances to generate groups of pixels. One of the main limitations of this earlier work is that the aggregation does not exploit structural information, making it suboptimal for segmentation tasks, especially for polyps and heterogeneous color distributions. Therefore, in this work, we propose an approach for style-content disentanglement using instance normalization and instance selective whitening (ISW) for improved domain generalization when combined with SUPRA. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: EndoUDA Barrett's Esophagus and EndoUDA polyps, and compare its performance with three state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our findings demonstrate a notable enhancement in performance compared to both baseline and SOTA methods across the target domain data. Specifically, our approach exhibited improvements of 14%, 10%, 8%, and 18% over the baseline and three SOTA methods on the polyp dataset. Additionally, it surpassed the second-best method (EndoUDA) on the Barrett's Esophagus dataset by nearly 2%.

- **Summary**: Human motion prediction is a cornerstone of human-robot collaboration (HRC), as robots need to infer the future movements of human workers based on past motion cues to proactively plan their motion, ensuring safety in close collaboration scenarios. The diffusion model has demonstrated remarkable performance in predicting high-quality motion samples with reasonable diversity, but suffers from a slow generative process which necessitates multiple model evaluations, hindering real-world applications. To enable real-time prediction, in this work, we propose training a one-step multi-layer perceptron-based (MLP-based) diffusion model for motion prediction using knowledge distillation and Bayesian optimization. Our method contains two steps. First, we distill a pretrained diffusion-based motion predictor, TransFusion, directly into a one-step diffusion model with the same denoiser architecture. Then, to further reduce the inference time, we remove the computationally expensive components from the original denoiser and use knowledge distillation once again to distill the obtained one-step diffusion model into an even smaller model based solely on MLPs. Bayesian optimization is used to tune the hyperparameters for training the smaller diffusion model. Extensive experimental studies are conducted on benchmark datasets, and our model can significantly improve the inference speed, achieving real-time prediction without noticeable degradation in performance.

- **Summary**: Surgical phase recognition is critical for assisting surgeons in understanding surgical videos. Existing studies focused more on online surgical phase recognition, by leveraging preceding frames to predict the current frame. Despite great progress, they formulated the task as a series of frame-wise classification, which resulted in a lack of global context of the entire procedure and incoherent predictions. Moreover, besides online analysis, accurate offline surgical phase recognition is also in significant clinical need for retrospective analysis, and existing online algorithms do not fully analyze the entire video, thereby limiting accuracy in offline analysis. To overcome these challenges and enhance both online and offline inference capabilities, we propose a universal Surgical Phase Localization Network, named SurgPLAN++, with the principle of temporal detection. To ensure a global understanding of the surgical procedure, we devise a phase localization strategy for SurgPLAN++ to predict phase segments across the entire video through phase proposals. For online analysis, to generate high-quality phase proposals, SurgPLAN++ incorporates a data augmentation strategy to extend the streaming video into a pseudo-complete video through mirroring, center-duplication, and down-sampling. For offline analysis, SurgPLAN++ capitalizes on its global phase prediction framework to continuously refine preceding predictions during each online inference step, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of phase recognition. We perform extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness, and our SurgPLAN++ achieves remarkable performance in both online and offline modes, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral image (HSI) plays a vital role in various fields such as agriculture and environmental monitoring. However, due to the expensive acquisition cost, the number of hyperspectral images is limited, degenerating the performance of downstream tasks. Although some recent studies have attempted to employ diffusion models to synthesize HSIs, they still struggle with the scarcity of HSIs, affecting the reliability and diversity of the generated images. Some studies propose to incorporate multi-modal data to enhance spatial diversity, but the spectral fidelity cannot be ensured. In addition, existing HSI synthesis models are typically uncontrollable or only support single-condition control, limiting their ability to generate accurate and reliable HSIs. To alleviate these issues, we propose HSIGene, a novel HSI generation foundation model which is based on latent diffusion and supports multi-condition control, allowing for more precise and reliable HSI generation. To enhance the spatial diversity of the training data while preserving spectral fidelity, we propose a new data augmentation method based on spatial super-resolution, in which HSIs are upscaled first, and thus abundant training patches could be obtained by cropping the high-resolution HSIs. In addition, to improve the perceptual quality of the augmented data, we introduce a novel two-stage HSI super-resolution framework, which first applies RGB bands super-resolution and then utilizes our proposed Rectangular Guided Attention Network (RGAN) for guided HSI super-resolution. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is capable of generating a vast quantity of realistic HSIs for downstream tasks such as denoising and super-resolution.

- **Summary**: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial for trustworthy AI in real-world applications. Leveraging recent advances in representation learning and latent embeddings, Various scoring algorithms estimate distributions beyond the training data. However, a single embedding space falls short in characterizing in-distribution data and defending against diverse OOD conditions. This paper introduces a novel Multi-Manifold Embedding Learning (MMEL) framework, optimizing hypersphere and hyperbolic spaces jointly for enhanced OOD detection. MMEL generates representative embeddings and employs a prototype-aware scoring function to differentiate OOD samples. It operates with very few OOD samples and requires no model retraining. Experiments on six open datasets demonstrate MMEL's significant reduction in FPR while maintaining a high AUC compared to state-of-the-art distance-based OOD detection methods. We analyze the effects of learning multiple manifolds and visualize OOD score distributions across datasets. Notably, enrolling ten OOD samples without retraining achieves comparable FPR and AUC to modern outlier exposure methods using 80 million outlier samples for model training.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary video visual relationship detection aims to expand video visual relationship detection beyond annotated categories by detecting unseen relationships between both seen and unseen objects in videos. Existing methods usually use trajectory detectors trained on closed datasets to detect object trajectories, and then feed these trajectories into large-scale pre-trained vision-language models to achieve open-vocabulary classification. Such heavy dependence on the pre-trained trajectory detectors limits their ability to generalize to novel object categories, leading to performance degradation. To address this challenge, we propose to unify object trajectory detection and relationship classification into an end-to-end open-vocabulary framework. Under this framework, we propose a relationship-aware open-vocabulary trajectory detector. It primarily consists of a query-based Transformer decoder, where the visual encoder of CLIP is distilled for frame-wise open-vocabulary object detection, and a trajectory associator. To exploit relationship context during trajectory detection, a relationship query is embedded into the Transformer decoder, and accordingly, an auxiliary relationship loss is designed to enable the decoder to perceive the relationships between objects explicitly. Moreover, we propose an open-vocabulary relationship classifier that leverages the rich semantic knowledge of CLIP to discover novel relationships. To adapt CLIP well to relationship classification, we design a multi-modal prompting method that employs spatio-temporal visual prompting for visual representation and vision-guided language prompting for language input. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, VidVRD and VidOR, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our framework is also applied to a more difficult cross-dataset scenario to further demonstrate its generalization ability.

- **Summary**: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered significant attention for their low power consumption and high biological interpretability. Their rich spatio-temporal information processing capability and event-driven nature make them ideally well-suited for neuromorphic datasets. However, current SNNs struggle to balance accuracy and latency in classifying these datasets. In this paper, we propose Hybrid Step-wise Distillation (HSD) method, tailored for neuromorphic datasets, to mitigate the notable decline in performance at lower time steps. Our work disentangles the dependency between the number of event frames and the time steps of SNNs, utilizing more event frames during the training stage to improve performance, while using fewer event frames during the inference stage to reduce latency. Nevertheless, the average output of SNNs across all time steps is susceptible to individual time step with abnormal outputs, particularly at extremely low time steps. To tackle this issue, we implement Step-wise Knowledge Distillation (SKD) module that considers variations in the output distribution of SNNs at each time step. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our method yields competitive performance in classification tasks on neuromorphic datasets, especially at lower time steps. Our code will be available at: {https://github.com/hsw0929/HSD}.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable potential in visuomotor control and instruction comprehension through end-to-end learning processes. However, current VLA models face significant challenges: they are slow during inference and require extensive pre-training on large amounts of robotic data, making real-world deployment difficult. In this paper, we introduce a new family of compact vision-language-action models, called TinyVLA, which offers two key advantages over existing VLA models: (1) faster inference speeds, and (2) improved data efficiency, eliminating the need for pre-training stage. Our framework incorporates two essential components to build TinyVLA: (1) initializing the policy backbone with robust, high-speed multimodal models, and (2) integrating a diffusion policy decoder during fine-tuning to enable precise robot actions. We conducted extensive evaluations of TinyVLA in both simulation and on real robots, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model, OpenVLA, in terms of speed and data efficiency, while delivering comparable or superior performance. Additionally, TinyVLA exhibits strong generalization capabilities across various dimensions, including language instructions, novel objects, unseen positions, changes in object appearance, background variations, and environmental shifts, often matching or exceeding the performance of OpenVLA. We believe that \methodname offers an interesting perspective on utilizing pre-trained multimodal models for policy learning. Our project is at https://tiny-vla.github.io.

- **Summary**: Deep learning based methods often suffer from performance degradation caused by domain shift. In recent years, many sophisticated network structures have been designed to tackle this problem. However, the advent of large model trained on massive data, with its exceptional segmentation capability, introduces a new perspective for solving medical segmentation problems. In this paper, we propose a novel Domain-Adaptive Prompt framework for fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model (termed as DAPSAM) to address single-source domain generalization (SDG) in segmenting medical images. DAPSAM not only utilizes a more generalization-friendly adapter to fine-tune the large model, but also introduces a self-learning prototype-based prompt generator to enhance model's generalization ability. Specifically, we first merge the important low-level features into intermediate features before feeding to each adapter, followed by an attention filter to remove redundant information. This yields more robust image embeddings. Then, we propose using a learnable memory bank to construct domain-adaptive prototypes for prompt generation, helping to achieve generalizable medical image segmentation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our DAPSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two SDG medical image segmentation tasks with different modalities.

- **Summary**: Video generation using diffusion-based models is constrained by high computational costs due to the frame-wise iterative diffusion process. This work presents a Diffusion Reuse MOtion (Dr. Mo) network to accelerate latent video generation. Our key discovery is that coarse-grained noises in earlier denoising steps have demonstrated high motion consistency across consecutive video frames. Following this observation, Dr. Mo propagates those coarse-grained noises onto the next frame by incorporating carefully designed, lightweight inter-frame motions, eliminating massive computational redundancy in frame-wise diffusion models. The more sensitive and fine-grained noises are still acquired via later denoising steps, which can be essential to retain visual qualities. As such, deciding which intermediate steps should switch from motion-based propagations to denoising can be a crucial problem and a key tradeoff between efficiency and quality. Dr. Mo employs a meta-network named Denoising Step Selector (DSS) to dynamically determine desirable intermediate steps across video frames. Extensive evaluations on video generation and editing tasks have shown that Dr. Mo can substantially accelerate diffusion models in video tasks with improved visual qualities.

- **Summary**: Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, has significantly advanced 3D medical image segmentation. While CNNs are highly effective at capturing local features, their limited receptive fields may hinder performance in complex clinical scenarios. In contrast, Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies but are computationally intensive, making them expensive to train and deploy. Recently, the Mamba architecture, based on the State Space Model (SSM), has been proposed to efficiently model long-range dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity. However, its application in medical image segmentation reveals shortcomings, particularly in capturing critical local features essential for accurate delineation of clinical regions. In this study, we propose MambaClinix, a novel U-shaped architecture for medical image segmentation that integrates a hierarchical gated convolutional network(HGCN) with Mamba in an adaptive stage-wise framework. This design significantly enhances computational efficiency and high-order spatial interactions, enabling the model to effectively capture both proximal and distal relationships in medical images. Specifically, our HGCN is designed to mimic the attention mechanism of Transformers by a purely convolutional structure, facilitating high-order spatial interactions in feature maps while avoiding the computational complexity typically associated with Transformer-based methods. Additionally, we introduce a region-specific Tversky loss, which emphasizes specific pixel regions to improve auto-segmentation performance, thereby optimizing the model's decision-making process. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MambaClinix achieves high segmentation accuracy while maintaining low model complexity.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has revolutionized various fields by enabling highly accurate predictions and estimates. One important application is probabilistic prediction, where models estimate the probability of events rather than deterministic outcomes. This approach is particularly relevant and, therefore, still unexplored for segmentation tasks where each pixel in an image needs to be classified. Conventional models often overlook the probabilistic nature of labels, but accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial for improving the reliability and applicability of models.   In this study, we applied Calibrated Probability Estimation (CaPE) to segmentation tasks to evaluate its impact on model calibration. Our results indicate that while CaPE improves calibration, its effect is less pronounced compared to classification tasks, suggesting that segmentation models can inherently provide better probability estimates. We also investigated the influence of dataset size and bin optimization on the effectiveness of calibration. Our results emphasize the expressive power of segmentation models as probability estimators and incorporate probabilistic reasoning, which is crucial for applications requiring precise uncertainty quantification.

- **Summary**: In radiation therapy (RT), the reliance on pre-treatment computed tomography (CT) images encounter challenges due to anatomical changes, necessitating adaptive planning. Daily cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging, pivotal for therapy adjustment, falls short in tissue density accuracy. To address this, our innovative approach integrates diffusion models for CT image generation, offering precise control over data synthesis. Leveraging a self-training method with knowledge distillation, we maximize CBCT data during therapy, complemented by sparse paired fan-beam CTs. This strategy, incorporated into state-of-the-art diffusion-based models, surpasses conventional methods like Pix2pix and CycleGAN. A meticulously curated dataset of 2800 paired CBCT and CT scans, supplemented by 4200 CBCT scans, undergoes preprocessing and teacher model training, including the Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM). Pseudo-label CT images are generated, resulting in a dataset combining 5600 CT images with corresponding CBCT images. Thorough evaluation using MSE, SSIM, PSNR and LPIPS demonstrates superior performance against Pix2pix and CycleGAN. Our approach shows promise in generating high-quality CT images from CBCT scans in RT.

- **Summary**: Pre-training on large-scale, high-quality datasets is crucial for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in specialized domains such as mathematics. Despite the recognized importance, the Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) field currently lacks a comprehensive open-source pre-training dataset specifically designed for mathematical reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce InfiMM-WebMath-40B, a high-quality dataset of interleaved image-text documents. It comprises 24 million web pages, 85 million associated image URLs, and 40 billion text tokens, all meticulously extracted and filtered from CommonCrawl. We provide a detailed overview of our data collection and processing pipeline. To demonstrate the robustness of InfiMM-WebMath-40B, we conducted evaluations in both text-only and multimodal settings. Our evaluations on text-only benchmarks show that, despite utilizing only 40 billion tokens, our dataset significantly enhances the performance of our 1.3B model, delivering results comparable to DeepSeekMath-1.3B, which uses 120 billion tokens for the same model size. Nevertheless, with the introduction of our multi-modal math pre-training dataset, our models set a new state-of-the-art among open-source models on multi-modal math benchmarks such as MathVerse and We-Math. We release our data at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Infi-MM/InfiMM-WebMath-40B.

- **Summary**: Tuning-free personalized image generation methods have achieved significant success in maintaining facial consistency, i.e., identities, even with multiple characters. However, the lack of holistic consistency in scenes with multiple characters hampers these methods' ability to create a cohesive narrative. In this paper, we introduce StoryMaker, a personalization solution that preserves not only facial consistency but also clothing, hairstyles, and body consistency, thus facilitating the creation of a story through a series of images. StoryMaker incorporates conditions based on face identities and cropped character images, which include clothing, hairstyles, and bodies. Specifically, we integrate the facial identity information with the cropped character images using the Positional-aware Perceiver Resampler (PPR) to obtain distinct character features. To prevent intermingling of multiple characters and the background, we separately constrain the cross-attention impact regions of different characters and the background using MSE loss with segmentation masks. Additionally, we train the generation network conditioned on poses to promote decoupling from poses. A LoRA is also employed to enhance fidelity and quality. Experiments underscore the effectiveness of our approach. StoryMaker supports numerous applications and is compatible with other societal plug-ins.

- **Summary**: Today's Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased exemplary capabilities, ranging from simple text generation to advanced image processing. Such models are currently being explored for in-vehicle services such as supporting perception tasks in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) or Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, given the LLMs' capabilities to process multi-modal data. However, LLMs often generate nonsensical or unfaithful information, known as ``hallucinations'': a notable issue that needs to be mitigated. In this paper, we systematically explore the adoption of SelfCheckGPT to spot hallucinations by three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, LLaVA, and Llama3) when analysing visual automotive data from two sources: Waymo Open Dataset, from the US, and PREPER CITY dataset, from Sweden. Our results show that GPT-4o is better at generating faithful image captions than LLaVA, whereas the former demonstrated leniency in mislabeling non-hallucinated content as hallucinations compared to the latter. Furthermore, the analysis of the performance metrics revealed that the dataset type (Waymo or PREPER CITY) did not significantly affect the quality of the captions or the effectiveness of hallucination detection. However, the models showed better performance rates over images captured during daytime, compared to during dawn, dusk or night. Overall, the results show that SelfCheckGPT and its adaptation can be used to filter hallucinations in generated traffic-related image captions for state-of-the-art LLMs.

- **Summary**: In recent years, considerable research has been conducted on vision-language models that handle both image and text data; these models are being applied to diverse downstream tasks, such as "image-related chat," "image recognition by instruction," and "answering visual questions." Vision-language models (VLMs), such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), are also high-performance image classifiers that are being developed into domain adaptation methods that can utilize language information to extend into unseen domains. However, because these VLMs embed images as a single point in a unified embedding space, there is room for improvement in the classification accuracy. Therefore, in this study, we proposed the Latent Augmentation using Regional Embedding (LARE), which embeds the image as a region in the unified embedding space learned by the VLM. By sampling the augmented image embeddings from within this latent region, LARE enables data augmentation to various unseen domains, not just to specific unseen domains. LARE achieves robust image classification for domains in and out using augmented image embeddings to fine-tune VLMs. We demonstrate that LARE outperforms previous fine-tuning models in terms of image classification accuracy on three benchmarks. We also demonstrate that LARE is a more robust and general model that is valid under multiple conditions, such as unseen domains, small amounts of data, and imbalanced data.

- **Summary**: Generative models aim to learn the distribution of datasets, such as images, so as to be able to generate samples that statistically resemble real data. However, learning the underlying probability distribution can be very challenging and intractable. To this end, we introduce an approach which employs the characteristic function (CF), a probabilistic descriptor that directly corresponds to the distribution. However, unlike the probability density function (pdf), the characteristic function not only always exists, but also provides an additional degree of freedom, hence enhances flexibility in learning distributions. This removes the critical dependence on pdf-based assumptions, which limit the applicability of traditional methods. While several works have attempted to use CF in generative modeling, they often impose strong constraints on the training process. In contrast, our approach calculates the distance between query points in the CF domain, which is an unconstrained and well defined problem. Next, to deal with the sampling strategy, which is crucial to model performance, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based optimizer for the sampling process, which identifies regions where the difference between CFs is most significant. In addition, our method allows the use of a pre-trained model, such as a well-trained autoencoder, and is capable of learning directly in its feature space, without modifying its parameters. This offers a flexible and robust approach to generative modeling, not only provides broader applicability and improved performance, but also equips any latent space world with the ability to become a generative model.

- **Summary**: Recently, while significant progress has been made in remote sensing image change captioning, existing methods fail to filter out areas unrelated to actual changes, making models susceptible to irrelevant features. In this article, we propose a novel multimodal framework for remote sensing image change captioning, guided by Key Change Features and Instruction-tuned (KCFI). This framework aims to fully leverage the intrinsic knowledge of large language models through visual instructions and enhance the effectiveness and accuracy of change features using pixel-level change detection tasks. Specifically, KCFI includes a ViTs encoder for extracting bi-temporal remote sensing image features, a key feature perceiver for identifying critical change areas, a pixel-level change detection decoder to constrain key change features, and an instruction-tuned decoder based on a large language model. Moreover, to ensure that change description and change detection tasks are jointly optimized, we employ a dynamic weight-averaging strategy to balance the losses between the two tasks. We also explore various feature combinations for visual fine-tuning instructions and demonstrate that using only key change features to guide the large language model is the optimal choice. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare it against several state-of-the-art change captioning methods on the LEVIR-CC dataset, achieving the best performance. Our code will be available at https://github.com/yangcong356/KCFI.git.

- **Summary**: 3D detection of traffic management objects, such as traffic lights and road signs, is vital for self-driving cars, particularly for address-to-address navigation where vehicles encounter numerous intersections with these static objects. This paper introduces a novel method for automatically generating accurate and temporally consistent 3D bounding box annotations for traffic lights and signs, effective up to a range of 200 meters. These annotations are suitable for training real-time models used in self-driving cars, which need a large amount of training data. The proposed method relies only on RGB images with 2D bounding boxes of traffic management objects, which can be automatically obtained using an off-the-shelf image-space detector neural network, along with GNSS/INS data, eliminating the need for LiDAR point cloud data.

- **Summary**: As a natural disaster with high suddenness and great destructiveness, fire has long posed a major threat to human society and ecological environment. In recent years, with the rapid development of smart city and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, fire detection systems based on deep learning have gradually become a key means to cope with fire hazards. However, existing fire detection models still have many challenges in terms of detection accuracy and real-time performance in complex contexts. To address these issues, we propose two key modules: EAConv (Efficient Attention Convolution) and EADown (Efficient Attention Downsampling). The EAConv module significantly improves the feature extraction efficiency by combining an efficient attention mechanism with depth-separable convolution, while the EADown module enhances the accuracy and efficiency of feature downsampling by utilizing spatial and channel attention mechanisms in combination with pooling operations. Based on these two modules, we design an efficient and lightweight flame detection model, EFA-YOLO (Efficient Feature Attention YOLO). Experimental results show that EFA-YOLO has a model parameter quantity of only 1.4M, GFLOPs of 4.6, and the inference time per image on the CPU is only 22.19 ms. Compared with existing mainstream models (e.g., YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10), EFA-YOLO exhibits a significant enhancement in detection accuracy (mAP) and inference speed, with model parameter amount is reduced by 94.6 and the inference speed is improved by 88 times.

- **Summary**: Image inpainting is a valuable technique for enhancing images that have been corrupted. The primary challenge in this research revolves around the extent of corruption in the input image that the deep learning model must restore. To address this challenge, we introduce a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for learning and replicating the missing pixels. Additionally, we have developed a distinct variant of the Super-Resolution GAN (SRGAN), which we refer to as the Semi-SRGAN (SSRGAN). Furthermore, we leveraged three diverse datasets to assess the robustness and accuracy of our proposed model. Our training process involves varying levels of pixel corruption to attain optimal accuracy and generate high-quality images.

- **Summary**: Plastic waste in aquatic environments poses severe risks to marine life and human health. Autonomous robots can be utilized to collect floating waste, but they require accurate object identification capability. While deep learning has been widely used as a powerful tool for this task, its performance is significantly limited by outdoor light conditions and water surface reflection. Light polarization, abundant in such environments yet invisible to the human eye, can be captured by modern sensors to significantly improve litter detection accuracy on water surfaces. With this goal in mind, we introduce PoTATO, a dataset containing 12,380 labeled plastic bottles and rich polarimetric information. We demonstrate under which conditions polarization can enhance object detection and, by providing raw image data, we offer an opportunity for the research community to explore novel approaches and push the boundaries of state-of-the-art object detection algorithms even further. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/luisfelipewb/ PoTATO/tree/eccv2024.

- **Summary**: Radiance fields are powerful and, hence, popular models for representing the appearance of complex scenes. Yet, constructing them based on image observations gives rise to ambiguities and uncertainties. We propose a versatile approach for learning Gaussian radiance fields with explicit and fine-grained uncertainty estimates that impose only little additional cost compared to uncertainty-agnostic training. Our key observation is that uncertainties can be modeled as a low-dimensional manifold in the space of radiance field parameters that is highly amenable to Monte Carlo sampling. Importantly, our uncertainties are differentiable and, thus, allow for gradient-based optimization of subsequent captures that optimally reduce ambiguities. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on next-best-view planning tasks, including high-dimensional illumination planning for optimal radiance field relighting quality.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal end-to-end autonomous driving has shown promising advancements in recent work. By embedding more modalities into end-to-end networks, the system's understanding of both static and dynamic aspects of the driving environment is enhanced, thereby improving the safety of autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce METDrive, an end-to-end system that leverages temporal guidance from the embedded time series features of ego states, including rotation angles, steering, throttle signals, and waypoint vectors. The geometric features derived from perception sensor data and the time series features of ego state data jointly guide the waypoint prediction with the proposed temporal guidance loss function. We evaluated METDrive on the CARLA leaderboard's Longest6 benchmark, achieving a driving score of 70%, a route completion score of 94%, and an infraction score of 0.78.

- **Summary**: In the realm of construction safety, the detection of personal protective equipment, such as helmets, plays a critical role in preventing workplace injuries. This paper details the development and evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) designed for the accurate classification of helmet presence on construction sites. Initially, a simple CNN model comprising one convolutional block and one fully connected layer was developed, yielding modest results. To enhance its performance, the model was progressively refined, first by extending the architecture to include an additional convolutional block and a fully connected layer. Subsequently, batch normalization and dropout techniques were integrated, aiming to mitigate overfitting and improve the model's generalization capabilities. The performance of these models is methodically analyzed, revealing a peak F1-score of 84\%, precision of 82\%, and recall of 86\% with the most advanced configuration of the first study phase. Despite these improvements, the accuracy remained suboptimal, thus setting the stage for further architectural and operational enhancements. This work lays a foundational framework for ongoing adjustments and optimization in automated helmet detection technology, with future enhancements expected to address the limitations identified during these initial experiments.

- **Summary**: In recent years, encoder-decoder networks have focused on expanding receptive fields and incorporating multi-scale context to capture global features for objects of varying sizes. However, as networks deepen, they often discard fine spatial details, impairing precise object localization. Additionally, conventional decoders' use of interpolation for upsampling leads to a loss of global context, diminishing edge segmentation accuracy. To address the above problems, we propose a novel parallel multi-resolution encoder-decoder network, namely PMR-Net for short. First, we design a parallel multi-resolution encoder and a multi-resolution context encoder. The parallel multi-resolution encoder can extract and fuse multi-scale fine-grained local features in parallel for input images with different resolutions. The multi-resolution context encoder fuses the global context semantic features of different receptive fields from different encoder branches to maintain effectively the integrity of global information. Secondly, we design a parallel multi-resolution decoder symmetrical to the structure of parallel multi-resolution encoder. The decoder can continuously supplement the global context features of low-resolution branches to the feature maps of high-resolution branches, and effectively solve the problem of global context feature loss caused by upsampling operation in the decoding process. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our proposed PMR-Net can achieve more accurate segmentation results than state-of-the-art methods on five public available datasets. Moreover, PMR-Net is also a flexible network framework, which can meet the requirements of different scenarios by adjusting the number of network layers and the number of parallel encoder-decoder branches.

- **Summary**: With the advancement of autonomous driving, semantic segmentation has achieved remarkable progress. The training of such networks heavily relies on image annotations, which are very expensive to obtain. Semi-supervised learning can utilize both labeled data and unlabeled data with the help of pseudo-labels. However, in many real-world scenarios where classes are imbalanced, majority classes often play a dominant role during training and the learning quality of minority classes can be undermined. To overcome this limitation, we propose a synergistic training framework, including a professional training module to enhance minority class learning and a general training module to learn more comprehensive semantic information. Based on a pixel selection strategy, they can iteratively learn from each other to reduce error accumulation and coupling. In addition, a dual contrastive learning with anchors is proposed to guarantee more distinct decision boundaries. In experiments, our framework demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are well-suited for processing event streams from Dynamic Visual Sensors (DVSs) due to their use of sparse spike-based coding and asynchronous event-driven computation. To extract features from DVS objects, SNNs commonly use event-driven convolution with fixed kernel parameters. These filters respond strongly to features in specific orientations while disregarding others, leading to incomplete feature extraction. To improve the current event-driven convolution feature extraction capability of SNNs, we propose a DVS object recognition model that utilizes a trainable event-driven convolution and a spiking attention mechanism. The trainable event-driven convolution is proposed in this paper to update its convolution kernel through gradient descent. This method can extract local features of the event stream more efficiently than traditional event-driven convolution. Furthermore, the spiking attention mechanism is used to extract global dependence features. The classification performances of our model are better than the baseline methods on two neuromorphic datasets including MNIST-DVS and the more complex CIFAR10-DVS. Moreover, our model showed good classification ability for short event streams. It was shown that our model can improve the performance of event-driven convolutional SNNs for DVS objects.

- **Summary**: Generative AI has seen major developments in recent years, enhancing the realism of synthetic images, also known as computer-generated images. In addition, generative AI has also made it possible to modify specific image characteristics through image editing. Previous work has developed methods based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) for generating realistic images, in particular faces, but also to modify specific features. However, this work has never been applied to specific animal species. Moreover, the assessment of the results has been generally done subjectively, rather than quantitatively. In this paper, we propose an approach based on methods for generating images of faces of male or female mandrills, a non-human primate. The main novelty of proposed method is the ability to edit their sex by identifying a sex axis in the latent space of a specific GAN. In addition, we have developed an assessment of the sex levels based on statistical features extracted from real image distributions. The experimental results we obtained from a specific database are not only realistic, but also accurate, meeting a need for future work in behavioral experiments with wild mandrills.

- **Summary**: Recently, significant improvements in rate-distortion performance of image compression have been achieved with deep-learning techniques. A key factor in this success is the use of additional bits to predict an approximation of the latent vector, which is the output of the encoder, through another neural network. Then, only the difference between the prediction and the latent vector is coded into the bitstream, along with its estimated probability distribution. We introduce a new predictive structure consisting of the auxiliary coarse network and the main network, inspired by neural video compression. The auxiliary coarse network encodes the auxiliary information and predicts the approximation of the original image as multi-scale features. The main network encodes the residual between the predicted feature from the auxiliary coarse network and the feature of the original image. To further leverage our new structure, we propose Auxiliary info-guided Feature Prediction (AFP) module that uses global correlation to predict more accurate predicted features. Moreover, we present Context Junction module that refines the auxiliary feature from AFP module and produces the residuals between the refined features and the original image features. Finally, we introduce Auxiliary info-guided Parameter Estimation (APE) module, which predicts the approximation of the latent vector and estimates the probability distribution of these residuals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules by various ablation studies. Under extensive experiments, our model outperforms other neural image compression models and achieves a 19.49\% higher rate-distortion performance than VVC on Tecnick dataset.

- **Summary**: Efficient storage of large-scale point cloud data has become increasingly challenging due to advancements in scanning technology. Recent deep learning techniques have revolutionized this field; However, most existing approaches rely on single-modality contexts, such as octree nodes or voxel occupancy, limiting their ability to capture information across large regions. In this paper, we propose PVContext, a hybrid context model for effective octree-based point cloud compression. PVContext comprises two components with distinct modalities: the Voxel Context, which accurately represents local geometric information using voxels, and the Point Context, which efficiently preserves global shape information from point clouds. By integrating these two contexts, we retain detailed information across large areas while controlling the context size. The combined context is then fed into a deep entropy model to accurately predict occupancy. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to G-PCC, our method reduces the bitrate by 37.95\% on SemanticKITTI LiDAR point clouds and by 48.98\% and 36.36\% on dense object point clouds from MPEG 8i and MVUB, respectively.

- **Summary**: We propose DrivingForward, a feed-forward Gaussian Splatting model that reconstructs driving scenes from flexible surround-view input. Driving scene images from vehicle-mounted cameras are typically sparse, with limited overlap, and the movement of the vehicle further complicates the acquisition of camera extrinsics. To tackle these challenges and achieve real-time reconstruction, we jointly train a pose network, a depth network, and a Gaussian network to predict the Gaussian primitives that represent the driving scenes. The pose network and depth network determine the position of the Gaussian primitives in a self-supervised manner, without using depth ground truth and camera extrinsics during training. The Gaussian network independently predicts primitive parameters from each input image, including covariance, opacity, and spherical harmonics coefficients. At the inference stage, our model can achieve feed-forward reconstruction from flexible multi-frame surround-view input. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art feed-forward and scene-optimized reconstruction methods in terms of reconstruction.

- **Summary**: To help address the occlusion problem in panoptic segmentation and image understanding, this paper proposes a new large-scale dataset, COCO-Occ, which is derived from the COCO dataset by manually labelling the COCO images into three perceived occlusion levels. Using COCO-Occ, we systematically assess and quantify the impact of occlusion on panoptic segmentation on samples having different levels of occlusion. Comparative experiments with SOTA panoptic models demonstrate that the presence of occlusion significantly affects performance with higher occlusion levels resulting in notably poorer performance. Additionally, we propose a straightforward yet effective method as an initial attempt to leverage the occlusion annotation using contrastive learning to render a model that learns a more robust representation capturing different severities of occlusion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach boosts the performance of the baseline model and achieves SOTA performance on the proposed COCO-Occ dataset.

- **Summary**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has achieved impressive results in novel view synthesis, demonstrating high fidelity and efficiency. However, it easily exhibits needle-like artifacts, especially when increasing the sampling rate. Mip-Splatting tries to remove these artifacts with a 3D smoothing filter for frequency constraints and a 2D Mip filter for approximated supersampling. Unfortunately, it tends to produce over-blurred results, and sometimes needle-like Gaussians still persist. Our spectral analysis of the covariance matrix during optimization and densification reveals that current 3D-GS lacks shape awareness, relying instead on spectral radius and view positional gradients to determine splitting. As a result, needle-like Gaussians with small positional gradients and low spectral entropy fail to split and overfit high-frequency details. Furthermore, both the filters used in 3D-GS and Mip-Splatting reduce the spectral entropy and increase the condition number during zooming in to synthesize novel view, causing view inconsistencies and more pronounced artifacts. Our Spectral-GS, based on spectral analysis, introduces 3D shape-aware splitting and 2D view-consistent filtering strategies, effectively addressing these issues, enhancing 3D-GS's capability to represent high-frequency details without noticeable artifacts, and achieving high-quality photorealistic rendering.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel framework for large-scale scene reconstruction based on 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and aims to address the scalability and accuracy challenges faced by existing methods. For tackling the scalability issue, we split the large scene into multiple cells, and the candidate point-cloud and camera views of each cell are correlated through a visibility-based camera selection and a progressive point-cloud extension. To reinforce the rendering quality, three highlighted improvements are made in comparison with vanilla 3DGS, which are a strategy of the ray-Gaussian intersection and the novel Gaussians density control for learning efficiency, an appearance decoupling module based on ConvKAN network to solve uneven lighting conditions in large-scale scenes, and a refined final loss with the color loss, the depth distortion loss, and the normal consistency loss. Finally, the seamless stitching procedure is executed to merge the individual Gaussian radiance field for novel view synthesis across different cells. Evaluation of Mill19, Urban3D, and MatrixCity datasets shows that our method consistently generates more high-fidelity rendering results than state-of-the-art methods of large-scale scene reconstruction. We further validate the generalizability of the proposed approach by rendering on self-collected video clips recorded by a commercial drone.

- **Summary**: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a crucial non-invasive method used to capture the movement of internal organs and tissues, making it a key tool for medical diagnosis. However, dynamic MRI faces a major challenge: long acquisition times needed to achieve high spatial and temporal resolution. This leads to higher costs, patient discomfort, motion artifacts, and lower image quality. Compressed Sensing (CS) addresses this problem by acquiring a reduced amount of MR data in the Fourier domain, based on a chosen sampling pattern, and reconstructing the full image from this partial data. While various deep learning methods have been developed to optimize these sampling patterns and improve reconstruction, they often struggle with slow optimization and inference times or are limited to specific temporal dimensions used during training. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-compressed sensing approach that uses 3D window attention and flexible, temporally extendable acquisition trajectories. Our method significantly reduces both training and inference times compared to existing approaches, while also adapting to different temporal dimensions during inference without requiring additional training. Tests with real data show that our approach outperforms current state-of-theart techniques. The code for reproducing all experiments will be made available upon acceptance of the paper.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the challenging problem of cross-modal (image-to-events) adaptation for event-based recognition without accessing any labeled source image data. This task is arduous due to the substantial modality gap between images and events. With only a pre-trained source model available, the key challenge lies in extracting knowledge from this model and effectively transferring knowledge to the event-based domain. Inspired by the natural ability of language to convey semantics across different modalities, we propose EventDance++, a novel framework that tackles this unsupervised source-free cross-modal adaptation problem from a language-guided perspective. We introduce a language-guided reconstruction-based modality bridging (L-RMB) module, which reconstructs intensity frames from events in a self-supervised manner. Importantly, it leverages a vision-language model to provide further supervision, enriching the surrogate images and enhancing modality bridging. This enables the creation of surrogate images to extract knowledge (i.e., labels) from the source model. On top, we propose a multi-representation knowledge adaptation (MKA) module to transfer knowledge to target models, utilizing multiple event representations to capture the spatiotemporal characteristics of events fully. The L-RMB and MKA modules are jointly optimized to achieve optimal performance in bridging the modality gap. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that EventDance++ performs on par with methods that utilize source data, validating the effectiveness of our language-guided approach in event-based recognition.

- **Summary**: Despite the impressive success of text-to-image (TTI) generation models, existing studies overlook the issue of whether these models accurately convey factual information. In this paper, we focus on the problem of image hallucination, where images created by generation models fail to faithfully depict factual content. To address this, we introduce I-HallA (Image Hallucination evaluation with Question Answering), a novel automated evaluation metric that measures the factuality of generated images through visual question answering (VQA). We also introduce I-HallA v1.0, a curated benchmark dataset for this purpose. As part of this process, we develop a pipeline that generates high-quality question-answer pairs using multiple GPT-4 Omni-based agents, with human judgments to ensure accuracy. Our evaluation protocols measure image hallucination by testing if images from existing text-to-image models can correctly respond to these questions. The I-HallA v1.0 dataset comprises 1.2K diverse image-text pairs across nine categories with 1,000 rigorously curated questions covering various compositional challenges. We evaluate five text-to-image models using I-HallA and reveal that these state-of-the-art models often fail to accurately convey factual information. Moreover, we validate the reliability of our metric by demonstrating a strong Spearman correlation (rho=0.95) with human judgments. We believe our benchmark dataset and metric can serve as a foundation for developing factually accurate text-to-image generation models.

- **Summary**: Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases and consequently, a major cause for mortality and morbidity worldwide. Accurate assessment of myocardial tissue viability for post-MI patients is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning, e.g. allowing surgical revascularization, or to determine the risk of adverse cardiovascular events in the future. Fine-grained analysis of the myocardium and its surrounding anatomical structures can be performed by combining the information obtained from complementary medical imaging techniques. In this work, we use late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) magnetic resonance (MR), T2-weighted (T2) MR and balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) cine MR in order to semantically segment the left and right ventricle, healthy and scarred myocardial tissue, as well as edema. To this end, we propose the Multi-Sequence Cascading Refinement CNN (MS-CaRe-CNN), a 2-stage CNN cascade that receives multi-sequence data and generates predictions of the anatomical structures of interest without considering tissue viability at Stage 1. The prediction of Stage 1 is then further refined in Stage 2, where the model additionally distinguishes myocardial tissue based on viability, i.e. healthy, scarred and edema regions. Our proposed method is set up as a 5-fold ensemble and semantically segments scar tissue achieving 62.31% DSC and 82.65% precision, as well as 63.78% DSC and 87.69% precision for the combined scar and edema region. These promising results for such small and challenging structures confirm that MS-CaRe-CNN is well-suited to generate semantic segmentations to assess the viability of myocardial tissue, enabling downstream tasks like personalized therapy planning.

- **Summary**: The process of fish cage inspections, which is a necessary maintenance task at any fish farm, be it small scale or industrial, is a task that has the potential to be fully automated. Replacing trained divers who perform regular inspections with autonomous marine vehicles would lower the costs of manpower and remove the risks associated with humans performing underwater inspections. Achieving such a level of autonomy implies developing an image processing algorithm that is capable of estimating the state of biofouling buildup. The aim of this work is to propose a complete solution for automating the said inspection process; from developing an autonomous control algorithm for an ROV, to automatically segmenting images of fish cages, and accurately estimating the state of biofouling. The first part is achieved by modifying a commercially available ROV with an acoustic SBL positioning system and developing a closed-loop control system. The second part is realized by implementing a proposed biofouling estimation framework, which relies on AI to perform image segmentation, and by processing images using established computer vision methods to obtain a rough estimate of the distance of the ROV from the fish cage. This also involved developing a labeling tool in order to create a dataset of images for the neural network performing the semantic segmentation to be trained on. The experimental results show the viability of using an ROV fitted with an acoustic transponder for autonomous missions, and demonstrate the biofouling estimation framework's ability to provide accurate assessments, alongside satisfactory distance estimation capabilities. In conclusion, the achieved biofouling estimation accuracy showcases clear potential for use in the aquaculture industry.

- **Summary**: In Canada's northern regions, linear disturbances such as roads, seismic exploration lines, and pipelines pose a significant threat to the boreal woodland caribou population (Rangifer tarandus). To address the critical need for management of these disturbances, there is a strong emphasis on developing mapping approaches that accurately identify forest habitat fragmentation. The traditional approach is manually generating maps, which is time-consuming and lacks the capability for frequent updates. Instead, applying deep learning methods to multispectral satellite imagery offers a cost-effective solution for automated and regularly updated map production. Deep learning models have shown promise in extracting paved roads in urban environments when paired with high-resolution (<0.5m) imagery, but their effectiveness for general linear feature extraction in forested areas from lower resolution imagery remains underexplored. This research employs a deep convolutional neural network model based on the VGGNet16 architecture for semantic segmentation of lower resolution (10m) Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, creating precise multi-class linear disturbance maps. The model is trained using ground-truth label maps sourced from the freely available Alberta Institute of Biodiversity Monitoring Human Footprint dataset, specifically targeting the Boreal and Taiga Plains ecozones in Alberta, Canada. Despite challenges in segmenting lower resolution imagery, particularly for thin linear disturbances like seismic exploration lines that can exhibit a width of 1-3 pixels in Sentinel-2 imagery, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the VGGNet model for accurate linear disturbance retrieval. By leveraging the freely available Sentinel-2 imagery, this work advances cost-effective automated mapping techniques for identifying and monitoring linear disturbance fragmentation.

- **Summary**: Diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema are significant complications of diabetes that can lead to vision loss. Early detection through ultra-widefield fundus imaging enhances patient outcomes but presents challenges in image quality and analysis scale. This paper introduces deep learning solutions for automated UWF image analysis within the framework of the MICCAI 2024 UWF4DR challenge. We detail methods and results across three tasks: image quality assessment, detection of referable DR, and identification of DME. Employing advanced convolutional neural network architectures such as EfficientNet and ResNet, along with preprocessing and augmentation strategies, our models demonstrate robust performance in these tasks. Results indicate that deep learning can significantly aid in the automated analysis of UWF images, potentially improving the efficiency and accuracy of DR and DME detection in clinical settings.

- **Summary**: The extraction of blood vessels has recently experienced a widespread interest in medical image analysis. Automatic vessel segmentation is highly desirable to guide clinicians in computer-assisted diagnosis, therapy or surgical planning. Despite a good ability to extract large anatomical structures, the capacity of U-Net inspired architectures to automatically delineate vascular systems remains a major issue, especially given the scarcity of existing datasets. In this paper, we present a novel approach that integrates into deep segmentation shape priors from a Semi-Overcomplete Convolutional Auto-Encoder (S-OCAE) embedding. Compared to standard Convolutional Auto-Encoders (CAE), it exploits an over-complete branch that projects data onto higher dimensions to better characterize tiny structures. Experiments on retinal and liver vessel extraction, respectively performed on publicly-available DRIVE and 3D-IRCADb datasets, highlight the effectiveness of our method compared to U-Net trained without and with shape priors from a traditional CAE.

- **Summary**: Domain generalisation involves learning artificial intelligence (AI) models that can maintain high performance across diverse domains within a specific task. In video games, for instance, such AI models can supposedly learn to detect player actions across different games. Despite recent advancements in AI, domain generalisation for modelling the users' experience remains largely unexplored. While video games present unique challenges and opportunities for the analysis of user experience -- due to their dynamic and rich contextual nature -- modelling such experiences is limited by generally small datasets. As a result, conventional modelling methods often struggle to bridge the domain gap between users and games due to their reliance on large labelled training data and assumptions of common distributions of user experience. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by introducing a framework that decomposes the general domain-agnostic modelling of user experience into several domain-specific and game-dependent tasks that can be solved via few-shot learning. We test our framework on a variation of the publicly available GameVibe corpus, designed specifically to test a model's ability to predict user engagement across different first-person shooter games. Our findings demonstrate the superior performance of few-shot learners over traditional modelling methods and thus showcase the potential of few-shot learning for robust experience modelling in video games and beyond.

- **Summary**: The in-vivo identification of the kidney stone types during an ureteroscopy would be a major medical advance in urology, as it could reduce the time of the tedious renal calculi extraction process, while diminishing infection risks. Furthermore, such an automated procedure would make possible to prescribe anti-recurrence treatments immediately. Nowadays, only few experienced urologists are able to recognize the kidney stone types in the images of the videos displayed on a screen during the endoscopy. Thus, several deep learning (DL) models have recently been proposed to automatically recognize the kidney stone types using ureteroscopic images. However, these DL models are of black box nature whicl limits their applicability in clinical settings. This contribution proposes a case-based reasoning DL model which uses prototypical parts (PPs) and generates local and global descriptors. The PPs encode for each class (i.e., kidney stone type) visual feature information (hue, saturation, intensity and textures) similar to that used by biologists. The PPs are optimally generated due a new loss function used during the model training. Moreover, the local and global descriptors of PPs allow to explain the decisions ("what" information, "where in the images") in an understandable way for biologists and urologists. The proposed DL model has been tested on a database including images of the six most widespread kidney stone types. The overall average classification accuracy was 90.37. When comparing this results with that of the eight other DL models of the kidney stone state-of-the-art, it can be seen that the valuable gain in explanability was not reached at the expense of accuracy which was even slightly increased with respect to that (88.2) of the best method of the literature. These promising and interpretable results also encourage urologists to put their trust in AI-based solutions.

- **Summary**: Protection of biometric templates is a critical and urgent area of focus. IronMask demonstrates outstanding recognition performance while protecting facial templates against existing known attacks. In high-level, IronMask can be conceptualized as a fuzzy commitment scheme building on the hypersphere directly. We devise an attack on IronMask targeting on the security notion of renewability. Our attack, termed as Probabilistic Linear Regression Attack, utilizes the linearity of underlying used error correcting code. This attack is the first algorithm to successfully recover the original template when getting multiple protected templates in acceptable time and requirement of storage. We implement experiments on IronMask applied to protect ArcFace that well verify the validity of our attacks. Furthermore, we carry out experiments in noisy environments and confirm that our attacks are still applicable. Finally, we put forward two strategies to mitigate this type of attacks.

- **Summary**: With their meaningful geometry and their omnipresence in the 3D world, edges are extremely useful primitives in computer vision. 3D edges comprise of lines and curves, and methods to reconstruct them use either multi-view images or point clouds as input. State-of-the-art image-based methods first learn a 3D edge point cloud then fit 3D edges to it. The edge point cloud is obtained by learning a 3D neural implicit edge field from which the 3D edge points are sampled on a specific level set (0 or 1). However, such methods present two important drawbacks: i) it is not realistic to sample points on exact level sets due to float imprecision and training inaccuracies. Instead, they are sampled within a range of levels so the points do not lie accurately on the 3D edges and require further processing. ii) Such implicit representations are computationally expensive and require long training times. In this paper, we address these two limitations and propose a 3D edge mapping that is simpler, more efficient, and preserves accuracy. Our method learns explicitly the 3D edge points and their edge direction hence bypassing the need for point sampling. It casts a 3D edge point as the center of a 3D Gaussian and the edge direction as the principal axis of the Gaussian. Such a representation has the advantage of being not only geometrically meaningful but also compatible with the efficient training optimization defined in Gaussian Splatting. Results show that the proposed method produces edges as accurate and complete as the state-of-the-art while being an order of magnitude faster.

- **Summary**: We present 3DGS-LM, a new method that accelerates the reconstruction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by replacing its ADAM optimizer with a tailored Levenberg-Marquardt (LM). Existing methods reduce the optimization time by decreasing the number of Gaussians or by improving the implementation of the differentiable rasterizer. However, they still rely on the ADAM optimizer to fit Gaussian parameters of a scene in thousands of iterations, which can take up to an hour. To this end, we change the optimizer to LM that runs in conjunction with the 3DGS differentiable rasterizer. For efficient GPU parallization, we propose a caching data structure for intermediate gradients that allows us to efficiently calculate Jacobian-vector products in custom CUDA kernels. In every LM iteration, we calculate update directions from multiple image subsets using these kernels and combine them in a weighted mean. Overall, our method is 30% faster than the original 3DGS while obtaining the same reconstruction quality. Our optimization is also agnostic to other methods that acclerate 3DGS, thus enabling even faster speedups compared to vanilla 3DGS.

- **Summary**: Human immune system contains white blood cells (WBC) that are good indicator of many diseases like bacterial infections, AIDS, cancer, spleen, etc. White blood cells have been sub classified into four types: monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils on the basis of their nucleus, shape and cytoplasm. Traditionally in laboratories, pathologists and hematologists analyze these blood cells through microscope and then classify them manually. This manual process takes more time and increases the chance of human error. Hence, there is a need to automate this process. In this paper, first we have used different CNN pre-train models such as ResNet-50, InceptionV3, VGG16 and MobileNetV2 to automatically classify the white blood cells. These pre-train models are applied on Kaggle dataset of microscopic images. Although we achieved reasonable accuracy ranging between 92 to 95%, still there is need to enhance the performance. Hence, inspired by these architectures, a framework has been proposed to automatically categorize the four kinds of white blood cells with increased accuracy. The aim is to develop a convolution neural network (CNN) based classification system with decent generalization ability. The proposed CNN model has been tested on white blood cells images from Kaggle and LISC datasets. Accuracy achieved is 99.57% and 98.67% for both datasets respectively. Our proposed convolutional neural network-based model provides competitive performance as compared to previous results reported in literature.

- **Summary**: Monitoring plankton distribution, particularly harmful phytoplankton, is vital for preserving aquatic ecosystems, regulating the global climate, and ensuring environmental protection. Traditional methods for monitoring are often time-consuming, expensive, error-prone, and unsuitable for large-scale applications, highlighting the need for accurate and efficient automated systems. In this study, we evaluate several state-of-the-art CNN models, including ResNet, ResNeXt, DenseNet, and EfficientNet, using three transfer learning approaches: linear probing, fine-tuning, and a combined approach, to classify eleven harmful phytoplankton genera from microscopic images. The best performance was achieved by ResNet-50 using the fine-tuning approach, with an accuracy of 96.97%. The results also revealed that the models struggled to differentiate between four harmful phytoplankton types with similar morphological features.

- **Summary**: In this study, we implemented a two-stage deep learning-based approach to segment lesions in PET/CT images for the AutoPET III challenge. The first stage utilized a DynUNet model for coarse segmentation, identifying broad regions of interest. The second stage refined this segmentation using an ensemble of SwinUNETR, SegResNet, and UNet models. Preprocessing involved resampling images to a common resolution and normalization, while data augmentation techniques such as affine transformations and intensity adjustments were applied to enhance model generalization. The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% validation, excluding healthy cases. This method leverages multi-stage segmentation and model ensembling to achieve precise lesion segmentation, aiming to improve robustness and overall performance.

- **Summary**: The challenging deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision (CV) algorithms at the edge pushes the community of embedded computing to examine heterogeneous System-on-Chips (SoCs). Such novel computing platforms provide increased diversity in interfaces, processors and storage, however, the efficient partitioning and mapping of AI/CV workloads still remains an open issue. In this context, the current paper develops a hybrid AI/CV system on Intel's Movidius Myriad X, which is an heterogeneous Vision Processing Unit (VPU), for initializing and tracking the satellite's pose in space missions. The space industry is among the communities examining alternative computing platforms to comply with the tight constraints of on-board data processing, while it is also striving to adopt functionalities from the AI domain. At algorithmic level, we rely on the ResNet-50-based UrsoNet network along with a custom classical CV pipeline. For efficient acceleration, we exploit the SoC's neural compute engine and 16 vector processors by combining multiple parallelization and low-level optimization techniques. The proposed single-chip, robust-estimation, and real-time solution delivers a throughput of up to 5 FPS for 1-MegaPixel RGB images within a limited power envelope of 2W.

- **Summary**: The robust self-training (RST) framework has emerged as a prominent approach for semi-supervised adversarial training. To explore the possibility of tackling more complicated tasks with even lower labeling budgets, unlike prior approaches that rely on robust pretrained models, we present SNORD - a simple yet effective framework that introduces contemporary semi-supervised learning techniques into the realm of adversarial training. By enhancing pseudo labels and managing noisy training data more effectively, SNORD showcases impressive, state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets and labeling budgets, all without the need for pretrained models. Compared to full adversarial supervision, SNORD achieves a 90% relative robust accuracy under epsilon = 8/255 AutoAttack, requiring less than 0.1%, 2%, and 10% labels for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet-200, respectively. Additional experiments confirm the efficacy of each component and demonstrate the adaptability of integrating SNORD with existing adversarial pretraining strategies to further bolster robustness.

- **Summary**: Visual counterfactual explanation (CF) methods modify image concepts, e.g, shape, to change a prediction to a predefined outcome while closely resembling the original query image. Unlike self-explainable models (SEMs) and heatmap techniques, they grant users the ability to examine hypothetical "what-if" scenarios. Previous CF methods either entail post-hoc training, limiting the balance between transparency and CF quality, or demand optimization during inference. To bridge the gap between transparent SEMs and CF methods, we introduce the GdVAE, a self-explainable model based on a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), featuring a Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA) classifier and integrated CF explanations. Full transparency is achieved through a generative classifier that leverages class-specific prototypes for the downstream task and a closed-form solution for CFs in the latent space. The consistency of CFs is improved by regularizing the latent space with the explainer function. Extensive comparisons with existing approaches affirm the effectiveness of our method in producing high-quality CF explanations while preserving transparency. Code and models are public.

- **Summary**: Existing vision-language understanding benchmarks largely consist of images of objects in their usual contexts. As a consequence, recent multimodal large language models can perform well with only a shallow visual understanding by relying on background language biases. Thus, strong performance on these benchmarks does not necessarily correlate with strong visual understanding. In this paper, we release JourneyBench, a comprehensive human-annotated benchmark of generated images designed to assess the model's fine-grained multimodal reasoning abilities across five tasks: complementary multimodal chain of thought, multi-image VQA, imaginary image captioning, VQA with hallucination triggers, and fine-grained retrieval with sample-specific distractors. Unlike existing benchmarks, JourneyBench explicitly requires fine-grained multimodal reasoning in unusual imaginary scenarios where language bias and holistic image gist are insufficient. We benchmark state-of-the-art models on JourneyBench and analyze performance along a number of fine-grained dimensions. Results across all five tasks show that JourneyBench is exceptionally challenging for even the best models, indicating that models' visual reasoning abilities are not as strong as they first appear. We discuss the implications of our findings and propose avenues for further research.

- **Summary**: Gaussian splatting has demonstrated excellent performance for view synthesis and scene reconstruction. The representation achieves photorealistic quality by optimizing the position, scale, color, and opacity of thousands to millions of 2D or 3D Gaussian primitives within a scene. However, since each Gaussian primitive encodes both appearance and geometry, these attributes are strongly coupled--thus, high-fidelity appearance modeling requires a large number of Gaussian primitives, even when the scene geometry is simple (e.g., for a textured planar surface). We propose to texture each 2D Gaussian primitive so that even a single Gaussian can be used to capture appearance details. By employing per-primitive texturing, our appearance representation is agnostic to the topology and complexity of the scene's geometry. We show that our approach, GStex, yields improved visual quality over prior work in texturing Gaussian splats. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our decoupling enables improved novel view synthesis performance compared to 2D Gaussian splatting when reducing the number of Gaussian primitives, and that GStex can be used for scene appearance editing and re-texturing.

- **Summary**: The increasing demand for high-quality 3D assets across various industries necessitates efficient and automated 3D content creation. Despite recent advancements in 3D generative models, existing methods still face challenges with optimization speed, geometric fidelity, and the lack of assets for physically based rendering (PBR). In this paper, we introduce 3DTopia-XL, a scalable native 3D generative model designed to overcome these limitations. 3DTopia-XL leverages a novel primitive-based 3D representation, PrimX, which encodes detailed shape, albedo, and material field into a compact tensorial format, facilitating the modeling of high-resolution geometry with PBR assets. On top of the novel representation, we propose a generative framework based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT), which comprises 1) Primitive Patch Compression, 2) and Latent Primitive Diffusion. 3DTopia-XL learns to generate high-quality 3D assets from textual or visual inputs. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate that 3DTopia-XL significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality 3D assets with fine-grained textures and materials, efficiently bridging the quality gap between generative models and real-world applications.

- **Summary**: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has paved the way for AI search engines, e.g., SearchGPT, showcasing a new paradigm in human-internet interaction. However, most current AI search engines are limited to text-only settings, neglecting the multimodal user queries and the text-image interleaved nature of website information. Recently, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made impressive strides. Yet, whether they can function as AI search engines remains under-explored, leaving the potential of LMMs in multimodal search an open question. To this end, we first design a delicate pipeline, MMSearch-Engine, to empower any LMMs with multimodal search capabilities. On top of this, we introduce MMSearch, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark to assess the multimodal search performance of LMMs. The curated dataset contains 300 manually collected instances spanning 14 subfields, which involves no overlap with the current LMMs' training data, ensuring the correct answer can only be obtained within searching. By using MMSearch-Engine, the LMMs are evaluated by performing three individual tasks (requery, rerank, and summarization), and one challenging end-to-end task with a complete searching process. We conduct extensive experiments on closed-source and open-source LMMs. Among all tested models, GPT-4o with MMSearch-Engine achieves the best results, which surpasses the commercial product, Perplexity Pro, in the end-to-end task, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline. We further present error analysis to unveil current LMMs still struggle to fully grasp the multimodal search tasks, and conduct ablation study to indicate the potential of scaling test-time computation for AI search engine. We hope MMSearch may provide unique insights to guide the future development of multimodal AI search engine. Project Page: https://mmsearch.github.io

- **Summary**: We propose the first video diffusion framework for reference-based lineart video colorization. Unlike previous works that rely solely on image generative models to colorize lineart frame by frame, our approach leverages a large-scale pretrained video diffusion model to generate colorized animation videos. This approach leads to more temporally consistent results and is better equipped to handle large motions. Firstly, we introduce Sketch-guided ControlNet which provides additional control to finetune an image-to-video diffusion model for controllable video synthesis, enabling the generation of animation videos conditioned on lineart. We then propose Reference Attention to facilitate the transfer of colors from the reference frame to other frames containing fast and expansive motions. Finally, we present a novel scheme for sequential sampling, incorporating the Overlapped Blending Module and Prev-Reference Attention, to extend the video diffusion model beyond its original fixed-length limitation for long video colorization. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of frame and video quality, as well as temporal consistency. Moreover, our method is capable of generating high-quality, long temporal-consistent animation videos with large motions, which is not achievable in previous works. Our code and model are available at https://luckyhzt.github.io/lvcd.

- **Summary**: Visual data comes in various forms, ranging from small icons of just a few pixels to long videos spanning hours. Existing multi-modal LLMs usually standardize these diverse visual inputs to a fixed resolution for visual encoders and yield similar numbers of tokens for LLMs. This approach is non-optimal for multimodal understanding and inefficient for processing inputs with long and short visual contents. To solve the problem, we propose Oryx, a unified multimodal architecture for the spatial-temporal understanding of images, videos, and multi-view 3D scenes. Oryx offers an on-demand solution to seamlessly and efficiently process visual inputs with arbitrary spatial sizes and temporal lengths through two core innovations: 1) a pre-trained OryxViT model that can encode images at any resolution into LLM-friendly visual representations; 2) a dynamic compressor module that supports 1x to 16x compression on visual tokens by request. These design features enable Oryx to accommodate extremely long visual contexts, such as videos, with lower resolution and high compression while maintaining high recognition precision for tasks like document understanding with native resolution and no compression. Beyond the architectural improvements, enhanced data curation and specialized training on long-context retrieval and spatial-aware data help Oryx achieve strong capabilities in image, video, and 3D multimodal understanding simultaneously.

- **Summary**: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) inspire various strategies for integrating video modalities. A key approach is Video-LLMs, which incorporate an optimizable interface linking sophisticated video encoders to LLMs. However, due to computation and data limitations, these Video-LLMs are typically pre-trained to process only short videos, limiting their broader application for understanding longer video content. Additionally, fine-tuning Video-LLMs to handle longer videos is cost-prohibitive. Consequently, it becomes essential to explore the interpolation of Video-LLMs under a completely training-free setting. In this paper, we first identify the primary challenges in interpolating Video-LLMs: (1) the video encoder and modality alignment projector are fixed, preventing the integration of additional frames into Video-LLMs, and (2) the LLM backbone is limited in its content length capabilities, which complicates the processing of an increased number of video tokens. To address these challenges, we propose a specific INTerPolation method for Video-LLMs (INTP-Video-LLMs). We introduce an alternative video token rearrangement technique that circumvents limitations imposed by the fixed video encoder and alignment projector. Furthermore, we introduce a training-free LLM context window extension method to enable Video-LLMs to understand a correspondingly increased number of visual tokens.

- **Summary**: Text-based diffusion video editing systems have been successful in performing edits with high fidelity and textual alignment. However, this success is limited to rigid-type editing such as style transfer and object overlay, while preserving the original structure of the input video. This limitation stems from an initial latent noise employed in diffusion video editing systems. The diffusion video editing systems prepare initial latent noise to edit by gradually infusing Gaussian noise onto the input video. However, we observed that the visual structure of the input video still persists within this initial latent noise, thereby restricting non-rigid editing such as motion change necessitating structural modifications. To this end, this paper proposes Dilutional Noise Initialization (DNI) framework which enables editing systems to perform precise and dynamic modification including non-rigid editing. DNI introduces a concept of `noise dilution' which adds further noise to the latent noise in the region to be edited to soften the structural rigidity imposed by input video, resulting in more effective edits closer to the target prompt. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the DNI framework.

- **Summary**: The application of deep learning in medical imaging has significantly advanced diagnostic capabilities, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency. Despite these benefits, the lack of transparency in these AI models, often termed "black boxes," raises concerns about their reliability in clinical settings. Explainable AI (XAI) aims to mitigate these concerns by developing methods that make AI decisions understandable and trustworthy. In this study, we propose Tumor Aware Counterfactual Explanations (TACE), a framework designed to generate reliable counterfactual explanations for medical images. Unlike existing methods, TACE focuses on modifying tumor-specific features without altering the overall organ structure, ensuring the faithfulness of the counterfactuals. We achieve this by including an additional step in the generation process which allows to modify only the region of interest (ROI), thus yielding more reliable counterfactuals as the rest of the organ remains unchanged. We evaluate our method on mammography images and brain MRI. We find that our method far exceeds existing state-of-the-art techniques in quality, faithfulness, and generation speed of counterfactuals. Indeed, more faithful explanations lead to a significant improvement in classification success rates, with a 10.69% increase for breast cancer and a 98.02% increase for brain tumors. The code of our work is available at https://github.com/ispamm/TACE.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based speech generators are ubiquitous. These methods can generate very high quality synthetic speech and several recent incidents report their malicious use. To counter such misuse, synthetic speech detectors have been developed. Many of these detectors are trained on datasets which do not include diffusion-based synthesizers. In this paper, we demonstrate that existing detectors trained on one such dataset, ASVspoof2019, do not perform well in detecting synthetic speech from recent diffusion-based synthesizers. We propose the Diffusion-Based Synthetic Speech Dataset (DiffSSD), a dataset consisting of about 200 hours of labeled speech, including synthetic speech generated by 8 diffusion-based open-source and 2 commercial generators. We also examine the performance of existing synthetic speech detectors on DiffSSD in both closed-set and open-set scenarios. The results highlight the importance of this dataset in detecting synthetic speech generated from recent open-source and commercial speech generators.

- **Summary**: Real-time SLAM with dense 3D mapping is computationally challenging, especially on resource-limited devices. The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a promising approach for real-time dense 3D reconstruction. However, existing 3DGS-based SLAM systems struggle to balance hardware simplicity, speed, and map quality. Most systems excel in one or two of the aforementioned aspects but rarely achieve all. A key issue is the difficulty of initializing 3D Gaussians while concurrently conducting SLAM. To address these challenges, we present Monocular GSO (MGSO), a novel real-time SLAM system that integrates photometric SLAM with 3DGS. Photometric SLAM provides dense structured point clouds for 3DGS initialization, accelerating optimization and producing more efficient maps with fewer Gaussians. As a result, experiments show that our system generates reconstructions with a balance of quality, memory efficiency, and speed that outperforms the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our system achieves all results using RGB inputs. We evaluate the Replica, TUM-RGBD, and EuRoC datasets against current live dense reconstruction systems. Not only do we surpass contemporary systems, but experiments also show that we maintain our performance on laptop hardware, making it a practical solution for robotics, A/R, and other real-time applications.

- **Summary**: Palmprint recognition has emerged as a prominent biometric authentication method, owing to its high discriminative power and user-friendly nature. This paper introduces a novel Cross-Chirality Palmprint Verification (CCPV) framework that challenges the conventional wisdom in traditional palmprint verification systems. Unlike existing methods that typically require storing both left and right palmprints, our approach enables verification using either palm while storing only one palmprint template. The core of our CCPV framework lies in a carefully designed matching rule. This rule involves flipping both the gallery and query palmprints and calculating the average distance between each pair as the final matching distance. This approach effectively reduces matching variance and enhances overall system robustness. We introduce a novel cross-chirality loss function to construct a discriminative and robust cross-chirality feature space. This loss enforces representation consistency across four palmprint variants: left, right, flipped left, and flipped right. The resulting compact feature space, coupled with the model's enhanced discriminative representation capability, ensures robust performance across various scenarios. We conducted extensive experiments to validate the efficacy of our proposed method. The evaluation encompassed multiple public datasets and considered both closed-set and open-set settings. The results demonstrate the CCPV framework's effectiveness and highlight its potential for real-world applications in palmprint authentication systems.

- **Summary**: The use of guidance in diffusion models was originally motivated by the premise that the guidance-modified score is that of the data distribution tilted by a conditional likelihood raised to some power. In this work we clarify this misconception by rigorously proving that guidance fails to sample from the intended tilted distribution.   Our main result is to give a fine-grained characterization of the dynamics of guidance in two cases, (1) mixtures of compactly supported distributions and (2) mixtures of Gaussians, which reflect salient properties of guidance that manifest on real-world data. In both cases, we prove that as the guidance parameter increases, the guided model samples more heavily from the boundary of the support of the conditional distribution. We also prove that for any nonzero level of score estimation error, sufficiently large guidance will result in sampling away from the support, theoretically justifying the empirical finding that large guidance results in distorted generations.   In addition to verifying these results empirically in synthetic settings, we also show how our theoretical insights can offer useful prescriptions for practical deployment.

- **Summary**: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) /Computed Tomography (CT) is crucial for diagnosing, managing, and planning treatment for various cancers. Developing reliable deep learning models for the segmentation of tumor lesions in PET/CT scans in a multi-tracer multicenter environment, is a critical area of research. Different tracers, such as Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), have distinct physiological uptake patterns and data from different centers often vary in terms of acquisition protocols, scanner types, and patient populations. Because of this variability, it becomes more difficult to design reliable segmentation algorithms and generalization techniques due to variations in image quality and lesion detectability. To address this challenge, We trained a 3D Residual encoder U-Net within the no new U-Net framework, aiming to generalize the performance of automatic lesion segmentation of whole body PET/CT scans, across different tracers and clinical sites. Further, We explored several preprocessing techniques and ultimately settled on using the Total Segmentator to crop our training data. Additionally, we applied resampling during this process. During inference, we leveraged test-time augmentations and other post-processing techniques to enhance tumor lesion segmentation. Our team currently hold the top position in the Auto-PET III challenge and outperformed the challenge baseline model in the preliminary test set with Dice score of 0.9627.

- **Summary**: Since the publication of CLIP, the approach of using InfoNCE loss for contrastive pre-training has become widely popular for bridging two or more modalities. Despite its wide adoption, CLIP's original design choices of L2 normalization and cosine similarity logit have rarely been revisited. We have systematically experimented with alternative geometries and softmax logits for language-image pre-training and identified that variants with intuitive Euclidean geometry, Euclidean CLIP (EuCLIP), match or exceed the performance of CLIP and support hierarchical relationships at least as well as more complicated hyperbolic alternative.

- **Summary**: Students often drift in and out of focus during class. Effective teachers recognize this and re-engage them when necessary. With the shift to remote learning, teachers have lost the visual feedback needed to adapt to varying student engagement. We propose using readily available front-facing video to infer attention levels based on movements of the eyes, head, and face. We train a deep learning model to predict a measure of attention based on overt eye movements. Specifically, we measure Inter-Subject Correlation of eye movements in ten-second intervals while students watch the same educational videos. In 3 different experiments (N=83) we show that the trained model predicts this objective metric of attention on unseen data with $R^2$=0.38, and on unseen subjects with $R^2$=0.26-0.30. The deep network relies mostly on a student's eye movements, but to some extent also on movements of the brows, cheeks, and head. In contrast to Inter-Subject Correlation of the eyes, the model can estimate attentional engagement from individual students' movements without needing reference data from an attentive group. This enables a much broader set of online applications. The solution is lightweight and can operate on the client side, which mitigates some of the privacy concerns associated with online attention monitoring.

- **Summary**: We investigate a human-like interpretable model of video understanding. Humans recognise complex activities in video by recognising critical spatio-temporal relations among explicitly recognised objects and parts, for example, an object entering the aperture of a container. To mimic this we build on a model which uses positions of objects and hands, and their motions, to recognise the activity taking place. To improve this model we focussed on three of the most confused classes (for this model) and identified that the lack of 3D information was the major problem. To address this we extended our basic model by adding 3D awareness in two ways: (1) A state-of-the-art object detection model was fine-tuned to determine the difference between "Container" and "NotContainer" in order to integrate object shape information into the existing object features. (2) A state-of-the-art depth estimation model was used to extract depth values for individual objects and calculate depth relations to expand the existing relations used our interpretable model. These 3D extensions to our basic model were evaluated on a subset of three superficially similar "Putting" actions from the Something-Something-v2 dataset. The results showed that the container detector did not improve performance, but the addition of depth relations made a significant improvement to performance.

- **Summary**: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lower potential risks linked to radiation exposure while relying on advanced denoising algorithms to maintain diagnostic quality in reconstructed images. The reigning paradigm in LDCT denoising is based on neural network models that learn data-driven image priors to separate noise evoked by dose reduction from underlying tissue signals. Naturally, the fidelity of these priors depend on the model's ability to capture the broad range of contextual features evident in CT images. Earlier convolutional neural networks (CNN) are highly adept at efficiently capturing short-range spatial context, but their limited receptive fields reduce sensitivity to interactions over longer distances. Although transformers based on self-attention mechanisms have recently been posed to increase sensitivity to long-range context, they can suffer from suboptimal performance and efficiency due to elevated model complexity, particularly for high-resolution CT images. For high-quality restoration of LDCT images, here we introduce DenoMamba, a novel denoising method based on state-space modeling (SSM), that efficiently captures short- and long-range context in medical images. Following an hourglass architecture with encoder-decoder stages, DenoMamba employs a spatial SSM module to encode spatial context and a novel channel SSM module equipped with a secondary gated convolution network to encode latent features of channel context at each stage. Feature maps from the two modules are then consolidated with low-level input features via a convolution fusion module (CFM). Comprehensive experiments on LDCT datasets with 25\% and 10\% dose reduction demonstrate that DenoMamba outperforms state-of-the-art denoisers with average improvements of 1.4dB PSNR, 1.1% SSIM, and 1.6% RMSE in recovered image quality.

- **Summary**: Current state-of-the-art residential irrigation systems, such as WaterMyYard, rely on rainfall data from nearby weather stations to adjust irrigation amounts. However, the accuracy of rainfall data is compromised by the limited spatial resolution of rain gauges and the significant variability of hyperlocal rainfall, leading to substantial water waste. To improve irrigation efficiency, we developed a cost-effective irrigation system, dubbed ERIC, which employs machine learning models to estimate rainfall from commodity doorbell camera footage and optimizes irrigation schedules without human intervention. Specifically, we: a) designed novel visual and audio features with lightweight neural network models to infer rainfall from the camera at the edge, preserving user privacy; b) built a complete end-to-end irrigation system on Raspberry Pi 4, costing only $75. We deployed the system across five locations (collecting over 750 hours of video) with varying backgrounds and light conditions. Comprehensive evaluation validates that ERIC achieves state-of-the-art rainfall estimation performance (~ 5mm/day), saving 9,112 gallons/month of water, translating to $28.56/month in utility savings.

- **Summary**: Data-driven visual-inertial odometry (VIO) has received highlights for its performance since VIOs are a crucial compartment in autonomous robots. However, their deployment on resource-constrained devices is non-trivial since large network parameters should be accommodated in the device memory. Furthermore, these networks may risk failure post-deployment due to environmental distribution shifts at test time. In light of this, we propose UL-VIO -- an ultra-lightweight (<1M) VIO network capable of test-time adaptation (TTA) based on visual-inertial consistency. Specifically, we perform model compression to the network while preserving the low-level encoder part, including all BatchNorm parameters for resource-efficient test-time adaptation. It achieves 36X smaller network size than state-of-the-art with a minute increase in error -- 1% on the KITTI dataset. For test-time adaptation, we propose to use the inertia-referred network outputs as pseudo labels and update the BatchNorm parameter for lightweight yet effective adaptation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to perform noise-robust TTA on VIO. Experimental results on the KITTI, EuRoC, and Marulan datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our resource-efficient adaptation method under diverse TTA scenarios with dynamic domain shifts.

- **Summary**: Improving the automatic and timely recognition of construction and demolition waste (C&DW) composition is crucial for enhancing business returns, economic outcomes, and sustainability. Technologies like computer vision, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and internet of things (IoT) are increasingly integrated into waste processing to achieve these goals. While deep learning (DL) models show promise in recognising homogeneous C&DW piles, few studies assess their performance with mixed, highly contaminated material in commercial settings. Drawing on extensive experience at a C&DW materials recovery facility (MRF) in Sydney, Australia, we explore the challenges and opportunities in developing an advanced automated mixed C&DW management system. We begin with an overview of the evolution of waste management in the construction industry, highlighting its environmental, economic, and societal impacts. We review various C&DW analysis techniques, concluding that DL-based visual methods are the optimal solution. Additionally, we examine the progression of sensor and camera technologies for C&DW analysis as well as the evolution of DL algorithms focused on object detection and material segmentation. We also discuss C&DW datasets, their curation, and innovative methods for their creation. Finally, we share insights on C&DW visual analysis, addressing technical and commercial challenges, research trends, and future directions for mixed C&DW analysis. This paper aims to improve the efficiency of C&DW management by providing valuable insights for ongoing and future research and development efforts in this critical sector.

- **Summary**: The field of medical diagnostics has witnessed a transformative convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and healthcare data, offering promising avenues for enhancing patient care and disease comprehension. However, this integration of multimodal data, specifically histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) and genetic sequencing data, presents unique challenges due to modality disparities and the need for scalable computational solutions. This paper addresses the scarcity of multimodal solutions, primarily centered around unimodal data solutions, thus limiting the realization of the rich insights that can be derived from integrating images and genomic data. Here, we introduce MarbliX ``Multimodal Association and Retrieval with Binary Latent Indexed matriX,'' an innovative multimodal framework that integrates histopathology images with immunogenomic sequencing data, encapsulating them into a concise binary patient code, referred to as ``monogram.'' This binary representation facilitates the establishment of a comprehensive archive, enabling clinicians to match similar cases. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of MarbliX to empower healthcare professionals with in-depth insights, leading to more precise diagnoses, reduced variability, and expanded personalized treatment options, particularly in the context of cancer.

- **Summary**: Generative models can enhance discriminative classifiers by constructing complex feature spaces, thereby improving performance on intricate datasets. Conventional methods typically augment datasets with more detailed feature representations or increase dimensionality to make nonlinear data linearly separable. Utilizing a generative model solely for feature space processing falls short of unlocking its full potential within a classifier and typically lacks a solid theoretical foundation. We base our approach on a novel hypothesis: the probability information (logit) derived from a single model training can be used to generate the equivalent of multiple training sessions. Leveraging the central limit theorem, this synthesized probability information is anticipated to converge toward the true probability more accurately. To achieve this goal, we propose the Bernoulli-Gaussian Decision Block (BGDB), a novel module inspired by the Central Limit Theorem and the concept that the mean of multiple Bernoulli trials approximates the probability of success in a single trial. Specifically, we utilize Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (IDDPM) to model the probability of Bernoulli Trials. Our approach shifts the focus from reconstructing features to reconstructing logits, transforming the logit from a single iteration into logits analogous to those from multiple experiments. We provide the theoretical foundations of our approach through mathematical analysis and validate its effectiveness through experimental evaluation using various datasets for multiple imaging tasks, including both classification and segmentation.

- **Summary**: Early diagnosis and intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been shown to significantly improve the quality of life of autistic individuals. However, diagnostics methods for ASD rely on assessments based on clinical presentation that are prone to bias and can be challenging to arrive at an early diagnosis. There is a need for objective biomarkers of ASD which can help improve diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning (DL) has achieved outstanding performance in diagnosing diseases and conditions from medical imaging data. Extensive research has been conducted on creating models that classify ASD using resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. However, existing models lack interpretability. This research aims to improve the accuracy and interpretability of ASD diagnosis by creating a DL model that can not only accurately classify ASD but also provide explainable insights into its working. The dataset used is a preprocessed version of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) with 884 samples. Our findings show a model that can accurately classify ASD and highlight critical brain regions differing between ASD and typical controls, with potential implications for early diagnosis and understanding of the neural basis of ASD. These findings are validated by studies in the literature that use different datasets and modalities, confirming that the model actually learned characteristics of ASD and not just the dataset. This study advances the field of explainable AI in medical imaging by providing a robust and interpretable model, thereby contributing to a future with objective and reliable ASD diagnostics.
