- **Summary**: Federated learning provides a privacy-preserving manner to collaboratively train models on data distributed over multiple local clients via the coordination of a global server. In this paper, we focus on label distribution skew in federated learning, where due to the different user behavior of the client, label distributions between different clients are significantly different. When faced with such cases, most existing methods will lead to a suboptimal optimization due to the inadequate utilization of label distribution information in clients. Inspired by this, we propose a label-masking distillation approach termed FedLMD to facilitate federated learning via perceiving the various label distributions of each client. We classify the labels into majority and minority labels based on the number of examples per class during training. The client model learns the knowledge of majority labels from local data. The process of distillation masks out the predictions of majority labels from the global model, so that it can focus more on preserving the minority label knowledge of the client. A series of experiments show that the proposed approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance in various cases. Moreover, considering the limited resources of the clients, we propose a variant FedLMD-Tf that does not require an additional teacher, which outperforms previous lightweight approaches without increasing computational costs.

- **Summary**: Interpreting the predictions of a black-box deep network can facilitate the reliability of its deployment. In this work, we propose a re-label distillation approach to learn a direct map from the input to the prediction in a self-supervision manner. The image is projected into a VAE subspace to generate some synthetic images by randomly perturbing its latent vector. Then, these synthetic images can be annotated into one of two classes by identifying whether their labels shift. After that, using the labels annotated by the deep network as teacher, a linear student model is trained to approximate the annotations by mapping these synthetic images to the classes. In this manner, these re-labeled synthetic images can well describe the local classification mechanism of the deep network, and the learned student can provide a more intuitive explanation towards the predictions. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our approach qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Multibeam echo-sounder (MBES) is the de-facto sensor for bathymetry mapping. In recent years, cheaper MBES sensors and global mapping initiatives have led to exponential growth of available data. However, raw MBES data contains 1-25% of noise that requires semi-automatic filtering using tools such as Combined Uncertainty and Bathymetric Estimator (CUBE). In this work, we draw inspirations from the 3D point cloud community and adapted a score-based point cloud denoising network for MBES outlier detection and denoising. We trained and evaluated this network on real MBES survey data. The proposed method was found to outperform classical methods, and can be readily integrated into existing MBES standard workflow. To facilitate future research, the code and pretrained model are available online.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of multiple organs and the differentiation of pathological tissues in medical imaging are crucial but challenging, especially for nuanced classifications and ambiguous organ boundaries. To tackle these challenges, we introduce GASA-UNet, a refined U-Net-like model featuring a novel Global Axial Self-Attention (GASA) block. This block processes image data as a 3D entity, with each 2D plane representing a different anatomical cross-section. Voxel features are defined within this spatial context, and a Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanism is utilized on extracted 1D patches to facilitate connections across these planes. Positional embeddings (PE) are incorporated into our attention framework, enriching voxel features with spatial context and enhancing tissue classification and organ edge delineation. Our model has demonstrated promising improvements in segmentation performance, particularly for smaller anatomical structures, as evidenced by enhanced Dice scores and Normalized Surface Dice (NSD) on three benchmark datasets, i.e., BTCV, AMOS, and KiTS23.

- **Summary**: In the digital era, table structure recognition technology is a critical tool for processing and analyzing large volumes of tabular data. Previous methods primarily focus on visual aspects of table structure recovery but often fail to effectively comprehend the textual semantics within tables, particularly for descriptive textual cells. In this paper, we introduce UniTabNet, a novel framework for table structure parsing based on the image-to-text model. UniTabNet employs a ``divide-and-conquer'' strategy, utilizing an image-to-text model to decouple table cells and integrating both physical and logical decoders to reconstruct the complete table structure. We further enhance our framework with the Vision Guider, which directs the model's focus towards pertinent areas, thereby boosting prediction accuracy. Additionally, we introduce the Language Guider to refine the model's capability to understand textual semantics in table images. Evaluated on prominent table structure datasets such as PubTabNet, PubTables1M, WTW, and iFLYTAB, UniTabNet achieves a new state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach. The code will also be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Accurate feature detection is fundamental for various computer vision tasks, including autonomous robotics, 3D reconstruction, medical imaging, and remote sensing. Despite advancements in enhancing the robustness of visual features, no existing method measures the utility of visual information before processing by specific feature-type algorithms. To address this gap, we introduce PIXER and the concept of "Featureness," which reflects the inherent interest and reliability of visual information for robust recognition, independent of any specific feature type. Leveraging a generalization on Bayesian learning, our approach quantifies both the probability and uncertainty of a pixel's contribution to robust visual utility in a single-shot process, avoiding costly operations such as Monte Carlo sampling and permitting customizable featureness definitions adaptable to a wide range of applications. We evaluate PIXER on visual odometry with featureness selectivity, achieving an average of 31% improvement in RMSE trajectory with 49% fewer features.

- **Summary**: Training deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) presents unique challenges, including the pervasive issue of elimination singularities, consistent deactivation of nodes leading to degenerate manifolds within the loss landscape. These singularities impede efficient learning by disrupting feature propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Pool Skip, an architectural enhancement that strategically combines a Max Pooling, a Max Unpooling, a 3 times 3 convolution, and a skip connection. This configuration helps stabilize the training process and maintain feature integrity across layers. We also propose the Weight Inertia hypothesis, which underpins the development of Pool Skip, providing theoretical insights into mitigating degradation caused by elimination singularities through dimensional and affine compensation. We evaluate our method on a variety of benchmarks, focusing on both 2D natural and 3D medical imaging applications, including tasks such as classification and segmentation. Our findings highlight Pool Skip's effectiveness in facilitating more robust CNN training and improving model performance.

- **Summary**: Object-centric surface reconstruction from multi-view images is crucial in creating editable digital assets for AR/VR. Due to the lack of geometric constraints, existing methods, e.g., NeuS necessitate annotating the object masks to reconstruct compact surfaces in mesh processing. Mask annotation, however, incurs considerable labor costs due to its cumbersome nature. This paper presents Hi-NeuS, a novel rendering-based framework for neural implicit surface reconstruction, aiming to recover compact and precise surfaces without multi-view object masks. Our key insight is that the overlapping regions in the object-centric views naturally highlight the object of interest as the camera orbits around objects. The object of interest can be specified by estimating the distribution of the rendering weights accumulated from multiple views, which implicitly identifies the surface that a user intends to capture. This inspires us to design a geometric refinement approach, which takes multi-view rendering weights to guide the signed distance functions (SDF) of neural surfaces in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, it retains these weights to resample a pseudo surface based on their distribution. This facilitates the alignment of the SDF to the object of interest. We then regularize the SDF's bias for geometric consistency. Moreover, we propose to use unmasked Chamfer Distance(CD) to measure the extracted mesh without post-processing for more precise evaluation. Our approach has been validated through NeuS and its variant Neuralangelo, demonstrating its adaptability across different NeuS backbones. Extensive benchmark on the DTU dataset shows that our method reduces surface noise by about 20%, and improves the unmasked CD by around 30%, achieving better surface details. The superiority of Hi-NeuS is further validated on BlendedMVS and handheld camera captures for content creation.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViT) are current high-performance models of choice for various vision applications. Recent developments have given rise to biologically inspired spiking transformers that thrive in ultra-low power operations on neuromorphic hardware, however, without fully unlocking the potential of spiking neural networks. We introduce DS2TA, a Denoising Spiking transformer with attenuated SpatioTemporal Attention, designed specifically for vision applications. DS2TA introduces a new spiking attenuated spatiotemporal attention mechanism that considers input firing correlations occurring in both time and space, thereby fully harnessing the computational power of spiking neurons at the core of the transformer architecture. Importantly, DS2TA facilitates parameter-efficient spatiotemporal attention computation without introducing extra weights. DS2TA employs efficient hashmap-based nonlinear spiking attention denoisers to enhance the robustness and expressive power of spiking attention maps. DS2TA demonstrates state-of-the-art performances on several widely adopted static image and dynamic neuromorphic datasets. Operated over 4 time steps, DS2TA achieves 94.92% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR10 and 77.47% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR100, as well as 79.1% and 94.44% on CIFAR10-DVS and DVS-Gesture using 10 time steps.

- **Summary**: Detecting anomalies within point clouds is crucial for various industrial applications, but traditional unsupervised methods face challenges due to data acquisition costs, early-stage production constraints, and limited generalization across product categories. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Multi-View Projection (MVP) framework, leveraging pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to detect anomalies. Specifically, MVP projects point cloud data into multi-view depth images, thereby translating point cloud anomaly detection into image anomaly detection. Following zero-shot image anomaly detection methods, pre-trained VLMs are utilized to detect anomalies on these depth images. Given that pre-trained VLMs are not inherently tailored for zero-shot point cloud anomaly detection and may lack specificity, we propose the integration of learnable visual and adaptive text prompting techniques to fine-tune these VLMs, thereby enhancing their detection performance. Extensive experiments on the MVTec 3D-AD and Real3D-AD demonstrate our proposed MVP framework's superior zero-shot anomaly detection performance and the prompting techniques' effectiveness. Real-world evaluations on automotive plastic part inspection further showcase that the proposed method can also be generalized to practical unseen scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/hustCYQ/MVP-PCLIP.

- **Summary**: The stochastic formation of defects during Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) negatively impacts its adoption for high-precision use cases. Optical monitoring techniques can be used to identify defects based on layer-wise imaging, but these methods are difficult to scale to high resolutions due to cost and memory constraints. Therefore, we implement generative deep learning models to link low-cost, low-resolution images of the build plate to detailed high-resolution optical images of the build plate, enabling cost-efficient process monitoring. To do so, a conditional latent probabilistic diffusion model is trained to produce realistic high-resolution images of the build plate from low-resolution webcam images, recovering the distribution of small-scale features and surface roughness. We first evaluate the performance of the model by analyzing the reconstruction quality of the generated images using peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and wavelet covariance metrics that describe the preservation of high-frequency information. Additionally, we design a framework based upon the Segment Anything foundation model to recreate the 3D morphology of the printed part and analyze the surface roughness of the reconstructed samples. Finally, we explore the zero-shot generalization capabilities of the implemented framework to other part geometries by creating synthetic low-resolution data.

- **Summary**: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) enhances generalization by reducing a Max-Sharpness (MaxS). Despite the practical success, we empirically found that the MAxS behind SAM's generalization enhancements face the "Flatness Indicator Problem" (FIP), where SAM only considers the flatness in the direction of gradient ascent, resulting in a next minimization region that is not sufficiently flat. A better Flatness Indicator (FI) would bring a better generalization of neural networks. Because SAM is a greedy search method in nature. In this paper, we propose to utilize the difference between the training loss and the minimum loss over the neighborhood surrounding the current weight, which we denote as Min-Sharpness (MinS). By merging MaxS and MinS, we created a better FI that indicates a flatter direction during the optimization. Specially, we combine this FI with SAM into the proposed Bilateral SAM (BSAM) which finds a more flatter minimum than that of SAM. The theoretical analysis proves that BSAM converges to local minima. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSAM offers superior generalization performance and robustness compared to vanilla SAM across various tasks, i.e., classification, transfer learning, human pose estimation, and network quantization.

- **Summary**: Recently, driven by advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), Vision Language Action Models (VLAMs) are being proposed to achieve better performance in open-vocabulary scenarios for robotic manipulation tasks. Since manipulation tasks involve direct interaction with the physical world, ensuring robustness and safety during the execution of this task is always a very critical issue. In this paper, by synthesizing current safety research on MLLMs and the specific application scenarios of the manipulation task in the physical world, we comprehensively evaluate VLAMs in the face of potential physical threats. Specifically, we propose the Physical Vulnerability Evaluating Pipeline (PVEP) that can incorporate as many visual modal physical threats as possible for evaluating the physical robustness of VLAMs. The physical threats in PVEP specifically include Out-of-Distribution, Typography-based Visual Prompt, and Adversarial Patch Attacks. By comparing the performance fluctuations of VLAMs before and after being attacked, we provide generalizable \textbf{\textit{Analyses}} of how VLAMs respond to different physical security threats.

- **Summary**: Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting has been getting a lot of attention as an innovative method for representing 3D space due to rapid rendering and image quality. However, copyright protection for the 3D Gaussian splatting has not yet been introduced. In this paper, we present a novel watermarking method for 3D Gaussian splatting. The proposed method embeds a binary message into 3D Gaussians by fine-tuning the pre-trained 3D Gaussian splatting model. To achieve this, we present Frequency-Guided Densification (FGD) that utilizes Discrete Fourier Transform to find patches with high-frequencies and split 3D Gaussians based on 3D Gaussian Contribution Vector. It is each 3D Gaussian contribution to rendered pixel colors, improving both rendering quality and bit accuracy. Furthermore, we modify an adaptive gradient mask to enhance rendering quality. Our experiments show that our method can embed a watermark in 3D Gaussians imperceptibly with increased capacity and robustness against attacks. Our method reduces optimization cost and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods.

- **Summary**: Brain tumor segmentation plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis. This study introduces a novel segmentation algorithm utilizing a modified nnU-Net architecture. Within the nnU-Net architecture's encoder section, we enhance conventional convolution layers by incorporating omni-dimensional dynamic convolution layers, resulting in improved feature representation. Simultaneously, we propose a multi-scale attention strategy that harnesses contemporary insights from various scales. Our model's efficacy is demonstrated on diverse datasets from the BraTS-2023 challenge. Integrating omni-dimensional dynamic convolution (ODConv) layers and multi-scale features yields substantial improvement in the nnU-Net architecture's performance across multiple tumor segmentation datasets. Remarkably, our proposed model attains good accuracy during validation for the BraTS Africa dataset. The ODconv source code along with full training code is available on GitHub.

- **Summary**: Nowadays, the enhanced capabilities of in-expensive imaging devices have led to a tremendous increase in the acquisition and sharing of multimedia content over the Internet. Despite advances in imaging sensor technology, annoying conditions like \textit{occlusions} hamper photography and may deteriorate the performance of applications such as surveillance, detection, and recognition. Occlusion segmentation is difficult because of scale variations, illumination changes, and so on. Similarly, recovering a scene from foreground occlusions also poses significant challenges due to the complexity of accurately estimating the occluded regions and maintaining coherence with the surrounding context. In particular, image de-fencing presents its own set of challenges because of the diverse variations in shape, texture, color, patterns, and the often cluttered environment. This study focuses on the automatic detection and removal of occlusions from a single image. We propose a fully automatic, two-stage convolutional neural network for fence segmentation and occlusion completion. We leverage generative adversarial networks (GANs) to synthesize realistic content, including both structure and texture, in a single shot for inpainting. To assess zero-shot generalization, we evaluated our trained occlusion detection model on our proposed fence-like occlusion segmentation dataset. The dataset can be found on GitHub.

- **Summary**: Digital pathology has made significant advances in tumor diagnosis and segmentation, but image variability due to differences in organs, tissue preparation, and acquisition - known as domain shift - limits the effectiveness of current algorithms. The COSAS (Cross-Organ and Cross-Scanner Adenocarcinoma Segmentation) challenge addresses this issue by improving the resilience of segmentation algorithms to domain shift, with Task 2 focusing on adenocarcinoma segmentation using a diverse dataset from six scanners, pushing the boundaries of clinical diagnostics. Our approach employs unsupervised learning through stain separation within a multi-task learning framework using a multi-decoder autoencoder. This model isolates stain matrix and stain density, allowing it to handle color variation and improve generalization across scanners. We further enhanced the robustness of the model with a mixture of stain augmentation techniques and used a U-net architecture for segmentation. The novelty of our method lies in the use of stain separation within a multi-task learning framework, which effectively disentangles histological structures from color variations. This approach shows promise for improving segmentation accuracy and generalization across different histopathological stains, paving the way for more reliable diagnostic tools in digital pathology.

- **Summary**: The generation of humanoid animation from text prompts can profoundly impact animation production and AR/VR experiences. However, existing methods only generate body motion data, excluding facial expressions and hand movements. This limitation, primarily due to a lack of a comprehensive whole-body motion dataset, inhibits their readiness for production use. Recent attempts to create such a dataset have resulted in either motion inconsistency among different body parts in the artificially augmented data or lower quality in the data extracted from RGB videos. In this work, we propose T2M-X, a two-stage method that learns expressive text-to-motion generation from partially annotated data. T2M-X trains three separate Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAEs) for body, hand, and face on respective high-quality data sources to ensure high-quality motion outputs, and a Multi-indexing Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model with motion consistency loss for motion generation and coordination among different body parts. Our results show significant improvements over the baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively, demonstrating its robustness against the dataset limitations.

- **Summary**: In audio-driven video generation, creating Mandarin videos presents significant challenges. Collecting comprehensive Mandarin datasets is difficult, and the complex lip movements in Mandarin further complicate model training compared to English. In this study, we collected 29 hours of Mandarin speech video from JD Health International Inc. employees, resulting in the jdh-Hallo dataset. This dataset includes a diverse range of ages and speaking styles, encompassing both conversational and specialized medical topics. To adapt the JoyHallo model for Mandarin, we employed the Chinese wav2vec2 model for audio feature embedding. A semi-decoupled structure is proposed to capture inter-feature relationships among lip, expression, and pose features. This integration not only improves information utilization efficiency but also accelerates inference speed by 14.3%. Notably, JoyHallo maintains its strong ability to generate English videos, demonstrating excellent cross-language generation capabilities. The code and models are available at https://jdh-algo.github.io/JoyHallo.

- **Summary**: Exemplar-free class-incremental learning (EFCIL) presents a significant challenge as the old class samples are absent for new task learning. Due to the severe imbalance between old and new class samples, the learned classifiers can be easily biased toward the new ones. Moreover, continually updating the feature extractor under EFCIL can compromise the discriminative power of old class features, e.g., leading to less compact and more overlapping distributions across classes. Existing methods mainly focus on handling biased classifier learning. In this work, both cases are considered using the proposed method. Specifically, we first introduce a Distribution-Based Global Classifier (DBGC) to avoid bias factors in existing methods, such as data imbalance and sampling. More importantly, the compromised distributions of old classes are simulated via a simple operation, variance enlarging (VE). Incorporating VE based on DBGC results in a novel classification loss for EFCIL. This loss is proven equivalent to an Adaptive Margin Softmax Cross Entropy (AMarX). The proposed method is thus called Adaptive Margin Global Classifier (AMGC). AMGC is simple yet effective. Extensive experiments show that AMGC achieves superior image classification results on its own under a challenging EFCIL setting. Detailed analysis is also provided for further demonstration.

- **Summary**: Groundwater resources are one of the most relevant elements in the water cycle, therefore developing models to accurately predict them is a pivotal task in the sustainable resources management framework. Deep Learning (DL) models have been revealed very effective in hydrology, especially by feeding spatially distributed data (e.g. raster data). In many regions, hydrological measurements are difficult to obtain regularly or periodically in time, and in some cases, last available data are not up to date. Reversely, weather data, which significantly impacts water resources, are usually more available and with higher quality. More specifically, we have proposed two different DL models to predict the water table depth in the Grana-Maira catchment (Piemonte, IT) using only exogenous weather image time series. To deal with the image time series, both models are made of a first Time Distributed Convolutional Neural Network (TDC) which encodes the image available at each time step into a vectorial representation. The first model, TDC-LSTM uses then a Sequential Module based on an LSTM layer to learn temporal relations and output the predictions. The second model, TDC-UnPWaveNet uses instead a new version of the WaveNet architecture, adapted here to output a sequence shorter and completely shifted in the future with respect to the input one. To this aim, and to deal with the different sequence lengths in the UnPWaveNet, we have designed a new Channel Distributed layer, that acts like a Time Distributed one but on the channel dimension, i.e. applying the same set of operations to each channel of the input. TDC-LSTM and TDC-UnPWaveNet have shown both remarkable results. However, the two models have focused on different learnable information: TDC-LSTM has focused more on lowering the bias, while the TDC-UnPWaveNet has focused more on the temporal dynamics maximising correlation and KGE.

- **Summary**: Current data-driven methodologies for point cloud matching demand extensive training time and computational resources, presenting significant challenges for model deployment and application. In the point cloud matching task, recent advancements with an encoder-only Transformer architecture have revealed the emergence of semantically meaningful patterns in the attention heads, particularly resembling Gaussian functions centered on each point of the input shape. In this work, we further investigate this phenomenon by integrating these patterns as fixed attention weights within the attention heads of the Transformer architecture. We evaluate two variants: one utilizing predetermined variance values for the Gaussians, and another where the variance values are treated as learnable parameters. Additionally we analyze the performances on noisy data and explore a possible way to improve robustness to noise. Our findings demonstrate that fixing the attention weights not only accelerates the training process but also enhances the stability of the optimization. Furthermore, we conducted an ablation study to identify the specific layers where the infused information is most impactful and to understand the reliance of the network on this information.

- **Summary**: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), there is growing research interest in developing LLMs in the medical domain to assist clinicians. However, for hospitals, using closed-source commercial LLMs involves privacy issues, and developing open-source public LLMs requires large-scale computational resources, which are usually limited, especially in resource-efficient regions and low-income countries. We propose an open-source Small Language and Vision Assistant (SLaVA-CXR) that can be used for Chest X-Ray report automation. To efficiently train a small assistant, we first propose the Re$^3$Training method, which simulates the cognitive development of radiologists and optimizes the model in the Recognition, Reasoning, and Reporting training manner. Then, we introduce a data synthesis method, RADEX, which can generate a high-quality and diverse training corpus with privacy regulation compliance. The extensive experiments show that our SLaVA-CXR built on a 2.7B backbone not only outperforms but also achieves 6 times faster inference efficiency than previous state-of-the-art larger models.

- **Summary**: With the development of 3D and 2D data acquisition techniques, it has become easy to obtain point clouds and images of scenes simultaneously, which further facilitates dual-modal semantic segmentation. Most existing methods for simultaneously segmenting point clouds and images rely heavily on the quantity and quality of the labeled training data. However, massive point-wise and pixel-wise labeling procedures are time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we propose a parallel dual-stream network to handle the semi-supervised dual-modal semantic segmentation task, called PD-Net, by jointly utilizing a small number of labeled point clouds, a large number of unlabeled point clouds, and unlabeled images. The proposed PD-Net consists of two parallel streams (called original stream and pseudo-label prediction stream). The pseudo-label prediction stream predicts the pseudo labels of unlabeled point clouds and their corresponding images. Then, the unlabeled data is sent to the original stream for self-training. Each stream contains two encoder-decoder branches for 3D and 2D data respectively. In each stream, multiple dual-modal fusion modules are explored for fusing the dual-modal features. In addition, a pseudo-label optimization module is explored to optimize the pseudo labels output by the pseudo-label prediction stream. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed PD-Net not only outperforms the comparative semi-supervised methods but also achieves competitive performances with some fully-supervised methods in most cases.

- **Summary**: Automating the detection of fruits and vegetables using computer vision is essential for modernizing agriculture, improving efficiency, ensuring food quality, and contributing to technologically advanced and sustainable farming practices. This paper presents an end-to-end pipeline for detecting and localizing fruits and vegetables in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we have curated a dataset named FRUVEG67 that includes images of 67 classes of fruits and vegetables captured in unconstrained scenarios, with only a few manually annotated samples per class. We have developed a semi-supervised data annotation algorithm (SSDA) that generates bounding boxes for objects to label the remaining non-annotated images. For detection, we introduce the Fruit and Vegetable Detection Network (FVDNet), an ensemble version of YOLOv7 featuring three distinct grid configurations. We employ an averaging approach for bounding-box prediction and a voting mechanism for class prediction. We have integrated Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) in conjunction with focal loss to better detect smaller objects. Our experimental results highlight the superiority of FVDNet compared to previous versions of YOLO, showcasing remarkable improvements in detection and localization performance. We achieved an impressive mean average precision (mAP) score of 0.78 across all classes. Furthermore, we evaluated the efficacy of FVDNet using open-category refrigerator images, where it demonstrates promising results.

- **Summary**: We propose an adaptive fine-tuning algorithm for multimodal large models. The core steps of this algorithm involve two stages of truncation. First, the vast amount of data is projected into a semantic vector space, and the MiniBatchKMeans algorithm is used for automated clustering. This classification ensures that the data within each cluster exhibit high semantic similarity. Next, we process the data in each cluster, calculating the translational difference between the original and perturbed data in the multimodal large model's vector space. This difference serves as a generalization metric for the data. Based on this metric, we select the data with high generalization potential for training. We applied this algorithm to train the InternLM-XComposer2-VL-7B model on two 3090 GPUs using one-third of the GeoChat multimodal remote sensing dataset. The results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. various baselines. The model trained on our optimally chosen one-third dataset, based on experimental validation, exhibited only 1% reduction in performance across various remote sensing metrics compared to the model trained on the full dataset. This approach significantly preserved general-purpose capabilities while reducing training time by 68.2%. Furthermore, the model achieved scores of 89.86 and 77.19 on the UCMerced and AID evaluation datasets, respectively, surpassing the GeoChat dataset by 5.43 and 5.16 points. It only showed a 0.91-point average decrease on the LRBEN evaluation dataset.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable efficacy across various image-to-image tasks. In this research, we introduce Imagine yourself, a state-of-the-art model designed for personalized image generation. Unlike conventional tuning-based personalization techniques, Imagine yourself operates as a tuning-free model, enabling all users to leverage a shared framework without individualized adjustments. Moreover, previous work met challenges balancing identity preservation, following complex prompts and preserving good visual quality, resulting in models having strong copy-paste effect of the reference images. Thus, they can hardly generate images following prompts that require significant changes to the reference image, \eg, changing facial expression, head and body poses, and the diversity of the generated images is low. To address these limitations, our proposed method introduces 1) a new synthetic paired data generation mechanism to encourage image diversity, 2) a fully parallel attention architecture with three text encoders and a fully trainable vision encoder to improve the text faithfulness, and 3) a novel coarse-to-fine multi-stage finetuning methodology that gradually pushes the boundary of visual quality. Our study demonstrates that Imagine yourself surpasses the state-of-the-art personalization model, exhibiting superior capabilities in identity preservation, visual quality, and text alignment. This model establishes a robust foundation for various personalization applications. Human evaluation results validate the model's SOTA superiority across all aspects (identity preservation, text faithfulness, and visual appeal) compared to the previous personalization models.

- **Summary**: In whiteboard-based remote communication, the seamless integration of drawn content and hand-screen interactions is essential for an immersive user experience. Previous methods either require bulky device setups for capturing hand gestures or fail to accurately track the hand poses from capacitive images. In this paper, we present a real-time method for precise tracking 3D poses of both hands from capacitive video frames. To this end, we develop a deep neural network to identify hands and infer hand joint positions from capacitive frames, and then recover 3D hand poses from the hand-joint positions via a constrained inverse kinematic solver. Additionally, we design a device setup for capturing high-quality hand-screen interaction data and obtained a more accurate synchronized capacitive video and hand pose dataset. Our method improves the accuracy and stability of 3D hand tracking for capacitive frames while maintaining a compact device setup for remote communication. We validate our scheme design and its superior performance on 3D hand pose tracking and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in whiteboard-based remote communication.

- **Summary**: The misuse of deep learning-based facial manipulation poses a potential threat to civil rights. To prevent this fraud at its source, proactive defense technology was proposed to disrupt the manipulation process by adding invisible adversarial perturbations into images, making the forged output unconvincing to the observer. However, their non-directional disruption of the output may result in the retention of identity information of the person in the image, leading to stigmatization of the individual. In this paper, we propose a novel universal framework for combating facial manipulation, called ID-Guard. Specifically, this framework requires only a single forward pass of an encoder-decoder network to generate a cross-model universal adversarial perturbation corresponding to a specific facial image. To ensure anonymity in manipulated facial images, a novel Identity Destruction Module (IDM) is introduced to destroy the identifiable information in forged faces targetedly. Additionally, we optimize the perturbations produced by considering the disruption towards different facial manipulations as a multi-task learning problem and design a dynamic weights strategy to improve cross-model performance. The proposed framework reports impressive results in defending against multiple widely used facial manipulations, effectively distorting the identifiable regions in the manipulated facial images. In addition, our experiments reveal the ID-Guard's ability to enable disrupted images to avoid face inpaintings and open-source image recognition systems.

Existing research has primarily focused on algorithms for specific tasks, which have limited applicability in a broad range of ARS vision applications. This paper proposes the RingMo-Aerial model, aiming to fill the gap in foundation model research in the field of ARS vision. By introducing the Frequency-Enhanced Multi-Head Self-Attention (FE-MSA) mechanism and an affine transformation-based contrastive learning pre-training method, the model's detection capability for small targets is enhanced and optimized for the tilted viewing angles characteristic of ARS. Furthermore, the ARS-Adapter, an efficient parameter fine-tuning method, is proposed to improve the model's adaptability and effectiveness in various ARS vision tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that RingMo-Aerial achieves SOTA performance on multiple downstream tasks. This indicates the practicality and effectiveness of RingMo-Aerial in enhancing the performance of ARS vision tasks.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of various regions within the prostate is pivotal for diagnosing and treating prostate-related diseases. However, the scarcity of labeled data, particularly in specialized medical fields like prostate imaging, poses a significant challenge. Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a new large model for natural image segmentation, but there are some challenges in medical imaging. In order to better utilize the powerful feature extraction capability of SAM as well as to address the problem of low data volume for medical image annotation, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and semi-supervised learning methods of Monte Carlo guided interpolation consistency (MCIC) to enhance the fine-tuned SAM. We propose Monte Carlo-guided Interpolation Consistency Segment Anything Model (MCICSAM) for application to semi-supervised learning based prostate region segmentation. In the unlabeled data section, MCIC performs two different interpolation transformations on the input data and incorporates Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis in the output, forcing the model to be consistent in its predictions. The consistency constraints imposed on these interpolated samples allow the model to fit the distribution of unlabeled data better, ultimately improving its performance in semi-supervised scenarios. We use Dice and Hausdorff Distance at 95th percentile (HD95) to validate model performance. MCICSAM yieldes Dice with 79.38% and 89.95%, along with improves HD95 values of 3.12 and 2.27 for transition zone and transition zone. At the same time MCICSAM demonstrates strong generalizability. This method is expected to bring new possibilities in the field of prostate image segmentation.

- **Summary**: The structure tensor method is often used for 2D and 3D analysis of imaged structures, but its results are in many cases very dependent on the user's choice of method parameters. We simplify this parameter choice in first order structure tensor scale-space by directly connecting the width of the derivative filter to the size of image features. By introducing a ring-filter step, we substitute the Gaussian integration/smoothing with a method that more accurately shifts the derivative filter response from feature edges to their center. We further demonstrate how extracted structural measures can be used to correct known inaccuracies in the scale map, resulting in a reliable representation of the feature sizes both in 2D and 3D. Compared to the traditional first order structure tensor, or previous structure tensor scale-space approaches, our solution is much more accurate and can serve as an out-of-the-box method for extracting a wide range of structural parameters with minimal user input.

- **Summary**: Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that output asynchronous and sparse event streams, instead of fixed frames. Benefiting from their distinct advantages, such as high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, event cameras have been applied to address 3D reconstruction, important for robotic mapping. Recently, neural rendering techniques, such as 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), have been shown successful in 3D reconstruction. However, it still remains under-explored how to develop an effective event-based 3DGS pipeline. In particular, as 3DGS typically depends on high-quality initialization and dense multiview constraints, a potential problem appears for the 3DGS optimization with events given its inherent sparse property. To this end, we propose a novel event-based 3DGS framework, named Elite-EvGS. Our key idea is to distill the prior knowledge from the off-the-shelf event-to-video (E2V) models to effectively reconstruct 3D scenes from events in a coarse-to-fine optimization manner. Specifically, to address the complexity of 3DGS initialization from events, we introduce a novel warm-up initialization strategy that optimizes a coarse 3DGS from the frames generated by E2V models and then incorporates events to refine the details. Then, we propose a progressive event supervision strategy that employs the window-slicing operation to progressively reduce the number of events used for supervision. This subtly relives the temporal randomness of the event frames, benefiting the optimization of local textural and global structural details. Experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that Elite-EvGS can reconstruct 3D scenes with better textural and structural details. Meanwhile, our method yields plausible performance on the captured real-world data, including diverse challenging conditions, such as fast motion and low light scenes.

- **Summary**: Segment Anything Model (SAM) is an advanced foundational model for image segmentation, widely applied to remote sensing images (RSIs). Due to the domain gap between RSIs and natural images, traditional methods typically use SAM as a source pre-trained model and fine-tune it with fully supervised masks. Unlike these methods, our work focuses on fine-tuning SAM using more convenient and challenging point annotations. Leveraging SAM's zero-shot capabilities, we adopt a self-training framework that iteratively generates pseudo-labels for training. However, if the pseudo-labels contain noisy labels, there is a risk of error accumulation. To address this issue, we extract target prototypes from the target dataset and use the Hungarian algorithm to match them with prediction prototypes, preventing the model from learning in the wrong direction. Additionally, due to the complex backgrounds and dense distribution of objects in RSI, using point prompts may result in multiple objects being recognized as one. To solve this problem, we propose a negative prompt calibration method based on the non-overlapping nature of instance masks. In brief, we use the prompts of overlapping masks as corresponding negative signals, resulting in refined masks. Combining the above methods, we propose a novel Pointly-supervised Segment Anything Model named PointSAM. We conduct experiments on RSI datasets, including WHU, HRSID, and NWPU VHR-10, and the results show that our method significantly outperforms direct testing with SAM, SAM2, and other comparison methods. Furthermore, we introduce PointSAM as a point-to-box converter and achieve encouraging results, suggesting that this method can be extended to other point-supervised tasks.

- **Summary**: This article presents an innovative study in exploring, evaluating, and implementing deep learning architectures for the calibration of multi-modal sensor systems. The focus behind this is to leverage the use of sensor fusion to achieve dynamic, real-time alignment between 3D LiDAR and 2D Camera sensors. static calibration methods are tedious and time-consuming, which is why we propose utilizing Conventional Neural Networks (CNN) coupled with geometrically informed learning to solve this issue. We leverage the foundational principles of Extrinsic LiDAR-Camera Calibration tools such as RegNet, CalibNet, and LCCNet by exploring open-source models that are available online and comparing our results with their corresponding research papers. Requirements for extracting these visual and measurable outputs involved tweaking source code, fine-tuning, training, validation, and testing for each of these frameworks for equal comparisons. This approach aims to investigate which of these advanced networks produces the most accurate and consistent predictions. Through a series of experiments, we reveal some of their shortcomings and areas for potential improvements along the way. We find that LCCNet yields the best results out of all the models that we validated.

- **Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant progress by extending large language models. Building on this progress, the latest developments in LMMs demonstrate the ability to generate dense pixel-wise segmentation through the integration of segmentation models.Despite the innovations, the textual responses and segmentation masks of existing works remain at the instance level, showing limited ability to perform fine-grained understanding and segmentation even provided with detailed textual cues.To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Multi-Granularity Large Multimodal Model (MGLMM), which is capable of seamlessly adjusting the granularity of Segmentation and Captioning (SegCap) following user instructions, from panoptic SegCap to fine-grained SegCap. We name such a new task Multi-Granularity Segmentation and Captioning (MGSC). Observing the lack of a benchmark for model training and evaluation over the MGSC task, we establish a benchmark with aligned masks and captions in multi-granularity using our customized automated annotation pipeline. This benchmark comprises 10K images and more than 30K image-question pairs. We will release our dataset along with the implementation of our automated dataset annotation pipeline for further research.Besides, we propose a novel unified SegCap data format to unify heterogeneous segmentation datasets; it effectively facilitates learning to associate object concepts with visual features during multi-task training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MGLMM excels at tackling more than eight downstream tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance in MGSC, GCG, image captioning, referring segmentation, multiple and empty segmentation, and reasoning segmentation tasks. The great performance and versatility of MGLMM underscore its potential impact on advancing multimodal research.

- **Summary**: Currently, the Morpho-Constitutional Analysis (MCA) is the de facto approach for the etiological diagnosis of kidney stone formation, and it is an important step for establishing personalized treatment to avoid relapses. More recently, research has focused on performing such tasks intra-operatively, an approach known as Endoscopic Stone Recognition (ESR). Both methods rely on features observed in the surface and the section of kidney stones to separate the analyzed samples into several sub-groups. However, given the high intra-observer variability and the complex operating conditions found in ESR, there is a lot of interest in using AI for computer-aided diagnosis. However, current AI models require large datasets to attain a good performance and for generalizing to unseen distributions. This is a major problem as large labeled datasets are very difficult to acquire, and some classes of kidney stones are very rare. Thus, in this paper, we present a method based on diffusion as a way of augmenting pre-existing ex-vivo kidney stone datasets. Our aim is to create plausible diverse kidney stone images that can be used for pre-training models using ex-vivo data. We show that by mixing natural and synthetic images of CCD images, it is possible to train models capable of performing very well on unseen intra-operative data. Our results show that is possible to attain an improvement of 10% in terms of accuracy compared to a baseline model pre-trained only on ImageNet. Moreover, our results show an improvement of 6% for surface images and 10% for section images compared to a model train on CCD images only, which demonstrates the effectiveness of using synthetic images.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions in longitudinal MRI scans is crucial for monitoring disease progression and treatment efficacy. Although changes across time are taken into account when assessing images in clinical practice, most existing deep learning methods treat scans from different timepoints separately. Among studies utilizing longitudinal images, a simple channel-wise concatenation is the primary albeit suboptimal method employed to integrate timepoints. We introduce a novel approach that explicitly incorporates temporal differences between baseline and follow-up scans through a unique architectural inductive bias called Difference Weighting Block. It merges features from two timepoints, emphasizing changes between scans. We achieve superior scores in lesion segmentation (Dice Score, Hausdorff distance) as well as lesion detection (lesion-level $F_1$ score) as compared to state-of-the-art longitudinal and single timepoint models across two datasets. Our code is made publicly available at www.github.com/MIC-DKFZ/Longitudinal-Difference-Weighting.

- **Summary**: We introduce a dual contouring method that provides state-of-the-art performance for occupancy functions while achieving computation times of a few seconds. Our method is learning-free and carefully designed to maximize the use of GPU parallelization. The recent surge of implicit neural representations has led to significant attention to occupancy fields, resulting in a wide range of 3D reconstruction and generation methods based on them. However, the outputs of such methods have been underestimated due to the bottleneck in converting the resulting occupancy function to a mesh. Marching Cubes tends to produce staircase-like artifacts, and most subsequent works focusing on exploiting signed distance functions as input also yield suboptimal results for occupancy functions. Based on Manifold Dual Contouring (MDC), we propose Occupancy-Based Dual Contouring (ODC), which mainly modifies the computation of grid edge points (1D points) and grid cell points (3D points) to not use any distance information. We introduce auxiliary 2D points that are used to compute local surface normals along with the 1D points, helping identify 3D points via the quadric error function. To search the 1D, 2D, and 3D points, we develop fast algorithms that are parallelizable across all grid edges, faces, and cells. Our experiments with several 3D neural generative models and a 3D mesh dataset demonstrate that our method achieves the best fidelity compared to prior works.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates the online generation of realistic full-body human motion using a single head-mounted device with an outward-facing color camera and the ability to perform visual SLAM. Given the inherent ambiguity of this setup, we introduce a novel system, HMD$^2$, designed to balance between motion reconstruction and generation. From a reconstruction standpoint, our system aims to maximally utilize the camera streams to produce both analytical and learned features, including head motion, SLAM point cloud, and image embeddings. On the generative front, HMD$^2$ employs a multi-modal conditional motion Diffusion model, incorporating a time-series backbone to maintain temporal coherence in generated motions, and utilizes autoregressive in-painting to facilitate online motion inference with minimal latency (0.17 seconds). Collectively, we demonstrate that our system offers a highly effective and robust solution capable of scaling to an extensive dataset of over 200 hours collected in a wide range of complex indoor and outdoor environments using publicly available smart glasses.

- **Summary**: Vision-based 3D occupancy prediction is significantly challenged by the inherent limitations of monocular vision in depth estimation. This paper introduces CVT-Occ, a novel approach that leverages temporal fusion through the geometric correspondence of voxels over time to improve the accuracy of 3D occupancy predictions. By sampling points along the line of sight of each voxel and integrating the features of these points from historical frames, we construct a cost volume feature map that refines current volume features for improved prediction outcomes. Our method takes advantage of parallax cues from historical observations and employs a data-driven approach to learn the cost volume. We validate the effectiveness of CVT-Occ through rigorous experiments on the Occ3D-Waymo dataset, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 3D occupancy prediction with minimal additional computational cost. The code is released at \url{https://github.com/Tsinghua-MARS-Lab/CVT-Occ}.

- **Summary**: Existing scene text removal (STR) task suffers from insufficient training data due to the expensive pixel-level labeling. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by introducing a Text-aware Masked Image Modeling algorithm (TMIM), which can pretrain STR models with low-cost text detection labels (e.g., text bounding box). Different from previous pretraining methods that use indirect auxiliary tasks only to enhance the implicit feature extraction ability, our TMIM first enables the STR task to be directly trained in a weakly supervised manner, which explores the STR knowledge explicitly and efficiently. In TMIM, first, a Background Modeling stream is built to learn background generation rules by recovering the masked non-text region. Meanwhile, it provides pseudo STR labels on the masked text region. Second, a Text Erasing stream is proposed to learn from the pseudo labels and equip the model with end-to-end STR ability. Benefiting from the two collaborative streams, our STR model can achieve impressive performance only with the public text detection datasets, which greatly alleviates the limitation of the high-cost STR labels. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other pretrain methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance (37.35 PSNR on SCUT-EnsText). Code will be available at https://github.com/wzx99/TMIM.

- **Summary**: Brain imaging has allowed neuroscientists to analyze brain morphology in genetic and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Down syndrome, pinpointing regions of interest to unravel the neuroanatomical underpinnings of cognitive impairment and memory deficits. However, the connections between brain anatomy, cognitive performance and comorbidities like Alzheimer's disease are still poorly understood in the Down syndrome population. The latest advances in artificial intelligence constitute an opportunity for developing automatic tools to analyze large volumes of brain magnetic resonance imaging scans, overcoming the bottleneck of manual analysis. In this study, we propose the use of generative models for detecting brain alterations in people with Down syndrome affected by various degrees of neurodegeneration caused by Alzheimer's disease. To that end, we evaluate state-of-the-art brain anomaly detection models based on Variational Autoencoders and Diffusion Models, leveraging a proprietary dataset of brain magnetic resonance imaging scans. Following a comprehensive evaluation process, our study includes several key analyses. First, we conducted a qualitative evaluation by expert neuroradiologists. Second, we performed both quantitative and qualitative reconstruction fidelity studies for the generative models. Third, we carried out an ablation study to examine how the incorporation of histogram post-processing can enhance model performance. Finally, we executed a quantitative volumetric analysis of subcortical structures. Our findings indicate that some models effectively detect the primary alterations characterizing Down syndrome's brain anatomy, including a smaller cerebellum, enlarged ventricles, and cerebral cortex reduction, as well as the parietal lobe alterations caused by Alzheimer's disease.

- **Summary**: Concept-based XAI (C-XAI) approaches to explaining neural vision models are a promising field of research, since explanations that refer to concepts (i.e., semantically meaningful parts in an image) are intuitive to understand and go beyond saliency-based techniques that only reveal relevant regions. Given the remarkable progress in this field in recent years, it is time for the community to take a critical look at the advances and trends. Consequently, this paper reviews C-XAI methods to identify interesting and underexplored areas and proposes future research directions. To this end, we consider three main directions: the choice of concepts to explain, the choice of concept representation, and how we can control concepts. For the latter, we propose techniques and draw inspiration from the field of knowledge representation and learning, showing how this could enrich future C-XAI research.

- **Summary**: Salient object detection (SOD) has achieved substantial progress in recent years. In practical scenarios, compressed images (CI) serve as the primary medium for data transmission and storage. However, scant attention has been directed towards SOD for compressed images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we are dedicated to strictly benchmarking and analyzing CNN-based salient object detection on compressed images. To comprehensively study this issue, we meticulously establish various CI SOD datasets from existing public SOD datasets. Subsequently, we investigate representative CNN-based SOD methods, assessing their robustness on compressed images (approximately 2.64 million images). Importantly, our evaluation results reveal two key findings: 1) current state-of-the-art CNN-based SOD models, while excelling on clean images, exhibit significant performance bottlenecks when applied to compressed images. 2) The principal factors influencing the robustness of CI SOD are rooted in the characteristics of compressed images and the limitations in saliency feature learning. Based on these observations, we propose a simple yet promising baseline framework that focuses on robust feature representation learning to achieve robust CNN-based CI SOD. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing markedly improved robustness across various levels of image degradation, while maintaining competitive accuracy on clean data. We hope that our benchmarking efforts, analytical insights, and proposed techniques will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the robustness of CNN-based SOD algorithms, inspiring future research in the community.

- **Summary**: Text-based person search, employing free-form text queries to identify individuals within a vast image collection, presents a unique challenge in aligning visual and textual representations, particularly at the human part level. Existing methods often struggle with part feature extraction and alignment due to the lack of direct part-level supervision and reliance on heuristic features. We propose a novel framework that leverages a part discovery module based on slot attention to autonomously identify and align distinctive parts across modalities, enhancing interpretability and retrieval accuracy without explicit part-level correspondence supervision. Additionally, text-based dynamic part attention adjusts the importance of each part, further improving retrieval outcomes. Our method is evaluated on three public benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods.

- **Summary**: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have substantially improved dermatologists' diagnostic accuracy for melanoma, with explainable AI (XAI) systems further enhancing clinicians' confidence and trust in AI-driven decisions. Despite these advancements, there remains a critical need for objective evaluation of how dermatologists engage with both AI and XAI tools. In this study, 76 dermatologists participated in a reader study, diagnosing 16 dermoscopic images of melanomas and nevi using an XAI system that provides detailed, domain-specific explanations. Eye-tracking technology was employed to assess their interactions. Diagnostic performance was compared with that of a standard AI system lacking explanatory features. Our findings reveal that XAI systems improved balanced diagnostic accuracy by 2.8 percentage points relative to standard AI. Moreover, diagnostic disagreements with AI/XAI systems and complex lesions were associated with elevated cognitive load, as evidenced by increased ocular fixations. These insights have significant implications for clinical practice, the design of AI tools for visual tasks, and the broader development of XAI in medical diagnostics.

- **Summary**: Since multiple MRI contrasts of the same anatomy contain redundant information, one contrast can be used as a prior for guiding the reconstruction of an undersampled subsequent contrast. To this end, several learning-based guided reconstruction methods have been proposed. However, two key challenges remain - (a) the requirement of large paired training datasets and (b) the lack of intuitive understanding of the model's internal representation and utilization of the shared information. We propose a modular two-stage approach for guided reconstruction, addressing these challenges. A content/style model of two-contrast image data is learned in a largely unpaired manner and is subsequently applied as a plug-and-play operator in iterative reconstruction. The disentanglement of content and style allows explicit representation of contrast-independent and contrast-specific factors. Based on this, incorporating prior information into the reconstruction reduces to simply replacing the aliased reconstruction content with clean content derived from the reference scan. We name this novel approach PnP-MUNIT. Various aspects like interpretability and convergence are explored via simulations. Furthermore, its practicality is demonstrated on the NYU fastMRI DICOM dataset and two in-house raw datasets, obtaining up to 32.6% more acceleration over learning-based non-guided reconstruction for a given SSIM. In a radiological task, PnP-MUNIT allowed 33.3% more acceleration over clinical reconstruction at diagnostic quality.



### DAP-LED: Learning Degradation-Aware Priors with CLIP for Joint Low-light Enhancement and Deblurring

- **Summary**: Autonomous vehicles and robots often struggle with reliable visual perception at night due to the low illumination and motion blur caused by the long exposure time of RGB cameras. Existing methods address this challenge by sequentially connecting the off-the-shelf pretrained low-light enhancement and deblurring models. Unfortunately, these methods often lead to noticeable artifacts (\eg, color distortions) in the over-exposed regions or make it hardly possible to learn the motion cues of the dark regions. In this paper, we interestingly find vision-language models, \eg, Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), can comprehensively perceive diverse degradation levels at night. In light of this, we propose a novel transformer-based joint learning framework, named DAP-LED, which can jointly achieve low-light enhancement and deblurring, benefiting downstream tasks, such as depth estimation, segmentation, and detection in the dark. The key insight is to leverage CLIP to adaptively learn the degradation levels from images at night. This subtly enables learning rich semantic information and visual representation for optimization of the joint tasks. To achieve this, we first introduce a CLIP-guided cross-fusion module to obtain multi-scale patch-wise degradation heatmaps from the image embeddings. Then, the heatmaps are fused via the designed CLIP-enhanced transformer blocks to retain useful degradation information for effective model optimization. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, our DAP-LED achieves state-of-the-art performance in the dark. Meanwhile, the enhanced results are demonstrated to be effective for three downstream tasks. For demo and more results, please check the project page: \url{https://vlislab22.github.io/dap-led/}.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in computer vision, particularly in detection, segmentation, and classification, have significantly impacted various domains. However, these advancements are tied to RGB-based systems, which are insufficient for applications in industries like waste sorting, pharmaceuticals, and defense, where advanced object characterization beyond shape or color is necessary. Hyperspectral (HS) imaging, capturing both spectral and spatial information, addresses these limitations and offers advantages over conventional technologies such as X-ray fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy, particularly in terms of speed, cost, and safety.   This study evaluates the potential of combining HS imaging with deep learning for material characterization. The research involves: i) designing an experimental setup with HS camera, conveyor, and controlled lighting; ii) generating a multi-object dataset of various plastics (HDPE, PET, PP, PS) with semi-automated mask generation and Raman spectroscopy-based labeling; and iii) developing a deep learning model trained on HS images for pixel-level material classification. The model achieved 99.94\% classification accuracy, demonstrating robustness in color, size, and shape invariance, and effectively handling material overlap. Limitations, such as challenges with black objects, are also discussed. Extending computer vision beyond RGB to HS imaging proves feasible, overcoming major limitations of traditional methods and showing strong potential for future applications.

- **Summary**: Current image retrieval systems often face domain specificity and generalization issues. This study aims to overcome these limitations by developing a computationally efficient training framework for a universal feature extractor that provides strong semantic image representations across various domains. To this end, we curated a multi-domain training dataset, called M4D-35k, which allows for resource-efficient training. Additionally, we conduct an extensive evaluation and comparison of various state-of-the-art visual-semantic foundation models and margin-based metric learning loss functions regarding their suitability for efficient universal feature extraction. Despite constrained computational resources, we achieve near state-of-the-art results on the Google Universal Image Embedding Challenge, with a mMP@5 of 0.721. This places our method at the second rank on the leaderboard, just 0.7 percentage points behind the best performing method. However, our model has 32% fewer overall parameters and 289 times fewer trainable parameters. Compared to methods with similar computational requirements, we outperform the previous state of the art by 3.3 percentage points. We release our code and M4D-35k training set annotations at https://github.com/morrisfl/UniFEx.

- **Summary**: In this study, we explore the efficacy of advanced pre-trained architectures, such as Vision Transformers (ViT), ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformers in enhancing Federated Domain Generalization. These architectures capture global contextual features and model long-range dependencies, making them promising candidates for improving cross-domain generalization. We conduct a broad study with in-depth analysis and systematically evaluate different variants of these architectures, using extensive pre-training datasets such as ImageNet-1K, ImageNet-21K, JFT-300M, and ImageNet-22K. Additionally, we compare self-supervised and supervised pre-training strategies to assess their impact on FDG performance. Our findings suggest that self-supervised techniques, which focus on reconstructing masked image patches, can better capture the intrinsic structure of images, thereby outperforming their supervised counterparts. Comprehensive evaluations on the Office-Home and PACS datasets demonstrate that adopting advanced architectures pre-trained on larger datasets establishes new benchmarks, achieving average accuracies of 84.46\% and 92.55\%, respectively. Additionally, we observe that certain variants of these advanced models, despite having fewer parameters, outperform larger ResNet models. This highlights the critical role of utilizing sophisticated architectures and diverse pre-training strategies to enhance FDG performance, especially in scenarios with limited computational resources where model efficiency is crucial. Our results indicate that federated learning systems can become more adaptable and efficient by leveraging these advanced methods, offering valuable insights for future research in FDG.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in generative models for medical imaging have shown promise in representing multiple modalities. However, the variability in modality availability across datasets limits the general applicability of the synthetic data they produce. To address this, we present a novel physics-informed generative model capable of synthesizing a variable number of brain MRI modalities, including those not present in the original dataset. Our approach utilizes latent diffusion models and a two-step generative process: first, unobserved physical tissue property maps are synthesized using a latent diffusion model, and then these maps are combined with a physical signal model to generate the final MRI scan. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in generating unseen MR contrasts and preserving physical plausibility. Furthermore, we validate the distributions of generated tissue properties by comparing them to those measured in real brain tissue.

- **Summary**: Throughout the history of computer vision, while research has explored the integration of images (visual) and point clouds (geometric), many advancements in image and 3D object recognition have tended to process these modalities separately. We aim to bridge this divide by integrating images and point clouds on a unified transformer model. This approach integrates the modality-specific properties of images and point clouds and achieves fundamental downstream tasks in image and 3D object recognition on a unified transformer model by learning visual-geometric representations. In this work, we introduce Formula-Supervised Visual-Geometric Pre-training (FSVGP), a novel synthetic pre-training method that automatically generates aligned synthetic images and point clouds from mathematical formulas. Through cross-modality supervision, we enable supervised pre-training between visual and geometric modalities. FSVGP also reduces reliance on real data collection, cross-modality alignment, and human annotation. Our experimental results show that FSVGP pre-trains more effectively than VisualAtom and PC-FractalDB across six tasks: image and 3D object classification, detection, and segmentation. These achievements demonstrate FSVGP's superior generalization in image and 3D object recognition and underscore the potential of synthetic pre-training in visual-geometric representation learning.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in a broad range of vision-language tasks with their strong reasoning and generalization capabilities. However, they heavily depend on high-quality data in the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase. The existing approaches aim to curate high-quality data via GPT-4V, but they are not scalable due to the commercial nature of GPT-4V and the simplicity of the prompts used to instruct the model. To this end, we devised the FullAnno system, which is a data engine that can generate large-scale, high-quality, and fine-grained image annotations consisting of the category and position of objects, region descriptions, text information, as well as image dense captions. This engine is characterized by its cascade annotation process, which involves multiple expert models and employs rich prompts to instruct LLMs in generating dense image captions. We re-annotated the COCO and Visual Genome datasets using our FullAnno system, tripling the number of object annotations and increasing the length of the original image captions by a factor of 15. Experiments show that the regenerated annotation can significantly enhance the capabilities of LLaVA-v1.5 on several benchmarks.

- **Summary**: In this work, we describe our approach to compete in the autoPET3 datacentric track. While conventional wisdom suggests that larger datasets lead to better model performance, recent studies indicate that excluding certain training samples can enhance model accuracy. We find that in the autoPETIII dataset, a model that is trained on the entire dataset exhibits undesirable characteristics by producing a large number of false positives particularly for PSMA-PETs. We counteract this by removing the easiest samples from the training dataset as measured by the model loss before retraining from scratch. Using the proposed approach we manage to drive down the false negative volume and improve upon the baseline model in both false negative volume and dice score on the preliminary test set. Code and pre-trained models are available at github.com/alexanderjaus/autopet3_datadiet.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has long been dominated by multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), which have demonstrated superiority over other optimizable models in various domains. Recently, a new alternative to MLPs has emerged - Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)- which are based on a fundamentally different mathematical framework. According to their authors, KANs address several major issues in MLPs, such as catastrophic forgetting in continual learning scenarios. However, this claim has only been supported by results from a regression task on a toy 1D dataset. In this paper, we extend the investigation by evaluating the performance of KANs in continual learning tasks within computer vision, specifically using the MNIST datasets. To this end, we conduct a structured analysis of the behavior of MLPs and two KAN-based models in a class-incremental learning scenario, ensuring that the architectures involved have the same number of trainable parameters. Our results demonstrate that an efficient version of KAN outperforms both traditional MLPs and the original KAN implementation. We further analyze the influence of hyperparameters in MLPs and KANs, as well as the impact of certain trainable parameters in KANs, such as bias and scale weights. Additionally, we provide a preliminary investigation of recent KAN-based convolutional networks and compare their performance with that of traditional convolutional neural networks.

- **Summary**: The surge of hate speech on social media platforms poses a significant challenge, with hate speech detection~(HSD) becoming increasingly critical. Current HSD methods focus on enriching contextual information to enhance detection performance, but they overlook the inherent uncertainty of hate speech. We propose a novel HSD method, named trustworthy hate speech detection method through visual augmentation (TrusV-HSD), which enhances semantic information through integration with diffused visual images and mitigates uncertainty with trustworthy loss. TrusV-HSD learns semantic representations by effectively extracting trustworthy information through multi-modal connections without paired data. Our experiments on public HSD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TrusV-HSD, showing remarkable improvements over conventional methods.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel approach for deep visualization via a generative network, offering an improvement over existing methods. Our model simplifies the architecture by reducing the number of networks used, requiring only a generator and a discriminator, as opposed to the multiple networks traditionally involved. Additionally, our model requires less prior training knowledge and uses a non-adversarial training process, where the discriminator acts as a guide rather than a competitor to the generator. The core contribution of this work is its ability to generate detailed visualization images that align with specific class labels. Our model incorporates a unique skip-connection-inspired block design, which enhances label-directed image generation by propagating class information across multiple layers. Furthermore, we explore how these generated visualizations can be utilized as adversarial examples, effectively fooling classification networks with minimal perceptible modifications to the original images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional adversarial example generation techniques in both targeted and non-targeted attacks, achieving up to a 94.5% fooling rate with minimal perturbation. This work bridges the gap between visualization methods and adversarial examples, proposing that fooling rate could serve as a quantitative measure for evaluating visualization quality. The insights from this study provide a new perspective on the interpretability of neural networks and their vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks.

- **Summary**: Accurate field boundary delineation is a critical challenge in digital agriculture, impacting everything from crop monitoring to resource management. Existing methods often struggle with noise and fail to generalize across varied landscapes, particularly when dealing with cloud cover in optical remote sensing. In response, this study presents a new approach that leverages time series data from Sentinel-2 (S2) and Sentinel-1 (S1) imagery to improve performance under diverse cloud conditions, without the need for manual cloud filtering. We introduce a 3D Vision Transformer architecture specifically designed for satellite image time series, incorporating a memory-efficient attention mechanism. Two models are proposed: PTAViT3D, which handles either S2 or S1 data independently, and PTAViT3D-CA, which fuses both datasets to enhance accuracy. Both models are evaluated under sparse and dense cloud coverage by exploiting spatio-temporal correlations. Our results demonstrate that the models can effectively delineate field boundaries, even with partial (S2 or S2 and S1 data fusion) or dense cloud cover (S1), with the S1-based model providing performance comparable to S2 imagery in terms of spatial resolution. A key strength of this approach lies in its capacity to directly process cloud-contaminated imagery by leveraging spatio-temporal correlations in a memory-efficient manner. This methodology, used in the ePaddocks product to map Australia's national field boundaries, offers a robust, scalable solution adaptable to varying agricultural environments, delivering precision and reliability where existing methods falter.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in prompt tuning have successfully adapted large-scale models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained (CLIP) for downstream tasks such as scene text detection. Typically, text prompt complements the text encoder's input, focusing on global features while neglecting fine-grained details, leading to fine-grained text being ignored in task of scene text detection. In this paper, we propose the region prompt tuning (RPT) method for fine-grained scene text detection, where region text prompt proposed would help focus on fine-grained features. Region prompt tuning method decomposes region text prompt into individual characters and splits visual feature map into region visual tokens, creating a one-to-one correspondence between characters and tokens. This allows a character matches the local features of a token, thereby avoiding the omission of detailed features and fine-grained text. To achieve this, we introduce a sharing position embedding to link each character with its corresponding token and employ a bidirectional distance loss to align each region text prompt character with the target ``text''. To refine the information at fine-grained level, we implement character-token level interactions before and after encoding. Our proposed method combines a general score map from the image-text process with a region score map derived from character-token matching, producing a final score map that could balance the global and local features and be fed into DBNet to detect the text. Experiments on benchmarks like ICDAR2015, TotalText, and CTW1500 demonstrate RPT impressive performance, underscoring its effectiveness for scene text detection.

- **Summary**: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medical diagnostics is often hindered by model opacity, where high-accuracy systems function as "black boxes" without transparent reasoning. This limitation is critical in clinical settings, where trust and reliability are paramount. To address this, we have developed an explainable AI methodology tailored for medical imaging. By employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that analyzes MRI scans across both image and frequency domains, we introduce a novel approach that incorporates Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection UMAP] for the visualization of latent input embeddings. This approach not only enhances early training efficiency but also deepens our understanding of how additional features impact the model predictions, thereby increasing interpretability and supporting more accurate and intuitive diagnostic inferences

- **Summary**: We introduce PortraitGen, a powerful portrait video editing method that achieves consistent and expressive stylization with multimodal prompts. Traditional portrait video editing methods often struggle with 3D and temporal consistency, and typically lack in rendering quality and efficiency. To address these issues, we lift the portrait video frames to a unified dynamic 3D Gaussian field, which ensures structural and temporal coherence across frames. Furthermore, we design a novel Neural Gaussian Texture mechanism that not only enables sophisticated style editing but also achieves rendering speed over 100FPS. Our approach incorporates multimodal inputs through knowledge distilled from large-scale 2D generative models. Our system also incorporates expression similarity guidance and a face-aware portrait editing module, effectively mitigating degradation issues associated with iterative dataset updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the temporal consistency, editing efficiency, and superior rendering quality of our method. The broad applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated through various applications, including text-driven editing, image-driven editing, and relighting, highlighting its great potential to advance the field of video editing.

- **Summary**: Understanding satire and humor is a challenging task for even current Vision-Language models. In this paper, we propose the challenging tasks of Satirical Image Detection (detecting whether an image is satirical), Understanding (generating the reason behind the image being satirical), and Completion (given one half of the image, selecting the other half from 2 given options, such that the complete image is satirical) and release a high-quality dataset YesBut, consisting of 2547 images, 1084 satirical and 1463 non-satirical, containing different artistic styles, to evaluate those tasks. Each satirical image in the dataset depicts a normal scenario, along with a conflicting scenario which is funny or ironic. Despite the success of current Vision-Language Models on multimodal tasks such as Visual QA and Image Captioning, our benchmarking experiments show that such models perform poorly on the proposed tasks on the YesBut Dataset in Zero-Shot Settings w.r.t both automated as well as human evaluation. Additionally, we release a dataset of 119 real, satirical photographs for further research. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/abhi1nandy2/yesbut_dataset.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a pivotal role in multimedia applications for detecting defective products and automating quality inspection. Deep learning (DL) models typically require large-scale annotated data, which are often highly imbalanced since anomalies are usually scarce. The black box nature of these models prohibits them from being trusted by users. To address these challenges, we propose MeLIAD, a novel methodology for interpretable anomaly detection, which unlike the previous methods is based on metric learning and achieves interpretability by design without relying on any prior distribution assumptions of true anomalies. MeLIAD requires only a few samples of anomalies for training, without employing any augmentation techniques, and is inherently interpretable, providing visualizations that offer insights into why an image is identified as anomalous. This is achieved by introducing a novel trainable entropy-based scoring component for the identification and localization of anomalous instances, and a novel loss function that jointly optimizes the anomaly scoring component with a metric learning objective. Experiments on five public benchmark datasets, including quantitative and qualitative evaluation of interpretability, demonstrate that MeLIAD achieves improved anomaly detection and localization performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Clinical videos in the context of Autism Spectrum Disorder are often long-form interactions between children and caregivers/clinical professionals, encompassing complex verbal and non-verbal behaviors. Objective analyses of these videos could provide clinicians and researchers with nuanced insights into the behavior of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Manually coding these videos is a time-consuming task and requires a high level of domain expertise. Hence, the ability to capture these interactions computationally can augment the manual effort and enable supporting the diagnostic procedure. In this work, we investigate the use of foundation models across three modalities: speech, video, and text, to analyse child-focused interaction sessions. We propose a unified methodology to combine multiple modalities by using large language models as reasoning agents. We evaluate their performance on two tasks with different information granularity: activity recognition and abnormal behavior detection. We find that the proposed multimodal pipeline provides robustness to modality-specific limitations and improves performance on the clinical video analysis compared to unimodal settings.

- **Summary**: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), which aims to ground a local visual region via natural language, is a task that heavily relies on multimodal alignment. Most existing methods utilize powerful pre-trained models to transfer visual/linguistic knowledge by full fine-tuning. However, full fine-tuning the entire backbone not only breaks the rich prior knowledge embedded in the pre-training, but also incurs significant computational costs. Motivated by the recent emergence of Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) methods, we aim to solve the REC task in an effective and efficient manner. Directly applying these PETL methods to the REC task is inappropriate, as they lack the specific-domain abilities for precise local visual perception and visual-language alignment. Therefore, we propose a novel framework of Multimodal Prior-guided Parameter Efficient Tuning, namely MaPPER. Specifically, MaPPER comprises Dynamic Prior Adapters guided by a aligned prior, and Local Convolution Adapters to extract precise local semantics for better visual perception. Moreover, the Prior-Guided Text module is proposed to further utilize the prior for facilitating the cross-modal alignment. Experimental results on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that MaPPER achieves the best accuracy compared to the full fine-tuning and other PETL methods with only 1.41% tunable backbone parameters.

- **Summary**: The rapid development of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often comes with widespread hallucination issues, making cost-effective and comprehensive assessments increasingly vital. Current approaches mainly rely on costly annotations and are not comprehensive -- in terms of evaluating all aspects such as relations, attributes, and dependencies between aspects. Therefore, we introduce the FIHA (autonomous Fine-graIned Hallucination evAluation evaluation in LVLMs), which could access hallucination LVLMs in the LLM-free and annotation-free way and model the dependency between different types of hallucinations. FIHA can generate Q&A pairs on any image dataset at minimal cost, enabling hallucination assessment from both image and caption. Based on this approach, we introduce a benchmark called FIHA-v1, which consists of diverse questions on various images from MSCOCO and Foggy. Furthermore, we use the Davidson Scene Graph (DSG) to organize the structure among Q&A pairs, in which we can increase the reliability of the evaluation. We evaluate representative models using FIHA-v1, highlighting their limitations and challenges. We released our code and data.

- **Summary**: An improved model of medical image segmentation for brain tumor is discussed, which is a deep learning algorithm based on U-Net architecture. Based on the traditional U-Net, we introduce GSConv module and ECA attention mechanism to improve the performance of the model in medical image segmentation tasks. With these improvements, the new U-Net model is able to extract and utilize multi-scale features more efficiently while flexibly focusing on important channels, resulting in significantly improved segmentation results. During the experiment, the improved U-Net model is trained and evaluated systematically. By looking at the loss curves of the training set and the test set, we find that the loss values of both rapidly decline to the lowest point after the eighth epoch, and then gradually converge and stabilize. This shows that our model has good learning ability and generalization ability. In addition, by monitoring the change in the mean intersection ratio (mIoU), we can see that after the 35th epoch, the mIoU gradually approaches 0.8 and remains stable, which further validates the model. Compared with the traditional U-Net, the improved version based on GSConv module and ECA attention mechanism shows obvious advantages in segmentation effect. Especially in the processing of brain tumor image edges, the improved model can provide more accurate segmentation results. This achievement not only improves the accuracy of medical image analysis, but also provides more reliable technical support for clinical diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Given a language expression, referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) aims to identify the ground objects and assign pixel-wise labels within the imagery. The one of key challenges for this task is to capture discriminative multi-modal features via text-image alignment. However, the existing RRSIS methods use one vanilla and coarse alignment, where the language expression is directly extracted to be fused with the visual features. In this paper, we argue that a "fine-grained image-text alignment" can improve the extraction of multi-modal information. To this point, we here proposed a new referring remote sensing image segmentation method, termed FIANet, that fully exploits the visual and linguistic representations. Specifically, the original referring expression is regarded as context text, which is further decoupled into ground object text and spatial position text. The proposed fine-grained image-text alignment module (FIAM) would simultaneously leverage the features of the input image and the corresponding texts and learn better discriminative multi-modal representation. Meanwhile, to handle the various scales of ground objects in remote sensing, we introduce a Text-aware Multi-scale Enhancement Module (TMEM) to adaptively perform cross-scale fusion and intersections. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on two public referring remote sensing datasets including RefSegRS and RRSIS-D, and our method obtains superior performance over several state-of-the-art methods. The code will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks. However, current training approaches combine standard cross-entropy loss with extensive data, human feedback, or ad hoc methods to enhance performance. These solutions are often not scalable or feasible due to their associated costs, complexity, or resource requirements. This study investigates the use of established semantic segmentation loss functions in natural language generation to create a versatile, practical, and scalable solution for fine-tuning different architectures. We evaluate their effectiveness in solving Math Word Problems and question answering across different models of varying sizes. For the analyzed tasks, we found that the traditional Cross-Entropy loss represents a sub-optimal choice, while models trained to minimize alternative (task-dependent) losses, such as Focal or Lov\'asz, achieve a mean improvement of +42% on exact match without requiring additional data or human feedback. These findings suggest a promising pathway for more efficient and accessible training processes.

- **Summary**: Experiencing high-fidelity volumetric video as seamlessly as 2D videos is a long-held dream. However, current dynamic 3DGS methods, despite their high rendering quality, face challenges in streaming on mobile devices due to computational and bandwidth constraints. In this paper, we introduce V^3 (Viewing Volumetric Videos), a novel approach that enables high-quality mobile rendering through the streaming of dynamic Gaussians. Our key innovation is to view dynamic 3DGS as 2D videos, facilitating the use of hardware video codecs. Additionally, we propose a two-stage training strategy to reduce storage requirements with rapid training speed. The first stage employs hash encoding and shallow MLP to learn motion, then reduces the number of Gaussians through pruning to meet the streaming requirements, while the second stage fine tunes other Gaussian attributes using residual entropy loss and temporal loss to improve temporal continuity. This strategy, which disentangles motion and appearance, maintains high rendering quality with compact storage requirements. Meanwhile, we designed a multi-platform player to decode and render 2D Gaussian videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of V^3, outperforming other methods by enabling high-quality rendering and streaming on common devices, which is unseen before. As the first to stream dynamic Gaussians on mobile devices, our companion player offers users an unprecedented volumetric video experience, including smooth scrolling and instant sharing.

- **Summary**: Parkour poses a significant challenge for legged robots, requiring navigation through complex environments with agility and precision based on limited sensory inputs. In this work, we introduce a novel method for training end-to-end visual policies, from depth pixels to robot control commands, to achieve agile and safe quadruped locomotion. We formulate robot parkour as a constrained reinforcement learning (RL) problem designed to maximize the emergence of agile skills within the robot's physical limits while ensuring safety. We first train a policy without vision using privileged information about the robot's surroundings. We then generate experience from this privileged policy to warm-start a sample efficient off-policy RL algorithm from depth images. This allows the robot to adapt behaviors from this privileged experience to visual locomotion while circumventing the high computational costs of RL directly from pixels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a real Solo-12 robot, showcasing its capability to perform a variety of parkour skills such as walking, climbing, leaping, and crawling.

- **Summary**: Class-agnostic image segmentation is a crucial component in automating image editing workflows, especially in contexts where object selection traditionally involves interactive tools. Existing methods in the literature often adhere to top-down formulations, following the paradigm of class-based approaches, where object detection precedes per-object segmentation. In this work, we present a novel bottom-up formulation for addressing the class-agnostic segmentation problem. We supervise our network directly on the projective sphere of its feature space, employing losses inspired by metric learning literature as well as losses defined in a novel segmentation-space representation. The segmentation results are obtained through a straightforward mean-shift clustering of the estimated features. Our bottom-up formulation exhibits exceptional generalization capability, even when trained on datasets designed for class-based segmentation. We further showcase the effectiveness of our generic approach by addressing the challenging task of cell and nucleus segmentation. We believe that our bottom-up formulation will offer valuable insights into diverse segmentation challenges in the literature.

- **Summary**: Plastic pollution presents an escalating global issue, impacting health and environmental systems, with micro- and nanoplastics found across mediums from potable water to air. Traditional methods for studying these contaminants are labor-intensive and time-consuming, necessitating a shift towards more efficient technologies. In response, this paper introduces micro- and nanoplastics (MiNa), a novel and open-source dataset engineered for the automatic detection and classification of micro and nanoplastics using object detection algorithms. The dataset, comprising scanning electron microscopy images simulated under realistic aquatic conditions, categorizes plastics by polymer type across a broad size spectrum. We demonstrate the application of state-of-the-art detection algorithms on MiNa, assessing their effectiveness and identifying the unique challenges and potential of each method. The dataset not only fills a critical gap in available resources for microplastic research but also provides a robust foundation for future advancements in the field.

- **Summary**: The low dynamic range (LDR) of common cameras fails to capture the rich contrast in natural scenes, resulting in loss of color and details in saturated pixels. Reconstructing the high dynamic range (HDR) of luminance present in the scene from single LDR photographs is an important task with many applications in computational photography and realistic display of images. The HDR reconstruction task aims to infer the lost details using the context present in the scene, requiring neural networks to understand high-level geometric and illumination cues. This makes it challenging for data-driven algorithms to generate accurate and high-resolution results. In this work, we introduce a physically-inspired remodeling of the HDR reconstruction problem in the intrinsic domain. The intrinsic model allows us to train separate networks to extend the dynamic range in the shading domain and to recover lost color details in the albedo domain. We show that dividing the problem into two simpler sub-tasks improves performance in a wide variety of photographs.

- **Summary**: We introduce V-AURA, the first autoregressive model to achieve high temporal alignment and relevance in video-to-audio generation. V-AURA uses a high-framerate visual feature extractor and a cross-modal audio-visual feature fusion strategy to capture fine-grained visual motion events and ensure precise temporal alignment. Additionally, we propose VisualSound, a benchmark dataset with high audio-visual relevance. VisualSound is based on VGGSound, a video dataset consisting of in-the-wild samples extracted from YouTube. During the curation, we remove samples where auditory events are not aligned with the visual ones. V-AURA outperforms current state-of-the-art models in temporal alignment and semantic relevance while maintaining comparable audio quality. Code, samples, VisualSound and models are available at https://v-aura.notion.site

- **Summary**: Intrinsic image decomposition aims to separate the surface reflectance and the effects from the illumination given a single photograph. Due to the complexity of the problem, most prior works assume a single-color illumination and a Lambertian world, which limits their use in illumination-aware image editing applications. In this work, we separate an input image into its diffuse albedo, colorful diffuse shading, and specular residual components. We arrive at our result by gradually removing first the single-color illumination and then the Lambertian-world assumptions. We show that by dividing the problem into easier sub-problems, in-the-wild colorful diffuse shading estimation can be achieved despite the limited ground-truth datasets. Our extended intrinsic model enables illumination-aware analysis of photographs and can be used for image editing applications such as specularity removal and per-pixel white balancing.

- **Summary**: The use of transformers for vision tasks has challenged the traditional dominant role of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in computer vision (CV). For image classification tasks, Vision Transformer (ViT) effectively establishes spatial relationships between patches within images, directing attention to important areas for accurate predictions. However, similar to CNNs, ViTs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which mislead the image classifier into making incorrect decisions on images with carefully designed perturbations. Moreover, adversarial patch attacks, which introduce arbitrary perturbations within a small area, pose a more serious threat to ViTs. Even worse, traditional detection methods, originally designed for CNN models, are impractical or suffer significant performance degradation when applied to ViTs, and they generally overlook patch attacks.   In this paper, we propose ViTGuard as a general detection method for defending ViT models against adversarial attacks, including typical attacks where perturbations spread over the entire input and patch attacks. ViTGuard uses a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) model to recover randomly masked patches from the unmasked regions, providing a flexible image reconstruction strategy. Then, threshold-based detectors leverage distinctive ViT features, including attention maps and classification (CLS) token representations, to distinguish between normal and adversarial samples. The MAE model does not involve any adversarial samples during training, ensuring the effectiveness of our detectors against unseen attacks. ViTGuard is compared with seven existing detection methods under nine attacks across three datasets. The evaluation results show the superiority of ViTGuard over existing detectors. Finally, considering the potential detection evasion, we further demonstrate ViTGuard's robustness against adaptive attacks for evasion.

- **Summary**: An incomplete field-of-view (FOV) in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) can severely hinder the volumetric and bundle analyses of whole-brain white matter connectivity. Although existing works have investigated imputing the missing regions using deep generative models, it remains unclear how to specifically utilize additional information from paired multi-modality data and whether this can enhance the imputation quality and be useful for downstream tractography. To fill this gap, we propose a novel framework for imputing dMRI scans in the incomplete part of the FOV by integrating the learned diffusion features in the acquired part of the FOV to the complete brain anatomical structure. We hypothesize that by this design the proposed framework can enhance the imputation performance of the dMRI scans and therefore be useful for repairing whole-brain tractography in corrupted dMRI scans with incomplete FOV. We tested our framework on two cohorts from different sites with a total of 96 subjects and compared it with a baseline imputation method that treats the information from T1w and dMRI scans equally. The proposed framework achieved significant improvements in imputation performance, as demonstrated by angular correlation coefficient (p < 1E-5), and in downstream tractography accuracy, as demonstrated by Dice score (p < 0.01). Results suggest that the proposed framework improved imputation performance in dMRI scans by specifically utilizing additional information from paired multi-modality data, compared with the baseline method. The imputation achieved by the proposed framework enhances whole brain tractography, and therefore reduces the uncertainty when analyzing bundles associated with neurodegenerative.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the data collected for artificial intelligence has grown to an unmanageable amount. Particularly within industrial applications, such as autonomous vehicles, model training computation budgets are being exceeded while model performance is saturating -- and yet more data continues to pour in. To navigate the flood of data, we propose a framework to select the most semantically diverse and important dataset portion. Then, we further semantically enrich it by discovering meaningful new data from a massive unlabeled data pool. Importantly, we can provide explainability by leveraging foundation models to generate semantics for every data point. We quantitatively show that our Semantic Selection and Enrichment framework (SSE) can a) successfully maintain model performance with a smaller training dataset and b) improve model performance by enriching the smaller dataset without exceeding the original dataset size. Consequently, we demonstrate that semantic diversity is imperative for optimal data selection and model performance.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel deep-learning method for the automatic detection and segmentation of lung nodules, aimed at advancing the accuracy of early-stage lung cancer diagnosis. The proposed approach leverages a unique "Channel Squeeze U-Structure" that optimizes feature extraction and information integration across multiple semantic levels of the network. This architecture includes three key modules: shallow information processing, channel residual structure, and channel squeeze integration. These modules enhance the model's ability to detect and segment small, imperceptible, or ground-glass nodules, which are critical for early diagnosis. The method demonstrates superior performance in terms of sensitivity, Dice similarity coefficient, precision, and mean Intersection over Union (IoU). Extensive experiments were conducted on the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) dataset using five-fold cross-validation, showing excellent stability and robustness. The results indicate that this approach holds significant potential for improving computer-aided diagnosis systems, providing reliable support for radiologists in clinical practice and aiding in the early detection of lung cancer, especially in resource-limited settings

- **Summary**: Video game playing is an extremely structured domain where algorithmic decision-making can be tested without adverse real-world consequences. While prevailing methods rely on image inputs to avoid the problem of hand-crafting state space representations, this approach systematically diverges from the way humans actually learn to play games. In this paper, we design object-based input representations that generalize well across a number of video games. Using these representations, we evaluate an agent's ability to learn games similar to an infant - with limited world experience, employing simple inductive biases derived from intuitive representations of physics from the real world. Using such biases, we construct an object category representation to be used by a Q-learning algorithm and assess how well it learns to play multiple games based on observed object affordances. Our results suggest that a human-like object interaction setup capably learns to play several video games, and demonstrates superior generalizability, particularly for unfamiliar objects. Further exploring such methods will allow machines to learn in a human-centric way, thus incorporating more human-like learning benefits.

- **Summary**: Many longitudinal neuroimaging studies aim to improve the understanding of brain aging and diseases by studying the dynamic interactions between brain function and cognition. Doing so requires accurate encoding of their multidimensional relationship while accounting for individual variability over time. For this purpose, we propose an unsupervised learning model (called \underline{\textbf{Co}}ntrastive Learning-based \underline{\textbf{Gra}}ph Generalized \underline{\textbf{Ca}}nonical Correlation Analysis (CoGraCa)) that encodes their relationship via Graph Attention Networks and generalized Canonical Correlational Analysis. To create brain-cognition fingerprints reflecting unique neural and cognitive phenotype of each person, the model also relies on individualized and multimodal contrastive learning. We apply CoGraCa to longitudinal dataset of healthy individuals consisting of resting-state functional MRI and cognitive measures acquired at multiple visits for each participant. The generated fingerprints effectively capture significant individual differences and outperform current single-modal and CCA-based multimodal models in identifying sex and age. More importantly, our encoding provides interpretable interactions between those two modalities.

- **Summary**: In the field of autonomous driving, Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) perception has attracted increasing attention in the community since it provides more comprehensive information compared with pinhole front-view images and panoramas. Traditional BEV methods, which rely on multiple narrow-field cameras and complex pose estimations, often face calibration and synchronization issues. To break the wall of the aforementioned challenges, in this work, we introduce OneBEV, a novel BEV semantic mapping approach using merely a single panoramic image as input, simplifying the mapping process and reducing computational complexities. A distortion-aware module termed Mamba View Transformation (MVT) is specifically designed to handle the spatial distortions in panoramas, transforming front-view features into BEV features without leveraging traditional attention mechanisms. Apart from the efficient framework, we contribute two datasets, i.e., nuScenes-360 and DeepAccident-360, tailored for the OneBEV task. Experimental results showcase that OneBEV achieves state-of-the-art performance with 51.1% and 36.1% mIoU on nuScenes-360 and DeepAccident-360, respectively. This work advances BEV semantic mapping in autonomous driving, paving the way for more advanced and reliable autonomous systems.

- **Summary**: This paper improves upon existing data pruning methods for image classification by introducing a novel pruning metric and pruning procedure based on importance sampling. The proposed pruning metric explicitly accounts for data separability, data integrity, and model uncertainty, while the sampling procedure is adaptive to the pruning ratio and considers both intra-class and inter-class separation to further enhance the effectiveness of pruning. Furthermore, the sampling method can readily be applied to other pruning metrics to improve their performance. Overall, the proposed approach scales well to high pruning ratio and generalizes better across different classification models, as demonstrated by experiments on four benchmark datasets, including the fine-grained classification scenario.

- **Summary**: Computed tomography is a widely used imaging modality with applications ranging from medical imaging to material analysis. One major challenge arises from the lack of scanning information at certain angles, leading to distorted CT images with artifacts. This results in an ill-posed problem known as the Limited Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) reconstruction problem. To address this problem, we propose Residual Null-Space Diffusion Stochastic Differential Equations (RN-SDEs), which are a variant of diffusion models that characterize the diffusion process with mean-reverting (MR) stochastic differential equations. To demonstrate the generalizability of RN-SDEs, our experiments are conducted on two different LACT datasets, i.e., ChromSTEM and C4KC-KiTS. Through extensive experiments, we show that by leveraging learned Mean-Reverting SDEs as a prior and emphasizing data consistency using Range-Null Space Decomposition (RNSD) based rectification, RN-SDEs can restore high-quality images from severe degradation and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most LACT tasks. Additionally, we present a quantitative comparison of computational complexity and runtime efficiency, highlighting the superior effectiveness of our proposed approach.

- **Summary**: As per recent studies, Self-supervised learning (SSL) does not readily extend to smaller architectures. One direction to mitigate this shortcoming while simultaneously training a smaller network without labels is to adopt unsupervised knowledge distillation (UKD). Existing UKD approaches handcraft preservation worthy inter/intra sample relationships between the teacher and its student. However, this may overlook/ignore other key relationships present in the mapping of a teacher. In this paper, instead of heuristically constructing preservation worthy relationships between samples, we directly motivate the student to model the teacher's embedding manifold. If the mapped manifold is similar, all inter/intra sample relationships are indirectly conserved. We first demonstrate that prior methods cannot preserve teacher's latent manifold due to their sole reliance on $L_2$ normalised embedding features. Subsequently, we propose a simple objective to capture the lost information due to normalisation. Our proposed loss component, termed \textbf{space similarity}, motivates each dimension of a student's feature space to be similar to the corresponding dimension of its teacher. We perform extensive experiments demonstrating strong performance of our proposed approach on various benchmarks.

- **Summary**: We use images of cars of a wide range of varieties to compose an image of an animal such as a bird or a lion for the theme of environmental protection to maximize the information about cars in a single composed image and to raise the awareness about environmental challenges. We present a novel way of image interaction with an artistically-composed photomosaic image, in which a simple operation of "click and display" is used to demonstrate the interactive switch between a tile image in a photomosaic image and the corresponding original car image, which will be automatically saved on the Desktop. We build a multimodal custom GPT named TalkMosaic by incorporating car images information and the related knowledge to ChatGPT. By uploading the original car image to TalkMosaic, we can ask questions about the given car image and get the corresponding answers efficiently and effectively such as where to buy the tire in the car image that satisfies high environmental standards. We give an in-depth analysis on how to speed up the inference of multimodal LLM using sparse attention and quantization techniques with presented probabilistic FlashAttention (PrFlashAttention) and Staircase Adaptive Quantization (SAQ) methods. The implemented prototype demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the presented approach.

- **Summary**: Quantitative analysis of microscopy images is essential in the design and fabrication of components used in augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) modules. However, segmenting regions of interest (ROIs) from these complex images and extracting critical dimensions (CDs) requires novel techniques, such as deep learning models which are key for actionable decisions on process, material and device optimization. In this study, we report on the fine-tuning of a pre-trained Segment Anything Model (SAM) using a diverse dataset of electron microscopy images. We employed methods such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce training time and enhance the accuracy of ROI extraction. The model's ability to generalize to unseen images facilitates zero-shot learning and supports a CD extraction model that precisely extracts CDs from the segmented ROIs. We demonstrate the accurate extraction of binary images from cross-sectional images of surface relief gratings (SRGs) and Fresnel lenses in both single and multiclass modes. Furthermore, these binary images are used to identify transition points, aiding in the extraction of relevant CDs. The combined use of the fine-tuned segmentation model and the CD extraction model offers substantial advantages to various industrial applications by enhancing analytical capabilities, time to data and insights, and optimizing manufacturing processes.
