- **Summary**: An emerging area of research aims to learn deep generative models with limited training data. Prior generative models like GANs and diffusion models require a lot of data to perform well, and their performance degrades when they are trained on only a small amount of data. A recent technique called Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) has been adapted to the few-shot setting, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, current IMLE-based approaches encounter challenges due to inadequate correspondence between the latent codes selected for training and those drawn during inference. This results in suboptimal test-time performance. We theoretically show a way to address this issue and propose RS-IMLE, a novel approach that changes the prior distribution used for training. This leads to substantially higher quality image generation compared to existing GAN and IMLE-based methods, as validated by comprehensive experiments conducted on nine few-shot image datasets.

- **Summary**: To display low-quality broadcast content on high-resolution screens in full-screen format, the application of Super-Resolution (SR), a key consumer technology, is essential. Recently, SR methods have been developed that not only increase resolution while preserving the original image information but also enhance the perceived quality. However, evaluating the quality of SR images generated from low-quality sources, such as SR-enhanced broadcast content, is challenging due to the need to consider both distortions and improvements. Additionally, assessing SR image quality without original high-quality sources presents another significant challenge. Unfortunately, there has been a dearth of research specifically addressing the Image Quality Assessment (IQA) of SR images under these conditions. In this work, we introduce a new IQA dataset for SR broadcast images in both 2K and 4K resolutions. We conducted a subjective quality evaluation to obtain the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for these SR images and performed a comprehensive human study to identify the key factors influencing the perceived quality. Finally, we evaluated the performance of existing IQA metrics on our dataset. This study reveals the limitations of current metrics, highlighting the need for a more robust IQA metric that better correlates with the perceived quality of SR images.

- **Summary**: Few-shot Segmentation (FSS) aims to segment the interested objects in the query image with just a handful of labeled samples (i.e., support images). Previous schemes would leverage the similarity between support-query pixel pairs to construct the pixel-level semantic correlation. However, in remote sensing scenarios with extreme intra-class variations and cluttered backgrounds, such pixel-level correlations may produce tremendous mismatches, resulting in semantic ambiguity between the query foreground (FG) and background (BG) pixels. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Agent Mining Transformer (AgMTR), which adaptively mines a set of local-aware agents to construct agent-level semantic correlation. Compared with pixel-level semantics, the given agents are equipped with local-contextual information and possess a broader receptive field. At this point, different query pixels can selectively aggregate the fine-grained local semantics of different agents, thereby enhancing the semantic clarity between query FG and BG pixels. Concretely, the Agent Learning Encoder (ALE) is first proposed to erect the optimal transport plan that arranges different agents to aggregate support semantics under different local regions. Then, for further optimizing the agents, the Agent Aggregation Decoder (AAD) and the Semantic Alignment Decoder (SAD) are constructed to break through the limited support set for mining valuable class-specific semantics from unlabeled data sources and the query image itself, respectively. Extensive experiments on the remote sensing benchmark iSAID indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Surprisingly, our method remains quite competitive when extended to more common natural scenarios, i.e., PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i.

- **Summary**: Parametric Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is central to contemporary mechanical design. However, it encounters challenges in achieving precise parametric sketch modeling and lacks practical evaluation metrics suitable for mechanical design. We harness the capabilities of pre-trained foundation models, renowned for their successes in natural language processing and computer vision, to develop generative models specifically for CAD. These models are adept at understanding complex geometries and design reasoning, a crucial advancement in CAD technology. In this paper, we propose CadVLM, an end-to-end vision language model for CAD generation. Our approach involves adapting pre-trained foundation models to manipulate engineering sketches effectively, integrating both sketch primitive sequences and sketch images. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance on multiple CAD sketch generation tasks such as CAD autocompletion, CAD autoconstraint, and image conditional generation. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) being successfully applied to parametric CAD generation, representing a pioneering step in the field of computer-aided mechanical design.

- **Summary**: Despite advancements in Neural Implicit models for 3D surface reconstruction, handling dynamic environments with arbitrary rigid, non-rigid, or deformable entities remains challenging. Many template-based methods are entity-specific, focusing on humans, while generic reconstruction methods adaptable to such dynamic scenes often require additional inputs like depth or optical flow or rely on pre-trained image features for reasonable outcomes. These methods typically use latent codes to capture frame-by-frame deformations. In contrast, some template-free methods bypass these requirements and adopt traditional LBS (Linear Blend Skinning) weights for a detailed representation of deformable object motions, although they involve complex optimizations leading to lengthy training times. To this end, as a remedy, this paper introduces TFS-NeRF, a template-free 3D semantic NeRF for dynamic scenes captured from sparse or single-view RGB videos, featuring interactions among various entities and more time-efficient than other LBS-based approaches. Our framework uses an Invertible Neural Network (INN) for LBS prediction, simplifying the training process. By disentangling the motions of multiple entities and optimizing per-entity skinning weights, our method efficiently generates accurate, semantically separable geometries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality reconstructions of both deformable and non-deformable objects in complex interactions, with improved training efficiency compared to existing methods.

- **Summary**: Medical anomaly detection (AD) is crucial in pathological identification and localization. Current methods typically rely on uncertainty estimation in deep ensembles to detect anomalies, assuming that ensemble learners should agree on normal samples while exhibiting disagreement on unseen anomalies in the output space. However, these methods may suffer from inadequate disagreement on anomalies or diminished agreement on normal samples. To tackle these issues, we propose D2UE, a Diversified Dual-space Uncertainty Estimation framework for medical anomaly detection. To effectively balance agreement and disagreement for anomaly detection, we propose Redundancy-Aware Repulsion (RAR), which uses a similarity kernel that remains invariant to both isotropic scaling and orthogonal transformations, explicitly promoting diversity in learners' feature space. Moreover, to accentuate anomalous regions, we develop Dual-Space Uncertainty (DSU), which utilizes the ensemble's uncertainty in input and output spaces. In input space, we first calculate gradients of reconstruction error with respect to input images. The gradients are then integrated with reconstruction outputs to estimate uncertainty for inputs, enabling effective anomaly discrimination even when output space disagreement is minimal. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five medical benchmarks with different backbones. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method to state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of each component in our framework.

- **Summary**: Emerging of visual language models, such as the segment anything model (SAM), have made great breakthroughs in the field of universal semantic segmentation and significantly aid the improvements of medical image segmentation, in particular with the help of Medical SAM adaptor (Med-SA). However, Med-SA still can be improved, as it fine-tunes SAM in a partial adaption manner. To resolve this problem, we present a novel global medical SAM adaptor (GMed-SA) with full adaption, which can adapt SAM globally. We further combine GMed-SA and Med-SA to propose a global-local medical SAM adaptor (GLMed-SA) to adapt SAM both globally and locally. Extensive experiments have been performed on the challenging public 2D melanoma segmentation dataset. The results show that GLMed-SA outperforms several state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods on various evaluation metrics, demonstrating the superiority of our methods.

- **Summary**: The curvature of ODE trajectories in diffusion models hinders their ability to generate high-quality images in a few number of function evaluations (NFE). In this paper, we propose a novel and effective approach to reduce trajectory curvature by utilizing adaptive conditions. By employing a extremely light-weight quantized encoder, our method incurs only an additional 1% of training parameters, eliminates the need for extra regularization terms, yet achieves significantly better sample quality. Our approach accelerates ODE sampling while preserving the downstream task image editing capabilities of SDE techniques. Extensive experiments verify that our method can generate high quality results under extremely limited sampling costs. With only 6 NFE, we achieve 5.14 FID on CIFAR-10, 6.91 FID on FFHQ 64x64 and 3.10 FID on AFHQv2.

- **Summary**: Many medical image segmentation methods have achieved impressive results. Yet, most existing methods do not take into account the shape-intensity prior information. This may lead to implausible segmentation results, in particular for images of unseen datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to incorporate joint shape-intensity prior information into the segmentation network. Specifically, we first train a segmentation network (regarded as the teacher network) on class-wise averaged training images to extract valuable shape-intensity information, which is then transferred to a student segmentation network with the same network architecture as the teacher via knowledge distillation. In this way, the student network regarded as the final segmentation model can effectively integrate the shape-intensity prior information, yielding more accurate segmentation results. Despite its simplicity, experiments on five medical image segmentation tasks of different modalities demonstrate that the proposed Shape-Intensity Knowledge Distillation (SIKD) consistently improves several baseline models (including recent MaxStyle and SAMed) under intra-dataset evaluation, and significantly improves the cross-dataset generalization ability. The code is available at https://github.com/whdong-whu/SIKD.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities as a general-purpose interface for various visual and linguistic tasks. However, building a unified MLLM for multi-task learning in the medical field remains a thorny challenge. To mitigate the tug-of-war problem of multi-modal multi-task optimization, recent advances primarily focus on improving the LLM components, while neglecting the connector that bridges the gap between modalities. In this paper, we introduce Uni-Med, a novel medical generalist foundation model which consists of a universal visual feature extraction module, a connector mixture-of-experts (CMoE) module, and an LLM. Benefiting from the proposed CMoE that leverages a well-designed router with a mixture of projection experts at the connector, Uni-Med achieves efficient solution to the tug-of-war problem and can perform six different medical tasks including question answering, visual question answering, report generation, referring expression comprehension, referring expression generation and image classification. To the best of our knowledge, Uni-Med is the first effort to tackle multi-task interference at the connector. Extensive ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of introducing CMoE under any configuration, with up to an average 8% performance gains. We further provide interpretation analysis of the tug-of-war problem from the perspective of gradient optimization and parameter statistics. Compared to previous state-of-the-art medical MLLMs, Uni-Med achieves competitive or superior evaluation metrics on diverse tasks. Code, data and model will be soon available at GitHub.

- **Summary**: Although modern imaging technologies allow us to study connectivity between two distinct brain regions in-vivo, an in-depth understanding of how anatomical structure supports brain function and how spontaneous functional fluctuations emerge remarkable cognition is still elusive. Meanwhile, tremendous efforts have been made in the realm of machine learning to establish the nonlinear mapping between neuroimaging data and phenotypic traits. However, the absence of neuroscience insight in the current approaches poses significant challenges in understanding cognitive behavior from transient neural activities. To address this challenge, we put the spotlight on the coupling mechanism of structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) by formulating such network neuroscience question into an expressive graph representation learning problem for high-order topology. Specifically, we introduce the concept of topological detour to characterize how a ubiquitous instance of FC (direct link) is supported by neural pathways (detour) physically wired by SC, which forms a cyclic loop interacted by brain structure and function. In the clich\'e of machine learning, the multi-hop detour pathway underlying SC-FC coupling allows us to devise a novel multi-head self-attention mechanism within Transformer to capture multi-modal feature representation from paired graphs of SC and FC. Taken together, we propose a biological-inspired deep model, coined as NeuroPath, to find putative connectomic feature representations from the unprecedented amount of neuroimages, which can be plugged into various downstream applications such as task recognition and disease diagnosis. We have evaluated NeuroPath on large-scale public datasets including HCP and UK Biobank under supervised and zero-shot learning, where the state-of-the-art performance by our NeuroPath indicates great potential in network neuroscience.

- **Summary**: Open-set semi-supervised learning (OSSL) leverages practical open-set unlabeled data, comprising both in-distribution (ID) samples from seen classes and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples from unseen classes, for semi-supervised learning (SSL). Prior OSSL methods initially learned the decision boundary between ID and OOD with labeled ID data, subsequently employing self-training to refine this boundary. These methods, however, suffer from the tendency to overtrust the labeled ID data: the scarcity of labeled data caused the distribution bias between the labeled samples and the entire ID data, which misleads the decision boundary to overfit. The subsequent self-training process, based on the overfitted result, fails to rectify this problem. In this paper, we address the overtrusting issue by treating OOD samples as an additional class, forming a new SSL process.   Specifically, we propose SCOMatch, a novel OSSL method that 1) selects reliable OOD samples as new labeled data with an OOD memory queue and a corresponding update strategy and 2) integrates the new SSL process into the original task through our Simultaneous Close-set and Open-set self-training. SCOMatch refines the decision boundary of ID and OOD classes across the entire dataset, thereby leading to improved results. Extensive experimental results show that SCOMatch significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks. The effectiveness is further verified through ablation studies and visualization.

- **Summary**: In order for robots to autonomously navigate and operate in diverse environments, it is essential for them to recognize the state of their environment. On the other hand, the environmental state recognition has traditionally involved distinct methods tailored to each state to be recognized. In this study, we perform a unified environmental state recognition for robots through the spoken language with pre-trained large-scale vision-language models. We apply Visual Question Answering and Image-to-Text Retrieval, which are tasks of Vision-Language Models. We show that with our method, it is possible to recognize not only whether a room door is open/closed, but also whether a transparent door is open/closed and whether water is running in a sink, without training neural networks or manual programming. In addition, the recognition accuracy can be improved by selecting appropriate texts from the set of prepared texts based on black-box optimization. For each state recognition, only the text set and its weighting need to be changed, eliminating the need to prepare multiple different models and programs, and facilitating the management of source code and computer resource. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and apply it to the recognition behavior on a mobile robot, Fetch.

- **Summary**: The rapid evolution of egocentric video analysis brings new insights into understanding human activities and intentions from a first-person perspective. Despite this progress, the fragmentation in tasks like action recognition, procedure learning, and moment retrieval, \etc, coupled with inconsistent annotations and isolated model development, hinders a holistic interpretation of video content. In response, we introduce the EAGLE (Egocentric AGgregated Language-video Engine) model and the EAGLE-400K dataset to provide a unified framework that integrates various egocentric video understanding tasks. EAGLE-400K, the \textit{first} large-scale instruction-tuning dataset tailored for egocentric video, features 400K diverse samples to enhance a broad spectrum of tasks from activity recognition to procedure knowledge learning. Moreover, EAGLE, a strong video multimodal large language model (MLLM), is designed to effectively capture both spatial and temporal information. In addition, we propose a set of evaluation metrics designed to facilitate a thorough assessment of MLLM for egocentric video understanding. Our extensive experiments demonstrate EAGLE's superior performance over existing models, highlighting its ability to balance task-specific understanding with holistic video interpretation. With EAGLE, we aim to pave the way for research opportunities and practical applications in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Generating images with accurately represented text, especially in non-Latin languages, poses a significant challenge for diffusion models. Existing approaches, such as the integration of hint condition diagrams via auxiliary networks (e.g., ControlNet), have made strides towards addressing this issue. However, diffusion models often fall short in tasks requiring controlled text generation, such as specifying particular fonts or producing text in small fonts. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for multilingual visual text creation, named JoyType, designed to maintain the font style of text during the image generation process. Our methodology begins with assembling a training dataset, JoyType-1M, comprising 1 million pairs of data. Each pair includes an image, its description, and glyph instructions corresponding to the font style within the image. We then developed a text control network, Font ControlNet, tasked with extracting font style information to steer the image generation. To further enhance our model's ability to maintain font style, notably in generating small-font text, we incorporated a multi-layer OCR-aware loss into the diffusion process. This enhancement allows JoyType to direct text rendering using low-level descriptors. Our evaluations, based on both visual and accuracy metrics, demonstrate that JoyType significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, JoyType can function as a plugin, facilitating the creation of varied image styles in conjunction with other stable diffusion models on HuggingFace and CivitAI.

- **Summary**: Manual pruning of radiata pine trees presents significant safety risks due to their substantial height and the challenging terrains in which they thrive. To address these risks, this research proposes the development of a drone-based pruning system equipped with specialized pruning tools and a stereo vision camera, enabling precise detection and trimming of branches. Deep learning algorithms, including YOLO and Mask R-CNN, are employed to ensure accurate branch detection, while the Semi-Global Matching algorithm is integrated to provide reliable distance estimation. The synergy between these techniques facilitates the precise identification of branch locations and enables efficient, targeted pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that the combined implementation of YOLO and SGBM enables the drone to accurately detect branches and measure their distances from the drone. This research not only improves the safety and efficiency of pruning operations but also makes a significant contribution to the advancement of drone technology in the automation of agricultural and forestry practices, laying a foundational framework for further innovations in environmental management.

- **Summary**: Visual grounding is a common vision task that involves grounding descriptive sentences to the corresponding regions of an image. Most existing methods use independent image-text encoding and apply complex hand-crafted modules or encoder-decoder architectures for modal interaction and query reasoning. However, their performance significantly drops when dealing with complex textual expressions. This is because the former paradigm only utilizes limited downstream data to fit the multi-modal feature fusion. Therefore, it is only effective when the textual expressions are relatively simple. In contrast, given the wide diversity of textual expressions and the uniqueness of downstream training data, the existing fusion module, which extracts multimodal content from a visual-linguistic context, has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we present a simple yet robust transformer-based framework, SimVG, for visual grounding. Specifically, we decouple visual-linguistic feature fusion from downstream tasks by leveraging existing multimodal pre-trained models and incorporating additional object tokens to facilitate deep integration of downstream and pre-training tasks. Furthermore, we design a dynamic weight-balance distillation method in the multi-branch synchronous learning process to enhance the representation capability of the simpler branch. This branch only consists of a lightweight MLP, which simplifies the structure and improves reasoning speed. Experiments on six widely used VG datasets, i.e., RefCOCO/+/g, ReferIt, Flickr30K, and GRefCOCO, demonstrate the superiority of SimVG. Finally, the proposed method not only achieves improvements in efficiency and convergence speed but also attains new state-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes CAMOT, a simple camera angle estimator for multi-object tracking to tackle two problems: 1) occlusion and 2) inaccurate distance estimation in the depth direction. Under the assumption that multiple objects are located on a flat plane in each video frame, CAMOT estimates the camera angle using object detection. In addition, it gives the depth of each object, enabling pseudo-3D MOT. We evaluated its performance by adding it to various 2D MOT methods on the MOT17 and MOT20 datasets and confirmed its effectiveness. Applying CAMOT to ByteTrack, we obtained 63.8% HOTA, 80.6% MOTA, and 78.5% IDF1 in MOT17, which are state-of-the-art results. Its computational cost is significantly lower than the existing deep-learning-based depth estimators for tracking.

- **Summary**: Existing 3D mask learning methods encounter performance bottlenecks under limited data, and our objective is to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we introduce a triple point masking scheme, named TPM, which serves as a scalable framework for pre-training of masked autoencoders to achieve multi-mask learning for 3D point clouds. Specifically, we augment the baselines with two additional mask choices (i.e., medium mask and low mask) as our core insight is that the recovery process of an object can manifest in diverse ways. Previous high-masking schemes focus on capturing the global representation but lack the fine-grained recovery capability, so that the generated pre-trained weights tend to play a limited role in the fine-tuning process. With the support of the proposed TPM, available methods can exhibit more flexible and accurate completion capabilities, enabling the potential autoencoder in the pre-training stage to consider multiple representations of a single 3D object. In addition, an SVM-guided weight selection module is proposed to fill the encoder parameters for downstream networks with the optimal weight during the fine-tuning stage, maximizing linear accuracy and facilitating the acquisition of intricate representations for new objects. Extensive experiments show that the four baselines equipped with the proposed TPM achieve comprehensive performance improvements on various downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: In Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG), the model is exposed to both new variations of data appearance (domains) and open-set conditions, where both known and novel categories are present at test time. The challenges of this task arise from the dual need to generalize across diverse domains and accurately quantify category novelty, which is critical for applications in dynamic environments. Recently, meta-learning techniques have demonstrated superior results in OSDG, effectively orchestrating the meta-train and -test tasks by employing varied random categories and predefined domain partition strategies. These approaches prioritize a well-designed training schedule over traditional methods that focus primarily on data augmentation and the enhancement of discriminative feature learning. The prevailing meta-learning models in OSDG typically utilize a predefined sequential domain scheduler to structure data partitions. However, a crucial aspect that remains inadequately explored is the influence brought by strategies of domain schedulers during training. In this paper, we observe that an adaptive domain scheduler benefits more in OSDG compared with prefixed sequential and random domain schedulers. We propose the Evidential Bi-Level Hardest Domain Scheduler (EBiL-HaDS) to achieve an adaptive domain scheduler. This method strategically sequences domains by assessing their reliabilities in utilizing a follower network, trained with confidence scores learned in an evidential manner, regularized by max rebiasing discrepancy, and optimized in a bi-level manner. The results show that our method substantially improves OSDG performance and achieves more discriminative embeddings for both the seen and unseen categories.

- **Summary**: Event-based bionic camera asynchronously captures dynamic scenes with high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, offering potential for the integration of events and RGB under conditions of illumination degradation and fast motion. Existing RGB-E tracking methods model event characteristics utilising attention mechanism of Transformer before integrating both modalities. Nevertheless, these methods involve aggregating the event stream into a single event frame, lacking the utilisation of the temporal information inherent in the event stream.Moreover, the traditional attention mechanism is well-suited for dense semantic features, while the attention mechanism for sparse event features require revolution. In this paper, we propose a dynamic event subframe splitting strategy to split the event stream into more fine-grained event clusters, aiming to capture spatio-temporal features that contain motion cues. Based on this, we design an event-based sparse attention mechanism to enhance the interaction of event features in temporal and spatial dimensions. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the FE240 and COESOT datasets, providing an effective processing manner for the event data.

- **Summary**: Transformer-based trackers have established a dominant role in the field of visual object tracking. While these trackers exhibit promising performance, their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to inefficiencies. To improve the inference efficiency and reduce the computation cost, prior approaches have aimed to either design lightweight trackers or distill knowledge from larger teacher models into more compact student trackers. However, these solutions often sacrifice accuracy for speed. Thus, we propose a general model compression framework for efficient transformer object tracking, named CompressTracker, to reduce the size of a pre-trained tracking model into a lightweight tracker with minimal performance degradation. Our approach features a novel stage division strategy that segments the transformer layers of the teacher model into distinct stages, enabling the student model to emulate each corresponding teacher stage more effectively. Additionally, we also design a unique replacement training technique that involves randomly substituting specific stages in the student model with those from the teacher model, as opposed to training the student model in isolation. Replacement training enhances the student model's ability to replicate the teacher model's behavior. To further forcing student model to emulate teacher model, we incorporate prediction guidance and stage-wise feature mimicking to provide additional supervision during the teacher model's compression process. Our framework CompressTracker is structurally agnostic, making it compatible with any transformer architecture. We conduct a series of experiment to verify the effectiveness and generalizability of CompressTracker. Our CompressTracker-4 with 4 transformer layers, which is compressed from OSTrack, retains about 96% performance on LaSOT (66.1% AUC) while achieves 2.17x speed up.

- **Summary**: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have made significant advancements in the field of image generation in recent years. One major advantage of LDMs is their ability to operate in a compressed latent space, allowing for more efficient training and deployment. However, despite these advantages, challenges with LDMs still remain. For example, it has been observed that LDMs often generate high-frequency details and complex compositions imperfectly. We hypothesize that one reason for these flaws is due to the fact that all pre- and post-training of LDMs are done in latent space, which is typically $8 \times 8$ lower spatial-resolution than the output images. To address this issue, we propose adding pixel-space supervision in the post-training process to better preserve high-frequency details. Experimentally, we show that adding a pixel-space objective significantly improves both supervised quality fine-tuning and preference-based post-training by a large margin on a state-of-the-art DiT transformer and U-Net diffusion models in both visual quality and visual flaw metrics, while maintaining the same text alignment quality.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models are cutting-edge generative models adept at producing diverse, high-quality images. Despite their effectiveness, these models often require significant computational resources owing to their numerous sequential denoising steps and the significant inference cost of each step. Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques have been employed to automatically search for faster generation processes. However, NAS for diffusion is inherently time-consuming as it requires estimating thousands of diffusion models to search for the optimal one. In this paper, we introduce Flexiffusion, a novel training-free NAS paradigm designed to accelerate diffusion models by concurrently optimizing generation steps and network structures. Specifically, we partition the generation process into isometric step segments, each sequentially composed of a full step, multiple partial steps, and several null steps. The full step computes all network blocks, while the partial step involves part of the blocks, and the null step entails no computation. Flexiffusion autonomously explores flexible step combinations for each segment, substantially reducing search costs and enabling greater acceleration compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method for diffusion models. Our searched models reported speedup factors of $2.6\times$ and $1.5\times$ for the original LDM-4-G and the SOTA, respectively. The factors for Stable Diffusion V1.5 and the SOTA are $5.1\times$ and $2.0\times$. We also verified the performance of Flexiffusion on multiple datasets, and positive experiment results indicate that Flexiffusion can effectively reduce redundancy in diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Synthetic face recognition (SFR) aims to generate synthetic face datasets that mimic the distribution of real face data, which allows for training face recognition models in a privacy-preserving manner. Despite the remarkable potential of diffusion models in image generation, current diffusion-based SFR models struggle with generalization to real-world faces. To address this limitation, we outline three key objectives for SFR: (1) promoting diversity across identities (inter-class diversity), (2) ensuring diversity within each identity by injecting various facial attributes (intra-class diversity), and (3) maintaining identity consistency within each identity group (intra-class identity preservation). Inspired by these goals, we introduce a diffusion-fueled SFR model termed $\text{ID}^3$. $\text{ID}^3$ employs an ID-preserving loss to generate diverse yet identity-consistent facial appearances. Theoretically, we show that minimizing this loss is equivalent to maximizing the lower bound of an adjusted conditional log-likelihood over ID-preserving data. This equivalence motivates an ID-preserving sampling algorithm, which operates over an adjusted gradient vector field, enabling the generation of fake face recognition datasets that approximate the distribution of real-world faces. Extensive experiments across five challenging benchmarks validate the advantages of $\text{ID}^3$.

- **Summary**: Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its multiplier effect and wide applications in multiple areas, could potentially be an important application of quantum computing. Since modern AI systems are often built on neural networks, the design of quantum neural networks becomes a key challenge in integrating quantum computing into AI. To provide a more fine-grained characterisation of the impact of quantum components on the performance of neural networks, we propose a framework where classical neural network layers are gradually replaced by quantum layers that have the same type of input and output while keeping the flow of information between layers unchanged, different from most current research in quantum neural network, which favours an end-to-end quantum model. We start with a simple three-layer classical neural network without any normalisation layers or activation functions, and gradually change the classical layers to the corresponding quantum versions. We conduct numerical experiments on image classification datasets such as the MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets to demonstrate the change of performance brought by the systematic introduction of quantum components. Through this framework, our research sheds new light on the design of future quantum neural network models where it could be more favourable to search for methods and frameworks that harness the advantages from both the classical and quantum worlds.

- **Summary**: Adversarial training has achieved remarkable advancements in defending against adversarial attacks. Among them, fast adversarial training (FAT) is gaining attention for its ability to achieve competitive robustness with fewer computing resources. Existing FAT methods typically employ a uniform strategy that optimizes all training data equally without considering the influence of different examples, which leads to an imbalanced optimization. However, this imbalance remains unexplored in the field of FAT. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of the imbalance issue in FAT and observe an obvious class disparity regarding their performances. This disparity could be embodied from a perspective of alignment between clean and robust accuracy. Based on the analysis, we mainly attribute the observed misalignment and disparity to the imbalanced optimization in FAT, which motivates us to optimize different training data adaptively to enhance robustness. Specifically, we take disparity and misalignment into consideration. First, we introduce self-knowledge guided regularization, which assigns differentiated regularization weights to each class based on its training state, alleviating class disparity. Additionally, we propose self-knowledge guided label relaxation, which adjusts label relaxation according to the training accuracy, alleviating the misalignment and improving robustness. By combining these methods, we formulate the Self-Knowledge Guided FAT (SKG-FAT), leveraging naturally generated knowledge during training to enhance the adversarial robustness without compromising training efficiency. Extensive experiments on four standard datasets demonstrate that the SKG-FAT improves the robustness and preserves competitive clean accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Window-based transformers have demonstrated outstanding performance in super-resolution tasks due to their adaptive modeling capabilities through local self-attention (SA). However, they exhibit higher computational complexity and inference latency than convolutional neural networks. In this paper, we first identify that the adaptability of the Transformers is derived from their adaptive spatial aggregation and advanced structural design, while their high latency results from the computational costs and memory layout transformations associated with the local SA. To simulate this aggregation approach, we propose an effective convolution-based linear focal separable attention (FSA), allowing for long-range dynamic modeling with linear complexity. Additionally, we introduce an effective dual-branch structure combined with an ultra-lightweight information exchange module (IEM) to enhance the aggregation of information by the Token Mixer. Finally, with respect to the structure, we modify the existing spatial-gate-based feedforward neural networks by incorporating a self-gate mechanism to preserve high-dimensional channel information, enabling the modeling of more complex relationships. With these advancements, we construct a convolution-based Transformer framework named the linear adaptive mixer network (LAMNet). Extensive experiments demonstrate that LAMNet achieves better performance than existing SA-based Transformer methods while maintaining the computational efficiency of convolutional neural networks, which can achieve a \(3\times\) speedup of inference time. The code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/zononhzy/LAMNet.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained large models for multimodal contrastive learning, such as CLIP, have been widely recognized in the industry as highly susceptible to data-poisoned backdoor attacks. This poses significant risks to downstream model training. In response to such potential threats, finetuning offers a simpler and more efficient defense choice compared to retraining large models with augmented data. In the supervised learning domain, fine-tuning defense strategies can achieve excellent defense performance. However, in the unsupervised and semi-supervised domain, we find that when CLIP faces some complex attack techniques, the existing fine-tuning defense strategy, CleanCLIP, has some limitations on defense performance. The synonym substitution of its text-augmentation is insufficient to enhance the text feature space. To compensate for this weakness, we improve it by proposing a fine-grained \textbf{T}ext \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{C}leaner (TA-Cleaner) to cut off feature connections of backdoor triggers. We randomly select a few samples for positive and negative subtext generation at each epoch of CleanCLIP, and align the subtexts to the images to strengthen the text self-supervision. We evaluate the effectiveness of our TA-Cleaner against six attack algorithms and conduct comprehensive zero-shot classification tests on ImageNet1K. Our experimental results demonstrate that TA-Cleaner achieves state-of-the-art defensiveness among finetuning-based defense techniques. Even when faced with the novel attack technique BadCLIP, our TA-Cleaner outperforms CleanCLIP by reducing the ASR of Top-1 and Top-10 by 52.02\% and 63.88\%, respectively.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the limitations of traditional teacher-student models, imitation learning, and behaviour cloning in the context of Autonomous/Automated Driving Systems (ADS), where these methods often struggle with incomplete coverage of real-world scenarios. To enhance the robustness of such models, we introduce the use of Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) as a novel data augmentation technique for end-to-end ADS. CFEs, by generating training samples near decision boundaries through minimal input modifications, lead to a more comprehensive representation of expert driver strategies, particularly in safety-critical scenarios. This approach can therefore help improve the model's ability to handle rare and challenging driving events, such as anticipating darting out pedestrians, ultimately leading to safer and more trustworthy decision-making for ADS. Our experiments in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that CF-Driver outperforms the current state-of-the-art method, achieving a higher driving score and lower infraction rates. Specifically, CF-Driver attains a driving score of 84.2, surpassing the previous best model by 15.02 percentage points. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating CFEs in training end-to-end ADS. To foster further research, the CF-Driver code is made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Video anomaly detection (VAD) often learns the distribution of normal samples and detects the anomaly through measuring significant deviations, but the undesired generalization may reconstruct a few anomalies thus suppressing the deviations. Meanwhile, most VADs cannot cope with cross-dataset validation for new target domains, and few-shot methods must laboriously rely on model-tuning from the target domain to complete domain adaptation. To address these problems, we propose a novel VAD method with a motion-guided memory module to achieve cross-dataset validation with zero-shot. First, we add Gaussian blur to the raw appearance images, thereby constructing the global pseudo-anomaly, which serves as the input to the network. Then, we propose multi-scale residual channel attention to deblur the pseudo-anomaly in normal samples. Next, memory items are obtained by recording the motion features in the training phase, which are used to retrieve the motion features from the raw information in the testing phase. Lastly, our method can ignore the blurred real anomaly through attention and rely on motion memory items to increase the normality gap between normal and abnormal motion. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with cross-domain methods, our method achieves competitive performance without adaptation during testing.

- **Summary**: The rocketing prosperity of large language models (LLMs) in recent years has boosted the prevalence of vision-language models (VLMs) in the medical sector. In our online medical consultation scenario, a doctor responds to the texts and images provided by a patient in multiple rounds to diagnose her/his health condition, forming a multi-turn multimodal medical dialogue format. Unlike high-quality images captured by professional equipment in traditional medical visual question answering (Med-VQA), the images in our case are taken by patients' mobile phones. These images have poor quality control, with issues such as excessive background elements and the lesion area being significantly off-center, leading to degradation of vision-language alignment in the model training phase. In this paper, we propose ZALM3, a Zero-shot strategy to improve vision-language ALignment in Multi-turn Multimodal Medical dialogue. Since we observe that the preceding text conversations before an image can infer the regions of interest (RoIs) in the image, ZALM3 employs an LLM to summarize the keywords from the preceding context and a visual grounding model to extract the RoIs. The updated images eliminate unnecessary background noise and provide more effective vision-language alignment. To better evaluate our proposed method, we design a new subjective assessment metric for multi-turn unimodal/multimodal medical dialogue to provide a fine-grained performance comparison. Our experiments across three different clinical departments remarkably demonstrate the efficacy of ZALM3 with statistical significance.

- **Summary**: The sharp increase in data-related expenses has motivated research into condensing datasets while retaining the most informative features. Dataset distillation has thus recently come to the fore. This paradigm generates synthetic dataset that are representative enough to replace the original dataset in training a neural network. To avoid redundancy in these synthetic datasets, it is crucial that each element contains unique features and remains diverse from others during the synthesis stage. In this paper, we provide a thorough theoretical and empirical analysis of diversity within synthesized datasets. We argue that enhancing diversity can improve the parallelizable yet isolated synthesizing approach. Specifically, we introduce a novel method that employs dynamic and directed weight adjustment techniques to modulate the synthesis process, thereby maximizing the representativeness and diversity of each synthetic instance. Our method ensures that each batch of synthetic data mirrors the characteristics of a large, varying subset of the original dataset. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, including CIFAR, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting its effectiveness in producing diverse and representative synthetic datasets with minimal computational expense.

- **Summary**: Estimating the poses of both a hand and an object has become an important area of research due to the growing need for advanced vision computing. The primary challenge involves understanding and reconstructing how hands and objects interact, such as contact and physical plausibility. Existing approaches often adopt a graph neural network to incorporate spatial information of hand and object meshes. However, these approaches have not fully exploited the potential of graphs without modification of edges within and between hand- and object-graphs. We propose a graph-based refinement method that incorporates an interaction-aware graph-attention mechanism to account for hand-object interactions. Using edges, we establish connections among closely correlated nodes, both within individual graphs and across different graphs. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method with notable improvements in the realm of physical plausibility.

- **Summary**: Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained prominence in various visual and multimodal tasks, yet the deployment of VLMs on downstream application platforms remains challenging due to their prohibitive requirements of training samples and computing resources. Fine-tuning and quantization of VLMs can substantially reduce the sample and computation costs, which are in urgent need. There are two prevailing paradigms in quantization, Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) can effectively quantize large-scale VLMs but incur a huge training cost, while low-bit Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) suffers from a notable performance drop. We propose a method that balances fine-tuning and quantization named ``Prompt for Quantization'' (P4Q), in which we design a lightweight architecture to leverage contrastive loss supervision to enhance the recognition performance of a PTQ model. Our method can effectively reduce the gap between image features and text features caused by low-bit quantization, based on learnable prompts to reorganize textual representations and a low-bit adapter to realign the distributions of image and text features. We also introduce a distillation loss based on cosine similarity predictions to distill the quantized model using a full-precision teacher. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our P4Q method outperforms prior arts, even achieving comparable results to its full-precision counterparts. For instance, our 8-bit P4Q can theoretically compress the CLIP-ViT/B-32 by 4 $\times$ while achieving 66.94\% Top-1 accuracy, outperforming the learnable prompt fine-tuned full-precision model by 2.24\% with negligible additional parameters on the ImageNet dataset.

- **Summary**: Video causal reasoning aims to achieve a high-level understanding of video content from a causal perspective. However, current video reasoning tasks are limited in scope, primarily executed in a question-answering paradigm and focusing on short videos containing only a single event and simple causal relationships, lacking comprehensive and structured causality analysis for videos with multiple events. To fill this gap, we introduce a new task and dataset, Multi-Event Causal Discovery (MECD). It aims to uncover the causal relationships between events distributed chronologically across long videos. Given visual segments and textual descriptions of events, MECD requires identifying the causal associations between these events to derive a comprehensive, structured event-level video causal diagram explaining why and how the final result event occurred. To address MECD, we devise a novel framework inspired by the Granger Causality method, using an efficient mask-based event prediction model to perform an Event Granger Test, which estimates causality by comparing the predicted result event when premise events are masked versus unmasked. Furthermore, we integrate causal inference techniques such as front-door adjustment and counterfactual inference to address challenges in MECD like causality confounding and illusory causality. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework in providing causal relationships in multi-event videos, outperforming GPT-4o and VideoLLaVA by 5.7% and 4.1%, respectively.

- **Summary**: Copy Detection Patterns (CDPs) are crucial elements in modern security applications, playing a vital role in safeguarding industries such as food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. Current performance evaluations of CDPs predominantly rely on empirical setups using simplistic metrics like Hamming distances or Pearson correlation. These methods are often inadequate due to their sensitivity to distortions, degradation, and their limitations to stationary statistics of printing and imaging. Additionally, machine learning-based approaches suffer from distribution biases and fail to generalize to unseen counterfeit samples. Given the critical importance of CDPs in preventing counterfeiting, including the counterfeit vaccines issue highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need for provable performance guarantees across various criteria. This paper aims to establish a theoretical framework to derive optimal criteria for the analysis, optimization, and future development of CDP authentication technologies, ensuring their reliability and effectiveness in diverse security scenarios.

- **Summary**: Recent concept-based interpretable models have succeeded in providing meaningful explanations by pre-defined concept sets. However, the dependency on the pre-defined concepts restricts the application because of the limited number of concepts for explanations. This paper proposes a novel interpretable deep neural network called explanation bottleneck models (XBMs). XBMs generate a text explanation from the input without pre-defined concepts and then predict a final task prediction based on the generated explanation by leveraging pre-trained vision-language encoder-decoder models. To achieve both the target task performance and the explanation quality, we train XBMs through the target task loss with the regularization penalizing the explanation decoder via the distillation from the frozen pre-trained decoder. Our experiments, including a comparison to state-of-the-art concept bottleneck models, confirm that XBMs provide accurate and fluent natural language explanations without pre-defined concept sets.

- **Summary**: The basic body shape of a person does not change within a single video. However, most SOTA human mesh estimation (HME) models output a slightly different body shape for each video frame, which results in inconsistent body shapes for the same person. In contrast, we leverage anthropometric measurements like tailors are already obtaining from humans for centuries. We create a model called A2B that converts such anthropometric measurements to body shape parameters of human mesh models. Moreover, we find that finetuned SOTA 3D human pose estimation (HPE) models outperform HME models regarding the precision of the estimated keypoints. We show that applying inverse kinematics (IK) to the results of such a 3D HPE model and combining the resulting body pose with the A2B body shape leads to superior and consistent human meshes for challenging datasets like ASPset or fit3D, where we can lower the MPJPE by over 30 mm compared to SOTA HME models. Further, replacing HME models estimates of the body shape parameters with A2B model results not only increases the performance of these HME models, but also leads to consistent body shapes.

- **Summary**: Gestures are pivotal in enhancing co-speech communication. While recent works have mostly focused on point-level motion transformation or fully supervised motion representations through data-driven approaches, we explore the representation of gestures in co-speech, with a focus on self-supervised representation and pixel-level motion deviation, utilizing a diffusion model which incorporates latent motion features. Our approach leverages self-supervised deviation in latent representation to facilitate hand gestures generation, which are crucial for generating realistic gesture videos. Results of our first experiment demonstrate that our method enhances the quality of generated videos, with an improvement from 2.7 to 4.5% for FGD, DIV, and FVD, and 8.1% for PSNR, 2.5% for SSIM over the current state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks have primarily led 3D medical image segmentation but may be limited by small receptive fields. Transformer models excel in capturing global relationships through self-attention but are challenged by high computational costs at high resolutions. Recently, Mamba, a state space model, has emerged as an effective approach for sequential modeling. Inspired by its success, we introduce a novel Mamba-based 3D medical image segmentation model called EM-Net. It not only efficiently captures attentive interaction between regions by integrating and selecting channels, but also effectively utilizes frequency domain to harmonize the learning of features across varying scales, while accelerating training speed. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging multi-organ datasets with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms show that our method exhibits better segmentation accuracy while requiring nearly half the parameter size of SOTA models and 2x faster training speed.

- **Summary**: Stereopsis has widespread appeal in robotics as it is the predominant way by which living beings perceive depth to navigate our 3D world. Event cameras are novel bio-inspired sensors that detect per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously, with very high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, enabling machine perception in high-speed motion and broad illumination conditions. The high temporal precision also benefits stereo matching, making disparity (depth) estimation a popular research area for event cameras ever since its inception. Over the last 30 years, the field has evolved rapidly, from low-latency, low-power circuit design to current deep learning (DL) approaches driven by the computer vision community. The bibliography is vast and difficult to navigate for non-experts due its highly interdisciplinary nature. Past surveys have addressed distinct aspects of this topic, in the context of applications, or focusing only on a specific class of techniques, but have overlooked stereo datasets. This survey provides a comprehensive overview, covering both instantaneous stereo and long-term methods suitable for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), along with theoretical and empirical comparisons. It is the first to extensively review DL methods as well as stereo datasets, even providing practical suggestions for creating new benchmarks to advance the field. The main advantages and challenges faced by event-based stereo depth estimation are also discussed. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in achieving optimal performance in not only accuracy but also efficiency, a cornerstone of event-based computing. We identify several gaps and propose future research directions. We hope this survey inspires future research in this area, by serving as an accessible entry point for newcomers, as well as a practical guide for seasoned researchers in the community.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models have been demonstrated with unsafe generation due to unfiltered large-scale training data, such as violent, sexual, and shocking images, necessitating the erasure of unsafe concepts. Most existing methods focus on modifying the generation probabilities conditioned on the texts containing unsafe descriptions. However, they fail to guarantee safe generation for unseen texts in the training phase, especially for the prompts from adversarial attacks. In this paper, we re-analyze the erasure task and point out that existing methods cannot guarantee the minimization of the total probabilities of unsafe generation. To tackle this problem, we propose Dark Miner. It entails a recurring three-stage process that comprises mining, verifying, and circumventing. It greedily mines embeddings with maximum generation probabilities of unsafe concepts and reduces unsafe generation more effectively. In the experiments, we evaluate its performance on two inappropriate concepts, two objects, and two styles. Compared with 6 previous state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves better erasure and defense results in most cases, especially under 4 state-of-the-art attacks, while preserving the model's native generation capability. Our code will be available on GitHub.

- **Summary**: Motion generation from discrete quantization offers many advantages over continuous regression, but at the cost of inevitable approximation errors. Previous methods usually quantize the entire body pose into one code, which not only faces the difficulty in encoding all joints within one vector but also loses the spatial relationship between different joints. Differently, in this work we quantize each individual joint into one vector, which i) simplifies the quantization process as the complexity associated with a single joint is markedly lower than that of the entire pose; ii) maintains a spatial-temporal structure that preserves both the spatial relationships among joints and the temporal movement patterns; iii) yields a 2D token map, which enables the application of various 2D operations widely used in 2D images. Grounded in the 2D motion quantization, we build a spatial-temporal modeling framework, where 2D joint VQVAE, temporal-spatial 2D masking technique, and spatial-temporal 2D attention are proposed to take advantage of spatial-temporal signals among the 2D tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous methods across different datasets, with a $26.6\%$ decrease of FID on HumanML3D and a $29.9\%$ decrease on KIT-ML.

It introduces a novel framework that leverages distribution matching and label co-annotation to address tasks with non-overlapping annotations, encoding prior knowledge of their relatedness. In the largest study of its kind, Behavior4All outperforms both state-of-the-art and toolkits in overall performance as well as fairness across all databases and tasks. It also demonstrates superior generalizability on unseen databases and on compound expression recognition. Finally, Behavior4All is way times faster than other toolkits.

- **Summary**: With robots increasingly collaborating with humans in everyday tasks, it is important to take steps toward robotic systems capable of understanding the environment. This work focuses on scene understanding to detect pick and place tasks given initial and final images from the scene. To this end, a dataset is collected for object detection and pick and place task detection. A YOLOv5 network is subsequently trained to detect the objects in the initial and final scenes. Given the detected objects and their bounding boxes, two methods are proposed to detect the pick and place tasks which transform the initial scene into the final scene. A geometric method is proposed which tracks objects' movements in the two scenes and works based on the intersection of the bounding boxes which moved within scenes. Contrarily, the CNN-based method utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network to classify objects with intersected bounding boxes into 5 classes, showing the spatial relationship between the involved objects. The performed pick and place tasks are then derived from analyzing the experiments with both scenes. Results show that the CNN-based method, using a VGG16 backbone, outscores the geometric method by roughly 12 percentage points in certain scenarios, with an overall success rate of 84.3%.

- **Summary**: Vision language models have played a key role in extracting meaningful features for various robotic applications. Among these, Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is widely used in robotic tasks that require both vision and natural language understanding. However, CLIP was trained solely on static images paired with text prompts and has not yet been fully adapted for robotic tasks involving dynamic actions. In this paper, we introduce Robotic-CLIP to enhance robotic perception capabilities. We first gather and label large-scale action data, and then build our Robotic-CLIP by fine-tuning CLIP on 309,433 videos (~7.4 million frames) of action data using contrastive learning. By leveraging action data, Robotic-CLIP inherits CLIP's strong image performance while gaining the ability to understand actions in robotic contexts. Intensive experiments show that our Robotic-CLIP outperforms other CLIP-based models across various language-driven robotic tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of Robotic-CLIP in real-world grasping applications.

- **Summary**: Camera-LiDAR fusion models significantly enhance perception performance in autonomous driving. The fusion mechanism leverages the strengths of each modality while minimizing their weaknesses. Moreover, in practice, camera-LiDAR fusion models utilize pre-trained backbones for efficient training. However, we argue that directly loading single-modal pre-trained camera and LiDAR backbones into camera-LiDAR fusion models introduces similar feature redundancy across modalities due to the nature of the fusion mechanism. Unfortunately, existing pruning methods are developed explicitly for single-modal models, and thus, they struggle to effectively identify these specific redundant parameters in camera-LiDAR fusion models. In this paper, to address the issue above on camera-LiDAR fusion models, we propose a novelty pruning framework Alternative Modality Masking Pruning (AlterMOMA), which employs alternative masking on each modality and identifies the redundant parameters. Specifically, when one modality parameters are masked (deactivated), the absence of features from the masked backbone compels the model to reactivate previous redundant features of the other modality backbone. Therefore, these redundant features and relevant redundant parameters can be identified via the reactivation process. The redundant parameters can be pruned by our proposed importance score evaluation function, Alternative Evaluation (AlterEva), which is based on the observation of the loss changes when certain modality parameters are activated and deactivated. Extensive experiments on the nuScene and KITTI datasets encompassing diverse tasks, baseline models, and pruning algorithms showcase that AlterMOMA outperforms existing pruning methods, attaining state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) have increasingly highlighted the robustness of LiDAR-based techniques. At the same time, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have introduced new possibilities for 3D scene reconstruction, exemplified by SLAM systems. Among these, NeRF-LOAM has shown notable performance in NeRF-based SLAM applications. However, despite its strengths, these systems often encounter difficulties in dynamic outdoor environments due to their inherent static assumptions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel method designed to improve reconstruction in highly dynamic outdoor scenes. Based on NeRF-LOAM, the proposed approach consists of two primary components. First, we separate the scene into static background and dynamic foreground. By identifying and excluding dynamic elements from the mapping process, this segmentation enables the creation of a dense 3D map that accurately represents the static background only. The second component extends the octree structure to support multi-resolution representation. This extension not only enhances reconstruction quality but also aids in the removal of dynamic objects identified by the first module. Additionally, Fourier feature encoding is applied to the sampled points, capturing high-frequency information and leading to more complete reconstruction results. Evaluations on various datasets demonstrate that our method achieves more competitive results compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have made compelling progress on facilitating high-throughput daily production. Nevertheless, the appealing customized requirements are remain suffered from instance-level finetuning for authentic fidelity. Prior zero-shot customization works achieve the semantic consistence through the condensed injection of identity features, while addressing detailed low-level signatures through complex model configurations and subject-specific fabrications, which significantly break the statistical coherence within the overall system and limit the applicability across various scenarios. To facilitate the generic signature concentration with rectified efficiency, we present \textbf{AnyLogo}, a zero-shot region customizer with remarkable detail consistency, building upon the symbiotic diffusion system with eliminated cumbersome designs. Streamlined as vanilla image generation, we discern that the rigorous signature extraction and creative content generation are promisingly compatible and can be systematically recycled within a single denoising model. In place of the external configurations, the gemini status of the denoising model promote the reinforced subject transmission efficiency and disentangled semantic-signature space with continuous signature decoration. Moreover, the sparse recycling paradigm is adopted to prevent the duplicated risk with compressed transmission quota for diversified signature stimulation. Extensive experiments on constructed logo-level benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of our methods.

- **Summary**: Scene text recognition in low-resource languages frequently faces challenges due to the limited availability of training datasets derived from real-world scenes. This study proposes a novel approach that generates text images in low-resource languages by emulating the style of real text images from high-resource languages. Our approach utilizes a diffusion model that is conditioned on binary states: ``synthetic'' and ``real.'' The training of this model involves dual translation tasks, where it transforms plain text images into either synthetic or real text images, based on the binary states. This approach not only effectively differentiates between the two domains but also facilitates the model's explicit recognition of characters in the target language. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and variety of generated text images, we introduce two guidance techniques: Fidelity-Diversity Balancing Guidance and Fidelity Enhancement Guidance. Our experimental results demonstrate that the text images generated by our proposed framework can significantly improve the performance of scene text recognition models for low-resource languages.

- **Summary**: Capturing different intensity and directions of light rays at the same scene Light field (LF) can encode the 3D scene cues into a 4D LF image which has a wide range of applications (i.e. post-capture refocusing and depth sensing). LF image super-resolution (SR) aims to improve the image resolution limited by the performance of LF camera sensor. Although existing methods have achieved promising results the practical application of these models is limited because they are not lightweight enough. In this paper we propose a lightweight model named LGFN which integrates the local and global features of different views and the features of different channels for LF image SR. Specifically owing to neighboring regions of the same pixel position in different sub-aperture images exhibit similar structural relationships we design a lightweight CNN-based feature extraction module (namely DGCE) to extract local features better through feature modulation. Meanwhile as the position beyond the boundaries in the LF image presents a large disparity we propose an efficient spatial attention module (namely ESAM) which uses decomposable large-kernel convolution to obtain an enlarged receptive field and an efficient channel attention module (namely ECAM). Compared with the existing LF image SR models with large parameter our model has a parameter of 0.45M and a FLOPs of 19.33G which has achieved a competitive effect. Extensive experiments with ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method which ranked the second place in the Track 2 Fidelity & Efficiency of NTIRE2024 Light Field Super Resolution Challenge and the seventh place in the Track 1 Fidelity.

- **Summary**: Medical imaging is spearheading the AI transformation of healthcare. Performance reporting is key to determine which methods should be translated into clinical practice. Frequently, broad conclusions are simply derived from mean performance values. In this paper, we argue that this common practice is often a misleading simplification as it ignores performance variability. Our contribution is threefold. (1) Analyzing all MICCAI segmentation papers (n = 221) published in 2023, we first observe that more than 50\% of papers do not assess performance variability at all. Moreover, only one (0.5\%) paper reported confidence intervals (CIs) for model performance. (2) To address the reporting bottleneck, we show that the unreported standard deviation (SD) in segmentation papers can be approximated by a second-order polynomial function of the mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Based on external validation data from 56 previous MICCAI challenges, we demonstrate that this approximation can accurately reconstruct the CI of a method using information provided in publications. (3) Finally, we reconstructed 95\% CIs around the mean DSC of MICCAI 2023 segmentation papers. The median CI width was 0.03 which is three times larger than the median performance gap between the first and second ranked method. For more than 60\% of papers, the mean performance of the second-ranked method was within the CI of the first-ranked method. We conclude that current publications typically do not provide sufficient evidence to support which models could potentially be translated into clinical practice.

- **Summary**: Background: The integration of multi-stain histopathology images through deep learning poses a significant challenge in digital histopathology. Current multi-modal approaches struggle with data heterogeneity and missing data. This study aims to overcome these limitations by developing a novel transformer model for multi-stain integration that can handle missing data during training as well as inference. Methods: We propose UNICORN (UNiversal modality Integration Network for CORonary classificatioN) a multi-modal transformer capable of processing multi-stain histopathology for atherosclerosis severity class prediction. The architecture comprises a two-stage, end-to-end trainable model with specialized modules utilizing transformer self-attention blocks. The initial stage employs domain-specific expert modules to extract features from each modality. In the subsequent stage, an aggregation expert module integrates these features by learning the interactions between the different data modalities. Results: Evaluation was performed using a multi-class dataset of atherosclerotic lesions from the Munich Cardiovascular Studies Biobank (MISSION), using over 4,000 paired multi-stain whole slide images (WSIs) from 170 deceased individuals on 7 prespecified segments of the coronary tree, each stained according to four histopathological protocols. UNICORN achieved a classification accuracy of 0.67, outperforming other state-of-the-art models. The model effectively identifies relevant tissue phenotypes across stainings and implicitly models disease progression. Conclusion: Our proposed multi-modal transformer model addresses key challenges in medical data analysis, including data heterogeneity and missing modalities. Explainability and the model's effectiveness in predicting atherosclerosis progression underscores its potential for broader applications in medical research.

- **Summary**: Deep multimodal learning has shown remarkable success by leveraging contrastive learning to capture explicit one-to-one relations across modalities. However, real-world data often exhibits shared relations beyond simple pairwise associations. We propose M3CoL, a Multimodal Mixup Contrastive Learning approach to capture nuanced shared relations inherent in multimodal data. Our key contribution is a Mixup-based contrastive loss that learns robust representations by aligning mixed samples from one modality with their corresponding samples from other modalities thereby capturing shared relations between them. For multimodal classification tasks, we introduce a framework that integrates a fusion module with unimodal prediction modules for auxiliary supervision during training, complemented by our proposed Mixup-based contrastive loss. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets (N24News, ROSMAP, BRCA, and Food-101), we demonstrate that M3CoL effectively captures shared multimodal relations and generalizes across domains. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on N24News, ROSMAP, and BRCA, while achieving comparable performance on Food-101. Our work highlights the significance of learning shared relations for robust multimodal learning, opening up promising avenues for future research.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) models have attracted substantial interest due to their powerful image restoration capabilities. However, prevailing diffusion models often struggle to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Typically, they either neglect to exploit the potential of existing extensive pretrained models, limiting their generative capacity, or they necessitate a dozens of forward passes starting from random noises, compromising inference efficiency. In this paper, we present DoSSR, a Domain Shift diffusion-based SR model that capitalizes on the generative powers of pretrained diffusion models while significantly enhancing efficiency by initiating the diffusion process with low-resolution (LR) images. At the core of our approach is a domain shift equation that integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion models. This integration not only improves the use of diffusion prior but also boosts inference efficiency. Moreover, we advance our method by transitioning the discrete shift process to a continuous formulation, termed as DoS-SDEs. This advancement leads to the fast and customized solvers that further enhance sampling efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, while notably requiring only 5 sampling steps. Compared to previous diffusion prior based methods, our approach achieves a remarkable speedup of 5-7 times, demonstrating its superior efficiency. Code: https://github.com/QinpengCui/DoSSR.

- **Summary**: Motion prediction is an important aspect for Autonomous Driving (AD) and Advance Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Current state-of-the-art motion prediction methods rely on High Definition (HD) maps for capturing the surrounding context of the ego vehicle. Such systems lack scalability in real-world deployment as HD maps are expensive to produce and update in real-time. To overcome this issue, we propose Context Aware Scene Prediction Transformer (CASPFormer), which can perform multi-modal motion prediction from rasterized Bird-Eye-View (BEV) images. Our system can be integrated with any upstream perception module that is capable of generating BEV images. Moreover, CASPFormer directly decodes vectorized trajectories without any postprocessing. Trajectories are decoded recurrently using deformable attention, as it is computationally efficient and provides the network with the ability to focus its attention on the important spatial locations of the BEV images. In addition, we also address the issue of mode collapse for generating multiple scene-consistent trajectories by incorporating learnable mode queries. We evaluate our model on the nuScenes dataset and show that it reaches state-of-the-art across multiple metrics

- **Summary**: For single image defocus deblurring, acquiring well-aligned training pairs (or training triplets), i.e., a defocus blurry image, an all-in-focus sharp image (and a defocus blur map), is an intricate task for the development of deblurring models. Existing image defocus deblurring methods typically rely on training data collected by specialized imaging equipment, presupposing that these pairs or triplets are perfectly aligned. However, in practical scenarios involving the collection of real-world data, direct acquisition of training triplets is infeasible, and training pairs inevitably encounter spatial misalignment issues. In this work, we introduce a reblurring-guided learning framework for single image defocus deblurring, enabling the learning of a deblurring network even with misaligned training pairs. Specifically, we first propose a baseline defocus deblurring network that utilizes spatially varying defocus blur map as degradation prior to enhance the deblurring performance. Then, to effectively learn the baseline defocus deblurring network with misaligned training pairs, our reblurring module ensures spatial consistency between the deblurred image, the reblurred image and the input blurry image by reconstructing spatially variant isotropic blur kernels. Moreover, the spatially variant blur derived from the reblurring module can serve as pseudo supervision for defocus blur map during training, interestingly transforming training pairs into training triplets. Additionally, we have collected a new dataset specifically for single image defocus deblurring (SDD) with typical misalignments, which not only substantiates our proposed method but also serves as a benchmark for future research.

- **Summary**: Prompt learning has surfaced as an effective approach to enhance the performance of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP when applied to downstream tasks. However, current learnable prompt tokens are primarily used for the single phase of adapting to tasks (i.e., adapting prompt), easily leading to overfitting risks. In this work, we propose a novel Cascade Prompt Learning CasPL framework to enable prompt learning to serve both generic and specific expertise (i.e., boosting and adapting prompt) simultaneously. Specifically, CasPL is a new learning paradigm comprising two distinct phases of learnable prompts: the first boosting prompt is crafted to extract domain-general knowledge from a senior larger CLIP teacher model by aligning their predicted logits using extensive unlabeled domain images. The second adapting prompt is then cascaded with the frozen first set to fine-tune the downstream tasks, following the approaches employed in prior research. In this manner, CasPL can effectively capture both domain-general and task-specific representations into explicitly different gradual groups of prompts, thus potentially alleviating overfitting issues in the target domain. It's worth noting that CasPL serves as a plug-and-play module that can seamlessly integrate into any existing prompt learning approach. CasPL achieves a significantly better balance between performance and inference speed, which is especially beneficial for deploying smaller VLM models in resource-constrained environments. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art method PromptSRC, CasPL shows an average improvement of 1.85% for base classes, 3.44% for novel classes, and 2.72% for the harmonic mean over 11 image classification datasets.

- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation typically employs the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to constrain the student model's output to match the soft labels provided by the teacher model exactly. However, sometimes the optimization direction of the KL divergence loss is not always aligned with the task loss, where a smaller KL divergence could lead to erroneous predictions that diverge from the soft labels. This limitation often results in suboptimal optimization for the student. Moreover, even under temperature scaling, the KL divergence loss function tends to overly focus on the larger-valued channels in the logits, disregarding the rich inter-class information provided by the multitude of smaller-valued channels. This hard constraint proves too challenging for lightweight students, hindering further knowledge distillation. To address this issue, we propose a plug-and-play ranking loss based on Kendall's $\tau$ coefficient, called Rank-Kendall Knowledge Distillation (RKKD). RKKD balances the attention to smaller-valued channels by constraining the order of channel values in student logits, providing more inter-class relational information. The rank constraint on the top-valued channels helps avoid suboptimal traps during optimization. We also discuss different differentiable forms of Kendall's $\tau$ coefficient and demonstrate that the proposed ranking loss function shares a consistent optimization objective with the KL divergence. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets show that our RKKD can enhance the performance of various knowledge distillation baselines and offer broad improvements across multiple teacher-student architecture combinations.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised learning based multi-scale exposure fusion (ULMEF) is efficient for fusing differently exposed low dynamic range (LDR) images into a higher quality LDR image for a high dynamic range (HDR) scene. Unlike supervised learning, loss functions play a crucial role in the ULMEF. In this paper, novel loss functions are proposed for the ULMEF and they are defined by using all the images to be fused and other differently exposed images from the same HDR scene. The proposed loss functions can guide the proposed ULMEF to learn more reliable information from the HDR scene than existing loss functions which are defined by only using the set of images to be fused. As such, the quality of the fused image is significantly improved. The proposed ULMEF also adopts a multi-scale strategy that includes a multi-scale attention module to effectively preserve the scene depth and local contrast in the fused image. Meanwhile, the proposed ULMEF can be adopted to achieve exposure interpolation and exposure extrapolation. Extensive experiments show that the proposed ULMEF algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art exposure fusion algorithms.

- **Summary**: Monocular depth estimation is a critical task for autonomous driving and many other computer vision applications. While significant progress has been made in this field, the effects of viewpoint shifts on depth estimation models remain largely underexplored. This paper introduces a novel dataset and evaluation methodology to quantify the impact of different camera positions and orientations on monocular depth estimation performance. We propose a ground truth strategy based on homography estimation and object detection, eliminating the need for expensive lidar sensors. We collect a diverse dataset of road scenes from multiple viewpoints and use it to assess the robustness of a modern depth estimation model to geometric shifts. After assessing the validity of our strategy on a public dataset, we provide valuable insights into the limitations of current models and highlight the importance of considering viewpoint variations in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: In various fields, including medicine, age distributions are crucial. Despite widespread media coverage of health topics, there remains a need to enhance health communication. Narrative medical visualization is promising for improving information comprehension and retention. This study explores the most effective ways to present age distributions of diseases through narrative visualizations. We conducted a thorough analysis of existing visualizations, held workshops with a broad audience, and reviewed relevant literature. From this, we identified design choices focusing on comprehension, aesthetics, engagement, and memorability. We specifically tested three pictogram variants: pictograms as bars, stacked pictograms, and annotations. After evaluating 18 visualizations with 72 participants and three expert reviews, we determined that annotations were most effective for comprehension and aesthetics. However, traditional bar charts were preferred for engagement, and other variants were more memorable. The study provides a set of design recommendations based on these insights.

- **Summary**: Depth refinement aims to infer high-resolution depth with fine-grained edges and details, refining low-resolution results of depth estimation models. The prevailing methods adopt tile-based manners by merging numerous patches, which lacks efficiency and produces inconsistency. Besides, prior arts suffer from fuzzy depth boundaries and limited generalizability. Analyzing the fundamental reasons for these limitations, we model depth refinement as a noisy Poisson fusion problem with local inconsistency and edge deformation noises. We propose the Self-distilled Depth Refinement (SDDR) framework to enforce robustness against the noises, which mainly consists of depth edge representation and edge-based guidance. With noisy depth predictions as input, SDDR generates low-noise depth edge representations as pseudo-labels by coarse-to-fine self-distillation. Edge-based guidance with edge-guided gradient loss and edge-based fusion loss serves as the optimization objective equivalent to Poisson fusion. When depth maps are better refined, the labels also become more noise-free. Our model can acquire strong robustness to the noises, achieving significant improvements in accuracy, edge quality, efficiency, and generalizability on five different benchmarks. Moreover, directly training another model with edge labels produced by SDDR brings improvements, suggesting that our method could help with training robust refinement models in future works.

- **Summary**: Gaze Target Detection (GTD), i.e., determining where a person is looking within a scene from an external viewpoint, is a challenging task, particularly in 3D space. Existing approaches heavily rely on analyzing the person's appearance, primarily focusing on their face to predict the gaze target. This paper presents a novel approach to tackle this problem by utilizing the person's upper-body pose and available depth maps to extract a 3D gaze direction and employing a multi-stage or an end-to-end pipeline to predict the gazed target. When predicted accurately, the human body pose can provide valuable information about the head pose, which is a good approximation of the gaze direction, as well as the position of the arms and hands, which are linked to the activity the person is performing and the objects they are likely focusing on. Consequently, in addition to performing gaze estimation in 3D, we are also able to perform GTD simultaneously. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on the most comprehensive publicly accessible 3D gaze target detection dataset without requiring images of the person's face, thus promoting privacy preservation in various application contexts.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has emerged as a promising approach since it does not rely on labeled training data. Most methods combine convolution and Transformer to model long-distance dependencies to estimate depth accurately. However, Transformer treats 2D image features as 1D sequences, and positional encoding somewhat mitigates the loss of spatial information between different feature blocks, tending to overlook channel features, which limit the performance of depth estimation. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised monocular depth estimation network to get finer details. Specifically, we propose a decoder based on large kernel attention, which can model long-distance dependencies without compromising the two-dimension structure of features while maintaining feature channel adaptivity. In addition, we introduce a up-sampling module to accurately recover the fine details in the depth map. Our method achieves competitive results on the KITTI dataset.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of intelligent transportation systems and the popularity of smart city infrastructure, Vehicle Re-ID technology has become an important research field. The vehicle Re-ID task faces an important challenge, which is the high similarity between different vehicles. Existing methods use additional detection or segmentation models to extract differentiated local features. However, these methods either rely on additional annotations or greatly increase the computational cost. Using attention mechanism to capture global and local features is crucial to solve the challenge of high similarity between classes in vehicle Re-ID tasks. In this paper, we propose LKA-ReID with large kernel attention. Specifically, the large kernel attention (LKA) utilizes the advantages of self-attention and also benefits from the advantages of convolution, which can extract the global and local features of the vehicle more comprehensively. We also introduce hybrid channel attention (HCA) combines channel attention with spatial information, so that the model can better focus on channels and feature regions, and ignore background and other disturbing information. Experiments on VeRi-776 dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of LKA-ReID, with mAP reaches 86.65% and Rank-1 reaches 98.03%.

- **Summary**: While style transfer techniques have been well-developed for 2D image stylization, the extension of these methods to 3D scenes remains relatively unexplored. Existing approaches demonstrate proficiency in transferring colors and textures but often struggle with replicating the geometry of the scenes. In our work, we leverage an explicit Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation and directly match the distributions of Gaussians between style and content scenes using the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). By employing the entropy-regularized Wasserstein-2 distance, we ensure that the transformation maintains spatial smoothness. Additionally, we decompose the scene stylization problem into smaller chunks to enhance efficiency. This paradigm shift reframes stylization from a pure generative process driven by latent space losses to an explicit matching of distributions between two Gaussian representations. Our method achieves high-resolution 3D stylization by faithfully transferring details from 3D style scenes onto the content scene. Furthermore, WaSt-3D consistently delivers results across diverse content and style scenes without necessitating any training, as it relies solely on optimization-based techniques.

- **Summary**: Personalized text-to-image generation methods can generate customized images based on the reference images, which have garnered wide research interest. Recent methods propose a finetuning-free approach with a decoupled cross-attention mechanism to generate personalized images requiring no test-time finetuning. However, when multiple reference images are provided, the current decoupled cross-attention mechanism encounters the object confusion problem and fails to map each reference image to its corresponding object, thereby seriously limiting its scope of application. To address the object confusion problem, in this work we investigate the relevance of different positions of the latent image features to the target object in diffusion model, and accordingly propose a weighted-merge method to merge multiple reference image features into the corresponding objects. Next, we integrate this weighted-merge method into existing pre-trained models and continue to train the model on a multi-object dataset constructed from the open-sourced SA-1B dataset. To mitigate object confusion and reduce training costs, we propose an object quality score to estimate the image quality for the selection of high-quality training samples. Furthermore, our weighted-merge training framework can be employed on single-object generation when a single object has multiple reference images. The experiments verify that our method achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-arts on the Concept101 dataset and DreamBooth dataset of multi-object personalized image generation, and remarkably improves the performance on single-object personalized image generation.

- **Summary**: Challenging to capture, and challenging to display on a cellphone screen, the panorama paradoxically remains both a staple and underused feature of modern mobile camera applications. In this work we address both of these challenges with a spherical neural light field model for implicit panoramic image stitching and re-rendering; able to accommodate for depth parallax, view-dependent lighting, and local scene motion and color changes during capture. Fit during test-time to an arbitrary path panoramic video capture -- vertical, horizontal, random-walk -- these neural light spheres jointly estimate the camera path and a high-resolution scene reconstruction to produce novel wide field-of-view projections of the environment. Our single-layer model avoids expensive volumetric sampling, and decomposes the scene into compact view-dependent ray offset and color components, with a total model size of 80 MB per scene, and real-time (50 FPS) rendering at 1080p resolution. We demonstrate improved reconstruction quality over traditional image stitching and radiance field methods, with significantly higher tolerance to scene motion and non-ideal capture settings.

- **Summary**: Image manipulation detection and localization have received considerable attention from the research community given the blooming of Generative Models (GMs). Detection methods that follow a passive approach may overfit to specific GMs, limiting their application in real-world scenarios, due to the growing diversity of generative models. Recently, approaches based on a proactive framework have shown the possibility of dealing with this limitation. However, these methods suffer from two main limitations, which raises concerns about potential vulnerabilities: i) the manipulation detector is not robust to noise and hence can be easily fooled; ii) the fact that they rely on fixed perturbations for image protection offers a predictable exploit for malicious attackers, enabling them to reverse-engineer and evade detection. To overcome this issue we propose PADL, a new solution able to generate image-specific perturbations using a symmetric scheme of encoding and decoding based on cross-attention, which drastically reduces the possibility of reverse engineering, even when evaluated with adaptive attack [31]. Additionally, PADL is able to pinpoint manipulated areas, facilitating the identification of specific regions that have undergone alterations, and has more generalization power than prior art on held-out generative models. Indeed, although being trained only on an attribute manipulation GAN model [15], our method generalizes to a range of unseen models with diverse architectural designs, such as StarGANv2, BlendGAN, DiffAE, StableDiffusion and StableDiffusionXL. Additionally, we introduce a novel evaluation protocol, which offers a fair evaluation of localisation performance in function of detection accuracy and better captures real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: In self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition, the mask reconstruction paradigm is gaining interest in enhancing model refinement and robustness through effective masking. However, previous works primarily relied on a single masking criterion, resulting in the model overfitting specific features and overlooking other effective information. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchy and attention guided cross-masking framework (HA-CM) that applies masking to skeleton sequences from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically, in spatial graphs, we utilize hyperbolic space to maintain joint distinctions and effectively preserve the hierarchical structure of high-dimensional skeletons, employing joint hierarchy as the masking criterion. In temporal flows, we substitute traditional distance metrics with the global attention of joints for masking, addressing the convergence of distances in high-dimensional space and the lack of a global perspective. Additionally, we incorporate cross-contrast loss based on the cross-masking framework into the loss function to enhance the model's learning of instance-level features. HA-CM shows efficiency and universality on three public large-scale datasets, NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD. The source code of our HA-CM is available at https://github.com/YinxPeng/HA-CM-main.

- **Summary**: Several benchmarks have concluded that our best vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) are lacking in compositionality. Given an image, these benchmarks probe a model's ability to identify its associated caption amongst a set of compositional distractors. In response, a surge of recent proposals show improvements by finetuning CLIP with distractors as hard negatives. Our investigations reveal that these improvements have, in fact, been significantly overstated -- because existing benchmarks do not probe whether finetuned vision-language models remain invariant to hard positives. By curating an evaluation dataset with 112,382 hard negatives and hard positives, we uncover that including hard positives decreases CLIP's performance by 12.9%, while humans perform effortlessly at 99%. CLIP finetuned with hard negatives results in an even larger decrease, up to 38.7%. With this finding, we then produce a 1,775,259 image-text training set with both hard negative and hard positive captions. By training with both, we see improvements on existing benchmarks while simultaneously improving performance on hard positives, indicating a more robust improvement in compositionality. Our work suggests the need for future research to rigorously test and improve CLIP's understanding of semantic relationships between related "positive" concepts.

- **Summary**: Prior works on physical adversarial camouflage against vehicle detectors mainly focus on the effectiveness and robustness of the attack. The current most successful methods optimize 3D vehicle texture at a pixel level. However, this results in conspicuous and attention-grabbing patterns in the generated camouflage, which humans can easily identify. To address this issue, we propose a Customizable and Natural Camouflage Attack (CNCA) method by leveraging an off-the-shelf pre-trained diffusion model. By sampling the optimal texture image from the diffusion model with a user-specific text prompt, our method can generate natural and customizable adversarial camouflage while maintaining high attack performance. With extensive experiments on the digital and physical worlds and user studies, the results demonstrate that our proposed method can generate significantly more natural-looking camouflage than the state-of-the-art baselines while achieving competitive attack performance.

- **Summary**: In recent years, despite significant advancements in adversarial attack research, the security challenges in cross-modal scenarios, such as the transferability of adversarial attacks between infrared, thermal, and RGB images, have been overlooked. These heterogeneous image modalities collected by different hardware devices are widely prevalent in practical applications, and the substantial differences between modalities pose significant challenges to attack transferability. In this work, we explore a novel cross-modal adversarial attack strategy, termed multiform attack. We propose a dual-layer optimization framework based on gradient-evolution, facilitating efficient perturbation transfer between modalities. In the first layer of optimization, the framework utilizes image gradients to learn universal perturbations within each modality and employs evolutionary algorithms to search for shared perturbations with transferability across different modalities through secondary optimization. Through extensive testing on multiple heterogeneous datasets, we demonstrate the superiority and robustness of Multiform Attack compared to existing techniques. This work not only enhances the transferability of cross-modal adversarial attacks but also provides a new perspective for understanding security vulnerabilities in cross-modal systems.

- **Summary**: The architecture of Vision Transformers (ViTs), particularly the Multi-head Attention (MHA) mechanism, imposes substantial hardware demands. Deploying ViTs on devices with varying constraints, such as mobile phones, requires multiple models of different sizes. However, this approach has limitations, such as training and storing each required model separately. This paper introduces HydraViT, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by stacking attention heads to achieve a scalable ViT. By repeatedly changing the size of the embedded dimensions throughout each layer and their corresponding number of attention heads in MHA during training, HydraViT induces multiple subnetworks. Thereby, HydraViT achieves adaptability across a wide spectrum of hardware environments while maintaining performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of HydraViT in achieving a scalable ViT with up to 10 subnetworks, covering a wide range of resource constraints. HydraViT achieves up to 5 p.p. more accuracy with the same GMACs and up to 7 p.p. more accuracy with the same throughput on ImageNet-1K compared to the baselines, making it an effective solution for scenarios where hardware availability is diverse or varies over time.

- **Summary**: Feature tracking is crucial for, structure from motion (SFM), simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), object tracking and various computer vision tasks. Event cameras, known for their high temporal resolution and ability to capture asynchronous changes, have gained significant attention for their potential in feature tracking, especially in challenging conditions. However, event cameras lack the fine-grained texture information that conventional cameras provide, leading to error accumulation in tracking. To address this, we propose a novel framework, BlinkTrack, which integrates event data with RGB images for high-frequency feature tracking. Our method extends the traditional Kalman filter into a learning-based framework, utilizing differentiable Kalman filters in both event and image branches. This approach improves single-modality tracking, resolves ambiguities, and supports asynchronous data fusion. We also introduce new synthetic and augmented datasets to better evaluate our model. Experimental results indicate that BlinkTrack significantly outperforms existing event-based methods, exceeding 100 FPS with preprocessed event data and 80 FPS with multi-modality data.

- **Summary**: Decoding visual-semantic information from brain signals, such as functional MRI (fMRI), across different subjects poses significant challenges, including low signal-to-noise ratio, limited data availability, and cross-subject variability. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) show remarkable effectiveness in processing multimodal information. In this study, we introduce an LLM-based approach for reconstructing visual-semantic information from fMRI signals elicited by video stimuli. Specifically, we employ fine-tuning techniques on an fMRI encoder equipped with adaptors to transform brain responses into latent representations aligned with the video stimuli. Subsequently, these representations are mapped to textual modality by LLM. In particular, we integrate self-supervised domain adaptation methods to enhance the alignment between visual-semantic information and brain responses. Our proposed method achieves good results using various quantitative semantic metrics, while yielding similarity with ground-truth information.

- **Summary**: The stark contrast in the design philosophy of an event camera makes it particularly ideal for operating under high-speed, high dynamic range and low-light conditions, where standard cameras underperform. Nonetheless, event cameras still suffer from some amount of motion blur, especially under these challenging conditions, in contrary to what most think. This is attributed to the limited bandwidth of the event sensor pixel, which is mostly proportional to the light intensity. Thus, to ensure that event cameras can truly excel in such conditions where it has an edge over standard cameras, it is crucial to account for event motion blur in downstream applications, especially reconstruction. However, none of the recent works on reconstructing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) from events, nor event simulators, have considered the full effects of event motion blur. To this end, we propose, Deblur e-NeRF, a novel method to directly and effectively reconstruct blur-minimal NeRFs from motion-blurred events generated under high-speed motion or low-light conditions. The core component of this work is a physically-accurate pixel bandwidth model proposed to account for event motion blur under arbitrary speed and lighting conditions. We also introduce a novel threshold-normalized total variation loss to improve the regularization of large textureless patches. Experiments on real and novel realistically simulated sequences verify our effectiveness. Our code, event simulator and synthetic event dataset will be open-sourced.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel unsupervised cross-modal homography estimation framework, based on interleaved modality transfer and self-supervised homography prediction, named InterNet. InterNet integrates modality transfer and self-supervised homography estimation, introducing an innovative interleaved optimization framework to alternately promote both components. The modality transfer gradually narrows the modality gaps, facilitating the self-supervised homography estimation to fully leverage the synthetic intra-modal data. The self-supervised homography estimation progressively achieves reliable predictions, thereby providing robust cross-modal supervision for the modality transfer. To further boost the estimation accuracy, we also formulate a fine-grained homography feature loss to improve the connection between two components. Furthermore, we employ a simple yet effective distillation training technique to reduce model parameters and improve cross-domain generalization ability while maintaining comparable performance. Experiments reveal that InterNet achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among unsupervised methods, and even outperforms many supervised methods such as MHN and LocalTrans.

- **Summary**: Lensless cameras offer significant advantages in size, weight, and cost compared to traditional lens-based systems. Without a focusing lens, lensless cameras rely on computational algorithms to recover the scenes from multiplexed measurements. However, current algorithms struggle with inaccurate forward imaging models and insufficient priors to reconstruct high-quality images. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel two-stage approach for consistent and photorealistic lensless image reconstruction. The first stage of our approach ensures data consistency by focusing on accurately reconstructing the low-frequency content with a spatially varying deconvolution method that adjusts to changes in the Point Spread Function (PSF) across the camera's field of view. The second stage enhances photorealism by incorporating a generative prior from pre-trained diffusion models. By conditioning on the low-frequency content retrieved in the first stage, the diffusion model effectively reconstructs the high-frequency details that are typically lost in the lensless imaging process, while also maintaining image fidelity. Our method achieves a superior balance between data fidelity and visual quality compared to existing methods, as demonstrated with two popular lensless systems, PhlatCam and DiffuserCam.

- **Summary**: Developing meaningful and efficient representations that separate the fundamental structure of the data generation mechanism is crucial in representation learning. However, Disentangled Representation Learning has not fully shown its potential on real images, because of correlated generative factors, their resolution and limited access to ground truth labels. Specifically on the latter, we investigate the possibility of leveraging synthetic data to learn general-purpose disentangled representations applicable to real data, discussing the effect of fine-tuning and what properties of disentanglement are preserved after the transfer. We provide an extensive empirical study to address these issues. In addition, we propose a new interpretable intervention-based metric, to measure the quality of factors encoding in the representation. Our results indicate that some level of disentanglement, transferring a representation from synthetic to real data, is possible and effective.

- **Summary**: Vision-centric semantic occupancy prediction plays a crucial role in autonomous driving, which requires accurate and reliable predictions from low-cost sensors. Although having notably narrowed the accuracy gap with LiDAR, there is still few research effort to explore the reliability in predicting semantic occupancy from camera. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing semantic occupancy prediction models from a reliability perspective for the first time. Despite the gradual alignment of camera-based models with LiDAR in term of accuracy, a significant reliability gap persists. To addresses this concern, we propose ReliOcc, a method designed to enhance the reliability of camera-based occupancy networks. ReliOcc provides a plug-and-play scheme for existing models, which integrates hybrid uncertainty from individual voxels with sampling-based noise and relative voxels through mix-up learning. Besides, an uncertainty-aware calibration strategy is devised to further enhance model reliability in offline mode. Extensive experiments under various settings demonstrate that ReliOcc significantly enhances model reliability while maintaining the accuracy of both geometric and semantic predictions. Importantly, our proposed approach exhibits robustness to sensor failures and out of domain noises during inference.

However, empowering Large Language Models to perceive and generate images, texts, and speeches end-to-end with publicly available data remains challenging in the open-source community. Existing vision-language models rely on external tools for the speech processing, while speech-language models still suffer from limited or even without vision-understanding abilities. To address this gap, we propose EMOVA (EMotionally Omni-present Voice Assistant), to enable Large Language Models with end-to-end speech capabilities while maintaining the leading vision-language performance. With a semantic-acoustic disentangled speech tokenizer, we notice surprisingly that omni-modal alignment can further enhance vision-language and speech abilities compared with the corresponding bi-modal aligned counterparts. Moreover, a lightweight style module is proposed for flexible speech style controls (e.g., emotions and pitches). For the first time, EMOVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the vision-language and speech benchmarks, and meanwhile, supporting omni-modal spoken dialogue with vivid emotions.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in image captioning have explored text-only training methods to overcome the limitations of paired image-text data. However, existing text-only training methods often overlook the modality gap between using text data during training and employing images during inference. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Image-like Retrieval, which aligns text features with visually relevant features to mitigate the modality gap. Our method further enhances the accuracy of generated captions by designing a Fusion Module that integrates retrieved captions with input features. Additionally, we introduce a Frequency-based Entity Filtering technique that significantly improves caption quality. We integrate these methods into a unified framework, which we refer to as IFCap ($\textbf{I}$mage-like Retrieval and $\textbf{F}$requency-based Entity Filtering for Zero-shot $\textbf{Cap}$tioning). Through extensive experimentation, our straightforward yet powerful approach has demonstrated its efficacy, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in both image captioning and video captioning compared to zero-shot captioning based on text-only training.

- **Summary**: Accurately recognizing a revisited place is crucial for embodied agents to localize and navigate. This requires visual representations to be distinct, despite strong variations in camera viewpoint and scene appearance. Existing visual place recognition pipelines encode the "whole" image and search for matches. This poses a fundamental challenge in matching two images of the same place captured from different camera viewpoints: "the similarity of what overlaps can be dominated by the dissimilarity of what does not overlap". We address this by encoding and searching for "image segments" instead of the whole images. We propose to use open-set image segmentation to decompose an image into `meaningful' entities (i.e., things and stuff). This enables us to create a novel image representation as a collection of multiple overlapping subgraphs connecting a segment with its neighboring segments, dubbed SuperSegment. Furthermore, to efficiently encode these SuperSegments into compact vector representations, we propose a novel factorized representation of feature aggregation. We show that retrieving these partial representations leads to significantly higher recognition recall than the typical whole image based retrieval. Our segments-based approach, dubbed SegVLAD, sets a new state-of-the-art in place recognition on a diverse selection of benchmark datasets, while being applicable to both generic and task-specialized image encoders. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our method to ``revisit anything'' by evaluating our method on an object instance retrieval task, which bridges the two disparate areas of research: visual place recognition and object-goal navigation, through their common aim of recognizing goal objects specific to a place.

- **Summary**: The widespread success of deep learning models today is owed to the curation of extensive datasets significant in size and complexity. However, such models frequently pick up inherent biases in the data during the training process, leading to unreliable predictions. Diagnosing and debiasing datasets is thus a necessity to ensure reliable model performance. In this paper, we present CONBIAS, a novel framework for diagnosing and mitigating Concept co-occurrence Biases in visual datasets. CONBIAS represents visual datasets as knowledge graphs of concepts, enabling meticulous analysis of spurious concept co-occurrences to uncover concept imbalances across the whole dataset. Moreover, we show that by employing a novel clique-based concept balancing strategy, we can mitigate these imbalances, leading to enhanced performance on downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that data augmentation based on a balanced concept distribution augmented by CONBIAS improves generalization performance across multiple datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods. We will make our code and data publicly available.

- **Summary**: Recent works have shown that neural radiance fields (NeRFs) on top of parametric models have reached SOTA quality to build photorealistic head avatars from a monocular video. However, one major limitation of the NeRF-based avatars is the slow rendering speed due to the dense point sampling of NeRF, preventing them from broader utility on resource-constrained devices. We introduce LightAvatar, the first head avatar model based on neural light fields (NeLFs). LightAvatar renders an image from 3DMM parameters and a camera pose via a single network forward pass, without using mesh or volume rendering. The proposed approach, while being conceptually appealing, poses a significant challenge towards real-time efficiency and training stability. To resolve them, we introduce dedicated network designs to obtain proper representations for the NeLF model and maintain a low FLOPs budget. Meanwhile, we tap into a distillation-based training strategy that uses a pretrained avatar model as teacher to synthesize abundant pseudo data for training. A warping field network is introduced to correct the fitting error in the real data so that the model can learn better. Extensive experiments suggest that our method can achieve new SOTA image quality quantitatively or qualitatively, while being significantly faster than the counterparts, reporting 174.1 FPS (512x512 resolution) on a consumer-grade GPU (RTX3090) with no customized optimization.

- **Summary**: Introducing user-specified visual concepts in image editing is highly practical as these concepts convey the user's intent more precisely than text-based descriptions. We propose FreeEdit, a novel approach for achieving such reference-based image editing, which can accurately reproduce the visual concept from the reference image based on user-friendly language instructions. Our approach leverages the multi-modal instruction encoder to encode language instructions to guide the editing process. This implicit way of locating the editing area eliminates the need for manual editing masks. To enhance the reconstruction of reference details, we introduce the Decoupled Residual ReferAttention (DRRA) module. This module is designed to integrate fine-grained reference features extracted by a detail extractor into the image editing process in a residual way without interfering with the original self-attention. Given that existing datasets are unsuitable for reference-based image editing tasks, particularly due to the difficulty in constructing image triplets that include a reference image, we curate a high-quality dataset, FreeBench, using a newly developed twice-repainting scheme. FreeBench comprises the images before and after editing, detailed editing instructions, as well as a reference image that maintains the identity of the edited object, encompassing tasks such as object addition, replacement, and deletion. By conducting phased training on FreeBench followed by quality tuning, FreeEdit achieves high-quality zero-shot editing through convenient language instructions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of FreeEdit across multiple task types, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. The code will be available at: https://freeedit.github.io/.

- **Summary**: Automating garment manipulation poses a significant challenge for assistive robotics due to the diverse and deformable nature of garments. Traditional approaches typically require separate models for each garment type, which limits scalability and adaptability. In contrast, this paper presents a unified approach using vision-language models (VLMs) to improve keypoint prediction across various garment categories. By interpreting both visual and semantic information, our model enables robots to manage different garment states with a single model. We created a large-scale synthetic dataset using advanced simulation techniques, allowing scalable training without extensive real-world data. Experimental results indicate that the VLM-based method significantly enhances keypoint detection accuracy and task success rates, providing a more flexible and general solution for robotic garment manipulation. In addition, this research also underscores the potential of VLMs to unify various garment manipulation tasks within a single framework, paving the way for broader applications in home automation and assistive robotics for future.

- **Summary**: Rapid advances in the field of generative AI and text-to-image methods in particular have transformed the way we interact with and perceive computer-generated imagery today. In parallel, much progress has been made in 3D face reconstruction, using 3D Morphable Models (3DMM). In this paper, we present SVP, a novel hybrid 2D/3D generation method that outputs photorealistic videos of talking faces leveraging a large pre-trained text-to-image prior (2D), controlled via a 3DMM (3D). Specifically, we introduce a person-specific fine-tuning of a general 2D stable diffusion model which we lift to a video model by providing temporal 3DMM sequences as conditioning and by introducing a temporal denoising procedure. As an output, this model generates temporally smooth imagery of a person with 3DMM-based controls, i.e., a person-specific avatar. The facial appearance of this person-specific avatar can be edited and morphed to text-defined celebrities, without any fine-tuning at test time. The method is analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively, and we show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art monocular head avatar methods.

- **Summary**: Perception systems play a crucial role in autonomous driving, incorporating multiple sensors and corresponding computer vision algorithms. 3D LiDAR sensors are widely used to capture sparse point clouds of the vehicle's surroundings. However, such systems struggle to perceive occluded areas and gaps in the scene due to the sparsity of these point clouds and their lack of semantics. To address these challenges, Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) jointly predicts unobserved geometry and semantics in the scene given raw LiDAR measurements, aiming for a more complete scene representation. Building on promising results of diffusion models in image generation and super-resolution tasks, we propose their extension to SSC by implementing the noising and denoising diffusion processes in the point and semantic spaces individually. To control the generation, we employ semantic LiDAR point clouds as conditional input and design local and global regularization losses to stabilize the denoising process. We evaluate our approach on autonomous driving datasets and our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art for SSC.

- **Summary**: Crack detection, particularly from pavement images, presents a formidable challenge in the domain of computer vision due to several inherent complexities such as intensity inhomogeneity, intricate topologies, low contrast, and noisy backgrounds. Automated crack detection is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of essential infrastructures, including buildings, pavements, and bridges. Existing lightweight methods often face challenges including computational inefficiency, complex crack patterns, and difficult backgrounds, leading to inaccurate detection and impracticality for real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose EfficientCrackNet, a lightweight hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers for precise crack segmentation. EfficientCrackNet integrates depthwise separable convolutions (DSC) layers and MobileViT block to capture both global and local features. The model employs an Edge Extraction Method (EEM) and for efficient crack edge detection without pretraining, and Ultra-Lightweight Subspace Attention Module (ULSAM) to enhance feature extraction. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets Crack500, DeepCrack, and GAPs384 demonstrate that EfficientCrackNet achieves superior performance compared to existing lightweight models, while requiring only 0.26M parameters, and 0.483 FLOPs (G). The proposed model offers an optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art lightweight models, and providing a robust and adaptable solution for real-world crack segmentation.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised pretraining (SSP) has shown promising results in learning from large unlabeled datasets and, thus, could be useful for automated cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) short-axis cine segmentation. However, inconsistent reports of the benefits of SSP for segmentation have made it difficult to apply SSP to CMR. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate SSP methods for CMR cine segmentation.   To this end, short-axis cine stacks of 296 subjects (90618 2D slices) were used for unlabeled pretraining with four SSP methods; SimCLR, positional contrastive learning, DINO, and masked image modeling (MIM). Subsets of varying numbers of subjects were used for supervised fine-tuning of 2D models for each SSP method, as well as to train a 2D baseline model from scratch. The fine-tuned models were compared to the baseline using the 3D Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) in a test dataset of 140 subjects.   The SSP methods showed no performance gains with the largest supervised fine-tuning subset compared to the baseline (DSC = 0.89). When only 10 subjects (231 2D slices) are available for supervised training, SSP using MIM (DSC = 0.86) improves over training from scratch (DSC = 0.82).   This study found that SSP is valuable for CMR cine segmentation when labeled training data is scarce, but does not aid state-of-the-art deep learning methods when ample labeled data is available. Moreover, the choice of SSP method is important. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/q-cardIA/ssp-cmr-cine-segmentation

- **Summary**: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR) is set to transform satellite Assembly, Integration, and Testing (AIT) processes by enhancing precision, minimizing human error, and improving operational efficiency in cleanroom environments. This paper presents a technical description of the European Space Agency's (ESA) project "AI for AR in Satellite AIT," which combines real-time computer vision and AR systems to assist technicians during satellite assembly. Leveraging Microsoft HoloLens 2 as the AR interface, the system delivers context-aware instructions and real-time feedback, tackling the complexities of object recognition and 6D pose estimation in AIT workflows. All AI models demonstrated over 70% accuracy, with the detection model exceeding 95% accuracy, indicating a high level of performance and reliability. A key contribution of this work lies in the effective use of synthetic data for training AI models in AR applications, addressing the significant challenges of obtaining real-world datasets in highly dynamic satellite environments, as well as the creation of the Segmented Anything Model for Automatic Labelling (SAMAL), which facilitates the automatic annotation of real data, achieving speeds up to 20 times faster than manual human annotation. The findings demonstrate the efficacy of AI-driven AR systems in automating critical satellite assembly tasks, setting a foundation for future innovations in the space industry.

- **Summary**: Much of Earth's charismatic megafauna is endangered by human activities, particularly the rhino, which is at risk of extinction due to the poaching crisis in Africa. Monitoring rhinos' movement is crucial to their protection but has unfortunately proven difficult because rhinos are elusive. Therefore, instead of tracking rhinos, we propose the novel approach of mapping communal defecation sites, called middens, which give information about rhinos' spatial behavior valuable to anti-poaching, management, and reintroduction efforts. This paper provides the first-ever mapping of rhino midden locations by building classifiers to detect them using remotely sensed thermal, RGB, and LiDAR imagery in passive and active learning settings. As existing active learning methods perform poorly due to the extreme class imbalance in our dataset, we design MultimodAL, an active learning system employing a ranking technique and multimodality to achieve competitive performance with passive learning models with 94% fewer labels. Our methods could therefore save over 76 hours in labeling time when used on a similarly-sized dataset. Unexpectedly, our midden map reveals that rhino middens are not randomly distributed throughout the landscape; rather, they are clustered. Consequently, rangers should be targeted at areas with high midden densities to strengthen anti-poaching efforts, in line with UN Target 15.7.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated their great potential in general-purpose video understanding. To verify the significance of these models, a number of benchmarks have been proposed to diagnose their capabilities in different scenarios. However, existing benchmarks merely evaluate models through video-level question-answering, lacking fine-grained event-level assessment and task diversity. To fill this gap, we introduce E.T. Bench (Event-Level & Time-Sensitive Video Understanding Benchmark), a large-scale and high-quality benchmark for open-ended event-level video understanding. Categorized within a 3-level task taxonomy, E.T. Bench encompasses 7.3K samples under 12 tasks with 7K videos (251.4h total length) under 8 domains, providing comprehensive evaluations. We extensively evaluated 8 Image-LLMs and 12 Video-LLMs on our benchmark, and the results reveal that state-of-the-art models for coarse-level (video-level) understanding struggle to solve our fine-grained tasks, e.g., grounding event-of-interests within videos, largely due to the short video context length, improper time representations, and lack of multi-event training data. Focusing on these issues, we further propose a strong baseline model, E.T. Chat, together with an instruction-tuning dataset E.T. Instruct 164K tailored for fine-grained event-level understanding. Our simple but effective solution demonstrates superior performance in multiple scenarios.

- **Summary**: Current auto-regressive mesh generation methods suffer from issues such as incompleteness, insufficient detail, and poor generalization. In this paper, we propose an Auto-regressive Auto-encoder (ArAE) model capable of generating high-quality 3D meshes with up to 4,000 faces at a spatial resolution of $512^3$. We introduce a novel mesh tokenization algorithm that efficiently compresses triangular meshes into 1D token sequences, significantly enhancing training efficiency. Furthermore, our model compresses variable-length triangular meshes into a fixed-length latent space, enabling training latent diffusion models for better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior quality, diversity, and generalization capabilities of our model in both point cloud and image-conditioned mesh generation tasks.

- **Summary**: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) shows promise in medical image analysis but requires substantial data and computational resources. Due to these restrictions, existing CLIP applications in medical imaging focus mainly on modalities like chest X-rays that have abundant image-report data available, leaving many other important modalities under-explored. Here, we propose the first adaptation of the full CLIP model to mammography, which presents significant challenges due to labeled data scarcity, high-resolution images with small regions of interest, and data imbalance. We first develop a specialized supervision framework for mammography that leverages its multi-view nature. Furthermore, we design a symmetric local alignment module to better focus on detailed features in high-resolution images. Lastly, we incorporate a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach for large language models pre-trained with medical knowledge to address data limitations.

- **Summary**: Traditionally, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) rely on CMOS-based cameras to collect images about the world below. One of the most successful applications of UAVs is to generate orthomosaics or orthomaps, in which a series of images are integrated together to develop a larger map. However, the use of CMOS-based cameras with global or rolling shutters mean that orthomaps are vulnerable to challenging light conditions, motion blur, and high-speed motion of independently moving objects under the camera. Event cameras are less sensitive to these issues, as their pixels are able to trigger asynchronously on brightness changes. This work introduces the first orthomosaic approach using event cameras. In contrast to existing methods relying only on CMOS cameras, our approach enables map generation even in challenging light conditions, including direct sunlight and after sunset.

- **Summary**: Humans can learn to manipulate new objects by simply watching others; providing robots with the ability to learn from such demonstrations would enable a natural interface specifying new behaviors. This work develops Robot See Robot Do (RSRD), a method for imitating articulated object manipulation from a single monocular RGB human demonstration given a single static multi-view object scan. We first propose 4D Differentiable Part Models (4D-DPM), a method for recovering 3D part motion from a monocular video with differentiable rendering. This analysis-by-synthesis approach uses part-centric feature fields in an iterative optimization which enables the use of geometric regularizers to recover 3D motions from only a single video. Given this 4D reconstruction, the robot replicates object trajectories by planning bimanual arm motions that induce the demonstrated object part motion. By representing demonstrations as part-centric trajectories, RSRD focuses on replicating the demonstration's intended behavior while considering the robot's own morphological limits, rather than attempting to reproduce the hand's motion. We evaluate 4D-DPM's 3D tracking accuracy on ground truth annotated 3D part trajectories and RSRD's physical execution performance on 9 objects across 10 trials each on a bimanual YuMi robot. Each phase of RSRD achieves an average of 87% success rate, for a total end-to-end success rate of 60% across 90 trials. Notably, this is accomplished using only feature fields distilled from large pretrained vision models -- without any task-specific training, fine-tuning, dataset collection, or annotation.

- **Summary**: Leveraging the visual priors of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models offers a promising solution to enhance zero-shot generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, existing methods often uncritically use the original diffusion formulation, which may not be optimal due to the fundamental differences between dense prediction and image generation. In this paper, we provide a systemic analysis of the diffusion formulation for the dense prediction, focusing on both quality and efficiency. And we find that the original parameterization type for image generation, which learns to predict noise, is harmful for dense prediction; the multi-step noising/denoising diffusion process is also unnecessary and challenging to optimize. Based on these insights, we introduce Lotus, a diffusion-based visual foundation model with a simple yet effective adaptation protocol for dense prediction. Specifically, Lotus is trained to directly predict annotations instead of noise, thereby avoiding harmful variance. We also reformulate the diffusion process into a single-step procedure, simplifying optimization and significantly boosting inference speed. Additionally, we introduce a novel tuning strategy called detail preserver, which achieves more accurate and fine-grained predictions. Without scaling up the training data or model capacity, Lotus achieves SoTA performance in zero-shot depth and normal estimation across various datasets. It also significantly enhances efficiency, being hundreds of times faster than most existing diffusion-based methods.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have greatly enhanced their proficiency in 2D visual understanding tasks, enabling them to effectively process and understand images and videos. However, the development of LMMs with 3D-awareness for 3D scene understanding has been hindered by the lack of large-scale 3D vision-language datasets and powerful 3D encoders. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective framework called LLaVA-3D. Leveraging the strong 2D understanding priors from LLaVA, our LLaVA-3D efficiently adapts LLaVA for 3D scene understanding without compromising 2D understanding capabilities. To achieve this, we employ a simple yet effective representation, 3D Patch, which connects 2D CLIP patch features with their corresponding positions in 3D space. By integrating the 3D Patches into 2D LMMs and employing joint 2D and 3D vision-language instruction tuning, we establish a unified architecture for both 2D image understanding and 3D scene understanding. Experimental results show that LLaVA-3D converges 3.5x faster than existing 3D LMMs when trained on 3D vision-language datasets. Moreover, LLaVA-3D not only achieves state-of-the-art performance across various 3D tasks but also maintains comparable 2D image understanding and vision-language conversation capabilities with LLaVA.

- **Summary**: As the prevalence of wearable devices, learning egocentric motions becomes essential to develop contextual AI. In this work, we present EgoLM, a versatile framework that tracks and understands egocentric motions from multi-modal inputs, e.g., egocentric videos and motion sensors. EgoLM exploits rich contexts for the disambiguation of egomotion tracking and understanding, which are ill-posed under single modality conditions. To facilitate the versatile and multi-modal framework, our key insight is to model the joint distribution of egocentric motions and natural languages using large language models (LLM). Multi-modal sensor inputs are encoded and projected to the joint latent space of language models, and used to prompt motion generation or text generation for egomotion tracking or understanding, respectively. Extensive experiments on large-scale multi-modal human motion dataset validate the effectiveness of EgoLM as a generalist model for universal egocentric learning.

- **Summary**: Building on the success of diffusion models in visual generation, flow-based models reemerge as another prominent family of generative models that have achieved competitive or better performance in terms of both visual quality and inference speed. By learning the velocity field through flow-matching, flow-based models tend to produce a straighter sampling trajectory, which is advantageous during the sampling process. However, unlike diffusion models for which fast samplers are well-developed, efficient sampling of flow-based generative models has been rarely explored. In this paper, we propose a framework called FlowTurbo to accelerate the sampling of flow-based models while still enhancing the sampling quality. Our primary observation is that the velocity predictor's outputs in the flow-based models will become stable during the sampling, enabling the estimation of velocity via a lightweight velocity refiner. Additionally, we introduce several techniques including a pseudo corrector and sample-aware compilation to further reduce inference time. Since FlowTurbo does not change the multi-step sampling paradigm, it can be effectively applied for various tasks such as image editing, inpainting, etc. By integrating FlowTurbo into different flow-based models, we obtain an acceleration ratio of 53.1%$\sim$58.3% on class-conditional generation and 29.8%$\sim$38.5% on text-to-image generation. Notably, FlowTurbo reaches an FID of 2.12 on ImageNet with 100 (ms / img) and FID of 3.93 with 38 (ms / img), achieving the real-time image generation and establishing the new state-of-the-art.
