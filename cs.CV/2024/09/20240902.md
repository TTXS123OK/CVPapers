- **Summary**: Digital Twins (DTs) are becoming popular in Additive Manufacturing (AM) due to their ability to create virtual replicas of physical components of AM machines, which helps in real-time production monitoring. Advanced techniques such as Machine Learning (ML), Augmented Reality (AR), and simulation-based models play key roles in developing intelligent and adaptable DTs in manufacturing processes. However, questions remain regarding scalability, the integration of high-quality data, and the computational power required for real-time applications in developing DTs. Understanding the current state of DTs in AM is essential to address these challenges and fully utilize their potential in advancing AM processes. Considering this opportunity, this work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of DTs in AM by addressing the following four research questions: (1) What are the key types of DTs used in AM and their specific applications? (2) What are the recent developments and implementations of DTs? (3) How are DTs employed in process improvement and hybrid manufacturing? (4) How are DTs integrated with Industry 4.0 technologies? By discussing current applications and techniques, we aim to offer a better understanding and potential future research directions for researchers and practitioners in AM and DTs.

- **Summary**: Deep learning methods have significantly advanced medical image segmentation, yet their success hinges on large volumes of manually annotated data, which require specialized expertise for accurate labeling. Additionally, these methods often demand substantial computational resources, particularly for three-dimensional medical imaging tasks. Consequently, applying deep learning techniques for medical image segmentation with limited annotated data and computational resources remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, termed HyPS, which employs a hybrid parallel and serial architecture. HyPS updates a minimal subset of model parameters, thereby retaining the pre-trained model's original knowledge tructure while enhancing its ability to learn specific features relevant to downstream tasks. We apply this strategy to the state-of-the-art SwinUNETR model for medical image segmentation. Initially, the model is pre-trained on the BraTs2021 dataset, after which the HyPS method is employed to transfer it to three distinct hippocampus datasets.Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyPS outperforms baseline methods, especially in scenarios with limited training samples. Furthermore, based on the segmentation results, we calculated the hippocampal volumes of subjects from the ADNI dataset and combined these with metadata to classify disease types. In distinguishing Alzheimer's disease (AD) from cognitively normal (CN) individuals, as well as early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) from late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), HyPS achieved classification accuracies of 83.78% and 64.29%, respectively. These findings indicate that the HyPS method not only facilitates effective hippocampal segmentation using pre-trained models but also holds potential for aiding Alzheimer's disease detection. Our code is publicly available.

- **Summary**: The trustworthiness of multimedia is being increasingly evaluated by advanced Image Manipulation Localization (IML) techniques, resulting in the emergence of the IML field. An effective manipulation model necessitates the extraction of non-semantic differential features between manipulated and legitimate sections to utilize artifacts. This requires direct comparisons between the two regions.. Current models employ either feature approaches based on handcrafted features, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or a hybrid approach that combines both. Handcrafted feature approaches presuppose tampering in advance, hence restricting their effectiveness in handling various tampering procedures, but CNNs capture semantic information, which is insufficient for addressing manipulation artifacts. In order to address these constraints, we have developed a dual-branch model that integrates manually designed feature noise with conventional CNN features. This model employs a dual-branch strategy, where one branch integrates noise characteristics and the other branch integrates RGB features using the hierarchical ConvNext Module. In addition, the model utilizes edge supervision loss to acquire boundary manipulation information, resulting in accurate localization at the edges. Furthermore, this architecture utilizes a feature augmentation module to optimize and refine the presentation of attributes. The shallowfakes dataset (CASIA, COVERAGE, COLUMBIA, NIST16) and deepfake dataset Faceforensics++ (FF++) underwent thorough testing to demonstrate their outstanding ability to extract features and their superior performance compared to other baseline models. The AUC score achieved an astounding 99%. The model is superior in comparison and easily outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) models.

- **Summary**: An early, non-invasive, and on-site detection of nutrient deficiencies is critical to enable timely actions to prevent major losses of crops caused by lack of nutrients. While acquiring labeled data is very expensive, collecting images from multiple views of a crop is straightforward. Despite its relevance for practical applications, unsupervised domain adaptation where multiple views are available for the labeled source domain as well as the unlabeled target domain is an unexplored research area. In this work, we thus propose an approach that leverages multiple camera views in the source and target domain for unsupervised domain adaptation. We evaluate the proposed approach on two nutrient deficiency datasets. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on both datasets compared to other unsupervised domain adaptation methods. The dataset and source code are available at https://github.com/jh-yi/MV-Match.

- **Summary**: Motion prediction plays an essential role in autonomous driving systems, enabling autonomous vehicles to achieve more accurate local-path planning and driving decisions based on predictions of the surrounding vehicles. However, existing methods neglect the potential missing values caused by object occlusion, perception failures, etc., which inevitably degrades the trajectory prediction performance in real traffic scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end framework for incomplete vehicle trajectory prediction, named Multi-scale Temporal Fusion Transformer (MTFT), which consists of the Multi-scale Attention Head (MAH) and the Continuity Representation-guided Multi-scale Fusion (CRMF) module. Specifically, the MAH leverages the multi-head attention mechanism to parallelly capture multi-scale motion representation of trajectory from different temporal granularities, thus mitigating the adverse effect of missing values on prediction. Furthermore, the multi-scale motion representation is input into the CRMF module for multi-scale fusion to obtain the robust temporal feature of the vehicle. During the fusion process, the continuity representation of vehicle motion is first extracted across time steps to guide the fusion, ensuring that the resulting temporal feature incorporates both detailed information and the overall trend of vehicle motion, which facilitates the accurate decoding of future trajectory that is consistent with the vehicle's motion trend. We evaluate the proposed model on four datasets derived from highway and urban traffic scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its superior performance in the incomplete vehicle trajectory prediction task compared with state-of-the-art models, e.g., a comprehensive performance improvement of more than 39% on the HighD dataset.

- **Summary**: To accurately understand engineering drawings, it is essential to establish the correspondence between images and their description tables within the drawings. Existing document understanding methods predominantly focus on text as the main modality, which is not suitable for documents containing substantial image information. In the field of visual relation detection, the structure of the task inherently limits its capacity to assess relationships among all entity pairs in the drawings. To address this issue, we propose a vision-based relation detection model, named ViRED, to identify the associations between tables and circuits in electrical engineering drawings. Our model mainly consists of three parts: a vision encoder, an object encoder, and a relation decoder. We implement ViRED using PyTorch to evaluate its performance. To validate the efficacy of ViRED, we conduct a series of experiments. The experimental results indicate that, within the engineering drawing dataset, our approach attained an accuracy of 96\% in the task of relation prediction, marking a substantial improvement over existing methodologies. The results also show that ViRED can inference at a fast speed even when there are numerous objects in a single engineering drawing.



### Merging Multiple Datasets for Improved Appearance-Based Gaze Estimation

- **Summary**: Multiple datasets have been created for training and testing appearance-based gaze estimators. Intuitively, more data should lead to better performance. However, combining datasets to train a single esti-mator rarely improves gaze estimation performance. One reason may be differences in the experimental protocols used to obtain the gaze sam-ples, resulting in differences in the distributions of head poses, gaze an-gles, illumination, etc. Another reason may be the inconsistency between methods used to define gaze angles (label mismatch). We propose two innovations to improve the performance of gaze estimation by leveraging multiple datasets, a change in the estimator architecture and the intro-duction of a gaze adaptation module. Most state-of-the-art estimators merge information extracted from images of the two eyes and the entire face either in parallel or combine information from the eyes first then with the face. Our proposed Two-stage Transformer-based Gaze-feature Fusion (TTGF) method uses transformers to merge information from each eye and the face separately and then merge across the two eyes. We argue that this improves head pose invariance since changes in head pose affect left and right eye images in different ways. Our proposed Gaze Adaptation Module (GAM) method handles annotation inconsis-tency by applying a Gaze Adaption Module for each dataset to correct gaze estimates from a single shared estimator. This enables us to combine information across datasets despite differences in labeling. Our experi-ments show that these innovations improve gaze estimation performance over the SOTA both individually and collectively (by 10% - 20%).

- **Summary**: In this paper, we summarize the methods and experimental results we proposed for Task 2 in the learn2reg 2024 Challenge. This task focuses on unsupervised registration of anatomical structures in brain MRI images between different patients. The difficulty lies in: (1) without segmentation labels, and (2) a large amount of data. To address these challenges, we built an efficient backbone network and explored several schemes to further enhance registration accuracy. Under the guidance of the NCC loss function and smoothness regularization loss function, we obtained a smooth and reasonable deformation field. According to the leaderboard, our method achieved a Dice coefficient of 77.34%, which is 1.4% higher than the TransMorph. Overall, we won second place on the leaderboard for Task 2.

- **Summary**: The Medical Segment Anything Model (MedSAM) has shown remarkable performance in medical image segmentation, drawing significant attention in the field. However, its sensitivity to varying prompt types and locations poses challenges. This paper addresses these challenges by focusing on the development of reliable prompts that enhance MedSAM's accuracy. We introduce MedSAM-U, an uncertainty-guided framework designed to automatically refine multi-prompt inputs for more reliable and precise medical image segmentation. Specifically, we first train a Multi-Prompt Adapter integrated with MedSAM, creating MPA-MedSAM, to adapt to diverse multi-prompt inputs. We then employ uncertainty-guided multi-prompt to effectively estimate the uncertainties associated with the prompts and their initial segmentation results. In particular, a novel uncertainty-guided prompts adaptation technique is then applied automatically to derive reliable prompts and their corresponding segmentation outcomes. We validate MedSAM-U using datasets from multiple modalities to train a universal image segmentation model. Compared to MedSAM, experimental results on five distinct modal datasets demonstrate that the proposed MedSAM-U achieves an average performance improvement of 1.7\% to 20.5\% across uncertainty-guided prompts.

- **Summary**: Analyzing student actions is an important and challenging task in educational research. Existing efforts have been hampered by the lack of accessible datasets to capture the nuanced action dynamics in classrooms. In this paper, we present a new multi-label student action video (SAV) dataset for complex classroom scenes. The dataset consists of 4,324 carefully trimmed video clips from 758 different classrooms, each labeled with 15 different actions displayed by students in classrooms. Compared to existing behavioral datasets, our dataset stands out by providing a wide range of real classroom scenarios, high-quality video data, and unique challenges, including subtle movement differences, dense object engagement, significant scale differences, varied shooting angles, and visual occlusion. The increased complexity of the dataset brings new opportunities and challenges for benchmarking action detection. Innovatively, we also propose a new baseline method, a visual transformer for enhancing attention to key local details in small and dense object regions. Our method achieves excellent performance with mean Average Precision (mAP) of 67.9\% and 27.4\% on SAV and AVA, respectively. This paper not only provides the dataset but also calls for further research into AI-driven educational tools that may transform teaching methodologies and learning outcomes. The code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/Ritatanz/SAV.

- **Summary**: Normalizing flows, a category of probabilistic models famed for their capabilities in modeling complex data distributions, have exhibited remarkable efficacy in unsupervised anomaly detection. This paper explores the potential of normalizing flows in multi-class anomaly detection, wherein the normal data is compounded with multiple classes without providing class labels. Through the integration of vector quantization (VQ), we empower the flow models to distinguish different concepts of multi-class normal data in an unsupervised manner, resulting in a novel flow-based unified method, named VQ-Flow. Specifically, our VQ-Flow leverages hierarchical vector quantization to estimate two relative codebooks: a Conceptual Prototype Codebook (CPC) for concept distinction and its concomitant Concept-Specific Pattern Codebook (CSPC) to capture concept-specific normal patterns. The flow models in VQ-Flow are conditioned on the concept-specific patterns captured in CSPC, capable of modeling specific normal patterns associated with different concepts. Moreover, CPC further enables our VQ-Flow for concept-aware distribution modeling, faithfully mimicking the intricate multi-class normal distribution through a mixed Gaussian distribution reparametrized on the conceptual prototypes. Through the introduction of vector quantization, the proposed VQ-Flow advances the state-of-the-art in multi-class anomaly detection within a unified training scheme, yielding the Det./Loc. AUROC of 99.5%/98.3% on MVTec AD. The codebase is publicly available at https://github.com/cool-xuan/vqflow.

- **Summary**: XNet introduces a wavelet-based X-shaped unified architecture for fully- and semi-supervised biomedical segmentation. So far, however, XNet still faces the limitations, including performance degradation when images lack high-frequency (HF) information, underutilization of raw images and insufficient fusion. To address these issues, we propose XNet v2, a low- and high-frequency complementary model. XNet v2 performs wavelet-based image-level complementary fusion, using fusion results along with raw images inputs three different sub-networks to construct consistency loss. Furthermore, we introduce a feature-level fusion module to enhance the transfer of low-frequency (LF) information and HF information. XNet v2 achieves state-of-the-art in semi-supervised segmentation while maintaining competitve results in fully-supervised learning. More importantly, XNet v2 excels in scenarios where XNet fails. Compared to XNet, XNet v2 exhibits fewer limitations, better results and greater universality. Extensive experiments on three 2D and two 3D datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of XNet v2.

- **Summary**: Generalization to unseen real-world scenarios for robot manipulation requires exposure to diverse datasets during training. However, collecting large real-world datasets is intractable due to high operational costs. For robot learning to generalize despite these challenges, it is essential to leverage sources of data or priors beyond the robot's direct experience. In this work, we posit that image-text generative models, which are pre-trained on large corpora of web-scraped data, can serve as such a data source. These generative models encompass a broad range of real-world scenarios beyond a robot's direct experience and can synthesize novel synthetic experiences that expose robotic agents to additional world priors aiding real-world generalization at no extra cost.   In particular, our approach leverages pre-trained generative models as an effective tool for data augmentation. We propose a generative augmentation framework for semantically controllable augmentations and rapidly multiplying robot datasets while inducing rich variations that enable real-world generalization. Based on diverse augmentations of robot data, we show how scalable robot manipulation policies can be trained and deployed both in simulation and in unseen real-world environments such as kitchens and table-tops. By demonstrating the effectiveness of image-text generative models in diverse real-world robotic applications, our generative augmentation framework provides a scalable and efficient path for boosting generalization in robot learning at no extra human cost.

- **Summary**: Neural video compression has recently demonstrated significant potential to compete with conventional video codecs in terms of rate-quality performance. These learned video codecs are however associated with various issues related to decoding complexity (for autoencoder-based methods) and/or system delays (for implicit neural representation (INR) based models), which currently prevent them from being deployed in practical applications. In this paper, targeting a practical neural video codec, we propose a novel INR-based coding framework, PNVC, which innovatively combines autoencoder-based and overfitted solutions. Our approach benefits from several design innovations, including a new structural reparameterization-based architecture, hierarchical quality control, modulation-based entropy modeling, and scale-aware positional embedding. Supporting both low delay (LD) and random access (RA) configurations, PNVC outperforms existing INR-based codecs, achieving nearly 35%+ BD-rate savings against HEVC HM 18.0 (LD) - almost 10% more compared to one of the state-of-the-art INR-based codecs, HiNeRV and 5% more over VTM 20.0 (LD), while maintaining 20+ FPS decoding speeds for 1080p content. This represents an important step forward for INR-based video coding, moving it towards practical deployment. The source code will be available for public evaluation.

- **Summary**: Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is a key technique in experimental mechanics for full-field deformation measurement, traditionally relying on subset matching to determine displacement fields. However, selecting optimal parameters like shape functions and subset size can be challenging in non-uniform deformation scenarios. Recent deep learning-based DIC approaches, both supervised and unsupervised, use neural networks to map speckle images to deformation fields, offering precise measurements without manual tuning. However, these methods require complex network architectures to extract speckle image features, which does not guarantee solution accuracy This paper introduces PINN-DIC, a novel DIC method based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Unlike traditional approaches, PINN-DIC uses a simple fully connected neural network that takes the coordinate domain as input and outputs the displacement field. By integrating the DIC governing equation into the loss function, PINN-DIC directly extracts the displacement field from reference and deformed speckle images through iterative optimization. Evaluations on simulated and real experiments demonstrate that PINN-DIC maintains the accuracy of deep learning-based DIC in non-uniform fields while offering three distinct advantages: 1) enhanced precision with a simpler network by directly fitting the displacement field from coordinates, 2) effective handling of irregular boundary displacement fields with minimal parameter adjustments, and 3) easy integration with other neural network-based mechanical analysis methods for comprehensive DIC result analysis.

- **Summary**: Because videos in the wild can be out of sync for various reasons, a sync-net is used to bring the video back into sync for tasks that require synchronized videos. Previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) sync-nets use InfoNCE loss, rely on the transformer architecture, or both. Unfortunately, the former makes the model's output difficult to interpret, and the latter is unfriendly with large images, thus limiting the usefulness of sync-nets. In this work, we train a convolutional sync-net using the balanced BCE loss (BBCE), a loss inspired by the binary cross entropy (BCE) and the InfoNCE losses. In contrast to the InfoNCE loss, the BBCE loss does not require complicated sampling schemes. Our model can better handle larger images, and its output can be given a probabilistic interpretation. The probabilistic interpretation allows us to define metrics such as probability at offset and offscreen ratio to evaluate the sync quality of audio-visual (AV) speech datasets. Furthermore, our model achieves SOTA accuracy of $96.5\%$ on the LRS2 dataset and $93.8\%$ on the LRS3 dataset.

- **Summary**: Infrared and visible dual-modality tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection can achieve robust performance even in extreme scenes by fusing complementary information. Most current methods design task-specific frameworks, which are limited in generalization across multiple tasks. In this paper, we propose a fusion-guided infrared and visible general framework, IVGF, which can be easily extended to many high-level vision tasks. Firstly, we adopt the SOTA infrared and visible foundation models to extract the general representations. Then, to enrich the semantics information of these general representations for high-level vision tasks, we design the feature enhancement module and token enhancement module for feature maps and tokens, respectively. Besides, the attention-guided fusion module is proposed for effectively fusing by exploring the complementary information of two modalities. Moreover, we also adopt the cutout&mix augmentation strategy to conduct the data augmentation, which further improves the ability of the model to mine the regional complementary between the two modalities. Extensive experiments show that the IVGF outperforms state-of-the-art dual-modality methods in the semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. The detailed ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each module, and another experiment explores the anti-missing modality ability of the proposed method in the dual-modality semantic segmentation task.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the critical task of gait cycle segmentation using short sequences from ear-worn IMUs, a practical and non-invasive approach for home-based monitoring and rehabilitation of patients with impaired motor function. While previous studies have focused on IMUs positioned on the lower limbs, ear-worn IMUs offer a unique advantage in capturing gait dynamics with minimal intrusion. To address the challenges of gait cycle segmentation using short sequences, we introduce the Gait Characteristic Curve Regression and Restoration (GCCRR) method, a novel two-stage approach designed for fine-grained gait phase segmentation. The first stage transforms the segmentation task into a regression task on the Gait Characteristic Curve (GCC), which is a one-dimensional feature sequence incorporating periodic information. The second stage restores the gait cycle using peak detection techniques. Our method employs Bi-LSTM-based deep learning algorithms for regression to ensure reliable segmentation for short gait sequences. Evaluation on the HamlynGait dataset demonstrates that GCCRR achieves over 80\% Accuracy, with a Timestamp Error below one sampling interval. Despite its promising results, the performance lags behind methods using more extensive sensor systems, highlighting the need for larger, more diverse datasets. Future work will focus on data augmentation using motion capture systems and improving algorithmic generalizability.

- **Summary**: Lip reading aims to predict spoken language by analyzing lip movements. Despite advancements in lip reading technologies, performance degrades when models are applied to unseen speakers due to their sensitivity to variations in visual information such as lip appearances. To address this challenge, speaker adaptive lip reading technologies have advanced by focusing on effectively adapting a lip reading model to target speakers in the visual modality. The effectiveness of adapting language information, such as vocabulary choice, of the target speaker has not been explored in the previous works. Moreover, existing datasets for speaker adaptation have limited vocabulary size and pose variations, limiting the validation of previous speaker-adaptive methods in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel speaker-adaptive lip reading method that adapts a pre-trained model to target speakers at both vision and language levels. Specifically, we integrate prompt tuning and the LoRA approach, applying them to a pre-trained lip reading model to effectively adapt the model to target speakers. In addition, to validate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, we introduce a new dataset, VoxLRS-SA, derived from VoxCeleb2 and LRS3. It contains a vocabulary of approximately 100K words, offers diverse pose variations, and enables the validation of adaptation methods in wild, sentence-level lip reading for the first time. Through various experiments, we demonstrate that the existing speaker-adaptive method also improves performance in the wild at the sentence level. Moreover, with the proposed adaptation method, we show that the proposed method achieves larger improvements when applied to the target speaker, compared to the previous works.

- **Summary**: Blind image deblurring is a challenging low-level vision task that involves estimating the unblurred image when the blur kernel is unknown. In this paper, we present a self-supervised multi-scale blind image deblurring method to jointly estimate the latent image and the blur kernel via alternating optimization. In the image estimation step, we construct a multi-scale generator network with multiple inputs and multiple outputs to collaboratively estimate latent images at various scales, supervised by an image pyramid constructed from only the blurred image. This generator places architectural constraints on the network and avoids the need for mathematical expression of image priors. In the blur kernel estimation step, the blur kernel at each scale is independently estimated with a direct solution to a quadratic regularized least-squares model for its flexible adaptation to the proposed multi-scale generator for image estimation. Thanks to the collaborative estimation across multiple scales, our method avoids the computationally intensive coarse-to-fine propagation and additional image deblurring processes used in traditional mathematical optimization-based methods. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on synthetic and realistic datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, especially for handling large and real-world blurs.

- **Summary**: Blind face restoration endeavors to restore a clear face image from a degraded counterpart. Recent approaches employing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as priors have demonstrated remarkable success in this field. However, these methods encounter challenges in achieving a balance between realism and fidelity, particularly in complex degradation scenarios. To inherit the exceptional realism generative ability of the diffusion model and also constrained by the identity-aware fidelity, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework by embedding the 3D facial priors as structure and identity constraints into a denoising diffusion process. Specifically, in order to obtain more accurate 3D prior representations, the 3D facial image is reconstructed by a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) using an initial restored face image that has been processed by a pretrained restoration network. A customized multi-level feature extraction method is employed to exploit both structural and identity information of 3D facial images, which are then mapped into the noise estimation process. In order to enhance the fusion of identity information into the noise estimation, we propose a Time-Aware Fusion Block (TAFB). This module offers a more efficient and adaptive fusion of weights for denoising, considering the dynamic nature of the denoising process in the diffusion model, which involves initial structure refinement followed by texture detail enhancement.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms on synthetic and real-world datasets for blind face restoration.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing endoscopic videos is crucial for high-fidelity visualization and the efficiency of surgical operations. Despite the importance, existing 3D reconstruction methods encounter several challenges, including stringent demands for accuracy, imprecise camera positioning, intricate dynamic scenes, and the necessity for rapid reconstruction. Addressing these issues, this paper presents the first camera-pose-free scene reconstruction framework, Free-DyGS, tailored for dynamic surgical videos, leveraging 3D Gaussian splatting technology. Our approach employs a frame-by-frame reconstruction strategy and is delineated into four distinct phases: Scene Initialization, Joint Learning, Scene Expansion, and Retrospective Learning. We introduce a Generalizable Gaussians Parameterization module within the Scene Initialization and Expansion phases to proficiently generate Gaussian attributes for each pixel from the RGBD frames. The Joint Learning phase is crafted to concurrently deduce scene deformation and camera pose, facilitated by an innovative flexible deformation module. In the scene expansion stage, the Gaussian points gradually grow as the camera moves. The Retrospective Learning phase is dedicated to enhancing the precision of scene deformation through the reassessment of prior frames. The efficacy of the proposed Free-DyGS is substantiated through experiments on two datasets: the StereoMIS and Hamlyn datasets. The experimental outcomes underscore that Free-DyGS surpasses conventional baseline models in both rendering fidelity and computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: This study presents a multi-modal multi-granularity tokenizer specifically designed for analyzing ancient Chinese scripts, focusing on the Chu bamboo slip (CBS) script used during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period (771-256 BCE) in Ancient China. Considering the complex hierarchical structure of ancient Chinese scripts, where a single character may be a combination of multiple sub-characters, our tokenizer first adopts character detection to locate character boundaries, and then conducts character recognition at both the character and sub-character levels. Moreover, to support the academic community, we have also assembled the first large-scale dataset of CBSs with over 100K annotated character image scans. On the part-of-speech tagging task built on our dataset, using our tokenizer gives a 5.5% relative improvement in F1-score compared to mainstream sub-word tokenizers. Our work not only aids in further investigations of the specific script but also has the potential to advance research on other forms of ancient Chinese scripts.

- **Summary**: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently advanced the field of deep learning due to their ability to learn continuous representations of signals without the need for large training datasets. Although INR methods have been studied for medical image super-resolution, their adaptability to localized priors in medical images has not been extensively explored. Medical images contain rich anatomical divisions that could provide valuable local prior information to enhance the accuracy and robustness of INRs. In this work, we propose a novel framework, referred to as the Semantically Conditioned INR (SeCo-INR), that conditions an INR using local priors from a medical image, enabling accurate model fitting and interpolation capabilities to achieve super-resolution. Our framework learns a continuous representation of the semantic segmentation features of a medical image and utilizes it to derive the optimal INR for each semantic region of the image. We tested our framework using several medical imaging modalities and achieved higher quantitative scores and more realistic super-resolution outputs compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: We explore Bird's-Eye View (BEV) generation, converting a BEV map into its corresponding multi-view street images. Valued for its unified spatial representation aiding multi-sensor fusion, BEV is pivotal for various autonomous driving applications. Creating accurate street-view images from BEV maps is essential for portraying complex traffic scenarios and enhancing driving algorithms. Concurrently, diffusion-based conditional image generation models have demonstrated remarkable outcomes, adept at producing diverse, high-quality, and condition-aligned results. Nonetheless, the training of these models demands substantial data and computational resources. Hence, exploring methods to fine-tune these advanced models, like Stable Diffusion, for specific conditional generation tasks emerges as a promising avenue. In this paper, we introduce a practical framework for generating images from a BEV layout. Our approach comprises two main components: the Neural View Transformation and the Street Image Generation. The Neural View Transformation phase converts the BEV map into aligned multi-view semantic segmentation maps by learning the shape correspondence between the BEV and perspective views. Subsequently, the Street Image Generation phase utilizes these segmentations as a condition to guide a fine-tuned latent diffusion model. This finetuning process ensures both view and style consistency. Our model leverages the generative capacity of large pretrained diffusion models within traffic contexts, effectively yielding diverse and condition-coherent street view images.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based techniques have been widely utilized for brain tumor segmentation using both single and multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. Most current studies focus on centralized training due to the intrinsic challenge of data sharing across clinics. To mitigate privacy concerns, researchers have introduced Federated Learning (FL) methods to brain tumor segmentation tasks. However, currently such methods are focusing on single modal MRI, with limited study on multi-modal MRI. The challenges include complex structure, large-scale parameters, and overfitting issues of the FL based methods using multi-modal MRI. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel multi-modal FL framework for brain tumor segmentation (Fed-MUnet) that is suitable for FL training. We evaluate our approach with the BraTS2022 datasets, which are publicly available. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves FL nature of distributed learning and privacy preserving. For the enhancing tumor, tumor core and whole tumor, the mean of five major metrics were 87.5%, 90.6% and 92.2%, respectively, which were higher than SOTA methods while preserving privacy. In terms of parameters count, quantity of floating-point operations (FLOPs) and inference, Fed-MUnet is Pareto optimal compared with the state-of-the-art segmentation backbone while achieves higher performance and tackles privacy issue.

- **Summary**: Inter-image association modeling is crucial for co-salient object detection. Despite satisfactory performance, previous methods still have limitations on sufficient inter-image association modeling. Because most of them focus on image feature optimization under the guidance of heuristically calculated raw inter-image associations. They directly rely on raw associations which are not reliable in complex scenarios, and their image feature optimization approach is not explicit for inter-image association modeling. To alleviate these limitations, this paper proposes a deep association learning strategy that deploys deep networks on raw associations to explicitly transform them into deep association features. Specifically, we first create hyperassociations to collect dense pixel-pair-wise raw associations and then deploys deep aggregation networks on them. We design a progressive association generation module for this purpose with additional enhancement of the hyperassociation calculation. More importantly, we propose a correspondence-induced association condensation module that introduces a pretext task, i.e. semantic correspondence estimation, to condense the hyperassociations for computational burden reduction and noise elimination. We also design an object-aware cycle consistency loss for high-quality correspondence estimations. Experimental results in three benchmark datasets demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our proposed method with various training settings.

- **Summary**: Improving the quality of underwater images is essential for advancing marine research and technology. This work introduces a sparsity-driven interpretable neural network (SINET) for the underwater image enhancement (UIE) task. Unlike pure deep learning methods, our network architecture is based on a novel channel-specific convolutional sparse coding (CCSC) model, ensuring good interpretability of the underlying image enhancement process. The key feature of SINET is that it estimates the salient features from the three color channels using three sparse feature estimation blocks (SFEBs). The architecture of SFEB is designed by unrolling an iterative algorithm for solving the $\ell_1$ regulaized convolutional sparse coding (CSC) problem. Our experiments show that SINET surpasses state-of-the-art PSNR value by $1.05$ dB with $3873$ times lower computational complexity.

- **Summary**: Locating manipulation maps, i.e., pixel-level annotation of forgery cues, is crucial for providing interpretable detection results in face forgery detection. Related learning objects have also been widely adopted as auxiliary tasks to improve the classification performance of detectors whereas they require comparisons between paired real and forged faces to obtain manipulation maps as supervision. This requirement restricts their applicability to unpaired faces and contradicts real-world scenarios. Moreover, the used comparison methods annotate all changed pixels, including noise introduced by compression and upsampling. Using such maps as supervision hinders the learning of exploitable cues and makes models prone to overfitting. To address these issues, we introduce a weakly supervised model in this paper, named Forgery Cue Discovery (FoCus), to locate forgery cues in unpaired faces. Unlike some detectors that claim to locate forged regions in attention maps, FoCus is designed to sidestep their shortcomings of capturing partial and inaccurate forgery cues. Specifically, we propose a classification attentive regions proposal module to locate forgery cues during classification and a complementary learning module to facilitate the learning of richer cues. The produced manipulation maps can serve as better supervision to enhance face forgery detectors. Visualization of the manipulation maps of the proposed FoCus exhibits superior interpretability and robustness compared to existing methods. Experiments on five datasets and four multi-task models demonstrate the effectiveness of FoCus in both in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations.

- **Summary**: Large language models demonstrate impressive performance on downstream tasks, yet requiring extensive resource consumption when fully fine-tuning all parameters. To mitigate this, Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies, such as LoRA, have been developed. In this paper, we delve into the concept of task-specific directions--critical for transitioning large models from pre-trained states to task-specific enhancements in PEFT. We propose a framework to clearly define these directions and explore their properties, and practical utilization challenges. We then introduce a novel approach, LoRA-Dash, which aims to maximize the impact of task-specific directions during the fine-tuning process, thereby enhancing model performance on targeted tasks. Extensive experiments have conclusively demonstrated the effectiveness of LoRA-Dash, and in-depth analyses further reveal the underlying mechanisms of LoRA-Dash.

- **Summary**: GPS-based vehicle localization and tracking suffers from unstable positional information commonly experienced in tunnel segments and in dense urban areas. Also, both Visual Odometry (VO) and Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) are susceptible to adverse weather conditions that causes occlusions or blur on the visual input. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for vehicle localization that uses street network based map information to correct drifting odometry estimates and intermittent GPS measurements especially, in adversarial scenarios such as driving in rain and tunnels. Specifically, our approach is a flexible fusion algorithm that integrates intermittent GPS, drifting IMU and VO estimates together with 2D map information for robust vehicle localization and tracking. We refer to our approach as Map-Fusion. We robustly evaluate our proposed approach on four geographically diverse datasets from different countries ranging across clear and rain weather conditions. These datasets also include challenging visual segments in tunnels and underpasses. We show that with the integration of the map information, our Map-Fusion algorithm reduces the error of the state-of-the-art VO and VIO approaches across all datasets. We also validate our proposed algorithm in a real-world environment and in real-time on a hardware constrained mobile robot. Map-Fusion achieved 2.46m error in clear weather and 6.05m error in rain weather for a 150m route.

- **Summary**: This paper explores higher-resolution video outpainting with extensive content generation. We point out common issues faced by existing methods when attempting to largely outpaint videos: the generation of low-quality content and limitations imposed by GPU memory. To address these challenges, we propose a diffusion-based method called \textit{Follow-Your-Canvas}. It builds upon two core designs. First, instead of employing the common practice of "single-shot" outpainting, we distribute the task across spatial windows and seamlessly merge them. It allows us to outpaint videos of any size and resolution without being constrained by GPU memory. Second, the source video and its relative positional relation are injected into the generation process of each window. It makes the generated spatial layout within each window harmonize with the source video. Coupling with these two designs enables us to generate higher-resolution outpainting videos with rich content while keeping spatial and temporal consistency. Follow-Your-Canvas excels in large-scale video outpainting, e.g., from 512X512 to 1152X2048 (9X), while producing high-quality and aesthetically pleasing results. It achieves the best quantitative results across various resolution and scale setups. The code is released on https://github.com/mayuelala/FollowYourCanvas

- **Summary**: Model Inversion (MI) is a type of privacy violation that focuses on reconstructing private training data through abusive exploitation of machine learning models. To defend against MI attacks, state-of-the-art (SOTA) MI defense methods rely on regularizations that conflict with the training loss, creating explicit tension between privacy protection and model utility.   In this paper, we present a new method to defend against MI attacks. Our method takes a new perspective and focuses on training data. Our idea is based on a novel insight on Random Erasing (RE), which has been applied in the past as a data augmentation technique to improve the model accuracy under occlusion. In our work, we instead focus on applying RE for degrading MI attack accuracy. Our key insight is that MI attacks require significant amount of private training data information encoded inside the model in order to reconstruct high-dimensional private images. Therefore, we propose to apply RE to reduce private information presented to the model during training. We show that this can lead to substantial degradation in MI reconstruction quality and attack accuracy. Meanwhile, natural accuracy of the model is only moderately affected.   Our method is very simple to implement and complementary to existing defense methods. Our extensive experiments of 23 setups demonstrate that our method can achieve SOTA performance in balancing privacy and utility of the models.

- **Summary**: Retinal image registration plays an important role in the ophthalmological diagnosis process. Since there exist variances in viewing angles and anatomical structures across different retinal images, keypoint-based approaches become the mainstream methods for retinal image registration thanks to their robustness and low latency. These methods typically assume the retinal surfaces are planar, and adopt feature matching to obtain the homography matrix that represents the global transformation between images. Yet, such a planar hypothesis inevitably introduces registration errors since retinal surface is approximately curved. This limitation is more prominent when registering image pairs with significant differences in viewing angles. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid registration framework called HybridRetina, which progressively registers retinal images with global and local deformable transformations. For that, we use a keypoint detector and a deformation network called GAMorph to estimate the global transformation and local deformable transformation, respectively. Specifically, we integrate multi-level pixel relation knowledge to guide the training of GAMorph. Additionally, we utilize an edge attention module that includes the geometric priors of the images, ensuring the deformation field focuses more on the vascular regions of clinical interest. Experiments on two widely-used datasets, FIRE and FLoRI21, show that our proposed HybridRetina significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in large-scale video-language models have shown significant potential for real-time planning and detailed interactions. However, their high computational demands and the scarcity of annotated datasets limit their practicality for academic researchers. In this work, we introduce VideoLLaMB, a novel framework that utilizes temporal memory tokens within bridge layers to allow for the encoding of entire video sequences alongside historical visual data, effectively preserving semantic continuity and enhancing model performance across various tasks. This approach includes recurrent memory tokens and a SceneTilling algorithm, which segments videos into independent semantic units to preserve semantic integrity. Empirically, VideoLLaMB significantly outstrips existing video-language models, demonstrating a 5.5 points improvement over its competitors across three VideoQA benchmarks, and 2.06 points on egocentric planning. Comprehensive results on the MVBench show that VideoLLaMB-7B achieves markedly better results than previous 7B models of same LLM. Remarkably, it maintains robust performance as PLLaVA even as video length increases up to 8 times. Besides, the frame retrieval results on our specialized Needle in a Video Haystack (NIAVH) benchmark, further validate VideoLLaMB's prowess in accurately identifying specific frames within lengthy videos. Our SceneTilling algorithm also enables the generation of streaming video captions directly, without necessitating additional training. In terms of efficiency, VideoLLaMB, trained on 16 frames, supports up to 320 frames on a single Nvidia A100 GPU with linear GPU memory scaling, ensuring both high performance and cost-effectiveness, thereby setting a new foundation for long-form video-language models in both academic and practical applications.

- **Summary**: Online Domain Adaptation (OnDA) is designed to handle unforeseeable domain changes at minimal cost that occur during the deployment of the model, lacking clear boundaries between the domain, such as sudden weather events. However, existing OnDA methods that rely solely on the model itself to adapt to the current domain often misidentify ambiguous classes amidst continuous domain shifts and pass on this erroneous knowledge to the next domain. To tackle this, we propose \textbf{RODASS}, a \textbf{R}obust \textbf{O}nline \textbf{D}omain \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{S}emantic \textbf{S}egmentation framework, which dynamically detects domain shifts and adjusts hyper-parameters to minimize training costs and error propagation. Specifically, we introduce the \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{A}mbiguous \textbf{P}atch \textbf{Mask} (\textbf{DAP Mask}) strategy, which dynamically selects highly disturbed regions and masks these regions, mitigating error accumulation in ambiguous classes and enhancing the model's robustness against external noise in dynamic natural environments. Additionally, we present the \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{S}ource \textbf{C}lass \textbf{Mix} (\textbf{DSC Mix}), a domain-aware mix method that augments target domain scenes with class-level source buffers, reducing the high uncertainty and noisy labels, thereby accelerating adaptation and offering a more efficient solution for online domain adaptation. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on widely used OnDA benchmarks while maintaining approximately 40 frames per second (FPS).

- **Summary**: Sign languages, used by around 70 million Deaf individuals globally, are visual languages that convey visual and contextual information. Current methods in vision-based sign language recognition (SLR) and translation (SLT) struggle with dialogue scenes due to limited dataset diversity and the neglect of contextually relevant information. To address these challenges, we introduce SCOPE (Sign language Contextual Processing with Embedding from LLMs), a novel context-aware vision-based SLR and SLT framework. For SLR, we utilize dialogue contexts through a multi-modal encoder to enhance gloss-level recognition. For subsequent SLT, we further fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) by incorporating prior conversational context. We also contribute a new sign language dataset that contains 72 hours of Chinese sign language videos in contextual dialogues across various scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SCOPE framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, including Phoenix-2014T, CSL-Daily, and our SCOPE dataset. Moreover, surveys conducted with participants from the Deaf community further validate the robustness and effectiveness of our approach in real-world applications. Both our dataset and code will be open-sourced to facilitate further research.

- **Summary**: Fashion image editing is a crucial tool for designers to convey their creative ideas by visualizing design concepts interactively. Current fashion image editing techniques, though advanced with multimodal prompts and powerful diffusion models, often struggle to accurately identify editing regions and preserve the desired garment texture detail. To address these challenges, we introduce a new multimodal fashion image editing architecture based on latent diffusion models, called Detail-Preserved Diffusion Models (DPDEdit). DPDEdit guides the fashion image generation of diffusion models by integrating text prompts, region masks, human pose images, and garment texture images. To precisely locate the editing region, we first introduce Grounded-SAM to predict the editing region based on the user's textual description, and then combine it with other conditions to perform local editing. To transfer the detail of the given garment texture into the target fashion image, we propose a texture injection and refinement mechanism. Specifically, this mechanism employs a decoupled cross-attention layer to integrate textual descriptions and texture images, and incorporates an auxiliary U-Net to preserve the high-frequency details of generated garment texture. Additionally, we extend the VITON-HD dataset using a multimodal large language model to generate paired samples with texture images and textual descriptions. Extensive experiments show that our DPDEdit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of image fidelity and coherence with the given multimodal inputs.

- **Summary**: Accurate real-time object detection enhances the safety of advanced driver-assistance systems, making it an essential component in driving scenarios. With the rapid development of deep learning technology, CNN-based YOLO real-time object detectors have gained significant attention. However, the local focus of CNNs results in performance bottlenecks. To further enhance detector performance, researchers have introduced Transformer-based self-attention mechanisms to leverage global receptive fields, but their quadratic complexity incurs substantial computational costs. Recently, Mamba, with its linear complexity, has made significant progress through global selective scanning. Inspired by Mamba's outstanding performance, we propose a novel object detector: DS MYOLO. This detector captures global feature information through a simplified selective scanning fusion block (SimVSS Block) and effectively integrates the network's deep features. Additionally, we introduce an efficient channel attention convolution (ECAConv) that enhances cross-channel feature interaction while maintaining low computational complexity. Extensive experiments on the CCTSDB 2021 and VLD-45 driving scenarios datasets demonstrate that DS MYOLO exhibits significant potential and competitive advantage among similarly scaled YOLO series real-time object detectors.

- **Summary**: We present a robust refinement method for estimating oriented normals from unstructured point clouds. In contrast to previous approaches that either suffer from high computational complexity or fail to achieve desirable accuracy, our novel framework incorporates sign orientation and data augmentation in the feature space to refine the initial oriented normals, striking a balance between efficiency and accuracy. To address the issue of noise-caused direction inconsistency existing in previous approaches, we introduce a new metric called the Chamfer Normal Distance, which faithfully minimizes the estimation error by correcting the annotated normal with the closest point found on the potentially clean point cloud. This metric not only tackles the challenge but also aids in network training and significantly enhances network robustness against noise. Moreover, we propose an innovative dual-parallel architecture that integrates Multi-scale Local Feature Aggregation and Hierarchical Geometric Information Fusion, which enables the network to capture intricate geometric details more effectively and notably reduces ambiguity in scale selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our method in both unoriented and oriented normal estimation tasks across synthetic and real-world datasets among indoor and outdoor scenarios.

- **Summary**: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection in computer vision is a crucial research area, with related benchmarks playing a vital role in assessing the generalizability of models and their applicability in real-world scenarios. However, existing OOD benchmarks in the literature suffer from two main limitations: (1) they often overlook semantic shift as a potential challenge, and (2) their scale is limited compared to the large datasets used to train modern models. To address these gaps, we introduce SOOD-ImageNet, a novel dataset comprising around 1.6M images across 56 classes, designed for common computer vision tasks such as image classification and semantic segmentation under OOD conditions, with a particular focus on the issue of semantic shift. We ensured the necessary scalability and quality by developing an innovative data engine that leverages the capabilities of modern vision-language models, complemented by accurate human checks. Through extensive training and evaluation of various models on SOOD-ImageNet, we showcase its potential to significantly advance OOD research in computer vision.

- **Summary**: We present a novel approach for synthesizing 3D facial motions from audio sequences using key motion embeddings. Despite recent advancements in data-driven techniques, accurately mapping between audio signals and 3D facial meshes remains challenging. Direct regression of the entire sequence often leads to over-smoothed results due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. To this end, we propose a progressive learning mechanism that generates 3D facial animations by introducing key motion capture to decrease cross-modal mapping uncertainty and learning complexity. Concretely, our method integrates linguistic and data-driven priors through two modules: the linguistic-based key motion acquisition and the cross-modal motion completion. The former identifies key motions and learns the associated 3D facial expressions, ensuring accurate lip-speech synchronization. The latter extends key motions into a full sequence of 3D talking faces guided by audio features, improving temporal coherence and audio-visual consistency. Extensive experimental comparisons against existing state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach in generating more vivid and consistent talking face animations. Consistent enhancements in results through the integration of our proposed learning scheme with existing methods underscore the efficacy of our approach.

- **Summary**: Federated Class Continual Learning (FCCL) merges the challenges of distributed client learning with the need for seamless adaptation to new classes without forgetting old ones. The key challenge in FCCL is catastrophic forgetting, an issue that has been explored to some extent in Continual Learning (CL). However, due to privacy preservation requirements, some conventional methods, such as experience replay, are not directly applicable to FCCL. Existing FCCL methods mitigate forgetting by generating historical data through federated training of GANs or data-free knowledge distillation. However, these approaches often suffer from unstable training of generators or low-quality generated data, limiting their guidance for the model. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method of data replay based on diffusion models. Instead of training a diffusion model, we employ a pre-trained conditional diffusion model to reverse-engineer each class, searching the corresponding input conditions for each class within the model's input space, significantly reducing computational resources and time consumption while ensuring effective generation. Furthermore, we enhance the classifier's domain generalization ability on generated and real data through contrastive learning, indirectly improving the representational capability of generated data for real data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/jinglin-liang/DDDR.

- **Summary**: Monocular depth estimation is a critical function in computer vision applications. This paper shows that large language models (LLMs) can effectively interpret depth with minimal supervision, using efficient resource utilization and a consistent neural network architecture. We introduce LLM-MDE, a multimodal framework that deciphers depth through language comprehension. Specifically, LLM-MDE employs two main strategies to enhance the pretrained LLM's capability for depth estimation: cross-modal reprogramming and an adaptive prompt estimation module. These strategies align vision representations with text prototypes and automatically generate prompts based on monocular images, respectively. Comprehensive experiments on real-world MDE datasets confirm the effectiveness and superiority of LLM-MDE, which excels in few-/zero-shot tasks while minimizing resource use.

- **Summary**: Generative deep learning architectures can produce realistic, high-resolution fake imagery -- with potentially drastic societal implications. A key question in this context is: How easy is it to generate realistic imagery, in particular for niche domains. The iterative process required to achieve specific image content is difficult to automate and control. Especially for rare classes, it remains difficult to assess fidelity, meaning whether generative approaches produce realistic imagery and alignment, meaning how (well) the generation can be guided by human input. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical evaluation of generative architectures which we fine-tuned to generate synthetic satellite imagery. We focus on nuclear power plants as an example of a rare object category - as there are only around 400 facilities worldwide, this restriction is exemplary for many other scenarios in which training and test data is limited by the restricted number of occurrences of real-world examples. We generate synthetic imagery by conditioning on two kinds of modalities, textual input and image input obtained from a game engine that allows for detailed specification of the building layout. The generated images are assessed by commonly used metrics for automatic evaluation and then compared with human judgement from our conducted user studies to assess their trustworthiness. Our results demonstrate that even for rare objects, generation of authentic synthetic satellite imagery with textual or detailed building layouts is feasible. In line with previous work, we find that automated metrics are often not aligned with human perception -- in fact, we find strong negative correlations between commonly used image quality metrics and human ratings.

- **Summary**: Growth, abnormal behavior, and diseases of fish can be early detected by monitoring fish tracking through the method of image processing, which is of great significance for factory aquaculture. However, underwater reflections and some reasons with fish, such as the high similarity , rapid swimming caused by stimuli and multi-object occlusion bring challenges to multi-target tracking of fish. To address these challenges, this paper establishes a complex multi-scene sturgeon tracking dataset and proposes a real-time end-to-end fish tracking model, FMRFT. In this model, the Mamba In Mamba (MIM) architecture with low memory consumption is introduced into the tracking algorithm to realize multi-frame video timing memory and fast feature extraction, which improves the efficiency of correlation analysis for contiguous frames in multi-fish video. Additionally, the superior feature interaction and a priori frame processing capabilities of RT-DETR are leveraged to provide an effective tracking algorithm. By incorporating the QTSI query interaction processing module, the model effectively handles occluded objects and redundant tracking frames, resulting in more accurate and stable fish tracking. Trained and tested on the dataset, the model achieves an IDF1 score of 90.3% and a MOTA accuracy of 94.3%. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FMRFT model effectively addresses the challenges of high similarity and mutual occlusion in fish populations, enabling accurate tracking in factory farming environments.

- **Summary**: Hallucination is a common issue in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet the underlying principles remain poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate which components of MLLMs contribute to object hallucinations. To analyze image representations while completely avoiding the influence of all other factors other than the image representation itself, we propose a parametric-free representation alignment metric (Pfram) that can measure the similarities between any two representation systems without requiring additional training parameters. Notably, Pfram can also assess the alignment of a neural representation system with the human representation system, represented by ground-truth annotations of images. By evaluating the alignment with object annotations, we demonstrate that this metric shows strong and consistent correlations with object hallucination across a wide range of state-of-the-art MLLMs, spanning various model architectures and sizes. Furthermore, using this metric, we explore other key issues related to image representations in MLLMs, such as the role of different modules, the impact of textual instructions, and potential improvements including the use of alternative visual encoders.

- **Summary**: Most text-video retrieval methods utilize the text-image pre-trained CLIP as a backbone, incorporating complex modules that result in high computational overhead. As a result, many studies focus on efficient fine-tuning. The primary challenge in efficient adaption arises from the inherent differences between image and video modalities. Each sampled video frame must be processed by the image encoder independently, which increases complexity and complicates practical deployment. Although existing efficient methods fine-tune with small trainable parameters, they still incur high inference costs due to the large token number. In this work, we argue that temporal redundancy significantly contributes to the model's high complexity due to the repeated information in consecutive frames. Existing token compression methods for image models fail to solve the unique challenges, as they overlook temporal redundancy across frames. To tackle these problems, we propose Temporal Token Merging (TempMe) to reduce temporal redundancy. Specifically, we introduce a progressive multi-granularity framework. By gradually combining neighboring clips, we merge temporal tokens across different frames and learn video-level features, leading to lower complexity and better performance. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our TempMe. Compared to previous efficient text-video retrieval methods, TempMe significantly reduces output tokens by 95% and GFLOPs by 51%, while achieving a 1.8X speedup and a 4.4% R-Sum improvement. Additionally, TempMe exhibits robust generalization capabilities by integrating effectively with both efficient and full fine-tuning methods. With full fine-tuning, TempMe achieves a significant 7.9% R-Sum improvement, trains 1.57X faster, and utilizes 75.2% GPU memory usage. Our code will be released.

- **Summary**: Recently, multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) have achieved great success in many multimodal tasks, but their high computational costs limit their further promotion and application. In the MM-LLMs framework, the main computational consumption step is the processing of concatenated text and visual tokens at the LLM layer. The length of the input token for LLM directly affects the overall training and inference efficiency. In response to this issue, we further studied the visual tokens of MM-LLMs. We found that the similarity between visual and CLS tokens in the visual encoder follows a long-tail distribution. In other words, only a few visual tokens are highly similar to CLS tokens. Therefore, we designed a dynamic pruning algorithm to address this issue. Firstly, for different input samples, we search for the inflection point of their visual CLS token similarity curve and use it as the corresponding segmentation point to trim the visual markers. This process mainly reduces the output of the visual encoder to accelerate the model. Then, in the LLM layer, the concatenated visual text tokens are pruned for the second time. During this process, due to the interaction between visual and textual features, visual and textual tokens with low text correlation are further filtered, achieving a balance between efficiency and performance. The results on multiple datasets show that our proposed method can achieve performance that competes with the original performance when using an average of 22% of the original token quantity.

- **Summary**: Accurate calibration of camera intrinsic parameters is crucial to various computer vision-based applications in the fields of intelligent systems, autonomous vehicles, etc. However, existing calibration schemes are incompetent for finding general trend of the variation of camera parameters due to common physical changes. In this paper, it is demonstrated that major and minor variations due to changes in focal length and camera pose, respectively, can be identified with a recently proposed calibration method. It is readily observable from the experimental results that the former variations have different trends (directions) of principal point deviation for different types of camera, possibly due to different internal lens configurations, while the latter have very similar trends in the deviation which is most likely due to direction of gravity. Finally, to confirm the validity of such unprecedented findings, 3D to 2D reprojection errors are compared for different methods of camera calibration.

- **Summary**: The safe deployment of machine learning and AI models in open-world settings hinges critically on the ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) data accurately, data samples that contrast vastly from what the model was trained with. Current approaches to OOD detection often require further training the model, and/or statistics about the training data which may no longer be accessible. Additionally, many existing OOD detection methods struggle to maintain performance when transferred across different architectures. Our research tackles these issues by proposing a simple, post-hoc method that does not require access to the training data distribution, keeps a trained network intact, and holds strong performance across a variety of architectures. Our method, Logit Scaling (LTS), as the name suggests, simply scales the logits in a manner that effectively distinguishes between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. We tested our method on benchmarks across various scales, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet and OpenOOD. The experiments cover 3 ID and 14 OOD datasets, as well as 9 model architectures. Overall, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, robustness and adaptability across different architectures, paving the way towards a universally applicable solution for advanced OOD detection.

- **Summary**: With the advancement of large-scale language modeling techniques, large multimodal models combining visual encoders with large language models have demonstrated exceptional performance in various visual tasks. Most of the current large-scale multimodal models achieve this by mapping visual features obtained from the visual encoder into a large language model and using them as inputs alongside text for downstream tasks. Therefore, the number of visual tokens directly affects the training and inference speed of the model. There has been significant work on token pruning for visual transformers, but for large multimodal models, only relying on visual information for token pruning or compression may lead to significant loss of important information. On the other hand, the textual input in the form of a question may contain valuable information that can aid in answering the question, providing additional knowledge to the model. To address the potential oversimplification and excessive pruning that can occur with most purely visual token pruning methods, we propose a text information-guided dynamic visual token recovery mechanism that does not require training. This mechanism leverages the similarity between the question text and visual tokens to recover visually meaningful tokens with important text information while merging other less important tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable performance to the original approach while compressing the visual tokens to an average of 10% of the original quantity.

- **Summary**: The field of computer vision applied to videos of minimally invasive surgery is ever-growing. Workflow recognition pertains to the automated recognition of various aspects of a surgery: including which surgical steps are performed; and which surgical instruments are used. This information can later be used to assist clinicians when learning the surgery; during live surgery; and when writing operation notes. The Pituitary Vision (PitVis) 2023 Challenge tasks the community to step and instrument recognition in videos of endoscopic pituitary surgery. This is a unique task when compared to other minimally invasive surgeries due to the smaller working space, which limits and distorts vision; and higher frequency of instrument and step switching, which requires more precise model predictions. Participants were provided with 25-videos, with results presented at the MICCAI-2023 conference as part of the Endoscopic Vision 2023 Challenge in Vancouver, Canada, on 08-Oct-2023. There were 18-submissions from 9-teams across 6-countries, using a variety of deep learning models. A commonality between the top performing models was incorporating spatio-temporal and multi-task methods, with greater than 50% and 10% macro-F1-score improvement over purely spacial single-task models in step and instrument recognition respectively. The PitVis-2023 Challenge therefore demonstrates state-of-the-art computer vision models in minimally invasive surgery are transferable to a new dataset, with surgery specific techniques used to enhance performance, progressing the field further. Benchmark results are provided in the paper, and the dataset is publicly available at: https://doi.org/10.5522/04/26531686.

- **Summary**: This work evaluates the compression techniques on ConvNeXt models in image classification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Structured pruning, unstructured pruning, and dynamic quantization methods are evaluated to reduce model size and computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The experiments, conducted on cloud-based platforms and edge device, assess the performance of these techniques. Results show significant reductions in model size, with up to 75% reduction achieved using structured pruning techniques. Additionally, dynamic quantization achieves a reduction of up to 95% in the number of parameters. Fine-tuned models exhibit improved compression performance, indicating the benefits of pre-training in conjunction with compression techniques. Unstructured pruning methods reveal trends in accuracy and compression, with limited reductions in computational complexity. The combination of OTOV3 pruning and dynamic quantization further enhances compression performance, resulting 89.7% reduction in size, 95% reduction with number of parameters and MACs, and 3.8% increase with accuracy. The deployment of the final compressed model on edge device demonstrates high accuracy 92.5% and low inference time 20 ms, validating the effectiveness of compression techniques for real-world edge computing applications.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is a non-invasive method for depicting brain microstructure in vivo. Fiber orientation distributions (FODs) are mathematical representations extensively used to map white matter fiber configurations. Recently, FOD estimation with deep neural networks has seen growing success, in particular, those of neonates estimated with fewer diffusion measurements. These methods are mostly trained on target FODs reconstructed with multi-shell multi-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution (MSMT-CSD), which might not be the ideal ground truth for developing brains. Here, we investigate this hypothesis by training a state-of-the-art model based on the U-Net architecture on both MSMT-CSD and single-shell three-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution (SS3T-CSD). Our results suggest that SS3T-CSD might be more suited for neonatal brains, given that the ratio between single and multiple fiber-estimated voxels with SS3T-CSD is more realistic compared to MSMT-CSD. Additionally, increasing the number of input gradient directions significantly improves performance with SS3T-CSD over MSMT-CSD. Finally, in an age domain-shift setting, SS3T-CSD maintains robust performance across age groups, indicating its potential for more accurate neonatal brain imaging.

- **Summary**: Variational Autoencoder (VAE), compressing videos into latent representations, is a crucial preceding component of Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs). With the same reconstruction quality, the more sufficient the VAE's compression for videos is, the more efficient the LVDMs are. However, most LVDMs utilize 2D image VAE, whose compression for videos is only in the spatial dimension and often ignored in the temporal dimension. How to conduct temporal compression for videos in a VAE to obtain more concise latent representations while promising accurate reconstruction is seldom explored. To fill this gap, we propose an omni-dimension compression VAE, named OD-VAE, which can temporally and spatially compress videos. Although OD-VAE's more sufficient compression brings a great challenge to video reconstruction, it can still achieve high reconstructed accuracy by our fine design. To obtain a better trade-off between video reconstruction quality and compression speed, four variants of OD-VAE are introduced and analyzed. In addition, a novel tail initialization is designed to train OD-VAE more efficiently, and a novel inference strategy is proposed to enable OD-VAE to handle videos of arbitrary length with limited GPU memory. Comprehensive experiments on video reconstruction and LVDM-based video generation demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methods.

- **Summary**: With the rising demand for high-resolution (HR) images, No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) gains more attention, as it can ecaluate image quality in real-time on mobile devices and enhance user experience. However, existing NR-IQA methods often resize or crop the HR images into small resolution, which leads to a loss of important details. And most of them are of high computational complexity, which hinders their application on mobile devices due to limited computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose MobileIQA, a novel approach that utilizes lightweight backbones to efficiently assess image quality while preserving image details through high-resolution input. MobileIQA employs the proposed multi-view attention learning (MAL) module to capture diverse opinions, simulating subjective opinions provided by different annotators during the dataset annotation process. The model uses a teacher model to guide the learning of a student model through knowledge distillation. This method significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining high performance. Experiments demonstrate that MobileIQA outperforms novel IQA methods on evaluation metrics and computational efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/chencn2020/MobileIQA.

- **Summary**: Semantic recognition is pivotal in virtual reality (VR) applications, enabling immersive and interactive experiences. A promising approach is utilizing millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals to generate point clouds. However, the high computational and memory demands of current mmWave point cloud models hinder their efficiency and reliability. To address this limitation, our paper introduces ESP-PCT, a novel Enhanced Semantic Performance Point Cloud Transformer with a two-stage semantic recognition framework tailored for VR applications. ESP-PCT takes advantage of the accuracy of sensory point cloud data and optimizes the semantic recognition process, where the localization and focus stages are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate ESP-PCT on various VR semantic recognition conditions, demonstrating substantial enhancements in recognition efficiency. Notably, ESP-PCT achieves a remarkable accuracy of 93.2% while reducing the computational requirements (FLOPs) by 76.9% and memory usage by 78.2% compared to the existing Point Transformer model simultaneously. These underscore ESP-PCT's potential in VR semantic recognition by achieving high accuracy and reducing redundancy.

- **Summary**: Image retrieval is a crucial research topic in computer vision, with broad application prospects ranging from online product searches to security surveillance systems. In recent years, the accuracy and efficiency of image retrieval have significantly improved due to advancements in deep learning. However, existing methods still face numerous challenges, particularly in handling large-scale datasets, cross-domain retrieval, and image perturbations that can arise from real-world conditions such as variations in lighting, occlusion, and viewpoint. Data augmentation techniques and adversarial learning methods have been widely applied in the field of image retrieval to address these challenges. Data augmentation enhances the model's generalization ability and robustness by generating more diverse training samples, simulating real-world variations, and reducing overfitting. Meanwhile, adversarial attacks and defenses introduce perturbations during training to improve the model's robustness against potential attacks, ensuring reliability in practical applications. This review comprehensively summarizes the latest research advancements in image retrieval, with a particular focus on the roles of data augmentation and adversarial learning techniques in enhancing retrieval performance. Future directions and potential challenges are also discussed.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification involves assigning specific labels to each pixel to identify various land cover categories. Although deep classifiers have shown high predictive accuracy in this field, quantifying their uncertainty remains a significant challenge, which hinders their application in critical contexts. This study first theoretically evaluates the applicability of \textit{Conformal Prediction} (CP), an emerging technique for uncertainty quantification, in the context of HSI classification. We then propose a conformal procedure that provides HSI classifiers with trustworthy prediction sets, offering coverage guarantees that ensure these sets contain the true labels with a user-specified probability. Building on this foundation, we introduce \textit{Spatial-Aware Conformal Prediction} (\texttt{SACP}), which incorporates essential spatial information inherent in HSIs by aggregating non-conformity scores of pixels with high spatial correlation. Both theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that \texttt{SACP} outperforms standard CP in HSI classification. The source code is accessible at \url{https://github.com/J4ckLiu/SACP}.

- **Summary**: Recent work has proposed neural network pruning techniques to reduce the size of a network while preserving robustness against adversarial examples, i.e., well-crafted inputs inducing a misclassification. These methods, which we refer to as adversarial pruning methods, involve complex and articulated designs, making it difficult to analyze the differences and establish a fair and accurate comparison. In this work, we overcome these issues by surveying current adversarial pruning methods and proposing a novel taxonomy to categorize them based on two main dimensions: the pipeline, defining when to prune; and the specifics, defining how to prune. We then highlight the limitations of current empirical analyses and propose a novel, fair evaluation benchmark to address them. We finally conduct an empirical re-evaluation of current adversarial pruning methods and discuss the results, highlighting the shared traits of top-performing adversarial pruning methods, as well as common issues. We welcome contributions in our publicly-available benchmark at https://github.com/pralab/AdversarialPruningBenchmark

- **Summary**: The primary goal of traffic accident anticipation is to foresee potential accidents in real time using dashcam videos, a task that is pivotal for enhancing the safety and reliability of autonomous driving technologies. In this study, we introduce an innovative framework, AccNet, which significantly advances the prediction capabilities beyond the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) 2D-based methods by incorporating monocular depth cues for sophisticated 3D scene modeling. Addressing the prevalent challenge of skewed data distribution in traffic accident datasets, we propose the Binary Adaptive Loss for Early Anticipation (BA-LEA). This novel loss function, together with a multi-task learning strategy, shifts the focus of the predictive model towards the critical moments preceding an accident. {We rigorously evaluate the performance of our framework on three benchmark datasets--Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D), and DADA-2000 Dataset--demonstrating its superior predictive accuracy through key metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and mean Time-To-Accident (mTTA).

- **Summary**: Video deblurring aims at recovering sharp details from a sequence of blurry frames. Despite the proliferation of depth sensors in mobile phones and the potential of depth information to guide deblurring, depth-aware deblurring has received only limited attention. In this work, we introduce the 'Depth-Aware VIdeo DEblurring' (DAVIDE) dataset to study the impact of depth information in video deblurring. The dataset comprises synchronized blurred, sharp, and depth videos. We investigate how the depth information should be injected into the existing deep RGB video deblurring models, and propose a strong baseline for depth-aware video deblurring. Our findings reveal the significance of depth information in video deblurring and provide insights into the use cases where depth cues are beneficial. In addition, our results demonstrate that while the depth improves deblurring performance, this effect diminishes when models are provided with a longer temporal context.

- **Summary**: Depth estimation plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle's 3D surroundings. Radar, with its robustness to adverse weather conditions and capability to measure distances, has drawn significant interest for radar-camera depth estimation. However, existing algorithms process the inherently noisy and sparse radar data by projecting 3D points onto the image plane for pixel-level feature extraction, overlooking the valuable geometric information contained within the radar point cloud. To address this gap, we propose GET-UP, leveraging attention-enhanced Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to exchange and aggregate both 2D and 3D information from radar data. This approach effectively enriches the feature representation by incorporating spatial relationships compared to traditional methods that rely only on 2D feature extraction. Furthermore, we incorporate a point cloud upsampling task to densify the radar point cloud, rectify point positions, and derive additional 3D features under the guidance of lidar data. Finally, we fuse radar and camera features during the decoding phase for depth estimation. We benchmark our proposed GET-UP on the nuScenes dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a 15.3% and 14.7% improvement in MAE and RMSE over the previously best-performing model.

- **Summary**: To improve storage and transmission, images are generally compressed. Vector quantization (VQ) is a popular compression method as it has a high compression ratio that suppresses other compression techniques. Despite this, existing adversarial attack methods on image classification are mostly performed in the pixel domain with few exceptions in the compressed domain, making them less applicable in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel one-index attack method in the VQ domain to generate adversarial images by a differential evolution algorithm, successfully resulting in image misclassification in victim models. The one-index attack method modifies a single index in the compressed data stream so that the decompressed image is misclassified. It only needs to modify a single VQ index to realize an attack, which limits the number of perturbed indexes. The proposed method belongs to a semi-black-box attack, which is more in line with the actual attack scenario. We apply our method to attack three popular image classification models, i.e., Resnet, NIN, and VGG16. On average, 55.9% and 77.4% of the images in CIFAR-10 and Fashion MNIST, respectively, are successfully attacked, with a high level of misclassification confidence and a low level of image perturbation.

- **Summary**: The evaluation of image generators remains a challenge due to the limitations of traditional metrics in providing nuanced insights into specific image regions. This is a critical problem as not all regions of an image may be learned with similar ease. In this work, we propose a novel approach to disentangle the cosine similarity of mean embeddings into the product of cosine similarities for individual pixel clusters via central kernel alignment. Consequently, we can quantify the contribution of the cluster-wise performance to the overall image generation performance. We demonstrate how this enhances the explainability and the likelihood of identifying pixel regions of model misbehavior across various real-world use cases.

- **Summary**: In realistic medical settings, the data are often inherently long-tailed, with most samples concentrated in a few classes and a long tail of rare classes, usually containing just a few samples. This distribution presents a significant challenge because rare conditions are critical to detect and difficult to classify due to limited data. In this paper, rather than attempting to classify rare classes, we aim to detect these as out-of-distribution data reliably. We leverage low-rank adaption (LoRA) and diffusion guidance to generate targeted synthetic data for the detection problem. We significantly improve the OOD detection performance on a challenging histopathological task with only ten samples per tail class without losing classification accuracy on the head classes.

- **Summary**: Despite recent advances in large-scale text-to-image generative models, manipulating real images with these models remains a challenging problem. The main limitations of existing editing methods are that they either fail to perform with consistent quality on a wide range of image edits or require time-consuming hyperparameter tuning or fine-tuning of the diffusion model to preserve the image-specific appearance of the input image. We propose a novel approach that is built upon a modified diffusion sampling process via the guidance mechanism. In this work, we explore the self-guidance technique to preserve the overall structure of the input image and its local regions appearance that should not be edited. In particular, we explicitly introduce layout-preserving energy functions that are aimed to save local and global structures of the source image. Additionally, we propose a noise rescaling mechanism that allows to preserve noise distribution by balancing the norms of classifier-free guidance and our proposed guiders during generation. Such a guiding approach does not require fine-tuning the diffusion model and exact inversion process. As a result, the proposed method provides a fast and high-quality editing mechanism. In our experiments, we show through human evaluation and quantitative analysis that the proposed method allows to produce desired editing which is more preferable by humans and also achieves a better trade-off between editing quality and preservation of the original image.

- **Summary**: Recent text-to-image models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality images. However, when tasked with multi-concept generation which creates images containing multiple characters or objects, existing methods often suffer from attribute confusion, resulting in severe text-image inconsistency. We found that attribute confusion occurs when a certain region of the latent features attend to multiple or incorrect prompt tokens. In this work, we propose novel Semantic Protection Diffusion (SPDiffusion) to protect the semantics of regions from the influence of irrelevant tokens, eliminating the confusion of non-corresponding attributes. In the SPDiffusion framework, we design a Semantic Protection Mask (SP-Mask) to represent the relevance of the regions and the tokens, and propose a Semantic Protection Cross-Attention (SP-Attn) to shield the influence of irrelevant tokens on specific regions in the generation process. To evaluate our method, we created a diverse multi-concept benchmark, and SPDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art results on this benchmark, proving its effectiveness. Our method can be combined with many other application methods or backbones, such as ControlNet, Story Diffusion, PhotoMaker and PixArt-alpha to enhance their multi-concept capabilities, demonstrating strong compatibility and scalability.

- **Summary**: Machine Learning (ML) is crucial in many sectors, including computer vision. However, ML models trained on sensitive data face security challenges, as they can be attacked and leak information. Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) addresses this by using Differential Privacy (DP) to balance utility and privacy. This study identifies image dataset characteristics that affect the utility and vulnerability of private and non-private Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. Through analyzing multiple datasets and privacy budgets, we find that imbalanced datasets increase vulnerability in minority classes, but DP mitigates this issue. Datasets with fewer classes improve both model utility and privacy, while high entropy or low Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) datasets deteriorate the utility-privacy trade-off. These insights offer valuable guidance for practitioners and researchers in estimating and optimizing the utility-privacy trade-off in image datasets, helping to inform data and privacy modifications for better outcomes based on dataset characteristics.

- **Summary**: Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors in children and young adults, but the scarcity of large histopathology datasets has limited the application of computational pathology in this group. This study implements two weakly supervised multiple-instance learning (MIL) approaches on patch-features obtained from state-of-the-art histology-specific foundation models to classify pediatric brain tumors in hematoxylin and eosin whole slide images (WSIs) from a multi-center Swedish cohort. WSIs from 540 subjects (age 8.5$\pm$4.9 years) diagnosed with brain tumor were gathered from the six Swedish university hospitals. Instance (patch)-level features were obtained from WSIs using three pre-trained feature extractors: ResNet50, UNI and CONCH. Instances were aggregated using attention-based MIL (ABMIL) or clustering-constrained attention MIL (CLAM) for patient-level classification. Models were evaluated on three classification tasks based on the hierarchical classification of pediatric brain tumors: tumor category, family and type. Model generalization was assessed by training on data from two of the centers and testing on data from four other centers. Model interpretability was evaluated through attention-mapping. The highest classification performance was achieved using UNI features and AMBIL aggregation, with Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.86$\pm$0.04, 0.63$\pm$0.04, and 0.53$\pm$0.05, for tumor category, family and type classification, respectively. When evaluating generalization, models utilizing UNI and CONCH features outperformed those using ResNet50. However, the drop in performance from the in-site to out-of-site testing was similar across feature extractors. These results show the potential of state-of-the-art computational pathology methods in diagnosing pediatric brain tumors at different hierarchical levels with fair generalizability on a multi-center national dataset.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks often encounter significant performance drops while facing with domain shifts between training (source) and test (target) data. To address this issue, Test Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have been proposed to adapt pre-trained source model to handle out-of-distribution streaming target data. Although these methods offer some relief, they lack a reliable mechanism for domain shift correction, which can often be erratic in real-world applications. In response, we develop Few-Shot Test Time Adaptation (FS-TTA), a novel and practical setting that utilizes a few-shot support set on top of TTA. Adhering to the principle of few inputs, big gains, FS-TTA reduces blind exploration in unseen target domains. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage framework to tackle FS-TTA, including (i) fine-tuning the pre-trained source model with few-shot support set, along with using feature diversity augmentation module to avoid overfitting, (ii) implementing test time adaptation based on prototype memory bank guidance to produce high quality pseudo-label for model adaptation. Through extensive experiments on three cross-domain classification benchmarks, we demonstrate the superior performance and reliability of our FS-TTA and framework.

- **Summary**: Consistency distillation methods have demonstrated significant success in accelerating generative tasks of diffusion models. However, since previous consistency distillation methods use simple and straightforward strategies in selecting target timesteps, they usually struggle with blurs and detail losses in generated images. To address these limitations, we introduce Target-Driven Distillation (TDD), which (1) adopts a delicate selection strategy of target timesteps, increasing the training efficiency; (2) utilizes decoupled guidances during training, making TDD open to post-tuning on guidance scale during inference periods; (3) can be optionally equipped with non-equidistant sampling and x0 clipping, enabling a more flexible and accurate way for image sampling. Experiments verify that TDD achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-step generation, offering a better choice among consistency distillation models.

In this study, we investigate the potential of generative machine learning models for creating design rule legal metal layout patterns. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model can generate legal patterns in complex design rule settings and achieves a high diversity score. The designed system, with its flexible settings, supports both pattern generation with localized changes, and design rule violation correction. Our methodology is validated on Intel 18A Process Design Kit (PDK) and can produce a wide range of DRC-compliant pattern libraries with only 20 starter patterns.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical transformer-based model designed for sophisticated image segmentation tasks, effectively bridging the granularity of part segmentation with the comprehensive scope of object segmentation. At the heart of our approach is a multi-level representation strategy, which systematically advances from individual pixels to superpixels, and ultimately to cohesive group formations. This architecture is underpinned by two pivotal aggregation strategies: local aggregation and global aggregation. Local aggregation is employed to form superpixels, leveraging the inherent redundancy of the image data to produce segments closely aligned with specific parts of the object, guided by object-level supervision. In contrast, global aggregation interlinks these superpixels, organizing them into larger groups that correlate with entire objects and benefit from part-level supervision. This dual aggregation framework ensures a versatile adaptation to varying supervision inputs while maintaining computational efficiency.   Our methodology notably improves the balance between adaptability across different supervision modalities and computational manageability, culminating in significant enhancement in segmentation performance. When tested on the PartImageNet dataset, our model achieves a substantial increase, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 2.8% and 0.8% in mIoU scores for part and object segmentation, respectively. Similarly, on the Pascal Part dataset, it records performance enhancements of 1.5% and 2.0% for part and object segmentation, respectively.

- **Summary**: Much previous AI research has focused on developing monolithic models to maximize their intelligence and capability, with the primary goal of enhancing performance on specific tasks. In contrast, this paper explores an alternative approach: collaborative AI systems that use workflows to integrate models, data sources, and pipelines to solve complex and diverse tasks. We introduce GenAgent, an LLM-based framework that automatically generates complex workflows, offering greater flexibility and scalability compared to monolithic models. The core innovation of GenAgent lies in representing workflows with code, alongside constructing workflows with collaborative agents in a step-by-step manner. We implement GenAgent on the ComfyUI platform and propose a new benchmark, OpenComfy. The results demonstrate that GenAgent outperforms baseline approaches in both run-level and task-level evaluations, showing its capability to generate complex workflows with superior effectiveness and stability.

- **Summary**: Differentiable rendering is a key ingredient for inverse rendering and machine learning, as it allows to optimize scene parameters (shape, materials, lighting) to best fit target images. Differentiable rendering requires that each scene parameter relates to pixel values through differentiable operations. While 3D mesh rendering algorithms have been implemented in a differentiable way, these algorithms do not directly extend to Constructive-Solid-Geometry (CSG), a popular parametric representation of shapes, because the underlying boolean operations are typically performed with complex black-box mesh-processing libraries. We present an algorithm, DiffCSG, to render CSG models in a differentiable manner. Our algorithm builds upon CSG rasterization, which displays the result of boolean operations between primitives without explicitly computing the resulting mesh and, as such, bypasses black-box mesh processing. We describe how to implement CSG rasterization within a differentiable rendering pipeline, taking special care to apply antialiasing along primitive intersections to obtain gradients in such critical areas. Our algorithm is simple and fast, can be easily incorporated into modern machine learning setups, and enables a range of applications for computer-aided design, including direct and image-based editing of CSG primitives.

- **Summary**: In visual Reinforcement Learning (RL), learning from pixel-based observations poses significant challenges on sample efficiency, primarily due to the complexity of extracting informative state representations from high-dimensional data. Previous methods such as contrastive-based approaches have made strides in improving sample efficiency but fall short in modeling the nuanced evolution of states. To address this, we introduce MOOSS, a novel framework that leverages a temporal contrastive objective with the help of graph-based spatial-temporal masking to explicitly model state evolution in visual RL. Specifically, we propose a self-supervised dual-component strategy that integrates (1) a graph construction of pixel-based observations for spatial-temporal masking, coupled with (2) a multi-level contrastive learning mechanism that enriches state representations by emphasizing temporal continuity and change of states. MOOSS advances the understanding of state dynamics by disrupting and learning from spatial-temporal correlations, which facilitates policy learning. Our comprehensive evaluation on multiple continuous and discrete control benchmarks shows that MOOSS outperforms previous state-of-the-art visual RL methods in terms of sample efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

Our study addresses the need for automated solutions without relying on large amounts of labeled data. We propose a novel application of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for sewer inspection that offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for defect detection. We achieve competitive results with a model that is at least 5 times smaller than other approaches found in the literature and obtain competitive performance with 10\% of the available data when training with a larger architecture. Our findings highlight the potential of SSL to revolutionize sewer maintenance in resource-limited settings.

- **Summary**: Temporal video alignment aims to synchronize the key events like object interactions or action phase transitions in two videos. Such methods could benefit various video editing, processing, and understanding tasks. However, existing approaches operate under the restrictive assumption that a suitable video pair for alignment is given, significantly limiting their broader applicability. To address this, we re-pose temporal alignment as a search problem and introduce the task of Alignable Video Retrieval (AVR). Given a query video, our approach can identify well-alignable videos from a large collection of clips and temporally synchronize them to the query. To achieve this, we make three key contributions: 1) we introduce DRAQ, a video alignability indicator to identify and re-rank the best alignable video from a set of candidates; 2) we propose an effective and generalizable frame-level video feature design to improve the alignment performance of several off-the-shelf feature representations, and 3) we propose a novel benchmark and evaluation protocol for AVR using cycle-consistency metrics. Our experiments on 3 datasets, including large-scale Kinetics700, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in identifying alignable video pairs from diverse datasets.

- **Summary**: Real-life applications of action recognition often require a fine-grained understanding of subtle movements, e.g., in sports analytics, user interactions in AR/VR, and surgical videos. Although fine-grained actions are more costly to annotate, existing semi-supervised action recognition has mainly focused on coarse-grained action recognition. Since fine-grained actions are more challenging due to the absence of scene bias, classifying these actions requires an understanding of action-phases. Hence, existing coarse-grained semi-supervised methods do not work effectively. In this work, we for the first time thoroughly investigate semi-supervised fine-grained action recognition (FGAR). We observe that alignment distances like dynamic time warping (DTW) provide a suitable action-phase-aware measure for comparing fine-grained actions, a concept previously unexploited in FGAR. However, since regular DTW distance is pairwise and assumes strict alignment between pairs, it is not directly suitable for classifying fine-grained actions. To utilize such alignment distances in a limited-label setting, we propose an Alignability-Verification-based Metric learning technique to effectively discriminate between fine-grained action pairs. Our learnable alignability score provides a better phase-aware measure, which we use to refine the pseudo-labels of the primary video encoder. Our collaborative pseudo-labeling-based framework `\textit{FinePseudo}' significantly outperforms prior methods on four fine-grained action recognition datasets: Diving48, FineGym99, FineGym288, and FineDiving, and shows improvement on existing coarse-grained datasets: Kinetics400 and Something-SomethingV2. We also demonstrate the robustness of our collaborative pseudo-labeling in handling novel unlabeled classes in open-world semi-supervised setups.

- **Summary**: Laryngeal cancer is a malignant disease with a high morality rate in otorhinolaryngology, posing an significant threat to human health. Traditionally larygologists manually visual-inspect laryngeal cancer in laryngoscopic videos, which is quite time-consuming and subjective. In this study, we propose a novel automatic framework via 3D-large-scale pretrained models termed 3D-LSPTM for laryngeal cancer detection. Firstly, we collect 1,109 laryngoscopic videos from the First Affiliated Hospital Sun Yat-sen University with the approval of the Ethics Committee. Then we utilize the 3D-large-scale pretrained models of C3D, TimeSformer, and Video-Swin-Transformer, with the merit of advanced featuring videos, for laryngeal cancer detection with fine-tuning techniques. Extensive experiments show that our proposed 3D-LSPTM can achieve promising performance on the task of laryngeal cancer detection. Particularly, 3D-LSPTM with the backbone of Video-Swin-Transformer can achieve 92.4% accuracy, 95.6% sensitivity, 94.1% precision, and 94.8% F_1.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised image segmentation (WSSS) from image tags remains challenging due to its under-constraint nature. Most mainstream work focus on the extraction of class activation map (CAM) and imposing various additional regularization. Contrary to the mainstream, we propose to frame WSSS as a problem of reconstruction from decomposition of the image using its mask, under which most regularization are embedded implicitly within the framework of the new problem. Our approach has demonstrated promising results on initial experiments, and shown robustness against the problem of background ambiguity.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present a novel method for extensive multi-scale generative terrain modeling. At the core of our model is a cascade of superresolution diffusion models that can be combined to produce consistent images across multiple resolutions. Pairing this concept with a tiled generation method yields a scalable system that can generate thousands of square kilometers of realistic Earth surfaces at high resolution. We evaluate our method on a dataset collected from Bing Maps and show that it outperforms super-resolution baselines on the extreme super-resolution task of 1024x zoom. We also demonstrate its ability to create diverse and coherent scenes via an interactive gigapixel-scale generated map. Finally, we demonstrate how our system can be extended to enable novel content creation applications including controllable world generation and 3D scene generation.

- **Summary**: We consider the problem of distinguishing two vectors (visualized as images or barcodes) and learning if they are related to one another. For this, we develop a geometric quantum machine learning (GQML) approach with embedded symmetries that allows for the classification of similar and dissimilar pairs based on global correlations, and enables generalization from just a few samples. Unlike GQML algorithms developed to date, we propose to focus on symmetry-aware measurement adaptation that outperforms unitary parametrizations. We compare GQML for similarity testing against classical deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks with Siamese architectures. We show that quantum networks largely outperform their classical counterparts. We explain this difference in performance by analyzing correlated distributions used for composing our dataset. We relate the similarity testing with problems that showcase a proven maximal separation between the BQP complexity class and the polynomial hierarchy. While the ability to achieve advantage largely depends on how data are loaded, we discuss how similar problems can benefit from quantum machine learning.

- **Summary**: The visible-light camera, which is capable of environment perception and navigation assistance, has emerged as an essential imaging sensor for marine surface vessels in intelligent waterborne transportation systems (IWTS). However, the visual imaging quality inevitably suffers from several kinds of degradations (e.g., limited visibility, low contrast, color distortion, etc.) under complex weather conditions (e.g., haze, rain, and low-lightness). The degraded visual information will accordingly result in inaccurate environment perception and delayed operations for navigational risk. To promote the navigational safety of vessels, many computational methods have been presented to perform visual quality enhancement under poor weather conditions. However, most of these methods are essentially specific-purpose implementation strategies, only available for one specific weather type. To overcome this limitation, we propose to develop a general-purpose multi-scene visibility enhancement method, i.e., edge reparameterization- and attention-guided neural network (ERANet), to adaptively restore the degraded images captured under different weather conditions. In particular, our ERANet simultaneously exploits the channel attention, spatial attention, and reparameterization technology to enhance the visual quality while maintaining low computational cost. Extensive experiments conducted on standard and IWTS-related datasets have demonstrated that our ERANet could outperform several representative visibility enhancement methods in terms of both imaging quality and computational efficiency. The superior performance of IWTS-related object detection and scene segmentation could also be steadily obtained after ERANet-based visibility enhancement under complex weather conditions.

- **Summary**: Human video generation task has gained significant attention with the advancement of deep generative models. Generating realistic videos with human movements is challenging in nature, due to the intricacies of human body topology and sensitivity to visual artifacts. The extensively studied 2D media generation methods take advantage of massive human media datasets, but struggle with 3D-aware control; whereas 3D avatar-based approaches, while offering more freedom in control, lack photorealism and cannot be harmonized seamlessly with background scene. We propose AMG, a method that combines the 2D photorealism and 3D controllability by conditioning video diffusion models on controlled rendering of 3D avatars. We additionally introduce a novel data processing pipeline that reconstructs and renders human avatar movements from dynamic camera videos. AMG is the first method that enables multi-person diffusion video generation with precise control over camera positions, human motions, and background style. We also demonstrate through extensive evaluation that it outperforms existing human video generation methods conditioned on pose sequences or driving videos in terms of realism and adaptability.
