- **Summary**: Diffusion models have recently surpassed GANs in image synthesis and editing, offering superior image quality and diversity. However, achieving precise control over attributes in generated images remains a challenge. Concept Sliders introduced a method for fine-grained image control and editing by learning concepts (attributes/objects). However, this approach adds parameters and increases inference time due to the loading and unloading of Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) used for learning concepts. These adapters are model-specific and require retraining for different architectures, such as Stable Diffusion (SD) v1.5 and SD-XL. In this paper, we propose a straightforward textual inversion method to learn concepts through text embeddings, which are generalizable across models that share the same text encoder, including different versions of the SD model. We refer to our method as Prompt Sliders. Besides learning new concepts, we also show that Prompt Sliders can be used to erase undesirable concepts such as artistic styles or mature content. Our method is 30% faster than using LoRAs because it eliminates the need to load and unload adapters and introduces no additional parameters aside from the target concept text embedding. Each concept embedding only requires 3KB of storage compared to the 8922KB or more required for each LoRA adapter, making our approach more computationally efficient.

- **Summary**: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging problem in object detection, where a pre-trained source model is adapted to a new target domain without using any source domain data for privacy and efficiency reasons. Most state-of-the-art SFDA methods for object detection have been proposed for Faster-RCNN, a detector that is known to have high computational complexity. This paper focuses on domain adaptation techniques for real-world vision systems, particularly for the YOLO family of single-shot detectors known for their fast baselines and practical applications. Our proposed SFDA method - Source-Free YOLO (SF-YOLO) - relies on a teacher-student framework in which the student receives images with a learned, target domain-specific augmentation, allowing the model to be trained with only unlabeled target data and without requiring feature alignment. A challenge with self-training using a mean-teacher architecture in the absence of labels is the rapid decline of accuracy due to noisy or drifting pseudo-labels. To address this issue, a teacher-to-student communication mechanism is introduced to help stabilize the training and reduce the reliance on annotated target data for model selection. Despite its simplicity, our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art detectors on several challenging benchmark datasets, even sometimes outperforming methods that use source data for adaptation.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the Robotics field has initiated several efforts toward building generalist robot policies through large-scale multi-task Behavior Cloning. However, direct deployments of these policies have led to unsatisfactory performance, where the policy struggles with unseen states and tasks. How can we break through the performance plateau of these models and elevate their capabilities to new heights? In this paper, we propose FLaRe, a large-scale Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning framework that integrates robust pre-trained representations, large-scale training, and gradient stabilization techniques. Our method aligns pre-trained policies towards task completion, achieving state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance both on previously demonstrated and on entirely novel tasks and embodiments. Specifically, on a set of long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks, FLaRe achieves an average success rate of 79.5% in unseen environments, with absolute improvements of +23.6% in simulation and +30.7% on real robots over prior SoTA methods. By utilizing only sparse rewards, our approach can enable generalizing to new capabilities beyond the pretraining data with minimal human effort. Moreover, we demonstrate rapid adaptation to new embodiments and behaviors with less than a day of fine-tuning. Videos can be found on the project website at https://robot-flare.github.io/

- **Summary**: When developing Computer Aided Detection (CAD) systems for Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT), the complexity arising from the volumetric nature of the modality poses significant technical challenges for obtaining large-scale accurate annotations. Without access to large-scale annotations, the resulting model may not generalize to different domains. Given the costly nature of obtaining DBT annotations, how to effectively increase the amount of data used for training DBT CAD systems remains an open challenge.   In this paper, we present SelectiveKD, a semi-supervised learning framework for building cancer detection models for DBT, which only requires a limited number of annotated slices to reach high performance. We achieve this by utilizing unlabeled slices available in a DBT stack through a knowledge distillation framework in which the teacher model provides a supervisory signal to the student model for all slices in the DBT volume. Our framework mitigates the potential noise in the supervisory signal from a sub-optimal teacher by implementing a selective dataset expansion strategy using pseudo labels.   We evaluate our approach with a large-scale real-world dataset of over 10,000 DBT exams collected from multiple device manufacturers and locations. The resulting SelectiveKD process effectively utilizes unannotated slices from a DBT stack, leading to significantly improved cancer classification performance (AUC) and generalization performance.



### EventHallusion: Diagnosing Event Hallucinations in Video LLMs

- **Summary**: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in the video comprehension field. Despite remarkable content reasoning and instruction following capabilities they demonstrated, the hallucination problem of these VideoLLMs is less explored compared with its counterpart in the image domain. To mitigate this gap, we first propose EventHallusion, a novel benchmark that focuses on assessing the VideoLMMs' hallucination phenomenon on video event comprehension. Based on the observation that existing VideoLLMs are entangled with the priors stemming from their foundation models, our EventHallusion is curated by meticulously collecting videos and annotating questions to intentionally mislead the VideoLLMs into interpreting events based on these priors rather than accurately understanding the video content. On the other hand, we also propose a simple yet effective method, called Temporal Contrastive Decoding (TCD), to tackle the hallucination problems of VideoLLMs. The proposed TCD suppresses the model's preference toward their priors by comparing the original video with a constructed counterpart, whose temporal cues are disrupted, during the autoregressive decoding stage. Through comprehensive evaluation of eight open-source and two closed-source VideoLLMs on the proposed EventHallusion benchmark, we find that the open-source models suffer significantly from hallucination problems, whereas the closed-source models perform markedly better. By further equipping open-sourced VideoLLMs with the proposed TCD approach, evident performance improvements are achieved across most metrics in the EventHallusion benchmark. Our codes and benchmark data are available at https://github.com/Stevetich/EventHallusion.

- **Summary**: Although methods for estimating the pose of objects in indoor scenes have achieved great success, the pose estimation of underwater objects remains challenging due to difficulties brought by the complex underwater environment, such as degraded illumination, blurring, and the substantial cost of obtaining real annotations. In response, we introduce FAFA, a Frequency-Aware Flow-Aided self-supervised framework for 6D pose estimation of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). Essentially, we first train a frequency-aware flow-based pose estimator on synthetic data, where an FFT-based augmentation approach is proposed to facilitate the network in capturing domain-invariant features and target domain styles from a frequency perspective. Further, we perform self-supervised training by enforcing flow-aided multi-level consistencies to adapt it to the real-world underwater environment. Our framework relies solely on the 3D model and RGB images, alleviating the need for any real pose annotations or other-modality data like depths. We evaluate the effectiveness of FAFA on common underwater object pose benchmarks and showcase significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Despite the impressive advancements made in recent low-light image enhancement techniques, the scarcity of paired data has emerged as a significant obstacle to further advancements. This work proposes a mean-teacher-based semi-supervised low-light enhancement (Semi-LLIE) framework that integrates the unpaired data into model training. The mean-teacher technique is a prominent semi-supervised learning method, successfully adopted for addressing high-level and low-level vision tasks. However, two primary issues hinder the naive mean-teacher method from attaining optimal performance in low-light image enhancement. Firstly, pixel-wise consistency loss is insufficient for transferring realistic illumination distribution from the teacher to the student model, which results in color cast in the enhanced images. Secondly, cutting-edge image enhancement approaches fail to effectively cooperate with the mean-teacher framework to restore detailed information in dark areas due to their tendency to overlook modeling structured information within local regions. To mitigate the above issues, we first introduce a semantic-aware contrastive loss to faithfully transfer the illumination distribution, contributing to enhancing images with natural colors. Then, we design a Mamba-based low-light image enhancement backbone to effectively enhance Mamba's local region pixel relationship representation ability with a multi-scale feature learning scheme, facilitating the generation of images with rich textural details. Further, we propose novel perceptive loss based on the large-scale vision-language Recognize Anything Model (RAM) to help generate enhanced images with richer textual details. The experimental results indicate that our Semi-LLIE surpasses existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative metrics.

- **Summary**: Volumetric video streaming offers immersive 3D experiences but faces significant challenges due to high bandwidth requirements and latency issues in transmitting detailed content in real time. Traditional methods like point cloud streaming compromise visual quality when zoomed in, and neural rendering techniques are too computationally intensive for real-time use. Though mesh-based streaming stands out by preserving surface detail and connectivity, offering a more refined representation for 3D content, traditional mesh streaming methods typically transmit data on a per-frame basis, failing to take full advantage of temporal redundancies across frames. This results in inefficient bandwidth usage and poor adaptability to fluctuating network conditions. We introduce Deformation-based Adaptive Volumetric Video Streaming, a novel framework that enhances volumetric video streaming performance by leveraging the inherent deformability of mesh-based representations. DeformStream uses embedded deformation to reconstruct subsequent frames from inter-frame motion, significantly reducing bandwidth usage while ensuring visual coherence between frames. To address frame reconstruction overhead and network adaptability, we formulate a new QoE model that accounts for client-side deformation latency and design a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize the trade-off between visual quality and bandwidth consumption under varying network conditions. Our evaluation demonstrates that Deformation-based Adaptive Volumetric Video Streaming outperforms existing mesh-based streaming systems in both bandwidth efficiency and visual quality, offering a robust solution for real-time volumetric video applications.

- **Summary**: Regularization of deep neural networks has been an important issue to achieve higher generalization performance without overfitting problems. Although the popular method of Dropout provides a regularization effect, it causes inconsistent properties in the output, which may degrade the performance of deep neural networks. In this study, we propose a new module called stochastic average pooling, which incorporates Dropout-like stochasticity in pooling. We describe the properties of stochastic subsampling and average pooling and leverage them to design a module without any inconsistency problem. The stochastic average pooling achieves a regularization effect without any potential performance degradation due to the inconsistency issue and can easily be plugged into existing architectures of deep neural networks. Experiments demonstrate that replacing existing average pooling with stochastic average pooling yields consistent improvements across a variety of tasks, datasets, and models.

- **Summary**: Visual object tracking has boosted extensive intelligent applications for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) enhancers for nighttime UAV tracking always neglect the uneven light distribution in low-light images, inevitably leading to excessive enhancement in scenarios with complex illumination. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel enhancer, i.e., LDEnhancer, enhancing nighttime UAV tracking with light distribution suppression. Specifically, a novel image content refinement module is developed to decompose the light distribution information and image content information in the feature space, allowing for the targeted enhancement of the image content information. Then this work designs a new light distribution generation module to capture light distribution effectively. The features with light distribution information and image content information are fed into the different parameter estimation modules, respectively, for the parameter map prediction. Finally, leveraging two parameter maps, an innovative interweave iteration adjustment is proposed for the collaborative pixel-wise adjustment of low-light images. Additionally, a challenging nighttime UAV tracking dataset with uneven light distribution, namely NAT2024-2, is constructed to provide a comprehensive evaluation, which contains 40 challenging sequences with over 74K frames in total. Experimental results on the authoritative UAV benchmarks and the proposed NAT2024-2 demonstrate that LDEnhancer outperforms other SOTA low-light enhancers for nighttime UAV tracking. Furthermore, real-world tests on a typical UAV platform with an NVIDIA Orin NX confirm the practicality and efficiency of LDEnhancer.

- **Summary**: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is a powerful tool to reveal the morphologies and structures of materials, thereby attracting intensive interests from the scientific and industrial communities. The outstanding spatial (atomic level) and temporal (ms level) resolutions of the STEM techniques generate fruitful amounts of high-definition data, thereby enabling the high-volume and high-speed analysis of materials. On the other hand, processing of the big dataset generated by STEM is time-consuming and beyond the capability of human-based manual work, which urgently calls for computer-based automation. In this work, we present a deep-learning mask region-based neural network (Mask R-CNN) for the recognition of nanoparticles imaged by STEM, as well as generating the associated dimensional analysis. The Mask R-CNN model was tested on simulated STEM-HAADF results with different Gaussian noises, particle shapes and particle sizes, and the results indicated that Gaussian noise has determining influence on the accuracy of recognition. By applying Gaussian and Non-Local Means filters on the noise-containing STEM-HAADF results, the influences of noises are largely mitigated, and recognition accuracy is significantly improved. This filtering-recognition approach was further applied to experimental STEM-HAADF results, which yields satisfying accuracy compared with the traditional threshold methods. The deep-learning-based method developed in this work has great potentials in analysis of the complicated structures and large data generated by STEM-HAADF.

- **Summary**: Visual object tracking has significantly promoted autonomous applications for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, learning robust object representations for UAV tracking is especially challenging in complex dynamic environments, when confronted with aspect ratio change and occlusion. These challenges severely alter the original information of the object. To handle the above issues, this work proposes a novel progressive representation learning framework for UAV tracking, i.e., PRL-Track. Specifically, PRL-Track is divided into coarse representation learning and fine representation learning. For coarse representation learning, two innovative regulators, which rely on appearance and semantic information, are designed to mitigate appearance interference and capture semantic information. Furthermore, for fine representation learning, a new hierarchical modeling generator is developed to intertwine coarse object representations. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PRL-Track delivers exceptional performance on three authoritative UAV tracking benchmarks. Real-world tests indicate that the proposed PRL-Track realizes superior tracking performance with 42.6 frames per second on the typical UAV platform equipped with an edge smart camera. The code, model, and demo videos are available at \url{https://github.com/vision4robotics/PRL-Track}.

- **Summary**: We propose the use of latent space generative world models to address the covariate shift problem in autonomous driving. A world model is a neural network capable of predicting an agent's next state given past states and actions. By leveraging a world model during training, the driving policy effectively mitigates covariate shift without requiring an excessive amount of training data. During end-to-end training, our policy learns how to recover from errors by aligning with states observed in human demonstrations, so that at runtime it can recover from perturbations outside the training distribution. Additionally, we introduce a novel transformer-based perception encoder that employs multi-view cross-attention and a learned scene query. We present qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrating significant improvements upon prior state of the art in closed-loop testing in the CARLA simulator, as well as showing the ability to handle perturbations in both CARLA and NVIDIA's DRIVE Sim.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We introduce a novel framework that learns a dynamic neural radiance field (NeRF) for full-body talking humans from monocular videos. Prior work represents only the body pose or the face. However, humans communicate with their full body, combining body pose, hand gestures, as well as facial expressions. In this work, we propose TalkinNeRF, a unified NeRF-based network that represents the holistic 4D human motion. Given a monocular video of a subject, we learn corresponding modules for the body, face, and hands, that are combined together to generate the final result. To capture complex finger articulation, we learn an additional deformation field for the hands. Our multi-identity representation enables simultaneous training for multiple subjects, as well as robust animation under completely unseen poses. It can also generalize to novel identities, given only a short video as input. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for animating full-body talking humans, with fine-grained hand articulation and facial expressions.

- **Summary**: A global threshold (e.g., 0.5) is often applied to determine which bounding boxes should be included in the final results for an object detection task. A higher threshold reduces false positives but may result in missing a significant portion of true positives. A lower threshold can increase detection recall but may also result in more false positives. Because of this, using a preset global threshold (e.g., 0.5) applied to all the bounding box candidates may lead to suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a Test-time Self-guided Bounding-box Propagation (TSBP) method, leveraging Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to enhance object detection in histology images. TSBP utilizes bounding boxes with high confidence to influence those with low confidence, leveraging visual similarities between them. This propagation mechanism enables bounding boxes to be selected in a controllable, explainable, and robust manner, which surpasses the effectiveness of using simple thresholds and uncertainty calibration methods. Importantly, TSBP does not necessitate additional labeled samples for model training or parameter estimation, unlike calibration methods. We conduct experiments on gland detection and cell detection tasks in histology images. The results show that our proposed TSBP significantly improves detection outcomes when working in conjunction with state-of-the-art deep learning-based detection networks. Compared to other methods such as uncertainty calibration, TSBP yields more robust and accurate object detection predictions while using no additional labeled samples.

- **Summary**: Integrating aerial imagery-based scene generation into applications like autonomous driving and gaming enhances realism in 3D environments, but challenges remain in creating detailed content for occluded areas and ensuring real-time, consistent rendering. In this paper, we introduce Skyeyes, a novel framework that can generate photorealistic sequences of ground view images using only aerial view inputs, thereby creating a ground roaming experience. More specifically, we combine a 3D representation with a view consistent generation model, which ensures coherence between generated images. This method allows for the creation of geometrically consistent ground view images, even with large view gaps. The images maintain improved spatial-temporal coherence and realism, enhancing scene comprehension and visualization from aerial perspectives. To the best of our knowledge, there are no publicly available datasets that contain pairwise geo-aligned aerial and ground view imagery. Therefore, we build a large, synthetic, and geo-aligned dataset using Unreal Engine. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses on this synthetic dataset display superior results compared to other leading synthesis approaches.

- **Summary**: Layout generation is a task to synthesize a harmonious layout with elements characterized by attributes such as category, position, and size. Human designers experiment with the placement and modification of elements to create aesthetic layouts, however, we observed that current discrete diffusion models (DDMs) struggle to correct inharmonious layouts after they have been generated. In this paper, we first provide novel insights into layout sticking phenomenon in DDMs and then propose a simple yet effective layout-assessment module Layout-Corrector, which works in conjunction with existing DDMs to address the layout sticking problem. We present a learning-based module capable of identifying inharmonious elements within layouts, considering overall layout harmony characterized by complex composition. During the generation process, Layout-Corrector evaluates the correctness of each token in the generated layout, reinitializing those with low scores to the ungenerated state. The DDM then uses the high-scored tokens as clues to regenerate the harmonized tokens. Layout-Corrector, tested on common benchmarks, consistently boosts layout-generation performance when in conjunction with various state-of-the-art DDMs. Furthermore, our extensive analysis demonstrates that the Layout-Corrector (1) successfully identifies erroneous tokens, (2) facilitates control over the fidelity-diversity trade-off, and (3) significantly mitigates the performance drop associated with fast sampling.

- **Summary**: Radiography is widely used in orthopedics for its affordability and low radiation exposure. 3D reconstruction from a single radiograph, so-called 2D-3D reconstruction, offers the possibility of various clinical applications, but achieving clinically viable accuracy and computational efficiency is still an unsolved challenge. Unlike other areas in computer vision, X-ray imaging's unique properties, such as ray penetration and fixed geometry, have not been fully exploited. We propose a novel approach that simultaneously learns multiple depth maps (front- and back-surface of multiple bones) derived from the X-ray image to computed tomography registration. The proposed method not only leverages the fixed geometry characteristic of X-ray imaging but also enhances the precision of the reconstruction of the whole surface. Our study involved 600 CT and 2651 X-ray images (4 to 5 posed X-ray images per patient), demonstrating our method's superiority over traditional approaches with a surface reconstruction error reduction from 4.78 mm to 1.96 mm. This significant accuracy improvement and enhanced computational efficiency suggest our approach's potential for clinical application.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes Pix2Next, a novel image-to-image translation framework designed to address the challenge of generating high-quality Near-Infrared (NIR) images from RGB inputs. Our approach leverages a state-of-the-art Vision Foundation Model (VFM) within an encoder-decoder architecture, incorporating cross-attention mechanisms to enhance feature integration. This design captures detailed global representations and preserves essential spectral characteristics, treating RGB-to-NIR translation as more than a simple domain transfer problem. A multi-scale PatchGAN discriminator ensures realistic image generation at various detail levels, while carefully designed loss functions couple global context understanding with local feature preservation. We performed experiments on the RANUS dataset to demonstrate Pix2Next's advantages in quantitative metrics and visual quality, improving the FID score by 34.81% compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of Pix2Next by showing improved performance on a downstream object detection task using generated NIR data to augment limited real NIR datasets. The proposed approach enables the scaling up of NIR datasets without additional data acquisition or annotation efforts, potentially accelerating advancements in NIR-based computer vision applications.

- **Summary**: Sign language videos are an important medium for spreading and learning sign language. However, most existing human image synthesis methods produce sign language images with details that are distorted, blurred, or structurally incorrect. They also produce sign language video frames with poor temporal consistency, with anomalies such as flickering and abrupt detail changes between the previous and next frames. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Pose-Guided Motion Model (PGMM) for generating fine-grained and motion-consistent sign language videos. Firstly, we propose a new Coarse Motion Module (CMM), which completes the deformation of features by optical flow warping, thus transfering the motion of coarse-grained structures without changing the appearance; Secondly, we propose a new Pose Fusion Module (PFM), which guides the modal fusion of RGB and pose features, thus completing the fine-grained generation. Finally, we design a new metric, Temporal Consistency Difference (TCD) to quantitatively assess the degree of temporal consistency of a video by comparing the difference between the frames of the reconstructed video and the previous and next frames of the target video. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in most benchmark tests, with visible improvements in details and temporal consistency.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have witnessed the success of prompt tuning and adapter tuning, while the classic model fine-tuning on inherent parameters seems to be overlooked. It is believed that fine-tuning the parameters of VLMs with few-shot samples corrupts the pre-trained knowledge since fine-tuning the CLIP model even degrades performance. In this paper, we revisit this viewpoint, and propose a new perspective: fine-tuning the specific parameters instead of all will uncover the power of classic model fine-tuning on VLMs. Through our meticulous study, we propose ClipFit, a simple yet effective method to fine-tune CLIP without introducing any overhead of extra parameters. We demonstrate that by only fine-tuning the specific bias terms and normalization layers, ClipFit can improve the performance of zero-shot CLIP by 7.27\% average harmonic mean accuracy. Lastly, to understand how fine-tuning in CLIPFit affects the pre-trained models, we conducted extensive experimental analyses w.r.t. changes in internal parameters and representations. We found that low-level text bias layers and the first layer normalization layer change much more than other layers. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/minglllli/CLIPFit}.



### EAGLE: Towards Efficient Arbitrary Referring Visual Prompts Comprehension for Multimodal Large Language Models

- **Summary**: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have sparked great research interests owing to their exceptional content-reasoning and instruction-following capabilities. To effectively instruct an MLLM, in addition to conventional language expressions, the practice of referring to objects by painting with brushes on images has emerged as a prevalent tool (referred to as "referring visual prompts") due to its efficacy in aligning the user's intention with specific image regions. To accommodate the most common referring visual prompts, namely points, boxes, and masks, existing approaches initially utilize specialized feature encoding modules to capture the semantics of the highlighted areas indicated by these prompts. Subsequently, these encoded region features are adapted to MLLMs through fine-tuning on a meticulously curated multimodal instruction dataset. However, such designs suffer from redundancy in architecture. Moreover, they face challenges in effectively generalizing when encountering a diverse range of arbitrary referring visual prompts in real-life scenarios. To address the above issues, we propose EAGLE, a novel MLLM that empowers comprehension of arbitrary referring visual prompts with less training efforts than existing approaches. Specifically, our EAGLE maintains the innate format of the referring visual prompts as colored patches rendered on the given image for conducting the instruction tuning. Our approach embeds referring visual prompts as spatial concepts conveying specific spatial areas comprehensible to the MLLM, with the semantic comprehension of these regions originating from the MLLM itself. Besides, we also propose a Geometry-Agnostic Learning paradigm (GAL) to further disentangle the MLLM's region-level comprehension with the specific formats of referring visual prompts. Extensive experiments are conducted to prove the effectiveness of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) has been demonstrated the potential to mitigate the issue of limited medical labeled data. However, confirmation and cognitive biases may affect the prevalent teacher-student based SSMIS methods due to erroneous pseudo-labels. To tackle this challenge, we improve the mean teacher approach and propose the Students Discrepancy-Informed Correction Learning (SDCL) framework that includes two students and one non-trainable teacher, which utilizes the segmentation difference between the two students to guide the self-correcting learning. The essence of SDCL is to identify the areas of segmentation discrepancy as the potential bias areas, and then encourage the model to review the correct cognition and rectify their own biases in these areas. To facilitate the bias correction learning with continuous review and rectification, two correction loss functions are employed to minimize the correct segmentation voxel distance and maximize the erroneous segmentation voxel entropy. We conducted experiments on three public medical image datasets: two 3D datasets (CT and MRI) and one 2D dataset (MRI). The results show that our SDCL surpasses the current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) methods by 2.57\%, 3.04\%, and 2.34\% in the Dice score on the Pancreas, LA, and ACDC datasets, respectively. In addition, the accuracy of our method is very close to the fully supervised method on the ACDC dataset, and even exceeds the fully supervised method on the Pancreas and LA dataset.

- **Summary**: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has gained great attention from researchers due to the popularity of mobile devices and the need to observe users' daily activity data for better human-computer interaction. In this work, we collect a human activity recognition dataset called OPPOHAR consisting of phone IMU data. To facilitate the employment of HAR system in mobile phone and to achieve user-specific activity recognition, we propose a novel light-weight network called Non-stationary BERT with a two-stage training method. We also propose a simple yet effective data augmentation method to explore the deeper relationship between the accelerator and gyroscope data from the IMU. The network achieves the state-of-the-art performance testing on various activity recognition datasets and the data augmentation method demonstrates its wide applicability.

- **Summary**: Image compression is a critical tool in decreasing the cost of storage and improving the speed of transmission over the internet. While deep learning applications for natural images widely adopts the usage of lossy compression techniques, it is not widespread for 3D medical images. Using three CT datasets (17 tasks) and one MRI dataset (3 tasks) we demonstrate that lossy compression up to 20 times have no negative impact on segmentation quality with deep neural networks (DNN). In addition, we demonstrate the ability of DNN models trained on compressed data to predict on uncompressed data and vice versa with no quality deterioration.

- **Summary**: Images tell stories, trigger emotions, and let us recall memories -- they make us think. Thus, they have the ability to attract and hold one's attention, which is the definition of being "interesting". Yet, the appeal of an image is highly subjective. Looking at the image of my son taking his first steps will always bring me back to this emotional moment, while it is just a blurry, quickly taken snapshot to most others. Preferences vary widely: some adore cats, others are dog enthusiasts, and a third group may not be fond of either. We argue that every image can be interesting to a particular observer under certain circumstances. This work particularly emphasizes subjective preferences. However, our analysis of 2.5k image collections from diverse users of the photo-sharing platform Flickr reveals that specific image characteristics make them commonly more interesting. For instance, images, including professionally taken landscapes, appeal broadly due to their aesthetic qualities. In contrast, subjectively interesting images, such as those depicting personal or niche community events, resonate on a more individual level, often evoking personal memories and emotions.

- **Summary**: Explainable AI (XAI) is a rapidly growing domain with a myriad of proposed methods as well as metrics aiming to evaluate their efficacy. However, current studies are often of limited scope, examining only a handful of XAI methods and ignoring underlying design parameters for performance, such as the model architecture or the nature of input data. Moreover, they often rely on one or a few metrics and neglect thorough validation, increasing the risk of selection bias and ignoring discrepancies among metrics. These shortcomings leave practitioners confused about which method to choose for their problem. In response, we introduce LATEC, a large-scale benchmark that critically evaluates 17 prominent XAI methods using 20 distinct metrics. We systematically incorporate vital design parameters like varied architectures and diverse input modalities, resulting in 7,560 examined combinations. Through LATEC, we showcase the high risk of conflicting metrics leading to unreliable rankings and consequently propose a more robust evaluation scheme. Further, we comprehensively evaluate various XAI methods to assist practitioners in selecting appropriate methods aligning with their needs. Curiously, the emerging top-performing method, Expected Gradients, is not examined in any relevant related study. LATEC reinforces its role in future XAI research by publicly releasing all 326k saliency maps and 378k metric scores as a (meta-)evaluation dataset.

- **Summary**: This work presents a method that is able to predict the geolocation of a street-view photo taken in the wild within a state-sized search region by matching against a database of aerial reference imagery. We partition the search region into geographical cells and train a model to map cells and corresponding photos into a joint embedding space that is used to perform retrieval at test time. The model utilizes aerial images for each cell at multiple levels-of-detail to provide sufficient information about the surrounding scene. We propose a novel layout of the search region with consistent cell resolutions that allows scaling to large geographical regions. Experiments demonstrate that the method successfully localizes 60.6% of all non-panoramic street-view photos uploaded to the crowd-sourcing platform Mapillary in the state of Massachusetts to within 50m of their ground-truth location.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a benchmark dataset for aligning lecture videos with corresponding slides and introduces a novel multimodal algorithm leveraging features from speech, text, and images. It achieves an average accuracy of 0.82 in comparison to SIFT (0.56) while being approximately 11 times faster. Using dynamic programming the algorithm tries to determine the optimal slide sequence. The results show that penalizing slide transitions increases accuracy. Features obtained via optical character recognition (OCR) contribute the most to a high matching accuracy, followed by image features. The findings highlight that audio transcripts alone provide valuable information for alignment and are beneficial if OCR data is lacking. Variations in matching accuracy across different lectures highlight the challenges associated with video quality and lecture style. The novel multimodal algorithm demonstrates robustness to some of these challenges, underscoring the potential of the approach.

- **Summary**: Lensless cameras relax the design constraints of traditional cameras by shifting image formation from analog optics to digital post-processing. While new camera designs and applications can be enabled, lensless imaging is very sensitive to unwanted interference (other sources, noise, etc.). In this work, we address a prevalent noise source that has not been studied for lensless imaging: external illumination e.g. from ambient and direct lighting. Being robust to a variety of lighting conditions would increase the practicality and adoption of lensless imaging. To this end, we propose multiple recovery approaches that account for external illumination by incorporating its estimate into the image recovery process. At the core is a physics-based reconstruction that combines learnable image recovery and denoisers, all of whose parameters are trained using experimentally gathered data. Compared to standard reconstruction methods, our approach yields significant qualitative and quantitative improvements. We open-source our implementations and a 25K dataset of measurements under multiple lighting conditions.

- **Summary**: Limited by the expensive labeling, polyp segmentation models are plagued by data shortages. To tackle this, we propose the mixed supervised polyp segmentation paradigm (MixPolyp). Unlike traditional models relying on a single type of annotation, MixPolyp combines diverse annotation types (mask, box, and scribble) within a single model, thereby expanding the range of available data and reducing labeling costs. To achieve this, MixPolyp introduces three novel supervision losses to handle various annotations: Subspace Projection loss (L_SP), Binary Minimum Entropy loss (L_BME), and Linear Regularization loss (L_LR). For box annotations, L_SP eliminates shape inconsistencies between the prediction and the supervision. For scribble annotations, L_BME provides supervision for unlabeled pixels through minimum entropy constraint, thereby alleviating supervision sparsity. Furthermore, L_LR provides dense supervision by enforcing consistency among the predictions, thus reducing the non-uniqueness. These losses are independent of the model structure, making them generally applicable. They are used only during training, adding no computational cost during inference. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate MixPolyp's effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Unstructured data in industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing presents significant challenges for efficient analysis and decision making. Detecting patterns within this data and understanding their impact is critical but complex without the right tools. Traditionally, these tasks relied on the expertise of data analysts or labor-intensive manual reviews. In response, we introduce Spacewalker, an interactive tool designed to explore and annotate data across multiple modalities. Spacewalker allows users to extract data representations and visualize them in low-dimensional spaces, enabling the detection of semantic similarities. Through extensive user studies, we assess Spacewalker's effectiveness in data annotation and integrity verification. Results show that the tool's ability to traverse latent spaces and perform multi-modal queries significantly enhances the user's capacity to quickly identify relevant data. Moreover, Spacewalker allows for annotation speed-ups far superior to conventional methods, making it a promising tool for efficiently navigating unstructured data and improving decision making processes.

- **Summary**: Training a diverse ensemble of models has several practical applications such as providing candidates for model selection with better out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and enabling the detection of OOD samples via Bayesian principles. An existing approach to diverse ensemble training encourages the models to disagree on provided OOD samples. However, the approach is computationally expensive and it requires well-separated ID and OOD examples, such that it has only been demonstrated in small-scale settings.   $\textbf{Method.}$ This work presents a method for Scalable Ensemble Diversification (SED) applicable to large-scale settings (e.g. ImageNet) that does not require OOD samples. Instead, SED identifies hard training samples on the fly and encourages the ensemble members to disagree on these. To improve scaling, we show how to avoid the expensive computations in existing methods of exhaustive pairwise disagreements across models.   $\textbf{Results.}$ We evaluate the benefits of diversification with experiments on ImageNet. First, for OOD generalization, we observe large benefits from the diversification in multiple settings including output-space (classical) ensembles and weight-space ensembles (model soups). Second, for OOD detection, we turn the diversity of ensemble hypotheses into a novel uncertainty score estimator that surpasses a large number of OOD detection baselines.

- **Summary**: We introduce ColonSLAM, a system that combines classical multiple-map metric SLAM with deep features and topological priors to create topological maps of the whole colon. The SLAM pipeline by itself is able to create disconnected individual metric submaps representing locations from short video subsections of the colon, but is not able to merge covisible submaps due to deformations and the limited performance of the SIFT descriptor in the medical domain. ColonSLAM is guided by topological priors and combines a deep localization network trained to distinguish if two images come from the same place or not and the soft verification of a transformer-based matching network, being able to relate far-in-time submaps during an exploration, grouping them in nodes imaging the same colon place, building more complex maps than any other approach in the literature. We demonstrate our approach in the Endomapper dataset, showing its potential for producing maps of the whole colon in real human explorations.

- **Summary**: Modern applications, such as autonomous vehicles, require deploying deep learning algorithms on resource-constrained edge devices for real-time image and video processing. However, there is limited understanding of the efficiency and performance of various object detection models on these devices. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art object detection models, including YOLOv8 (Nano, Small, Medium), EfficientDet Lite (Lite0, Lite1, Lite2), and SSD (SSD MobileNet V1, SSDLite MobileDet). We deployed these models on popular edge devices like the Raspberry Pi 3, 4, and 5 with/without TPU accelerators, and Jetson Orin Nano, collecting key performance metrics such as energy consumption, inference time, and Mean Average Precision (mAP). Our findings highlight that lower mAP models such as SSD MobileNet V1 are more energy-efficient and faster in inference, whereas higher mAP models like YOLOv8 Medium generally consume more energy and have slower inference, though with exceptions when accelerators like TPUs are used. Among the edge devices, Jetson Orin Nano stands out as the fastest and most energy-efficient option for request handling, despite having the highest idle energy consumption. These results emphasize the need to balance accuracy, speed, and energy efficiency when deploying deep learning models on edge devices, offering valuable guidance for practitioners and researchers selecting models and devices for their applications.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an integrated approach to Visual SLAM, merging online sequential photometric calibration within a Hybrid direct-indirect visual SLAM (H-SLAM). Photometric calibration helps normalize pixel intensity values under different lighting conditions, and thereby improves the direct component of our H-SLAM. A tangential benefit also results to the indirect component of H-SLAM given that the detected features are more stable across variable lighting conditions. Our proposed photometrically calibrated H-SLAM is tested on several datasets, including the TUM monoVO as well as on a dataset we created. Calibrated H-SLAM outperforms other state of the art direct, indirect, and hybrid Visual SLAM systems in all the experiments. Furthermore, in online SLAM tested at our site, it also significantly outperformed the other SLAM Systems.

- **Summary**: Multimodal brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is indispensable in neuroscience and neurology. However, due to the accessibility of MRI scanners and their lengthy acquisition time, multimodal MR images are not commonly available. Current MR image synthesis approaches are typically trained on independent datasets for specific tasks, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to novel datasets and tasks. Here, we present TUMSyn, a Text-guided Universal MR image Synthesis generalist model, which can flexibly generate brain MR images with demanded imaging metadata from routinely acquired scans guided by text prompts. To ensure TUMSyn's image synthesis precision, versatility, and generalizability, we first construct a brain MR database comprising 31,407 3D images with 7 MRI modalities from 13 centers. We then pre-train an MRI-specific text encoder using contrastive learning to effectively control MR image synthesis based on text prompts. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and physician assessments indicate that TUMSyn can generate clinically meaningful MR images with specified imaging metadata in supervised and zero-shot scenarios. Therefore, TUMSyn can be utilized along with acquired MR scan(s) to facilitate large-scale MRI-based screening and diagnosis of brain diseases.

- **Summary**: The irregular contour representation is one of the tough challenges in scene text detection. Although segmentation-based methods have achieved significant progress with the help of flexible pixel prediction, the overlap of geographically close texts hinders detecting them separately. To alleviate this problem, some shrink-based methods predict text kernels and expand them to restructure texts. However, the text kernel is an artificial object with incomplete semantic features that are prone to incorrect or missing detection. In addition, different from the general objects, the geometry features (aspect ratio, scale, and shape) of scene texts vary significantly, which makes it difficult to detect them accurately. To consider the above problems, we propose an effective spotlight text detector (STD), which consists of a spotlight calibration module (SCM) and a multivariate information extraction module (MIEM). The former concentrates efforts on the candidate kernel, like a camera focus on the target. It obtains candidate features through a mapping filter and calibrates them precisely to eliminate some false positive samples. The latter designs different shape schemes to explore multiple geometric features for scene texts. It helps extract various spatial relationships to improve the model's ability to recognize kernel regions. Ablation studies prove the effectiveness of the designed SCM and MIEM. Extensive experiments verify that our STD is superior to existing state-of-the-art methods on various datasets, including ICDAR2015, CTW1500, MSRA-TD500, and Total-Text.

- **Summary**: Power grids serve as a vital component in numerous industries, seamlessly delivering electrical energy to industrial processes and technologies, making their safe and reliable operation indispensable. However, powerlines can be hard to inspect due to difficult terrain or harsh climatic conditions. Therefore, unmanned aerial vehicles are increasingly deployed to inspect powerlines, resulting in a substantial stream of visual data which requires swift and accurate processing. Deep learning methods have become widely popular for this task, proving to be a valuable asset in fault detection. In particular, the detection of insulator defects is crucial for predicting powerline failures, since their malfunction can lead to transmission disruptions. It is therefore of great interest to continuously maintain and rigorously inspect insulator components. In this work we propose a novel pipeline to tackle this task. We utilize state-of-the-art object detection to detect and subsequently classify individual insulator anomalies. Our approach addresses dataset challenges such as imbalance and motion-blurred images through a fine-tuning methodology which allows us to alter the classification focus of the model by increasing the classification accuracy of anomalous insulators. In addition, we employ explainable-AI tools for precise localization and explanation of anomalies. This proposed method contributes to the field of anomaly detection, particularly vision-based industrial inspection and predictive maintenance. We significantly improve defect detection accuracy by up to 13%, while also offering a detailed analysis of model mis-classifications and localization quality, showcasing the potential of our method on real-world data.



### Focus Entirety and Perceive Environment for Arbitrary-Shaped Text Detection

- **Summary**: Due to the diversity of scene text in aspects such as font, color, shape, and size, accurately and efficiently detecting text is still a formidable challenge. Among the various detection approaches, segmentation-based approaches have emerged as prominent contenders owing to their flexible pixel-level predictions. However, these methods typically model text instances in a bottom-up manner, which is highly susceptible to noise. In addition, the prediction of pixels is isolated without introducing pixel-feature interaction, which also influences the detection performance. To alleviate these problems, we propose a multi-information level arbitrary-shaped text detector consisting of a focus entirety module (FEM) and a perceive environment module (PEM). The former extracts instance-level features and adopts a top-down scheme to model texts to reduce the influence of noises. Specifically, it assigns consistent entirety information to pixels within the same instance to improve their cohesion. In addition, it emphasizes the scale information, enabling the model to distinguish varying scale texts effectively. The latter extracts region-level information and encourages the model to focus on the distribution of positive samples in the vicinity of a pixel, which perceives environment information. It treats the kernel pixels as positive samples and helps the model differentiate text and kernel features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the FEM's ability to efficiently support the model in handling different scale texts and confirm the PEM can assist in perceiving pixels more accurately by focusing on pixel vicinities. Comparisons show the proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on four public datasets.

- **Summary**: While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel at clean image classification, they struggle to classify images corrupted with different common corruptions, limiting their real-world applicability. Recent work has shown that incorporating a CNN front-end block that simulates some features of the primate primary visual cortex (V1) can improve overall model robustness. Here, we expand on this approach by introducing two novel biologically-inspired CNN model families that incorporate a new front-end block designed to simulate pre-cortical visual processing. RetinaNet, a hybrid architecture containing the novel front-end followed by a standard CNN back-end, shows a relative robustness improvement of 12.3% when compared to the standard model; and EVNet, which further adds a V1 block after the pre-cortical front-end, shows a relative gain of 18.5%. The improvement in robustness was observed for all the different corruption categories, though accompanied by a small decrease in clean image accuracy, and generalized to a different back-end architecture. These findings show that simulating multiple stages of early visual processing in CNN early layers provides cumulative benefits for model robustness.

- **Summary**: Recently, computer-aided design models and electromagnetic simulations have been used to augment synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for deep learning. However, an automatic target recognition (ATR) model struggles with domain shift when using synthetic data because the model learns specific clutter patterns present in such data, which disturbs performance when applied to measured data with different clutter distributions. This study proposes a framework particularly designed for domain-generalized SAR-ATR called IRASNet, enabling effective feature-level clutter reduction and domain-invariant feature learning. First, we propose a clutter reduction module (CRM) that maximizes the signal-to-clutter ratio on feature maps. The module reduces the impact of clutter at the feature level while preserving target and shadow information, thereby improving ATR performance. Second, we integrate adversarial learning with CRM to extract clutter-reduced domain-invariant features. The integration bridges the gap between synthetic and measured datasets without requiring measured data during training. Third, we improve feature extraction from target and shadow regions by implementing a positional supervision task using mask ground truth encoding. The improvement enhances the ability of the model to discriminate between classes. Our proposed IRASNet presents new state-of-the-art public SAR datasets utilizing target and shadow information to achieve superior performance across various test conditions. IRASNet not only enhances generalization performance but also significantly improves feature-level clutter reduction, making it a valuable advancement in the field of radar image pattern recognition.

- **Summary**: We present a novel method for scene change detection that leverages the robust feature extraction capabilities of a visual foundational model, DINOv2, and integrates full-image cross-attention to address key challenges such as varying lighting, seasonal variations, and viewpoint differences. In order to effectively learn correspondences and mis-correspondences between an image pair for the change detection task, we propose to a) ``freeze'' the backbone in order to retain the generality of dense foundation features, and b) employ ``full-image'' cross-attention to better tackle the viewpoint variations between the image pair. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets, VL-CMU-CD and PSCD, along with their viewpoint-varied versions. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in F1-score, particularly in scenarios involving geometric changes between image pairs. The results indicate our method's superior generalization capabilities over existing state-of-the-art approaches, showing robustness against photometric and geometric variations as well as better overall generalization when fine-tuned to adapt to new environments. Detailed ablation studies further validate the contributions of each component in our architecture. Source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Synthesizing accurate hands-object interactions (HOI) is critical for applications in Computer Vision, Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR). Despite recent advances, the accuracy of reconstructed or generated HOI leaves room for refinement. Some techniques have improved the accuracy of dense correspondences by shifting focus from generating explicit contacts to using rich HOI fields. Still, they lack full differentiability or continuity and are tailored to specific tasks. In contrast, we present a Coarse Hand-Object Interaction Representation (CHOIR), a novel, versatile and fully differentiable field for HOI modelling. CHOIR leverages discrete unsigned distances for continuous shape and pose encoding, alongside multivariate Gaussian distributions to represent dense contact maps with few parameters. To demonstrate the versatility of CHOIR we design JointDiffusion, a diffusion model to learn a grasp distribution conditioned on noisy hand-object interactions or only object geometries, for both refinement and synthesis applications. We demonstrate JointDiffusion's improvements over the SOTA in both applications: it increases the contact F1 score by $5\%$ for refinement and decreases the sim. displacement by $46\%$ for synthesis. Our experiments show that JointDiffusion with CHOIR yield superior contact accuracy and physical realism compared to SOTA methods designed for specific tasks. Our models and code will be publicly available to the research community.

This technique aims to enhance these metrics by refining the alignment of 3D meshes with the ground plane. Through qualitative comparisons, we demonstrate RotAvat's effectiveness in addressing the limitations of existing aproaches.

- **Summary**: Single-view 3D hair reconstruction is challenging, due to the wide range of shape variations among diverse hairstyles. Current state-of-the-art methods are specialized in recovering un-braided 3D hairs and often take braided styles as their failure cases, because of the inherent difficulty to define priors for complex hairstyles, whether rule-based or data-based. We propose a novel strategy to enable single-view 3D reconstruction for a variety of hair types via a unified pipeline. To achieve this, we first collect a large-scale synthetic multi-view hair dataset SynMvHair with diverse 3D hair in both braided and un-braided styles, and learn two diffusion priors specialized on hair. Then we optimize 3D Gaussian-based hair from the priors with two specially designed modules, i.e. view-wise and pixel-wise Gaussian refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that reconstructing braided and un-braided 3D hair from single-view images via a unified approach is possible and our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in recovering complex hairstyles. It is worth to mention that our method shows good generalization ability to real images, although it learns hair priors from synthetic data.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) learn abstract features to perform object classification, but understanding these features remains challenging due to difficult-to-interpret results or high computational costs. We propose an automatic method to visualize and systematically analyze learned features in CNNs. Specifically, we introduce a linking network that maps the penultimate layer of a pre-trained classifier to the latent space of a generative model (StyleGAN-XL), thereby enabling an interpretable, human-friendly visualization of the classifier's representations. Our findings indicate a congruent semantic order in both spaces, enabling a direct linear mapping between them. Training the linking network is computationally inexpensive and decoupled from training both the GAN and the classifier. We introduce an automatic pipeline that utilizes such GAN-based visualizations to quantify learned representations by analyzing activation changes in the classifier in the image domain. This quantification allows us to systematically study the learned representations in several thousand units simultaneously and to extract and visualize units selective for specific semantic concepts. Further, we illustrate how our method can be used to quantify and interpret the classifier's decision boundary using counterfactual examples. Overall, our method offers systematic and objective perspectives on learned abstract representations in CNNs. https://github.com/kaschube-lab/LinkingInStyle.git

- **Summary**: Data representation in non-Euclidean spaces has proven effective for capturing hierarchical and complex relationships in real-world datasets. Hyperbolic spaces, in particular, provide efficient embeddings for hierarchical structures. This paper introduces the Hyperbolic Vision Transformer (HVT), a novel extension of the Vision Transformer (ViT) that integrates hyperbolic geometry. While traditional ViTs operate in Euclidean space, our method enhances the self-attention mechanism by leveraging hyperbolic distance and M\"obius transformations. This enables more effective modeling of hierarchical and relational dependencies in image data. We present rigorous mathematical formulations, showing how hyperbolic geometry can be incorporated into attention layers, feed-forward networks, and optimization. We offer improved performance for image classification using the ImageNet dataset.

- **Summary**: Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in visual object tracking, largely due to the availability of large-scale training datasets. However, existing tracking datasets are primarily focused on open-air scenarios, which greatly limits the development of object tracking in underwater environments. To address this issue, we take a step forward by proposing the first large-scale underwater camouflaged object tracking dataset, namely UW-COT. Based on the proposed dataset, this paper presents an experimental evaluation of several advanced visual object tracking methods and the latest advancements in image and video segmentation. Specifically, we compare the performance of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its updated version, SAM 2, in challenging underwater environments. Our findings highlight the improvements in SAM 2 over SAM, demonstrating its enhanced capability to handle the complexities of underwater camouflaged objects. Compared to current advanced visual object tracking methods, the latest video segmentation foundation model SAM 2 also exhibits significant advantages, providing valuable insights into the development of more effective tracking technologies for underwater scenarios. The dataset will be accessible at \color{magenta}{https://github.com/983632847/Awesome-Multimodal-Object-Tracking}.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing surfaces from normals is a key component of photometric stereo. This work introduces an adaptive surface triangulation in the image domain and afterwards performs the normal integration on a triangle mesh. Our key insight is that surface curvature can be computed from normals. Based on the curvature, we identify flat areas and aggregate pixels into triangles. The approximation quality is controlled by a single user parameter facilitating a seamless generation of low- to high-resolution meshes. Compared to pixel grids, our triangle meshes adapt locally to surface details and allow for a sparser representation. Our new mesh-based formulation of the normal integration problem is strictly derived from discrete differential geometry and leads to well-conditioned linear systems. Results on real and synthetic data show that 10 to 100 times less vertices are required than pixels. Experiments suggest that this sparsity translates into a sublinear runtime in the number of pixels. For 64 MP normal maps, our meshing-first approach generates and integrates meshes in minutes while pixel-based approaches require hours just for the integration.

However, the need for large-scale datasets significantly increases costs and limits model generalization. In this work, we propose Moner, an unsupervised MoCo method that jointly solves artifact-free MR images and accurate motion from undersampled, rigid motion-corrupted k-space data, without requiring training data. Our core idea is to leverage the continuous prior of implicit neural representation (INR) to constrain this ill-posed inverse problem, enabling ideal solutions. Specifically, we incorporate a quasi-static motion model into the INR, granting its ability to correct subject's motion. To stabilize model optimization, we reformulate radial MRI as a back-projection problem using the Fourier-slice theorem. Additionally, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine hash encoding strategy, significantly enhancing MoCo accuracy. Experiments on multiple MRI datasets show our Moner achieves performance comparable to SOTA MoCo techniques on in-domain data, while demonstrating significant improvements on out-of-domain data.

- **Summary**: The vision-based geo-localization technology for UAV, serving as a secondary source of GPS information in addition to the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), can still operate independently in the GPS-denied environment. Recent deep learning based methods attribute this as the task of image matching and retrieval. By retrieving drone-view images in geo-tagged satellite image database, approximate localization information can be obtained. However, due to high costs and privacy concerns, it is usually difficult to obtain large quantities of drone-view images from a continuous area. Existing drone-view datasets are mostly composed of small-scale aerial photography with a strong assumption that there exists a perfect one-to-one aligned reference image for any query, leaving a significant gap from the practical localization scenario. In this work, we construct a large-range contiguous area UAV geo-localization dataset named GTA-UAV, featuring multiple flight altitudes, attitudes, scenes, and targets using modern computer games. Based on this dataset, we introduce a more practical UAV geo-localization task including partial matches of cross-view paired data, and expand the image-level retrieval to the actual localization in terms of distance (meters). For the construction of drone-view and satellite-view pairs, we adopt a weight-based contrastive learning approach, which allows for effective learning while avoiding additional post-processing matching steps. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our data and training method for UAV geo-localization, as well as the generalization capabilities to real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Generating and inserting new objects into 3D content is a compelling approach for achieving versatile scene recreation. Existing methods, which rely on SDS optimization or single-view inpainting, often struggle to produce high-quality results. To address this, we propose a novel method for object insertion in 3D content represented by Gaussian Splatting. Our approach introduces a multi-view diffusion model, dubbed MVInpainter, which is built upon a pre-trained stable video diffusion model to facilitate view-consistent object inpainting. Within MVInpainter, we incorporate a ControlNet-based conditional injection module to enable controlled and more predictable multi-view generation. After generating the multi-view inpainted results, we further propose a mask-aware 3D reconstruction technique to refine Gaussian Splatting reconstruction from these sparse inpainted views. By leveraging these fabricate techniques, our approach yields diverse results, ensures view-consistent and harmonious insertions, and produces better object quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.

- **Summary**: Segmentation is a crucial step in microscopy image analysis. Numerous approaches have been developed over the past years, ranging from classical segmentation algorithms to advanced deep learning models. While U-Net remains one of the most popular and well-established models for biomedical segmentation tasks, recently developed transformer-based models promise to enhance the segmentation process of microscopy images. In this work, we assess the efficacy of transformers, including UNETR, the Segment Anything Model, and Swin-UPerNet, and compare them with the well-established U-Net model across various image modalities such as electron microscopy, brightfield, histopathology, and phase-contrast. Our evaluation identifies several limitations in the original Swin Transformer model, which we address through architectural modifications to optimise its performance. The results demonstrate that these modifications improve segmentation performance compared to the classical U-Net model and the unmodified Swin-UPerNet. This comparative analysis highlights the promise of transformer models for advancing biomedical image segmentation. It demonstrates that their efficiency and applicability can be improved with careful modifications, facilitating their future use in microscopy image analysis tools.

- **Summary**: We introduce Go-SLAM, a novel framework that utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM to reconstruct dynamic environments while embedding object-level information within the scene representations. This framework employs advanced object segmentation techniques, assigning a unique identifier to each Gaussian splat that corresponds to the object it represents. Consequently, our system facilitates open-vocabulary querying, allowing users to locate objects using natural language descriptions. Furthermore, the framework features an optimal path generation module that calculates efficient navigation paths for robots toward queried objects, considering obstacles and environmental uncertainties. Comprehensive evaluations in various scene settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in delivering high-fidelity scene reconstructions, precise object segmentation, flexible object querying, and efficient robot path planning. This work represents an additional step forward in bridging the gap between 3D scene reconstruction, semantic object understanding, and real-time environment interactions.

- **Summary**: Face Forgery Detection (FFD), or Deepfake detection, aims to determine whether a digital face is real or fake. Due to different face synthesis algorithms with diverse forgery patterns, FFD models often overfit specific patterns in training datasets, resulting in poor generalization to other unseen forgeries. This severe challenge requires FFD models to possess strong capabilities in representing complex facial features and extracting subtle forgery cues. Although previous FFD models directly employ existing backbones to represent and extract facial forgery cues, the critical role of backbones is often overlooked, particularly as their knowledge and capabilities are insufficient to address FFD challenges, inevitably limiting generalization. Therefore, it is essential to integrate the backbone pre-training configurations and seek practical solutions by revisiting the complete FFD workflow, from backbone pre-training and fine-tuning to inference of discriminant results. Specifically, we analyze the crucial contributions of backbones with different configurations in FFD task and propose leveraging the ViT network with self-supervised learning on real-face datasets to pre-train a backbone, equipping it with superior facial representation capabilities. We then build a competitive backbone fine-tuning framework that strengthens the backbone's ability to extract diverse forgery cues within a competitive learning mechanism. Moreover, we devise a threshold optimization mechanism that utilizes prediction confidence to improve the inference reliability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our FFD model with the elaborate backbone achieves excellent performance in FFD and extra face-related tasks, i.e., presentation attack detection.

- **Summary**: This paper summarizes the 3rd NTIRE challenge on stereo image super-resolution (SR) with a focus on new solutions and results. The task of this challenge is to super-resolve a low-resolution stereo image pair to a high-resolution one with a magnification factor of x4 under a limited computational budget. Compared with single image SR, the major challenge of this challenge lies in how to exploit additional information in another viewpoint and how to maintain stereo consistency in the results. This challenge has 2 tracks, including one track on bicubic degradation and one track on real degradations. In total, 108 and 70 participants were successfully registered for each track, respectively. In the test phase, 14 and 13 teams successfully submitted valid results with PSNR (RGB) scores better than the baseline. This challenge establishes a new benchmark for stereo image SR.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present an effective data augmentation framework leveraging the Large Language Model (LLM) and Diffusion Model (DM) to tackle the challenges inherent in data-scarce scenarios. Recently, DMs have opened up the possibility of generating synthetic images to complement a few training images. However, increasing the diversity of synthetic images also raises the risk of generating samples outside the target distribution. Our approach addresses this issue by embedding novel semantic information into text prompts via LLM and utilizing real images as visual prompts, thus generating semantically rich images. To ensure that the generated images remain within the target distribution, we dynamically adjust the guidance weight based on each image's CLIPScore to control the diversity. Experimental results show that our method produces synthetic images with enhanced diversity while maintaining adherence to the target distribution. Consequently, our approach proves to be more efficient in the few-shot setting on several benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/kkyuhun94/dalda .

- **Summary**: Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that capture the intensity changes asynchronously and output event streams with distinct advantages, such as high temporal resolution. To exploit event cameras for object/action recognition, existing methods predominantly sample and aggregate events in a second-level duration at every fixed temporal interval (or frequency). However, they often face difficulties in capturing the spatiotemporal relationships for longer, e.g., minute-level, events and generalizing across varying temporal frequencies. To fill the gap, we present a novel framework, dubbed PAST-SSM, exhibiting superior capacity in recognizing events with arbitrary duration (e.g., 0.1s to 4.5s) and generalizing to varying inference frequencies. Our key insight is to learn the spatiotemporal relationships from the encoded event features via the state space model (SSM) -- whose linear complexity makes it ideal for modeling high temporal resolution events with longer sequences. To achieve this goal, we first propose a Path-Adaptive Event Aggregation and Scan (PEAS) module to encode events of varying duration into features with fixed dimensions by adaptively scanning and selecting aggregated event frames. On top of PEAS, we introduce a novel Multi-faceted Selection Guiding (MSG) loss to minimize the randomness and redundancy of the encoded features. This subtly enhances the model generalization across different inference frequencies. Lastly, the SSM is employed to better learn the spatiotemporal properties from the encoded features. Moreover, we build a minute-level event-based recognition dataset, named ArDVS100, with arbitrary duration for the benefit of the community. Extensive experiments prove that our method outperforms prior arts by +3.45%, +0.38% and +8.31% on the DVS Action, SeAct and HARDVS datasets, respectively.

- **Summary**: Autonomous robots are being employed in several mapping and data collection tasks due to their efficiency and low labor costs. In these tasks, the robots are required to map targets-of-interest in an unknown environment while constrained to a given resource budget such as path length or mission time. This is a challenging problem as each robot has to not only detect and avoid collisions from static obstacles in the environment but also has to model other robots' trajectories to avoid inter-robot collisions. We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach for multi-robot informative path planning to map targets-of-interest in an unknown 3D environment. A key aspect of our approach is an augmented graph that models other robots' trajectories to enable planning for communication and inter-robot collision avoidance. We train our decentralized reinforcement learning policy via the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. Once trained, our policy is also scalable to varying number of robots and does not require re-training. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art multi-robot target mapping approaches by 33.75% in terms of the number of discovered targets-of-interest.

- **Summary**: The creation of 3D human face avatars from a single unconstrained image is a fundamental task that underlies numerous real-world vision and graphics applications. Despite the significant progress made in generative models, existing methods are either less suited in design for human faces or fail to generalise from the restrictive training domain to unconstrained facial images. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, Gen3D-Face, which generates 3D human faces with unconstrained single image input within a multi-view consistent diffusion framework. Given a specific input image, our model first produces multi-view images, followed by neural surface construction. To incorporate face geometry information in a generalisable manner, we utilise input-conditioned mesh estimation instead of ground-truth mesh along with synthetic multi-view training data. Importantly, we introduce a multi-view joint generation scheme to enhance appearance consistency among different views. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt and benchmark for creating photorealistic 3D human face avatars from single images for generic human subject across domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous alternatives for out-of-domain singe image 3D face generation and top competition for in-domain setting.

- **Summary**: Accurate intra-operative Remaining Surgery Duration (RSD) predictions allow for anaesthetists to more accurately decide when to administer anaesthetic agents and drugs, as well as to notify hospital staff to send in the next patient. Therefore RSD plays an important role in improving patient care and minimising surgical theatre costs via efficient scheduling. In endoscopic pituitary surgery, it is uniquely challenging due to variable workflow sequences with a selection of optional steps contributing to high variability in surgery duration. This paper presents PitRSDNet for predicting RSD during pituitary surgery, a spatio-temporal neural network model that learns from historical data focusing on workflow sequences. PitRSDNet integrates workflow knowledge into RSD prediction in two forms: 1) multi-task learning for concurrently predicting step and RSD; and 2) incorporating prior steps as context in temporal learning and inference. PitRSDNet is trained and evaluated on a new endoscopic pituitary surgery dataset with 88 videos to show competitive performance improvements over previous statistical and machine learning methods. The findings also highlight how PitRSDNet improve RSD precision on outlier cases utilising the knowledge of prior steps.

- **Summary**: Robotic waste sorting poses significant challenges in both perception and manipulation, given the extreme variability of objects that should be recognized on a cluttered conveyor belt. While deep learning has proven effective in solving complex tasks, the necessity for extensive data collection and labeling limits its applicability in real-world scenarios like waste sorting. To tackle this issue, we introduce a data augmentation method based on a novel GAN architecture called wasteGAN. The proposed method allows to increase the performance of semantic segmentation models, starting from a very limited bunch of labeled examples, such as few as 100. The key innovations of wasteGAN include a novel loss function, a novel activation function, and a larger generator block. Overall, such innovations helps the network to learn from limited number of examples and synthesize data that better mirrors real-world distributions. We then leverage the higher-quality segmentation masks predicted from models trained on the wasteGAN synthetic data to compute semantic-aware grasp poses, enabling a robotic arm to effectively recognizing contaminants and separating waste in a real-world scenario. Through comprehensive evaluation encompassing dataset-based assessments and real-world experiments, our methodology demonstrated promising potential for robotic waste sorting, yielding performance gains of up to 5.8\% in picking contaminants.

- **Summary**: Optical flow has made great progress in clean scenes, while suffers degradation under adverse weather due to the violation of the brightness constancy and gradient continuity assumptions of optical flow. Typically, existing methods mainly adopt domain adaptation to transfer motion knowledge from clean to degraded domain through one-stage adaptation. However, this direct adaptation is ineffective, since there exists a large gap due to adverse weather and scene style between clean and real degraded domains. Moreover, even within the degraded domain itself, static weather (e.g., fog) and dynamic weather (e.g., rain) have different impacts on optical flow. To address above issues, we explore synthetic degraded domain as an intermediate bridge between clean and real degraded domains, and propose a cumulative homogeneous-heterogeneous adaptation framework for real adverse weather optical flow. Specifically, for clean-degraded transfer, our key insight is that static weather possesses the depth-association homogeneous feature which does not change the intrinsic motion of the scene, while dynamic weather additionally introduces the heterogeneous feature which results in a significant boundary discrepancy in warp errors between clean and degraded domains. For synthetic-real transfer, we figure out that cost volume correlation shares a similar statistical histogram between synthetic and real degraded domains, benefiting to holistically aligning the homogeneous correlation distribution for synthetic-real knowledge distillation. Under this unified framework, the proposed method can progressively and explicitly transfer knowledge from clean scenes to real adverse weather. In addition, we further collect a real adverse weather dataset with manually annotated optical flow labels and perform extensive experiments to verify the superiority of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: We introduce Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a novel approach that enhances the computational efficiency of CNNs by selectively processing channels based on their relevance to the current prediction. This method optimizes computational resources by dynamically selecting key channels in feature maps for focused processing within the convolutional blocks (Conv-Blocks), while skipping less relevant channels. Unlike conditional computation methods that require dynamic computation graphs, CNN MoD uses a static computation graph with fixed tensor sizes which improve hardware efficiency. It speeds up the training and inference processes without the need for customized CUDA kernels, unique loss functions, or finetuning. CNN MoD either matches the performance of traditional CNNs with reduced inference times, GMACs, and parameters, or exceeds their performance while maintaining similar inference times, GMACs, and parameters. For example, on ImageNet, ResNet86-MoD exceeds the performance of the standard ResNet50 by 0.45% with a 6% speedup on CPU and 5% on GPU. Moreover, ResNet75-MoD achieves the same performance as ResNet50 with a 25% speedup on CPU and 15% on GPU.

- **Summary**: Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, taking 17.9 million lives annually. Abdominal Aortic Calcification (AAC) is an established marker for CVD, which can be observed in lateral view Vertebral Fracture Assessment (VFA) scans, usually done for vertebral fracture detection. Early detection of AAC may help reduce the risk of developing clinical CVDs by encouraging preventive measures. Manual analysis of VFA scans for AAC measurement is time consuming and requires trained human assessors. Recently, efforts have been made to automate the process, however, the proposed models are either low in accuracy, lack granular level score prediction, or are too heavy in terms of inference time and memory footprint. Considering all these shortcomings of existing algorithms, we propose 'AACLiteNet', a lightweight deep learning model that predicts both cumulative and granular level AAC scores with high accuracy, and also has a low memory footprint, and computation cost (Floating Point Operations (FLOPs)). The AACLiteNet achieves a significantly improved one-vs-rest average accuracy of 85.94% as compared to the previous best 81.98%, with 19.88 times less computational cost and 2.26 times less memory footprint, making it implementable on portable computing devices.

- **Summary**: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), aims to segment the object referred by a given sentence in an image by understanding both visual and linguistic information. However, existing RIS methods tend to explore top-performance models, disregarding considerations for practical applications on resources-limited edge devices. This oversight poses a significant challenge for on-device RIS inference. To this end, we propose an effective and efficient post-training quantization framework termed PTQ4RIS. Specifically, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the root causes of performance degradation in RIS model quantization and propose dual-region quantization (DRQ) and reorder-based outlier-retained quantization (RORQ) to address the quantization difficulties in visual and text encoders. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks with different bits settings (from 8 to 4 bits) demonstrates its superior performance. Importantly, we are the first PTQ method specifically designed for the RIS task, highlighting the feasibility of PTQ in RIS applications. Code will be available at {https://github.com/gugu511yy/PTQ4RIS}.

This paper proposes several innovative ideas for detecting inpainting forgeries based on low level noise analysis by combining Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) for feature extraction with convolutional neural networks (CNN) for forged area detection and localization, and lastly by employing an innovative combination of texture segmentation with noise variance estimations. The DT-CWT offers significant advantages due to its shift-invariance, enhancing its robustness against subtle manipulations during the inpainting process. Furthermore, its directional selectivity allows for the detection of subtle artifacts introduced by inpainting within specific frequency bands and orientations. Various neural network architectures were evaluated and proposed. Lastly, we propose a fusion detection module that combines texture analysis with noise variance estimation to give the forged area. Our approach was benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods and demonstrated superior performance over all cited alternatives.

- **Summary**: Improved surgical skill is generally associated with improved patient outcomes, although assessment is subjective; labour-intensive; and requires domain specific expertise. Automated data driven metrics can alleviate these difficulties, as demonstrated by existing machine learning instrument tracking models in minimally invasive surgery. However, these models have been tested on limited datasets of laparoscopic surgery, with a focus on isolated tasks and robotic surgery. In this paper, a new public dataset is introduced, focusing on simulated surgery, using the nasal phase of endoscopic pituitary surgery as an exemplar. Simulated surgery allows for a realistic yet repeatable environment, meaning the insights gained from automated assessment can be used by novice surgeons to hone their skills on the simulator before moving to real surgery. PRINTNet (Pituitary Real-time INstrument Tracking Network) has been created as a baseline model for this automated assessment. Consisting of DeepLabV3 for classification and segmentation; StrongSORT for tracking; and the NVIDIA Holoscan SDK for real-time performance, PRINTNet achieved 71.9% Multiple Object Tracking Precision running at 22 Frames Per Second. Using this tracking output, a Multilayer Perceptron achieved 87% accuracy in predicting surgical skill level (novice or expert), with the "ratio of total procedure time to instrument visible time" correlated with higher surgical skill. This therefore demonstrates the feasibility of automated surgical skill assessment in simulated endoscopic pituitary surgery.

- **Summary**: Event cameras are innovative neuromorphic sensors that asynchronously capture the scene dynamics. Due to the event-triggering mechanism, such cameras record event streams with much shorter response latency and higher intensity sensitivity compared to conventional cameras. On the basis of these features, previous works have attempted to reconstruct high dynamic range (HDR) videos from events, but have either suffered from unrealistic artifacts or failed to provide sufficiently high frame rates. In this paper, we present a recurrent convolutional neural network that reconstruct high-speed HDR videos from event sequences, with a key frame guidance to prevent potential error accumulation caused by the sparse event data. Additionally, to address the problem of severely limited real dataset, we develop a new optical system to collect a real-world dataset with paired high-speed HDR videos and event streams, facilitating future research in this field. Our dataset provides the first real paired dataset for event-to-HDR reconstruction, avoiding potential inaccuracies from simulation strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate high-quality, high-speed HDR videos. We further explore the potential of our work in cross-camera reconstruction and downstream computer vision tasks, including object detection, panoramic segmentation, optical flow estimation, and monocular depth estimation under HDR scenarios.



### GeoBiked: A Dataset with Geometric Features and Automated Labeling Techniques to Enable Deep Generative Models in Engineering Design

- **Summary**: We provide a dataset for enabling Deep Generative Models (DGMs) in engineering design and propose methods to automate data labeling by utilizing large-scale foundation models. GeoBiked is curated to contain 4 355 bicycle images, annotated with structural and technical features and is used to investigate two automated labeling techniques: The utilization of consolidated latent features (Hyperfeatures) from image-generation models to detect geometric correspondences (e.g. the position of the wheel center) in structural images and the generation of diverse text descriptions for structural images. GPT-4o, a vision-language-model (VLM), is instructed to analyze images and produce diverse descriptions aligned with the system-prompt. By representing technical images as Diffusion-Hyperfeatures, drawing geometric correspondences between them is possible. The detection accuracy of geometric points in unseen samples is improved by presenting multiple annotated source images. GPT-4o has sufficient capabilities to generate accurate descriptions of technical images. Grounding the generation only on images leads to diverse descriptions but causes hallucinations, while grounding it on categorical labels restricts the diversity. Using both as input balances creativity and accuracy. Successfully using Hyperfeatures for geometric correspondence suggests that this approach can be used for general point-detection and annotation tasks in technical images. Labeling such images with text descriptions using VLMs is possible, but dependent on the models detection capabilities, careful prompt-engineering and the selection of input information. Applying foundation models in engineering design is largely unexplored. We aim to bridge this gap with a dataset to explore training, finetuning and conditioning DGMs in this field and suggesting approaches to bootstrap foundation models to process technical images.

- **Summary**: Volunteer Geographic Information (VGI), with its rich variety, large volume, rapid updates, and diverse sources, has become a critical source of geospatial data. However, VGI data from platforms like OSM exhibit significant quality heterogeneity across different data types, particularly with urban building data. To address this, we propose a multi-source geographic data transformation solution, utilizing accessible and complete VGI data to assist in generating urban building footprint data. We also employ a multimodal data generation framework to improve accuracy. First, we introduce a pipeline for constructing an 'image-text-metadata-building footprint' dataset, primarily based on road network data and supplemented by other multimodal data. We then present ControlCity, a geographic data transformation method based on a multimodal diffusion model. This method first uses a pre-trained text-to-image model to align text, metadata, and building footprint data. An improved ControlNet further integrates road network and land-use imagery, producing refined building footprint data. Experiments across 22 global cities demonstrate that ControlCity successfully simulates real urban building patterns, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, our method achieves an average FID score of 50.94, reducing error by 71.01% compared to leading methods, and a MIoU score of 0.36, an improvement of 38.46%. Additionally, our model excels in tasks like urban morphology transfer, zero-shot city generation, and spatial data completeness assessment. In the zero-shot city task, our method accurately predicts and generates similar urban structures, demonstrating strong generalization. This study confirms the effectiveness of our approach in generating urban building footprint data and capturing complex city characteristics.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) methods have achieved remarkable success by leveraging large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models as priors. However, these methods still face two challenges: the requirement for dozens of sampling steps to achieve satisfactory results, which limits efficiency in real scenarios, and the neglect of degradation models, which are critical auxiliary information in solving the SR problem. In this work, we introduced a novel one-step SR model, which significantly addresses the efficiency issue of diffusion-based SR methods. Unlike existing fine-tuning strategies, we designed a degradation-guided Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module specifically for SR, which corrects the model parameters based on the pre-estimated degradation information from low-resolution images. This module not only facilitates a powerful data-dependent or degradation-dependent SR model but also preserves the generative prior of the pre-trained diffusion model as much as possible. Furthermore, we tailor a novel training pipeline by introducing an online negative sample generation strategy. Combined with the classifier-free guidance strategy during inference, it largely improves the perceptual quality of the super-resolution results. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superior efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models have shown immense promise in computational pathology (CPath) tasks, but their performance often suffers when applied to unseen data due to domain shifts. Addressing this requires domain generalization (DG) algorithms. However, a systematic evaluation of DG algorithms in the CPath context is lacking. This study aims to benchmark the effectiveness of 30 DG algorithms on 3 CPath tasks of varying difficulty through 7,560 cross-validation runs. We evaluate these algorithms using a unified and robust platform, incorporating modality-specific techniques and recent advances like pretrained foundation models. Our extensive cross-validation experiments provide insights into the relative performance of various DG strategies. We observe that self-supervised learning and stain augmentation consistently outperform other methods, highlighting the potential of pretrained models and data augmentation. Furthermore, we introduce a new pan-cancer tumor detection dataset (HISTOPANTUM) as a benchmark for future research. This study offers valuable guidance to researchers in selecting appropriate DG approaches for CPath tasks.

- **Summary**: The subjective quality of natural signals can be approximated with objective perceptual metrics. Designed to approximate the perceptual behaviour of human observers, perceptual metrics often reflect structures found in natural signals and neurological pathways. Models trained with perceptual metrics as loss functions can capture perceptually meaningful features from the structures held within these metrics. We demonstrate that using features extracted from autoencoders trained with perceptual losses can improve performance on music understanding tasks, i.e. genre classification, over using these metrics directly as distances when learning a classifier. This result suggests improved generalisation to novel signals when using perceptual metrics as loss functions for representation learning.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have become state-of-the-art for many computer vision tasks, with in-context learning (ICL) as a popular adaptation strategy for new ones. But can VLMs learn novel concepts purely from visual demonstrations, or are they limited to adapting to the output format of ICL examples? We propose a new benchmark we call Spatial Visual Ambiguity Tasks (SVAT) that challenges state-of-the-art VLMs to learn new visuospatial tasks in-context. We find that VLMs fail to do this zero-shot, and sometimes continue to fail after finetuning. However, adding simpler data to the training by curriculum learning leads to improved ICL performance.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art computer vision tasks, like monocular depth estimation (MDE), rely heavily on large, modern Transformer-based architectures. However, their application in safety-critical domains demands reliable predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. While Bayesian neural networks provide a conceptually simple approach to serve those requirements, they suffer from the high dimensionality of the parameter space. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, in particular low-rank adaptations (LoRA), have emerged as a popular strategy for adapting large-scale models to down-stream tasks by performing parameter inference on lower-dimensional subspaces. In this work, we investigate the suitability of PEFT methods for subspace Bayesian inference in large-scale Transformer-based vision models. We show that, indeed, combining BitFit, DiffFit, LoRA, and CoLoRA, a novel LoRA-inspired PEFT method, with Bayesian inference enables more robust and reliable predictive performance in MDE.

- **Summary**: Due to intensive genetic selection for rapid growth rates and high broiler yields in recent years, the global poultry industry has faced a challenging problem in the form of woody breast (WB) conditions. This condition has caused significant economic losses as high as $200 million annually, and the root cause of WB has yet to be identified. Human palpation is the most common method of distinguishing a WB from others. However, this method is time-consuming and subjective. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) combined with machine learning algorithms can evaluate the WB conditions of fillets in a non-invasive, objective, and high-throughput manner. In this study, 250 raw chicken breast fillet samples (normal, mild, severe) were taken, and spatially heterogeneous hardness distribution was first considered when designing HSI processing models. The study not only classified the WB levels from HSI but also built a regression model to correlate the spectral information with sample hardness data. To achieve a satisfactory classification and regression model, a neural network architecture search (NAS) enabled a wide-deep neural network model named NAS-WD, which was developed. In NAS-WD, NAS was first used to automatically optimize the network architecture and hyperparameters. The classification results show that NAS-WD can classify the three WB levels with an overall accuracy of 95%, outperforming the traditional machine learning model, and the regression correlation between the spectral data and hardness was 0.75, which performs significantly better than traditional regression models.

- **Summary**: In the medical field, the limited availability of large-scale datasets and labor-intensive annotation processes hinder the performance of deep models. Diffusion-based generative augmentation approaches present a promising solution to this issue, having been proven effective in advancing downstream medical recognition tasks. Nevertheless, existing works lack sufficient semantic and sequential steerability for challenging video/3D sequence generation, and neglect quality control of noisy synthesized samples, resulting in unreliable synthetic databases and severely limiting the performance of downstream tasks. In this work, we present Ctrl-GenAug, a novel and general generative augmentation framework that enables highly semantic- and sequential-customized sequence synthesis and suppresses incorrectly synthesized samples, to aid medical sequence classification. Specifically, we first design a multimodal conditions-guided sequence generator for controllably synthesizing diagnosis-promotive samples. A sequential augmentation module is integrated to enhance the temporal/stereoscopic coherence of generated samples. Then, we propose a noisy synthetic data filter to suppress unreliable cases at semantic and sequential levels. Extensive experiments on 3 medical datasets, using 11 networks trained on 3 paradigms, comprehensively analyze the effectiveness and generality of Ctrl-GenAug, particularly in underrepresented high-risk populations and out-domain conditions.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful for cognitive tasks such as image classification, object detection, and scene segmentation. One drawback however is the significant high computational complexity and memory consumption, which makes them unfeasible to run real-time on embedded platforms because of the limited hardware resources. Block floating point (BFP) quantization is one of the representative compression approaches for reducing the memory and computational burden owing to their capability to effectively capture the broad data distribution of DNN models. Unfortunately, prior works on BFP-based quantization empirically choose the block size and the precision that preserve accuracy. In this paper, we develop a BFP-based bitwidth-aware analytical modeling framework (called ``BitQ'') for the best BFP implementation of DNN inference on embedded platforms. We formulate and resolve an optimization problem to identify the optimal BFP block size and bitwidth distribution by the trade-off of both accuracy and performance loss. Experimental results show that compared with an equal bitwidth setting, the BFP DNNs with optimized bitwidth allocation provide efficient computation, preserving accuracy on famous benchmarks.

- **Summary**: We introduce a general detection-based approach to text line recognition, be it printed (OCR) or handwritten (HTR), with Latin, Chinese, or ciphered characters. Detection-based approaches have until now been largely discarded for HTR because reading characters separately is often challenging, and character-level annotation is difficult and expensive. We overcome these challenges thanks to three main insights: (i) synthetic pre-training with sufficiently diverse data enables learning reasonable character localization for any script; (ii) modern transformer-based detectors can jointly detect a large number of instances, and, if trained with an adequate masking strategy, leverage consistency between the different detections; (iii) once a pre-trained detection model with approximate character localization is available, it is possible to fine-tune it with line-level annotation on real data, even with a different alphabet. Our approach, dubbed DTLR, builds on a completely different paradigm than state-of-the-art HTR methods, which rely on autoregressive decoding, predicting character values one by one, while we treat a complete line in parallel. Remarkably, we demonstrate good performance on a large range of scripts, usually tackled with specialized approaches. In particular, we improve state-of-the-art performances for Chinese script recognition on the CASIA v2 dataset, and for cipher recognition on the Borg and Copiale datasets. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/raphael-baena/DTLR.

- **Summary**: Prototyping complex computer-aided design (CAD) models in modern softwares can be very time-consuming. This is due to the lack of intelligent systems that can quickly generate simpler intermediate parts. We propose Text2CAD, the first AI framework for generating text-to-parametric CAD models using designer-friendly instructions for all skill levels. Furthermore, we introduce a data annotation pipeline for generating text prompts based on natural language instructions for the DeepCAD dataset using Mistral and LLaVA-NeXT. The dataset contains $\sim170$K models and $\sim660$K text annotations, from abstract CAD descriptions (e.g., generate two concentric cylinders) to detailed specifications (e.g., draw two circles with center $(x,y)$ and radius $r_{1}$, $r_{2}$, and extrude along the normal by $d$...). Within the Text2CAD framework, we propose an end-to-end transformer-based auto-regressive network to generate parametric CAD models from input texts. We evaluate the performance of our model through a mixture of metrics, including visual quality, parametric precision, and geometrical accuracy. Our proposed framework shows great potential in AI-aided design applications. Our source code and annotations will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Ontological commitment, i.e., used concepts, relations, and assumptions, are a corner stone of qualitative reasoning (QR) models. The state-of-the-art for processing raw inputs, though, are deep neural networks (DNNs), nowadays often based off from multimodal foundation models. These automatically learn rich representations of concepts and respective reasoning. Unfortunately, the learned qualitative knowledge is opaque, preventing easy inspection, validation, or adaptation against available QR models. So far, it is possible to associate pre-defined concepts with latent representations of DNNs, but extractable relations are mostly limited to semantic similarity. As a next step towards QR for validation and verification of DNNs: Concretely, we propose a method that extracts the learned superclass hierarchy from a multimodal DNN for a given set of leaf concepts. Under the hood we (1) obtain leaf concept embeddings using the DNN's textual input modality; (2) apply hierarchical clustering to them, using that DNNs encode semantic similarities via vector distances; and (3) label the such-obtained parent concepts using search in available ontologies from QR. An initial evaluation study shows that meaningful ontological class hierarchies can be extracted from state-of-the-art foundation models. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to validate and verify a DNN's learned representations against given ontologies. Lastly, we discuss potential future applications in the context of QR.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has revolutionized medical and biological imaging, particularly in segmentation tasks. However, segmenting biological cells remains challenging due to the high variability and complexity of cell shapes. Addressing this challenge requires high-quality datasets that accurately represent the diverse morphologies found in biological cells. Existing cell segmentation datasets are often limited by their focus on regular and uniform shapes. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset of Ntera-2 (NT2) cells, a pluripotent carcinoma cell line, exhibiting diverse morphologies across multiple stages of differentiation, capturing the intricate and heterogeneous cellular structures that complicate segmentation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware deep learning framework for complex cellular morphology segmentation (MorphoSeg) by incorporating sampling of virtual outliers from low-likelihood regions during training. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate that MorphoSeg significantly enhances segmentation accuracy, achieving up to a 7.74% increase in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and a 28.36% reduction in the Hausdorff Distance. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our dataset and methodology in advancing cell segmentation capabilities, especially for complex and variable cell morphologies. The dataset and source code is publicly available at https://github.com/RanchoGoose/MorphoSeg.

- **Summary**: Early detection of diseases in crops is essential to prevent harvest losses and improve the quality of the final product. In this context, the combination of machine learning and proximity sensors is emerging as a technique capable of achieving this detection efficiently and effectively. For example, this machine learning approach has been applied to potato crops -- to detect late blight (Phytophthora infestans) -- and grapevine crops -- to detect downy mildew. However, most of these AI models found in the specialised literature have been developed using leaf-by-leaf images taken in the lab, which does not represent field conditions and limits their applicability.   In this study, we present the first machine learning model capable of detecting mild symptoms of late blight in potato crops through the analysis of high-resolution RGB images captured directly in the field, overcoming the limitations of other publications in the literature and presenting real-world applicability. Our proposal exploits the availability of high-resolution images via the concept of patching, and is based on deep convolutional neural networks with a focal loss function, which makes the model to focus on the complex patterns that arise in field conditions. Additionally, we present a data augmentation scheme that facilitates the training of these neural networks with few high-resolution images, which allows for development of models under the small data paradigm.   Our model correctly detects all cases of late blight in the test dataset, demonstrating a high level of accuracy and effectiveness in identifying early symptoms. These promising results reinforce the potential use of machine learning for the early detection of diseases and pests in agriculture, enabling better treatment and reducing their impact on crops.

- **Summary**: Prostate cancer ranks among the leading health issues impacting men, with the Gleason scoring system serving as the primary method for diagnosis and prognosis. This system relies on expert pathologists to evaluate samples of prostate tissue and assign a Gleason grade, a task that requires significant time and manual effort. To address this challenge, artificial intelligence (AI) solutions have been explored to automate the grading process. In light of these challenges, this study evaluates and compares the effectiveness of three deep learning methodologies, YOLO, Vision Transformers, and Vision Mamba, in accurately classifying Gleason grades from histopathology images. The goal is to enhance diagnostic precision and efficiency in prostate cancer management. This study utilized two publicly available datasets, Gleason2019 and SICAPv2, to train and test the performance of YOLO, Vision Transformers, and Vision Mamba models. Each model was assessed based on its ability to classify Gleason grades accurately, considering metrics such as false positive rate, false negative rate, precision, and recall. The study also examined the computational efficiency and applicability of each method in a clinical setting. Vision Mamba demonstrated superior performance across all metrics, achieving high precision and recall rates while minimizing false positives and negatives. YOLO showed promise in terms of speed and efficiency, particularly beneficial for real-time analysis. Vision Transformers excelled in capturing long-range dependencies within images, although they presented higher computational complexity compared to the other models. Vision Mamba emerges as the most effective model for Gleason grade classification in histopathology images, offering a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are a novel paradigm for signal representation that have attracted considerable interest for image compression. INRs offer unprecedented advantages in signal resolution and memory efficiency, enabling new possibilities for compression techniques. However, the existing limitations of INRs for image compression have not been sufficiently addressed in the literature. In this work, we explore the critical yet overlooked limiting factors of INRs, such as computational cost, unstable performance, and robustness. Through extensive experiments and empirical analysis, we provide a deeper and more nuanced understanding of implicit neural image compression methods such as Fourier Feature Networks and Siren. Our work also offers valuable insights for future research in this area.

- **Summary**: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) effectively adapts pre-trained vision transformers to downstream tasks. However, the optimization for tasks performance often comes at the cost of generalizability in fine-tuned models. To address this issue, we theoretically connect smaller weight gradient norms during training and larger datasets to the improved model generalization. Motivated by this connection, we propose reducing gradient norms for enhanced generalization and aligning fine-tuned model with the pre-trained counterpart to retain knowledge from large-scale pre-training data. Yet, naive alignment does not guarantee gradient reduction and can potentially cause gradient explosion, complicating efforts to manage gradients. To address such issues, we propose PACE, marrying generalization of PArameter-efficient fine-tuning with Consistency rEgularization. We perturb features learned from the adapter with the multiplicative noise and ensure the fine-tuned model remains consistent for same sample under different perturbations. Theoretical analysis shows that PACE not only implicitly regularizes gradients for enhanced generalization, but also implicitly aligns the fine-tuned and pre-trained models to retain knowledge. Experimental evidence supports our theories. PACE outperforms existing PEFT methods in four visual adaptation tasks: VTAB-1k, FGVC, few-shot learning and domain adaptation.

- **Summary**: Compared with Large Language Models (LLMs), Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can also accept images as input, thus showcasing more interesting emergent capabilities and demonstrating impressive performance on various vision-language tasks. Motivated by text prompting in LLMs, visual prompting has been explored to enhance LVLMs' capabilities of perceiving visual information. However, previous visual prompting techniques solely process visual inputs without considering text queries, limiting the models' ability to follow text instructions to complete tasks. To fill this gap, in this work, we propose a new prompting technique named Attention Prompting on Image, which just simply overlays a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original input image and effectively enhances LVLM on various tasks. Specifically, we generate an attention heatmap for the input image dependent on the text query with an auxiliary model like CLIP. Then the heatmap simply multiplies the pixel values of the original image to obtain the actual input image for the LVLM. Extensive experiments on various vison-language benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our technique. For example, Attention Prompting on Image improves LLaVA-1.5 by 3.8% and 2.9% on MM-Vet and LLaVA-Wild benchmarks, respectively.

- **Summary**: Leveraging pretrained 2D diffusion models and score distillation sampling (SDS), recent methods have shown promising results for text-to-3D avatar generation. However, generating high-quality 3D avatars capable of expressive animation remains challenging. In this work, we present DreamWaltz-G, a novel learning framework for animatable 3D avatar generation from text. The core of this framework lies in Skeleton-guided Score Distillation and Hybrid 3D Gaussian Avatar representation. Specifically, the proposed skeleton-guided score distillation integrates skeleton controls from 3D human templates into 2D diffusion models, enhancing the consistency of SDS supervision in terms of view and human pose. This facilitates the generation of high-quality avatars, mitigating issues such as multiple faces, extra limbs, and blurring. The proposed hybrid 3D Gaussian avatar representation builds on the efficient 3D Gaussians, combining neural implicit fields and parameterized 3D meshes to enable real-time rendering, stable SDS optimization, and expressive animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamWaltz-G is highly effective in generating and animating 3D avatars, outperforming existing methods in both visual quality and animation expressiveness. Our framework further supports diverse applications, including human video reenactment and multi-subject scene composition.

- **Summary**: Today's most advanced multimodal models remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models rely heavily on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs to achieve good performance, effectively distilling these closed models into open ones. As a result, the community is still missing foundational knowledge about how to build performant VLMs from scratch. We present Molmo, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art in their class of openness. Our key innovation is a novel, highly detailed image caption dataset collected entirely from human annotators using speech-based descriptions. To enable a wide array of user interactions, we also introduce a diverse dataset mixture for fine-tuning that includes in-the-wild Q&A and innovative 2D pointing data. The success of our approach relies on careful choices for the model architecture details, a well-tuned training pipeline, and, most critically, the quality of our newly collected datasets, all of which will be released. The best-in-class 72B model within the Molmo family not only outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models but also compares favorably against proprietary systems like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.5 on both academic benchmarks and human evaluation.   We will be releasing all of our model weights, captioning and fine-tuning data, and source code in the near future.

- **Summary**: The supervision of state-of-the-art multiple object tracking (MOT) methods requires enormous annotation efforts to provide bounding boxes for all frames of all videos, and instance IDs to associate them through time. To this end, we introduce Walker, the first self-supervised tracker that learns from videos with sparse bounding box annotations, and no tracking labels. First, we design a quasi-dense temporal object appearance graph, and propose a novel multi-positive contrastive objective to optimize random walks on the graph and learn instance similarities. Then, we introduce an algorithm to enforce mutually-exclusive connective properties across instances in the graph, optimizing the learned topology for MOT. At inference time, we propose to associate detected instances to tracklets based on the max-likelihood transition state under motion-constrained bi-directional walks. Walker is the first self-supervised tracker to achieve competitive performance on MOT17, DanceTrack, and BDD100K. Remarkably, our proposal outperforms the previous self-supervised trackers even when drastically reducing the annotation requirements by up to 400x.

- **Summary**: Video super-resolution (VSR) is a critical task for enhancing low-bitrate and low-resolution videos, particularly in streaming applications. While numerous solutions have been developed, they often suffer from high computational demands, resulting in low frame rates (FPS) and poor power efficiency, especially on mobile platforms. In this work, we compile different methods to address these challenges, the solutions are end-to-end real-time video super-resolution frameworks optimized for both high performance and low runtime. We also introduce a new test set of high-quality 4K videos to further validate the approaches. The proposed solutions tackle video up-scaling for two applications: 540p to 4K (x4) as a general case, and 360p to 1080p (x3) more tailored towards mobile devices. In both tracks, the solutions have a reduced number of parameters and operations (MACs), allow high FPS, and improve VMAF and PSNR over interpolation baselines. This report gauges some of the most efficient video super-resolution methods to date.

- **Summary**: Tumors in the brain result from abnormal cell growth within the brain tissue, arising from various types of brain cells. When left undiagnosed, they lead to severe neurological deficits such as cognitive impairment, motor dysfunction, and sensory loss. As the tumor grows, it causes an increase in intracranial pressure, potentially leading to life-threatening complications such as brain herniation. Therefore, early detection and treatment are necessary to manage the complications caused by such tumors to slow down their growth. Numerous works involving deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI) are being carried out to assist physicians in early diagnosis by utilizing the scans obtained through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Our research proposes DL frameworks for localizing, segmenting, and classifying the grade of these gliomas from MRI images to solve this critical issue. In our localization framework, we enhance the LinkNet framework with a VGG19- inspired encoder architecture for improved multimodal tumor feature extraction, along with spatial and graph attention mechanisms to refine feature focus and inter-feature relationships. Following this, we integrated the SeResNet101 CNN model as the encoder backbone into the LinkNet framework for tumor segmentation, which achieved an IoU Score of 96%. To classify the segmented tumors, we combined the SeResNet152 feature extractor with an Adaptive Boosting classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 98.53%. Our proposed models demonstrated promising results, with the potential to advance medical AI by enabling early diagnosis and providing more accurate treatment options for patients.

- **Summary**: We present \textbf{Disco4D}, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework for 4D human generation and animation from a single image. Different from existing methods, Disco4D distinctively disentangles clothings (with Gaussian models) from the human body (with SMPL-X model), significantly enhancing the generation details and flexibility. It has the following technical innovations. \textbf{1)} Disco4D learns to efficiently fit the clothing Gaussians over the SMPL-X Gaussians. \textbf{2)} It adopts diffusion models to enhance the 3D generation process, \textit{e.g.}, modeling occluded parts not visible in the input image. \textbf{3)} It learns an identity encoding for each clothing Gaussian to facilitate the separation and extraction of clothing assets. Furthermore, Disco4D naturally supports 4D human animation with vivid dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Disco4D on 4D human generation and animation tasks.

- **Summary**: This study presents a novel evaluation framework for the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) task. It aims to diagnose current models for various instruction categories at a finer-grained level. The framework is structured around the context-free grammar (CFG) of the task. The CFG serves as the basis for the problem decomposition and the core premise of the instruction categories design. We propose a semi-automatic method for CFG construction with the help of Large-Language Models (LLMs). Then, we induct and generate data spanning five principal instruction categories (i.e. direction change, landmark recognition, region recognition, vertical movement, and numerical comprehension). Our analysis of different models reveals notable performance discrepancies and recurrent issues. The stagnation of numerical comprehension, heavy selective biases over directional concepts, and other interesting findings contribute to the development of future language-guided navigation systems.

- **Summary**: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is gaining prominence for its non-invasive approach to monitoring physiological signals using only cameras. Despite its promise, the adaptability of rPPG models to new, unseen domains is hindered due to the environmental sensitivity of physiological signals. To address this, we pioneer the Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) in rPPG, enabling the adaptation of pre-trained models to the target domain during inference, sidestepping the need for annotations or source data due to privacy considerations. Particularly, utilizing only the user's face video stream as the accessible target domain data, the rPPG model is adjusted by tuning on each single instance it encounters. However, 1) TTA algorithms are designed predominantly for classification tasks, ill-suited in regression tasks such as rPPG due to inadequate supervision. 2) Tuning pre-trained models in a single-instance manner introduces variability and instability, posing challenges to effectively filtering domain-relevant from domain-irrelevant features while simultaneously preserving the learned information. To overcome these challenges, we present Bi-TTA, a novel expert knowledge-based Bidirectional Test-Time Adapter framework. Specifically, leveraging two expert-knowledge priors for providing self-supervision, our Bi-TTA primarily comprises two modules: a prospective adaptation (PA) module using sharpness-aware minimization to eliminate domain-irrelevant noise, enhancing the stability and efficacy during the adaptation process, and a retrospective stabilization (RS) module to dynamically reinforce crucial learned model parameters, averting performance degradation caused by overfitting or catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we established a large-scale benchmark for rPPG tasks under TTA protocol. The experimental results demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation networks have achieved significant success under the assumption of independent and identically distributed data. However, these networks often struggle to detect anomalies from unknown semantic classes due to the limited set of visual concepts they are typically trained on. To address this issue, anomaly segmentation often involves fine-tuning on outlier samples, necessitating additional efforts for data collection, labeling, and model retraining. Seeking to avoid this cumbersome work, we take a different approach and propose to incorporate Vision-Language (VL) encoders into existing anomaly detectors to leverage the semantically broad VL pre-training for improved outlier awareness. Additionally, we propose a new scoring function that enables data- and training-free outlier supervision via textual prompts. The resulting VL4AD model, which includes max-logit prompt ensembling and a class-merging strategy, achieves competitive performance on widely used benchmark datasets, thereby demonstrating the potential of vision-language models for pixel-wise anomaly detection.

- **Summary**: Cinematographers adeptly capture the essence of the world, crafting compelling visual narratives through intricate camera movements. Witnessing the strides made by large language models in perceiving and interacting with the 3D world, this study explores their capability to control cameras with human language guidance. We introduce ChatCam, a system that navigates camera movements through conversations with users, mimicking a professional cinematographer's workflow. To achieve this, we propose CineGPT, a GPT-based autoregressive model for text-conditioned camera trajectory generation. We also develop an Anchor Determinator to ensure precise camera trajectory placement. ChatCam understands user requests and employs our proposed tools to generate trajectories, which can be used to render high-quality video footage on radiance field representations. Our experiments, including comparisons to state-of-the-art approaches and user studies, demonstrate our approach's ability to interpret and execute complex instructions for camera operation, showing promising applications in real-world production settings.

- **Summary**: Integrating deep learning into medical imaging is poised to greatly advance diagnostic methods but it faces challenges with generalizability. Foundation models, based on self-supervised learning, address these issues and improve data efficiency. Natural domain foundation models show promise for medical imaging, but systematic research evaluating domain adaptation, especially using self-supervised learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, remains underexplored. Additionally, little research addresses the issue of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning of foundation models. We adapted the DINOv2 vision transformer for retinal imaging classification tasks using self-supervised learning and generated two novel foundation models termed DINORET and BE DINORET. Publicly available color fundus photographs were employed for model development and subsequent fine-tuning for diabetic retinopathy staging and glaucoma detection. We introduced block expansion as a novel domain adaptation strategy and assessed the models for catastrophic forgetting. Models were benchmarked to RETFound, a state-of-the-art foundation model in ophthalmology. DINORET and BE DINORET demonstrated competitive performance on retinal imaging tasks, with the block expanded model achieving the highest scores on most datasets. Block expansion successfully mitigated catastrophic forgetting. Our few-shot learning studies indicated that DINORET and BE DINORET outperform RETFound in terms of data-efficiency. This study highlights the potential of adapting natural domain vision models to retinal imaging using self-supervised learning and block expansion. BE DINORET offers robust performance without sacrificing previously acquired capabilities. Our findings suggest that these methods could enable healthcare institutions to develop tailored vision models for their patient populations, enhancing global healthcare inclusivity.

- **Summary**: Current video-based computer vision (CV) applications typically suffer from high energy consumption due to reading and processing all pixels in a frame, regardless of their significance. While previous works have attempted to reduce this energy by skipping input patches or pixels and using feedback from the end task to guide the skipping algorithm, the skipping is not performed during the sensor read phase. As a result, these methods can not optimize the front-end sensor energy. Moreover, they may not be suitable for real-time applications due to the long latency of modern CV networks that are deployed in the back-end. To address this challenge, this paper presents a custom-designed reconfigurable CMOS image sensor (CIS) system that improves energy efficiency by selectively skipping uneventful regions or rows within a frame during the sensor's readout phase, and the subsequent analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) phase. A novel masking algorithm intelligently directs the skipping process in real-time, optimizing both the front-end sensor and back-end neural networks for applications including autonomous driving and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR). Our system can also operate in standard mode without skipping, depending on application needs. We evaluate our hardware-algorithm co-design framework on object detection based on BDD100K and ImageNetVID, and gaze estimation based on OpenEDS, achieving up to 53% reduction in front-end sensor energy while maintaining state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy.

- **Summary**: We introduce SeaSplat, a method to enable real-time rendering of underwater scenes leveraging recent advances in 3D radiance fields. Underwater scenes are challenging visual environments, as rendering through a medium such as water introduces both range and color dependent effects on image capture. We constrain 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a recent advance in radiance fields enabling rapid training and real-time rendering of full 3D scenes, with a physically grounded underwater image formation model. Applying SeaSplat to the real-world scenes from SeaThru-NeRF dataset, a scene collected by an underwater vehicle in the US Virgin Islands, and simulation-degraded real-world scenes, not only do we see increased quantitative performance on rendering novel viewpoints from the scene with the medium present, but are also able to recover the underlying true color of the scene and restore renders to be without the presence of the intervening medium. We show that the underwater image formation helps learn scene structure, with better depth maps, as well as show that our improvements maintain the significant computational improvements afforded by leveraging a 3D Gaussian representation.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a vision-based framework for capturing and understanding human behavior in industrial assembly lines, focusing on car door manufacturing. The framework leverages advanced computer vision techniques to estimate workers' locations and 3D poses and analyze work postures, actions, and task progress. A key contribution is the introduction of the CarDA dataset, which contains domain-relevant assembly actions captured in a realistic setting to support the analysis of the framework for human pose and action analysis. The dataset comprises time-synchronized multi-camera RGB-D videos, motion capture data recorded in a real car manufacturing environment, and annotations for EAWS-based ergonomic risk scores and assembly activities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in classifying worker postures and robust performance in monitoring assembly task progress.

- **Summary**: In recent years, analysis of remote sensing data has benefited immensely from borrowing techniques from the broader field of computer vision, such as the use of shared models pre-trained on large and diverse datasets. However, satellite imagery has unique features that are not accounted for in traditional computer vision, such as the existence of multiple revisits of the same location. Here, we explore the best way to use revisits in the framework of fine-tuning pre-trained remote sensing models. We focus on an applied research question of relevance to climate change mitigation -- power substation segmentation -- that is representative of applied uses of pre-trained models more generally. Through extensive tests of different multi-temporal input schemes across diverse model architectures, we find that fusing representations from multiple revisits in the model latent space is superior to other methods of using revisits, including as a form of data augmentation. We also find that a SWIN Transformer-based architecture performs better than U-nets and ViT-based models. We verify the generality of our results on a separate building density estimation task.

- **Summary**: The world is moving towards clean and renewable energy sources, such as wind energy, in an attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. To enhance the analysis and storage of wind data, we introduce a deep learning framework designed to simultaneously enable effective dimensionality reduction and continuous representation of multi-altitude wind data from discrete observations. The framework consists of three key components: dimensionality reduction, cross-modal prediction, and super-resolution. We aim to: (1) improve data resolution across diverse climatic conditions to recover high-resolution details; (2) reduce data dimensionality for more efficient storage of large climate datasets; and (3) enable cross-prediction between wind data measured at different heights. Comprehensive testing confirms that our approach surpasses existing methods in both super-resolution quality and compression efficiency.

- **Summary**: Despite transformers being considered as the new standard in computer vision, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) still outperform them in low-data regimes. Nonetheless, CNNs often make decisions based on narrow, specific regions of input images, especially when training data is limited. This behavior can severely compromise the model's generalization capabilities, making it disproportionately dependent on certain features that might not represent the broader context of images. While the conditions leading to this phenomenon remain elusive, the primary intent of this article is to shed light on this observed behavior of neural networks. Our research endeavors to prioritize comprehensive insight and to outline an initial response to this phenomenon. In line with this, we introduce Saliency Guided Dropout (SGDrop), a pioneering regularization approach tailored to address this specific issue. SGDrop utilizes attribution methods on the feature map to identify and then reduce the influence of the most salient features during training. This process encourages the network to diversify its attention and not focus solely on specific standout areas. Our experiments across several visual classification benchmarks validate SGDrop's role in enhancing generalization. Significantly, models incorporating SGDrop display more expansive attributions and neural activity, offering a more comprehensive view of input images in contrast to their traditionally trained counterparts.

- **Summary**: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) plays a crucial role in vision-based Autonomous Driving (AD) systems. It utilizes a single-camera image to determine the depth of objects, facilitating driving decisions such as braking a few meters in front of a detected obstacle or changing lanes to avoid collision. In this paper, we investigate the security risks associated with monocular vision-based depth estimation algorithms utilized by AD systems. By exploiting the vulnerabilities of MDE and the principles of optical lenses, we introduce LensAttack, a physical attack that involves strategically placing optical lenses on the camera of an autonomous vehicle to manipulate the perceived object depths. LensAttack encompasses two attack formats: concave lens attack and convex lens attack, each utilizing different optical lenses to induce false depth perception. We begin by constructing a mathematical model of our attack, incorporating various attack parameters. Subsequently, we simulate the attack and evaluate its real-world performance in driving scenarios to demonstrate its effect on state-of-the-art MDE models. The results highlight the significant impact of LensAttack on the accuracy of depth estimation in AD systems.

- **Summary**: Modern vehicles are equipped with multiple information-collection devices such as sensors and cameras, continuously generating a large volume of raw data. Accurately predicting the trajectories of neighboring vehicles is a vital component in understanding the complex driving environment. Yet, training trajectory prediction models is challenging in two ways. Processing the large-scale data is computation-intensive. Moreover, easy-medium driving scenarios often overwhelmingly dominate the dataset, leaving challenging driving scenarios such as dense traffic under-represented. For example, in the Argoverse motion prediction dataset, there are very few instances with $\ge 50$ agents, while scenarios with $10 \thicksim 20$ agents are far more common. In this paper, to mitigate data redundancy in the over-represented driving scenarios and to reduce the bias rooted in the data scarcity of complex ones, we propose a novel data-efficient training method based on coreset selection. This method strategically selects a small but representative subset of data while balancing the proportions of different scenario difficulties. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a method capable of effectively condensing large-scale trajectory dataset, while achieving a state-of-the-art compression ratio. Notably, even when using only 50% of the Argoverse dataset, the model can be trained with little to no decline in performance. Moreover, the selected coreset maintains excellent generalization ability.

- **Summary**: One of the major challenges for the agricultural industry today is the uncertainty in manual labor availability and the associated cost. Automated flower and fruit density estimation, localization, and counting could help streamline harvesting, yield estimation, and crop-load management strategies such as flower and fruitlet thinning. This article proposes a deep regression-based network, AgRegNet, to estimate density, count, and location of flower and fruit in tree fruit canopies without explicit object detection or polygon annotation. Inspired by popular U-Net architecture, AgRegNet is a U-shaped network with an encoder-to-decoder skip connection and modified ConvNeXt-T as an encoder feature extractor. AgRegNet can be trained based on information from point annotation and leverages segmentation information and attention modules (spatial and channel) to highlight relevant flower and fruit features while suppressing non-relevant background features. Experimental evaluation in apple flower and fruit canopy images under an unstructured orchard environment showed that AgRegNet achieved promising accuracy as measured by Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), percentage Mean Absolute Error (pMAE) and mean Average Precision (mAP) to estimate flower and fruit density, count, and centroid location, respectively. Specifically, the SSIM, pMAE, and mAP values for flower images were 0.938, 13.7%, and 0.81, respectively. For fruit images, the corresponding values were 0.910, 5.6%, and 0.93. Since the proposed approach relies on information from point annotation, it is suitable for sparsely and densely located objects. This simplified technique will be highly applicable for growers to accurately estimate yields and decide on optimal chemical and mechanical flower thinning practices.

- **Summary**: Object detection is a crucial task in autonomous driving. While existing research has proposed various attacks on object detection, such as those using adversarial patches or stickers, the exploration of projection attacks on 3D surfaces remains largely unexplored. Compared to adversarial patches or stickers, which have fixed adversarial patterns, projection attacks allow for transient modifications to these patterns, enabling a more flexible attack. In this paper, we introduce an adversarial 3D projection attack specifically targeting object detection in autonomous driving scenarios. We frame the attack formulation as an optimization problem, utilizing a combination of color mapping and geometric transformation models. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack in deceiving YOLOv3 and Mask R-CNN in physical settings. Evaluations conducted in an indoor environment show an attack success rate of up to 100% under low ambient light conditions, highlighting the potential damage of our attack in real-world driving scenarios.

- **Summary**: Reducing the atmospheric haze and enhancing image clarity is crucial for computer vision applications. The lack of real-life hazy ground truth images necessitates synthetic datasets, which often lack diverse haze types, impeding effective haze type classification and dehazing algorithm selection. This research introduces the HazeSpace2M dataset, a collection of over 2 million images designed to enhance dehazing through haze type classification. HazeSpace2M includes diverse scenes with 10 haze intensity levels, featuring Fog, Cloud, and Environmental Haze (EH). Using the dataset, we introduce a technique of haze type classification followed by specialized dehazers to clear hazy images. Unlike conventional methods, our approach classifies haze types before applying type-specific dehazing, improving clarity in real-life hazy images. Benchmarking with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, ResNet50 and AlexNet achieve 92.75\% and 92.50\% accuracy, respectively, against existing synthetic datasets. However, these models achieve only 80% and 70% accuracy, respectively, against our Real Hazy Testset (RHT), highlighting the challenging nature of our HazeSpace2M dataset. Additional experiments show that haze type classification followed by specialized dehazing improves results by 2.41% in PSNR, 17.14% in SSIM, and 10.2\% in MSE over general dehazers. Moreover, when testing with SOTA dehazing models, we found that applying our proposed framework significantly improves their performance. These results underscore the significance of HazeSpace2M and our proposed framework in addressing atmospheric haze in multimedia processing.
