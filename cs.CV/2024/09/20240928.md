- **Summary**: Advancements in open-source pre-trained backbones make it relatively easy to fine-tune a model for new tasks. However, this lowered entry barrier poses potential risks, e.g., bad actors developing models for harmful applications. A question arises: Is possible to develop a pre-trained model that is difficult to fine-tune for certain downstream tasks? To begin studying this, we focus on few-shot classification (FSC). Specifically, we investigate methods to make FSC more challenging for a set of restricted classes while maintaining the performance of other classes. We propose to meta-learn over the pre-trained backbone in a manner that renders it a ''poor initialization''. Our proposed Learning to Obstruct (LTO) algorithm successfully obstructs four FSC methods across three datasets, including ImageNet and CIFAR100 for image classification, as well as CelebA for attribute classification.

- **Summary**: This report describes our 1st place solution to the 8th HANDS workshop challenge (ARCTIC track) in conjunction with ECCV 2024. In this challenge, we address the task of bimanual category-agnostic hand-object interaction reconstruction, which aims to generate 3D reconstructions of both hands and the object from a monocular video, without relying on predefined templates. This task is particularly challenging due to the significant occlusion and dynamic contact between the hands and the object during bimanual manipulation. We worked to resolve these issues by introducing a mask loss and a 3D contact loss, respectively. Moreover, we applied 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to this task. As a result, our method achieved a value of 38.69 in the main metric, CD$_h$, on the ARCTIC test set.

- **Summary**: Optical imaging systems are generally limited by the depth of field because of the nature of the optics. Therefore, extending depth of field (EDoF) is a fundamental task for meeting the requirements of emerging visual applications. To solve this task, the common practice is using multi-focus images from a single viewpoint. This method can obtain acceptable quality of EDoF under the condition of fixed field of view, but it is only applicable to static scenes and the field of view is limited and fixed. An emerging data type, varifocal multiview images have the potential to become a new paradigm for solving the EDoF, because the data contains more field of view information than multi-focus images. To realize EDoF of varifocal multiview images, we propose an end-to-end method for the EDoF, including image alignment, image optimization and image fusion. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: We have developed a novel activation function, named the Cauchy Activation Function. This function is derived from the Cauchy Integral Theorem in complex analysis and is specifically tailored for problems requiring high precision. This innovation has led to the creation of a new class of neural networks, which we call (Comple)XNet, or simply XNet. We will demonstrate that XNet is particularly effective for high-dimensional challenges such as image classification and solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Our evaluations show that XNet significantly outperforms established benchmarks like MNIST and CIFAR-10 in computer vision, and offers substantial advantages over Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in both low-dimensional and high-dimensional PDE scenarios.

- **Summary**: Video photoplethysmography (vPPG) is an emerging method for non-invasive and convenient measurement of physiological signals, utilizing two primary approaches: remote video PPG (rPPG) and contact video PPG (cPPG). Monitoring vitals in high-altitude environments, where heart rates tend to increase and blood oxygen levels often decrease, presents significant challenges. To address these issues, we introduce the SUMS dataset comprising 80 synchronized non-contact facial and contact finger videos from 10 subjects during exercise and oxygen recovery scenarios, capturing PPG, respiration rate (RR), and SpO2. This dataset is designed to validate video vitals estimation algorithms and compare facial rPPG with finger cPPG. Additionally, fusing videos from different positions (i.e., face and finger) reduces the mean absolute error (MAE) of SpO2 predictions by 7.6\% and 10.6\% compared to only face and only finger, respectively. In cross-subject evaluation, we achieve an MAE of less than 0.5 BPM for HR estimation and 2.5\% for SpO2 estimation, demonstrating the precision of our multi-camera fusion techniques. Our findings suggest that simultaneous training on multiple indicators, such as PPG and blood oxygen, can reduce MAE in SpO2 estimation by 17.8\%.

- **Summary**: Reliable self-localization is a foundational skill for many intelligent mobile platforms. This paper explores the use of event cameras for motion tracking thereby providing a solution with inherent robustness under difficult dynamics and illumination. In order to circumvent the challenge of event camera-based mapping, the solution is framed in a cross-modal way. It tracks a map representation that comes directly from frame-based cameras. Specifically, the proposed method operates on top of gaussian splatting, a state-of-the-art representation that permits highly efficient and realistic novel view synthesis. The key of our approach consists of a novel pose parametrization that uses a reference pose plus first order dynamics for local differential image rendering. The latter is then compared against images of integrated events in a staggered coarse-to-fine optimization scheme. As demonstrated by our results, the realistic view rendering ability of gaussian splatting leads to stable and accurate tracking across a variety of both publicly available and newly recorded data sequences.

- **Summary**: The emergence of Vision Language Models (VLMs) is a significant advancement in integrating computer vision with Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce detailed text descriptions based on visual inputs, yet it introduces new security vulnerabilities. Unlike prior work that centered on single modalities or classification tasks, this study introduces TrojVLM, the first exploration of backdoor attacks aimed at VLMs engaged in complex image-to-text generation. Specifically, TrojVLM inserts predetermined target text into output text when encountering poisoned images. Moreover, a novel semantic preserving loss is proposed to ensure the semantic integrity of the original image content. Our evaluation on image captioning and visual question answering (VQA) tasks confirms the effectiveness of TrojVLM in maintaining original semantic content while triggering specific target text outputs. This study not only uncovers a critical security risk in VLMs and image-to-text generation but also sets a foundation for future research on securing multimodal models against such sophisticated threats.



### Beyond Euclidean: Dual-Space Representation Learning for Weakly Supervised Video Violence Detection

- **Summary**: While numerous Video Violence Detection (VVD) methods have focused on representation learning in Euclidean space, they struggle to learn sufficiently discriminative features, leading to weaknesses in recognizing normal events that are visually similar to violent events (\emph{i.e.}, ambiguous violence). In contrast, hyperbolic representation learning, renowned for its ability to model hierarchical and complex relationships between events, has the potential to amplify the discrimination between visually similar events. Inspired by these, we develop a novel Dual-Space Representation Learning (DSRL) method for weakly supervised VVD to utilize the strength of both Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries, capturing the visual features of events while also exploring the intrinsic relations between events, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of the features. DSRL employs a novel information aggregation strategy to progressively learn event context in hyperbolic spaces, which selects aggregation nodes through layer-sensitive hyperbolic association degrees constrained by hyperbolic Dirichlet energy. Furthermore, DSRL attempts to break the cyber-balkanization of different spaces, utilizing cross-space attention to facilitate information interactions between Euclidean and hyperbolic space to capture better discriminative features for final violence detection. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DSRL.

- **Summary**: In this work, we address the challenge of developing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning, with a particular focus on robustness against hallucinations. Existing metrics are often inadequate for handling hallucinations, primarily due to their limited ability to compare candidate captions with multifaceted reference captions. To address this shortcoming, we propose DENEB, a novel supervised automatic evaluation metric specifically robust against hallucinations. DENEB incorporates the Sim-Vec Transformer, a mechanism that processes multiple references simultaneously, thereby efficiently capturing the similarity between an image, a candidate caption, and reference captions. To train DENEB, we construct the diverse and balanced Nebula dataset comprising 32,978 images, paired with human judgments provided by 805 annotators. We demonstrated that DENEB achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing LLM-free metrics on the FOIL, Composite, Flickr8K-Expert, Flickr8K-CF, Nebula, and PASCAL-50S datasets, validating its effectiveness and robustness against hallucinations.



### PDCFNet: Enhancing Underwater Images through Pixel Difference Convolution

- **Summary**: Majority of deep learning methods utilize vanilla convolution for enhancing underwater images. While vanilla convolution excels in capturing local features and learning the spatial hierarchical structure of images, it tends to smooth input images, which can somewhat limit feature expression and modeling. A prominent characteristic of underwater degraded images is blur, and the goal of enhancement is to make the textures and details (high-frequency features) in the images more visible. Therefore, we believe that leveraging high-frequency features can improve enhancement performance. To address this, we introduce Pixel Difference Convolution (PDC), which focuses on gradient information with significant changes in the image, thereby improving the modeling of enhanced images. We propose an underwater image enhancement network, PDCFNet, based on PDC and cross-level feature fusion. Specifically, we design a detail enhancement module based on PDC that employs parallel PDCs to capture high-frequency features, leading to better detail and texture enhancement. The designed cross-level feature fusion module performs operations such as concatenation and multiplication on features from different levels, ensuring sufficient interaction and enhancement between diverse features. Our proposed PDCFNet achieves a PSNR of 27.37 and an SSIM of 92.02 on the UIEB dataset, attaining the best performance to date. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhangsong1213/PDCFNet.



### FINE: Factorizing Knowledge for Initialization of Variable-sized Diffusion Models

- **Summary**: Diffusion models often face slow convergence, and existing efficient training techniques, such as Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), are primarily designed for fine-tuning pre-trained models. However, these methods are limited in adapting models to variable sizes for real-world deployment, where no corresponding pre-trained models exist. To address this, we introduce FINE, a method based on the Learngene framework, to initializing downstream networks leveraging pre-trained models, while considering both model sizes and task-specific requirements. FINE decomposes pre-trained knowledge into the product of matrices (i.e., $U$, $\Sigma$, and $V$), where $U$ and $V$ are shared across network blocks as ``learngenes'', and $\Sigma$ remains layer-specific. During initialization, FINE trains only $\Sigma$ using a small subset of data, while keeping the learngene parameters fixed, marking it the first approach to integrate both size and task considerations in initialization. We provide a comprehensive benchmark for learngene-based methods in image generation tasks, and extensive experiments demonstrate that FINE consistently outperforms direct pre-training, particularly for smaller models, achieving state-of-the-art results across variable model sizes. FINE also offers significant computational and storage savings, reducing training steps by approximately $3N\times$ and storage by $5\times$, where $N$ is the number of models. Additionally, FINE's adaptability to tasks yields an average performance improvement of 4.29 and 3.30 in FID and sFID across multiple downstream datasets, highlighting its versatility and efficiency.



### CLIP-MoE: Towards Building Mixture of Experts for CLIP with Diversified Multiplet Upcycling

- **Summary**: In recent years, Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has become a cornerstone in multimodal intelligence. However, recent studies have identified that the information loss in the CLIP encoding process is substantial, and CLIP tends to capture only coarse-grained features from the input. This deficiency significantly limits the ability of a single CLIP model to handle images rich in visual detail. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic strategy, Diversified Multiplet Upcycling (DMU), for CLIP. DMU efficiently fine-tunes a series of CLIP models that capture different feature spaces, from a dense pre-trained CLIP checkpoint, sharing parameters except for the Feed-Forward Network (FFN). These models can then be transformed into a CLIP-MoE with a larger model capacity, leading to significantly enhanced performance with minimal computational overhead. To the best of our knowledge, Diversified Multiplet Upcycling is the first approach to introduce sparsely activated MoE into CLIP foundation models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant performance of CLIP-MoE across various zero-shot retrieval, zero-shot image classification tasks, and downstream Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) benchmarks by serving as a vision encoder. Furthermore, Diversified Multiplet Upcycling enables the conversion of any dense CLIP model into CLIP-MoEs, which can seamlessly replace CLIP in a plug-and-play manner without requiring further adaptation in downstream frameworks. Through Diversified Multiplet Upcycling, we aim to provide valuable insights for future research on developing more efficient and effective multimodal learning systems.

- **Summary**: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a crucial component of many visual localization pipelines for embodied agents. VPR is often formulated as an image retrieval task aimed at jointly learning local features and an aggregation method. The current state-of-the-art VPR methods rely on VLAD aggregation, which can be trained to learn a weighted contribution of features through their soft assignment to cluster centers. However, this process has two key limitations. Firstly, the feature-to-cluster weighting does not account for over-represented repetitive structures within a cluster, e.g., shadows or window panes; this phenomenon is also referred to as the `burstiness' problem, classically solved by discounting repetitive features before aggregation. Secondly, feature to cluster comparisons are compute-intensive for state-of-the-art image encoders with high-dimensional local features. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing VLAD-BuFF with two novel contributions: i) a self-similarity based feature discounting mechanism to learn Burst-aware features within end-to-end VPR training, and ii) Fast Feature aggregation by reducing local feature dimensions specifically through PCA-initialized learnable pre-projection. We benchmark our method on 9 public datasets, where VLAD-BuFF sets a new state of the art. Our method is able to maintain its high recall even for 12x reduced local feature dimensions, thus enabling fast feature aggregation without compromising on recall. Through additional qualitative studies, we show how our proposed weighting method effectively downweights the non-distinctive features. Source code: https://github.com/Ahmedest61/VLAD-BuFF/.

- **Summary**: Multisensor fusion is essential for autonomous vehicles to accurately perceive, analyze, and plan their trajectories within complex environments. This typically involves the integration of data from LiDAR sensors and cameras, which necessitates high-precision and real-time registration. Current methods for registering LiDAR point clouds with images face significant challenges due to inherent modality differences and computational overhead. To address these issues, we propose EEPNet, an advanced network that leverages reflectance maps obtained from point cloud projections to enhance registration accuracy. The introduction of point cloud projections substantially mitigates cross-modality differences at the network input level, while the inclusion of reflectance data improves performance in scenarios with limited spatial information of point cloud within the camera's field of view. Furthermore, by employing edge pixels for feature matching and incorporating an efficient matching optimization layer, EEPNet markedly accelerates real-time registration tasks. Experimental validation demonstrates that EEPNet achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our contributions offer significant advancements in autonomous perception systems, paving the way for robust and efficient sensor fusion in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Advanced facial recognition technologies and recommender systems with inadequate privacy technologies and policies for facial interactions increase concerns about bioprivacy violations. With the proliferation of video and live-streaming websites, public-face video distribution and interactions pose greater privacy risks. Existing techniques typically address the risk of sensitive biometric information leakage through various privacy enhancement methods but pose a higher security risk by corrupting the information to be conveyed by the interaction data, or by leaving certain biometric features intact that allow an attacker to infer sensitive biometric information from them. To address these shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a neural network framework, CausalVE. We obtain cover images by adopting a diffusion model to achieve face swapping with face guidance and use the speech sequence features and spatiotemporal sequence features of the secret video for dynamic video inference and prediction to obtain a cover video with the same number of frames as the secret video. In addition, we hide the secret video by using reversible neural networks for video hiding so that the video can also disseminate secret data. Numerous experiments prove that our CausalVE has good security in public video dissemination and outperforms state-of-the-art methods from a qualitative, quantitative, and visual point of view.

- **Summary**: In recent years, 3D models have gained popularity in various fields, including entertainment, manufacturing, and simulation. However, manually creating these models can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process, making it impractical for large-scale industrial applications. To address this issue, researchers are exploiting Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms to automatically generate 3D models effortlessly. In this paper, we present a novel cloud-native pipeline that can automatically reconstruct 3D models from monocular 2D images captured using a smartphone camera. Our goal is to provide an efficient and easily-adoptable solution that meets the Industry 4.0 standards for creating a Digital Twin model, which could enhance personnel expertise through accelerated training. We leverage machine learning models developed by NVIDIA Research Labs alongside a custom-designed pose recorder with a unique pose compensation component based on the ARCore framework by Google. Our solution produces a reusable 3D model, with embedded materials and textures, exportable and customizable in any external 3D modelling software or 3D engine. Furthermore, the whole workflow is implemented by adopting the microservices architecture standard, enabling each component of the pipeline to operate as a standalone replaceable module.

- **Summary**: Medical image analysis is crucial in modern radiological diagnostics, especially given the exponential growth in medical imaging data. The demand for automated report generation systems has become increasingly urgent. While prior research has mainly focused on using machine learning and multimodal language models for 2D medical images, the generation of reports for 3D medical images has been less explored due to data scarcity and computational complexities. This paper introduces 3D-CT-GPT, a Visual Question Answering (VQA)-based medical visual language model specifically designed for generating radiology reports from 3D CT scans, particularly chest CTs. Extensive experiments on both public and private datasets demonstrate that 3D-CT-GPT significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of report accuracy and quality. Although current methods are few, including the partially open-source CT2Rep and the open-source M3D, we ensured fair comparison through appropriate data conversion and evaluation methodologies. Experimental results indicate that 3D-CT-GPT enhances diagnostic accuracy and report coherence, establishing itself as a robust solution for clinical radiology report generation. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset and further optimizing the model to enhance its performance and applicability.

- **Summary**: Question decomposition has emerged as an effective strategy for prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer complex questions. However, while existing methods primarily focus on unimodal language models, the question decomposition capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has yet to be explored. To this end, this paper explores visual question decomposition on MLLMs. Specifically, we introduce a systematic evaluation framework including a dataset and several evaluation criteria to assess the quality of the decomposed sub-questions, revealing that existing MLLMs struggle to produce high-quality sub-questions. To address this limitation, we propose a specific finetuning dataset, DecoVQA+, for enhancing the model's question decomposition capability. Aiming at enabling models to perform appropriate selective decomposition, we propose an efficient finetuning pipeline. The finetuning pipeline consists of our proposed dataset and a training objective for selective decomposition. Finetuned MLLMs demonstrate significant improvements in the quality of sub-questions and the policy of selective question decomposition. Additionally, the models also achieve higher accuracy with selective decomposition on VQA benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal Video Object Segmentation (VOS), including RGB-Thermal, RGB-Depth, and RGB-Event, has garnered attention due to its capability to address challenging scenarios where traditional VOS methods struggle, such as extreme illumination, rapid motion, and background distraction. Existing approaches often involve designing specific additional branches and performing full-parameter fine-tuning for fusion in each task. However, this paradigm not only duplicates research efforts and hardware costs but also risks model collapse with the limited multi-modal annotated data. In this paper, we propose a universal framework named X-Prompt for all multi-modal video object segmentation tasks, designated as RGB+X. The X-Prompt framework first pre-trains a video object segmentation foundation model using RGB data, and then utilize the additional modality of the prompt to adapt it to downstream multi-modal tasks with limited data. Within the X-Prompt framework, we introduce the Multi-modal Visual Prompter (MVP), which allows prompting foundation model with the various modalities to segment objects precisely. We further propose the Multi-modal Adaptation Experts (MAEs) to adapt the foundation model with pluggable modality-specific knowledge without compromising the generalization capacity. To evaluate the effectiveness of the X-Prompt framework, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks across 4 benchmarks. The proposed universal X-Prompt framework consistently outperforms the full fine-tuning paradigm and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code: https://github.com/PinxueGuo/X-Prompt.git

- **Summary**: Transformers have demonstrated great power in the recent development of large foundational models. In particular, the Vision Transformer (ViT) has brought revolutionary changes to the field of vision, achieving significant accomplishments on the experimental side. However, their theoretical capabilities, particularly in terms of generalization when trained to overfit training data, are still not fully understood. To address this gap, this work delves deeply into the benign overfitting perspective of transformers in vision. To this end, we study the optimization of a Transformer composed of a self-attention layer with softmax followed by a fully connected layer under gradient descent on a certain data distribution model. By developing techniques that address the challenges posed by softmax and the interdependent nature of multiple weights in transformer optimization, we successfully characterized the training dynamics and achieved generalization in post-training. Our results establish a sharp condition that can distinguish between the small test error phase and the large test error regime, based on the signal-to-noise ratio in the data model. The theoretical results are further verified by experimental simulation.

- **Summary**: This research proposal discusses two challenges in the field of medical image analysis: the multi-parametric investigation on microstructural and macrostructural characteristics of the cervical spinal cord and deep learning-based medical image segmentation. First, we conduct a thorough analysis of the cervical spinal cord within a healthy population. Unlike most previous studies, which required medical professionals to perform functional examinations using metrics like the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) score or the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale, this research focuses solely on Magnetic Resonance (MR) images of the cervical spinal cord. Second, we employ cutting-edge deep learning-based segmentation methods to achieve highly accurate macrostructural measurements from MR images. To this end, we propose an enhanced UNet-like Transformer-based framework with attentive skip connections. This paper reports on the problem domain, proposed solutions, current status of research, and expected contributions.

- **Summary**: Autonomous racing has rapidly gained research attention. Traditionally, racing cars rely on 2D LiDAR as their primary visual system. In this work, we explore the integration of an event camera with the existing system to provide enhanced temporal information. Our goal is to fuse the 2D LiDAR data with event data in an end-to-end learning framework for steering prediction, which is crucial for autonomous racing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study addressing this challenging research topic. We start by creating a multisensor dataset specifically for steering prediction. Using this dataset, we establish a benchmark by evaluating various SOTA fusion methods. Our observations reveal that existing methods often incur substantial computational costs. To address this, we apply low-rank techniques to propose a novel, efficient, and effective fusion design. We introduce a new fusion learning policy to guide the fusion process, enhancing robustness against misalignment. Our fusion architecture provides better steering prediction than LiDAR alone, significantly reducing the RMSE from 7.72 to 1.28. Compared to the second-best fusion method, our work represents only 11% of the learnable parameters while achieving better accuracy. The source code, dataset, and benchmark will be released to promote future research.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an innovative approach to dimensionality reduction and feature extraction in high-dimensional datasets, with a specific application focus on wood surface defect detection. The proposed framework integrates sparse modeling techniques, particularly Lasso and proximal gradient methods, into a comprehensive pipeline for efficient and interpretable feature selection. Leveraging pre-trained models such as VGG19 and incorporating anomaly detection methods like Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor, our methodology addresses the challenge of extracting meaningful features from complex datasets. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and F1 score, alongside visualizations, are employed to assess the performance of the sparse modeling techniques. Through this work, we aim to advance the understanding and application of sparse modeling in machine learning, particularly in the context of wood surface defect detection.

- **Summary**: Multi-view egocentric hand tracking is a challenging task and plays a critical role in VR interaction. In this report, we present a method that uses multi-view input images and camera extrinsic parameters to estimate both hand shape and pose. To reduce overfitting to the camera layout, we apply crop jittering and extrinsic parameter noise augmentation. Additionally, we propose an offline neural smoothing post-processing method to further improve the accuracy of hand position and pose. Our method achieves 13.92mm MPJPE on the Umetrack dataset and 21.66mm MPJPE on the HOT3D dataset.

- **Summary**: Conditional image synthesis based on user-specified requirements is a key component in creating complex visual content. In recent years, diffusion-based generative modeling has become a highly effective way for conditional image synthesis, leading to exponential growth in the literature. However, the complexity of diffusion-based modeling, the wide range of image synthesis tasks, and the diversity of conditioning mechanisms present significant challenges for researchers to keep up with rapid developments and understand the core concepts on this topic. In this survey, we categorize existing works based on how conditions are integrated into the two fundamental components of diffusion-based modeling, i.e., the denoising network and the sampling process. We specifically highlight the underlying principles, advantages, and potential challenges of various conditioning approaches in the training, re-purposing, and specialization stages to construct a desired denoising network. We also summarize six mainstream conditioning mechanisms in the essential sampling process. All discussions are centered around popular applications. Finally, we pinpoint some critical yet still open problems to be solved in the future and suggest some possible solutions. Our reviewed works are itemized at https://github.com/zju-pi/Awesome-Conditional-Diffusion-Models.

- **Summary**: Brain tumor segmentation is often based on multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, in clinical practice, certain modalities of MRI may be missing, which presents an even more difficult scenario. To cope with this challenge, knowledge distillation has emerged as one promising strategy. However, recent efforts typically overlook the modality gaps and thus fail to learn invariant feature representations across different modalities. Such drawback consequently leads to limited performance for both teachers and students. To ameliorate these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that aligns latent features of involved modalities to a well-defined distribution anchor. As a major contribution, we prove that our novel training paradigm ensures a tight evidence lower bound, thus theoretically certifying its effectiveness. Extensive experiments on different backbones validate that the proposed paradigm can enable invariant feature representations and produce a teacher with narrowed modality gaps. This further offers superior guidance for missing modality students, achieving an average improvement of 1.75 on dice score.

- **Summary**: Segmenting anatomical structures and lesions from ultrasound images contributes to disease assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. Weakly supervised learning (WSL) based on sparse annotation has achieved encouraging performance and demonstrated the potential to reduce annotation costs. However, ultrasound images often suffer from issues such as poor contrast, unclear edges, as well as varying sizes and locations of lesions. This makes it challenging for convolutional networks with local receptive fields to extract global morphological features from the sparse information provided by scribble annotations. Recently, the visual Mamba based on state space sequence models (SSMs) has significantly reduced computational complexity while ensuring long-range dependencies compared to Transformers. Consequently, for the first time, we apply scribble-based WSL to ultrasound image segmentation and propose a novel hybrid CNN-Mamba framework. Furthermore, due to the characteristics of ultrasound images and insufficient supervision signals, existing consistency regularization often filters out predictions near decision boundaries, leading to unstable predictions of edges. Hence, we introduce the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) of evidence to devise an Evidence-Guided Consistency (EGC) strategy, which leverages high-evidence predictions more likely to occur near high-density regions to guide low-evidence predictions potentially present near decision boundaries for optimization. During training, the collaboration between the CNN branch and the Mamba branch in the proposed framework draws inspiration from each other based on the EGC strategy. Extensive experiments on four ultrasound public datasets for binary-class and multi-class segmentation demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed method. The scribble-annotated dataset and code will be made available on https://github.com/GtLinyer/MambaEviScrib.

- **Summary**: We investigate the utility of diffusion generative models to efficiently synthesise datasets that effectively train deep learning models for image analysis. Specifically, we propose novel $\Gamma$-distribution Latent Denoising Diffusion Models (LDMs) designed to generate semantically guided synthetic cardiac ultrasound images with improved computational efficiency. We also investigate the potential of using these synthetic images as a replacement for real data in training deep networks for left-ventricular segmentation and binary echocardiogram view classification tasks. We compared six diffusion models in terms of the computational cost of generating synthetic 2D echo data, the visual realism of the resulting images, and the performance, on real data, of downstream tasks (segmentation and classification) trained using these synthetic echoes. We compare various diffusion strategies and ODE solvers for their impact on segmentation and classification performance. The results show that our propose architectures significantly reduce computational costs while maintaining or improving downstream task performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. While other diffusion models generated more realistic-looking echo images at higher computational cost, our research suggests that for model training, visual realism is not necessarily related to model performance, and considerable compute costs can be saved by using more efficient models.

- **Summary**: Vision-language foundation models (e.g., CLIP) have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models may be unreliable when significant distribution gaps exist between the training and test data. The training-free test-time dynamic adapter (TDA) is a promising approach to address this issue by storing representative test samples to guide the classification of subsequent ones. However, TDA only naively maintains a limited number of reference samples in the cache, leading to severe test-time catastrophic forgetting when the cache is updated by dropping samples. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method for DistributiOnal Test-time Adaptation (Dota). Instead of naively memorizing representative test samples, Dota continually estimates the distributions of test samples, allowing the model to continually adapt to the deployment environment. The test-time posterior probabilities are then computed using the estimated distributions based on Bayes' theorem for adaptation purposes. To further enhance the adaptability on the uncertain samples, we introduce a new human-in-the-loop paradigm which identifies uncertain samples, collects human-feedback, and incorporates it into the Dota framework. Extensive experiments validate that Dota enables CLIP to continually learn, resulting in a significant improvement compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Learning representations of two views of data such that the resulting representations are highly linearly correlated is appealing in machine learning. In this paper, we present a canonical correlation guided learning framework, which allows to be realized by deep neural networks (CCDNN), to learn such a correlated representation. It is also a novel merging of multivariate analysis (MVA) and machine learning, which can be viewed as transforming MVA into end-to-end architectures with the aid of neural networks. Unlike the linear canonical correlation analysis (CCA), kernel CCA and deep CCA, in the proposed method, the optimization formulation is not restricted to maximize correlation, instead we make canonical correlation as a constraint, which preserves the correlated representation learning ability and focuses more on the engineering tasks endowed by optimization formulation, such as reconstruction, classification and prediction. Furthermore, to reduce the redundancy induced by correlation, a redundancy filter is designed. We illustrate the performance of CCDNN on various tasks. In experiments on MNIST dataset, the results show that CCDNN has better reconstruction performance in terms of mean squared error and mean absolute error than DCCA and DCCAE. Also, we present the application of the proposed network to industrial fault diagnosis and remaining useful life cases for the classification and prediction tasks accordingly. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in both tasks when compared to existing methods. Extension of CCDNN to much more deeper with the aid of residual connection is also presented in appendix.

- **Summary**: Tensor decompositions have become essential tools for feature extraction and compression of multiway data. Recent advances in tensor operators have enabled desirable properties of standard matrix algebra to be retained for multilinear factorizations. Behind this matrix-mimetic tensor operation is an invertible matrix whose size depends quadratically on certain dimensions of the data. As a result, for large-scale multiway data, the invertible matrix can be computationally demanding to apply and invert and can lead to inefficient tensor representations in terms of construction and storage costs. In this work, we propose a new projected tensor-tensor product that relaxes the invertibility restriction to reduce computational overhead and still preserves fundamental linear algebraic properties. The transformation behind the projected product is a tall-and-skinny matrix with unitary columns, which depends only linearly on certain dimensions of the data, thereby reducing computational complexity by an order of magnitude. We provide extensive theory to prove the matrix mimeticity and the optimality of compressed representations within the projected product framework. We further prove that projected-product-based approximations outperform a comparable, non-matrix-mimetic tensor factorization. We support the theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical benefits of projected products through numerical experiments on video and hyperspectral imaging data.

- **Summary**: All-in-one image restoration aims to handle multiple degradation types using one model. This paper proposes a simple pipeline for all-in-one blind image restoration to Restore Anything with Masks (RAM). We focus on the image content by utilizing Mask Image Modeling to extract intrinsic image information rather than distinguishing degradation types like other methods. Our pipeline consists of two stages: masked image pre-training and fine-tuning with mask attribute conductance. We design a straightforward masking pre-training approach specifically tailored for all-in-one image restoration. This approach enhances networks to prioritize the extraction of image content priors from various degradations, resulting in a more balanced performance across different restoration tasks and achieving stronger overall results. To bridge the gap of input integrity while preserving learned image priors as much as possible, we selectively fine-tuned a small portion of the layers. Specifically, the importance of each layer is ranked by the proposed Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC), and the layers with higher contributions are selected for finetuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code and model will be released at \href{https://github.com/Dragonisss/RAM}{https://github.com/Dragonisss/RAM}.

- **Summary**: Large scale 3D scene reconstruction is important for applications such as virtual reality and simulation. Existing neural rendering approaches (e.g., NeRF, 3DGS) have achieved realistic reconstructions on large scenes, but optimize per scene, which is expensive and slow, and exhibit noticeable artifacts under large view changes due to overfitting. Generalizable approaches or large reconstruction models are fast, but primarily work for small scenes/objects and often produce lower quality rendering results. In this work, we introduce G3R, a generalizable reconstruction approach that can efficiently predict high-quality 3D scene representations for large scenes. We propose to learn a reconstruction network that takes the gradient feedback signals from differentiable rendering to iteratively update a 3D scene representation, combining the benefits of high photorealism from per-scene optimization with data-driven priors from fast feed-forward prediction methods. Experiments on urban-driving and drone datasets show that G3R generalizes across diverse large scenes and accelerates the reconstruction process by at least 10x while achieving comparable or better realism compared to 3DGS, and also being more robust to large view changes.

- **Summary**: We introduce Brain-JEPA, a brain dynamics foundation model with the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). This pioneering model achieves state-of-the-art performance in demographic prediction, disease diagnosis/prognosis, and trait prediction through fine-tuning. Furthermore, it excels in off-the-shelf evaluations (e.g., linear probing) and demonstrates superior generalizability across different ethnic groups, surpassing the previous large model for brain activity significantly. Brain-JEPA incorporates two innovative techniques: Brain Gradient Positioning and Spatiotemporal Masking. Brain Gradient Positioning introduces a functional coordinate system for brain functional parcellation, enhancing the positional encoding of different Regions of Interest (ROIs). Spatiotemporal Masking, tailored to the unique characteristics of fMRI data, addresses the challenge of heterogeneous time-series patches. These methodologies enhance model performance and advance our understanding of the neural circuits underlying cognition. Overall, Brain-JEPA is paving the way to address pivotal questions of building brain functional coordinate system and masking brain activity at the AI-neuroscience interface, and setting a potentially new paradigm in brain activity analysis through downstream adaptation.

- **Summary**: Multi-modality imaging is widely used in clinical practice and biomedical research to gain a comprehensive understanding of an imaging subject. Currently, multi-modality imaging is accomplished by post hoc fusion of independently reconstructed images under the guidance of mutual information or spatially registered hardware, which limits the accuracy and utility of multi-modality imaging. Here, we investigate a data-driven multi-modality imaging (DMI) strategy for synergetic imaging of CT and MRI. We reveal two distinct types of features in multi-modality imaging, namely intra- and inter-modality features, and present a multi-sensor learning (MSL) framework to utilize the crossover inter-modality features for augmented multi-modality imaging. The MSL imaging approach breaks down the boundaries of traditional imaging modalities and allows for optimal hybridization of CT and MRI, which maximizes the use of sensory data. We showcase the effectiveness of our DMI strategy through synergetic CT-MRI brain imaging. The principle of DMI is quite general and holds enormous potential for various DMI applications across disciplines.

- **Summary**: Recent contrastive multimodal vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated robust open-world semantic understanding, becoming the standard image backbones for vision-language applications due to their aligned latent space. However, this practice has left powerful unimodal encoders for both vision and language underutilized in multimodal applications which raises a key question: Is there a plausible way to connect unimodal backbones for zero-shot vision-language tasks? To this end, we propose a novel approach that aligns vision and language modalities using only projection layers on pretrained, frozen unimodal encoders. Our method exploits the high semantic similarity between embedding spaces of well-trained vision and language models. It involves selecting semantically similar encoders in the latent space, curating a concept-rich dataset of image-caption pairs, and training simple MLP projectors. We evaluated our approach on 12 zero-shot classification datasets and 2 image-text retrieval datasets. Our best model, utilizing DINOv2 and All-Roberta-Large text encoder, achieves 76\(\%\) accuracy on ImageNet with a 20-fold reduction in data and 65 fold reduction in compute requirements. The proposed framework enhances the accessibility of model development while enabling flexible adaptation across diverse scenarios, offering an efficient approach to building multimodal models by utilizing existing unimodal architectures. Code and datasets will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Despite the abundant availability and content richness for video data, its high-dimensionality poses challenges for video research. Recent advancements have explored the implicit representation for videos using neural networks, demonstrating strong performance in applications such as video compression and enhancement. However, the prolonged encoding time remains a persistent challenge for video Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). In this paper, we focus on improving the speed of video encoding and decoding within implicit representations. We introduce two key components: NeRV-Enc, a transformer-based hyper-network for fast encoding; and NeRV-Dec, a parallel decoder for efficient video loading. NeRV-Enc achieves an impressive speed-up of $\mathbf{10^4\times}$ by eliminating gradient-based optimization. Meanwhile, NeRV-Dec simplifies video decoding, outperforming conventional codecs with a loading speed $\mathbf{11\times}$ faster, and surpassing RAM loading with pre-decoded videos ($\mathbf{2.5\times}$ faster while being $\mathbf{65\times}$ smaller in size).

- **Summary**: Advancements in generative modeling are pushing the state-of-the-art in synthetic medical image generation. These synthetic images can serve as an effective data augmentation method to aid the development of more accurate machine learning models for medical image analysis. While the fidelity of these synthetic images has progressively increased, the diversity of these images is an understudied phenomenon. In this work, we propose the SDICE index, which is based on the characterization of similarity distributions induced by a contrastive encoder. Given a synthetic dataset and a reference dataset of real images, the SDICE index measures the distance between the similarity score distributions of original and synthetic images, where the similarity scores are estimated using a pre-trained contrastive encoder. This distance is then normalized using an exponential function to provide a consistent metric that can be easily compared across domains. Experiments conducted on the MIMIC-chest X-ray and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SDICE index in assessing synthetic medical dataset diversity.

- **Summary**: Losing track of reading progress during line switching can be frustrating. Eye gaze tracking technology offers a potential solution by highlighting read paragraphs, aiding users in avoiding wrong line switches. However, the gap between gaze tracking accuracy (2-3 cm) and text line spacing (3-5 mm) makes direct application impractical. Existing methods leverage the linear reading pattern but fail during jump reading. This paper presents a reading tracking and highlighting system that supports both linear and jump reading. Based on experimental insights from the gaze nature study of 16 users, two gaze error models are designed to enable both jump reading detection and relocation. The system further leverages the large language model's contextual perception capability in aiding reading tracking. A reading tracking domain-specific line-gaze alignment opportunity is also exploited to enable dynamic and frequent calibration of the gaze results. Controlled experiments demonstrate reliable linear reading tracking, as well as 84% accuracy in tracking jump reading. Furthermore, real field tests with 18 volunteers demonstrated the system's effectiveness in tracking and highlighting read paragraphs, improving reading efficiency, and enhancing user experience.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we develop an embodied AI system for human-in-the-loop navigation with a wheeled mobile robot. We propose a direct yet effective method of monitoring the robot's current plan to detect changes in the environment that impact the intended trajectory of the robot significantly and then query a human for feedback. We also develop a means to parse human feedback expressed in natural language into local navigation waypoints and integrate it into a global planning system, by leveraging a map of semantic features and an aligned obstacle map. Extensive testing in simulation and physical hardware experiments with a resource-constrained wheeled robot tasked to navigate in a real-world environment validate the efficacy and robustness of our method. This work can support applications like precision agriculture and construction, where persistent monitoring of the environment provides a human with information about the environment state.

- **Summary**: We explore the universality of neural encodings in convolutional neural networks trained on image classification tasks. We develop a procedure to directly compare the learned weights rather than their representations. It is based on a factorization of spatial and channel dimensions and measures the similarity of aligned weight covariances. We show that, for a range of layers of VGG-type networks, the learned eigenvectors appear to be universal across different natural image datasets. Our results suggest the existence of a universal neural encoding for natural images. They explain, at a more fundamental level, the success of transfer learning. Our work shows that, instead of aiming at maximizing the performance of neural networks, one can alternatively attempt to maximize the universality of the learned encoding, in order to build a principled foundation model.

- **Summary**: The escalating frequency and scale of recent malware attacks underscore the urgent need for swift and precise malware classification in the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape. Key challenges include accurately categorizing closely related malware families. To tackle this evolving threat landscape, this paper proposes a novel architecture LeViT-MC which produces state-of-the-art results in malware detection and classification. LeViT-MC leverages a vision transformer-based architecture, an image-based visualization approach, and advanced transfer learning techniques. Experimental results on multi-class malware classification using the MaleVis dataset indicate LeViT-MC's significant advantage over existing models. This study underscores the critical importance of combining image-based and transfer learning techniques, with vision transformers at the forefront of the ongoing battle against evolving cyber threats. We propose a novel architecture LeViT-MC which not only achieves state of the art results on image classification but is also more time efficient.

- **Summary**: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have peaked interest in recent years due to their ability to encode natural signals using neural networks. While INRs allow for useful applications such as interpolating new coordinates and signal compression, their black-box nature makes it difficult to modify them post-training. In this paper we explore the idea of editable INRs, and specifically focus on the widely used cropping operation. To this end, we present Local-Global SIRENs -- a novel INR architecture that supports cropping by design. Local-Global SIRENs are based on combining local and global feature extraction for signal encoding. What makes their design unique is the ability to effortlessly remove specific portions of an encoded signal, with a proportional weight decrease. This is achieved by eliminating the corresponding weights from the network, without the need for retraining. We further show how this architecture can be used to support the straightforward extension of previously encoded signals. Beyond signal editing, we examine how the Local-Global approach can accelerate training, enhance encoding of various signals, improve downstream performance, and be applied to modern INRs such as INCODE, highlighting its potential and flexibility.

- **Summary**: Despite significant advancements and pervasive use of vision-language models, a paucity of studies has addressed their ethical implications. These models typically require extensive training data, often from hastily reviewed text and image datasets, leading to highly imbalanced datasets and ethical concerns. Additionally, models initially trained in English are frequently fine-tuned for other languages, such as the CLIP model, which can be expanded with more data to enhance capabilities but can add new biases. The CAPIVARA, a CLIP-based model adapted to Portuguese, has shown strong performance in zero-shot tasks. In this paper, we evaluate four different types of discriminatory practices within visual-language models and introduce FairPIVARA, a method to reduce them by removing the most affected dimensions of feature embeddings. The application of FairPIVARA has led to a significant reduction of up to 98% in observed biases while promoting a more balanced word distribution within the model.

- **Summary**: Segmentation of anatomical structures and pathological regions in medical images is essential for modern clinical diagnosis, disease research, and treatment planning. While significant advancements have been made in deep learning-based segmentation techniques, many of these methods still suffer from limitations in data efficiency, generalizability, and interactivity. As a result, developing precise segmentation methods that require fewer labeled datasets remains a critical challenge in medical image analysis. Recently, the introduction of foundation models like CLIP and Segment-Anything-Model (SAM), with robust cross-domain representations, has paved the way for interactive and universal image segmentation. However, further exploration of these models for data-efficient segmentation in medical imaging is still needed and highly relevant. In this paper, we introduce MedCLIP-SAMv2, a novel framework that integrates the CLIP and SAM models to perform segmentation on clinical scans using text prompts, in both zero-shot and weakly supervised settings. Our approach includes fine-tuning the BiomedCLIP model with a new Decoupled Hard Negative Noise Contrastive Estimation (DHN-NCE) loss, and leveraging the Multi-modal Information Bottleneck (M2IB) to create visual prompts for generating segmentation masks from SAM in the zero-shot setting. We also investigate using zero-shot segmentation labels within a weakly supervised paradigm to enhance segmentation quality further. Extensive testing across four diverse segmentation tasks and medical imaging modalities (breast tumor ultrasound, brain tumor MRI, lung X-ray, and lung CT) demonstrates the high accuracy of our proposed framework.
