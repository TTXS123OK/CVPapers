- **Summary**: Convolutional neural network (CNN) performs well in Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification tasks, but its high energy consumption and complex network structure make it difficult to directly apply it to edge computing devices. At present, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI classification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven characteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve optimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a spiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width mixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction operations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking mixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral features. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine approximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of spike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train supervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative experiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on spiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental results show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting effect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time step reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about 63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN based HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance for promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in edge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.

- **Summary**: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify inputs into both known and novel categories, a task crucial for open-world scientific discoveries. However, current GCD methods are limited to unimodal data, overlooking the inherently multimodal nature of most real-world data. In this work, we extend GCD to a multimodal setting, where inputs from different modalities provide richer and complementary information. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we identify that the key challenge in multimodal GCD lies in effectively aligning heterogeneous information across modalities. To address this, we propose MM-GCD, a novel framework that aligns both the feature and output spaces of different modalities using contrastive learning and distillation techniques. MM-GCD achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the UPMC-Food101 and N24News datasets, surpassing previous methods by 11.5\% and 4.7\%, respectively.

- **Summary**: Pain is a more intuitive and user-friendly way of communicating problems, making it especially useful in rehabilitation nurse training robots. While most previous methods have focused on classifying or recognizing pain expressions, these approaches often result in unnatural, jiggling robot faces. We introduce PainDiffusion, a model that generates facial expressions in response to pain stimuli, with controllable pain expressiveness and emotion status. PainDiffusion leverages diffusion forcing to roll out predictions over arbitrary lengths using a conditioned temporal U-Net. It operates as a latent diffusion model within EMOCA's facial expression latent space, ensuring a compact data representation and quick rendering time. For training data, we process the BioVid Heatpain Database, extracting expression codes and subject identity configurations. We also propose a novel set of metrics to evaluate pain expressions, focusing on expressiveness, diversity, and the appropriateness of model-generated outputs. Finally, we demonstrate that PainDiffusion outperforms the autoregressive method, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to combine complementary information from both modalities to provide a more comprehensive scene understanding. However, due to the significant differences between the two modalities, preserving key features during the fusion process remains a challenge. To address this issue, we propose a dual-branch feature decomposition fusion network (DAF-Net) with domain adaptive, which introduces Multi-Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MK-MMD) into the base encoder and designs a hybrid kernel function suitable for infrared and visible image fusion. The base encoder built on the Restormer network captures global structural information while the detail encoder based on Invertible Neural Networks (INN) focuses on extracting detail texture information. By incorporating MK-MMD, the DAF-Net effectively aligns the latent feature spaces of visible and infrared images, thereby improving the quality of the fused images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques across multiple datasets, significantly enhancing both visual quality and fusion performance. The related Python code is available at https://github.com/xujian000/DAF-Net.

- **Summary**: Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, primarily affecting the lungs. Early detection is crucial for improving treatment effectiveness and reducing transmission risk. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through image classification of chest X-rays, can assist in TB detection. However, class imbalance in TB chest X-ray datasets presents a challenge for accurate classification. In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning (FSL) approach using the Prototypical Network algorithm to address this issue. We compare the performance of ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and VGG16 in feature extraction from the TBX11K Chest X-ray dataset. Experimental results demonstrate classification accuracies of 98.93% for ResNet-18, 98.60% for ResNet-50, and 33.33% for VGG16. These findings indicate that the proposed method outperforms others in mitigating data imbalance, which is particularly beneficial for disease classification applications.

- **Summary**: Eye movement biometrics is a secure and innovative identification method. Deep learning methods have shown good performance, but their network architecture relies on manual design and combined priori knowledge. To address these issues, we introduce automated network search (NAS) algorithms to the field of eye movement recognition and present Relax DARTS, which is an improvement of the Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) to realize more efficient network search and training. The key idea is to circumvent the issue of weight sharing by independently training the architecture parameters $\alpha$ to achieve a more precise target architecture. Moreover, the introduction of module input weights $\beta$ allows cells the flexibility to select inputs, to alleviate the overfitting phenomenon and improve the model performance. Results on four public databases demonstrate that the Relax DARTS achieves state-of-the-art recognition performance. Notably, Relax DARTS exhibits adaptability to other multi-feature temporal classification tasks.

- **Summary**: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has become a preferred paradigm in many deep learning tasks, which reduces the need for human labor. Previous studies primarily focus on effectively utilising the labelled and unlabeled data to improve performance. However, we observe that how to select samples for labelling also significantly impacts performance, particularly under extremely low-budget settings. The sample selection task in SSL has been under-explored for a long time. To fill in this gap, we propose a Representative and Diverse Sample Selection approach (RDSS). By adopting a modified Frank-Wolfe algorithm to minimise a novel criterion $\alpha$-Maximum Mean Discrepancy ($\alpha$-MMD), RDSS samples a representative and diverse subset for annotation from the unlabeled data. We demonstrate that minimizing $\alpha$-MMD enhances the generalization ability of low-budget learning. Experimental results show that RDSS consistently improves the performance of several popular SSL frameworks and outperforms the state-of-the-art sample selection approaches used in Active Learning (AL) and Semi-Supervised Active Learning (SSAL), even with constrained annotation budgets.

- **Summary**: Text recognition is an inherent integration of vision and language, encompassing the visual texture in stroke patterns and the semantic context among the character sequences. Towards advanced text recognition, there are three key challenges: (1) an encoder capable of representing the visual and semantic distributions; (2) a decoder that ensures the alignment between vision and semantics; and (3) consistency in the framework during pre-training, if it exists, and fine-tuning. Inspired by masked autoencoding, a successful pre-training strategy in both vision and language, we propose an innovative scene text recognition approach, named VL-Reader. The novelty of the VL-Reader lies in the pervasive interplay between vision and language throughout the entire process. Concretely, we first introduce a Masked Visual-Linguistic Reconstruction (MVLR) objective, which aims at simultaneously modeling visual and linguistic information. Then, we design a Masked Visual-Linguistic Decoder (MVLD) to further leverage masked vision-language context and achieve bi-modal feature interaction. The architecture of VL-Reader maintains consistency from pre-training to fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, VL-Reader reconstructs both masked visual and text tokens, while in the fine-tuning stage, the network degrades to reconstruct all characters from an image without any masked regions. VL-reader achieves an average accuracy of 97.1% on six typical datasets, surpassing the SOTA by 1.1%. The improvement was even more significant on challenging datasets. The results demonstrate that vision and language reconstructor can serve as an effective scene text recognizer.

- **Summary**: This work presents Spacecraft Pose Network v3 (SPNv3), a Neural Network (NN) for monocular pose estimation of a known, non-cooperative target spacecraft. As opposed to existing literature, SPNv3 is designed and trained to be computationally efficient while providing robustness to spaceborne images that have not been observed during offline training and validation on the ground. These characteristics are essential to deploying NNs on space-grade edge devices. They are achieved through careful NN design choices, and an extensive trade-off analysis reveals features such as data augmentation, transfer learning and vision transformer architecture as a few of those that contribute to simultaneously maximizing robustness and minimizing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that the final SPNv3 can achieve state-of-the-art pose accuracy on hardware-in-the-loop images from a robotic testbed while having trained exclusively on computer-generated synthetic images, effectively bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real imagery. At the same time, SPNv3 runs well above the update frequency of modern satellite navigation filters when tested on a representative graphical processing unit system with flight heritage. Overall, SPNv3 is an efficient, flight-ready NN model readily applicable to a wide range of close-range rendezvous and proximity operations with target resident space objects. The code implementation of SPNv3 will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Histopathology analysis is the gold standard for medical diagnosis. Accurate classification of whole slide images (WSIs) and region-of-interests (ROIs) localization can assist pathologists in diagnosis. The gigapixel resolution of WSI and the absence of fine-grained annotations make direct classification and analysis challenging. In weakly supervised learning, multiple instance learning (MIL) presents a promising approach for WSI classification. The prevailing strategy is to use attention mechanisms to measure instance importance for classification. However, attention mechanisms fail to capture inter-instance information, and self-attention causes quadratic computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose AMD-MIL, an agent aggregator with a mask denoise mechanism. The agent token acts as an intermediate variable between the query and key for computing instance importance. Mask and denoising matrices, mapped from agents-aggregated value, dynamically mask low-contribution representations and eliminate noise. AMD-MIL achieves better attention allocation by adjusting feature representations, capturing micro-metastases in cancer, and improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on CAMELYON-16, CAMELYON-17, TCGA-KIDNEY, and TCGA-LUNG show AMD-MIL's superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful 3D scene representation technique, capturing fine details with high efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel voting-based method that extends 2D segmentation models to 3D Gaussian splats. Our approach leverages masked gradients, where gradients are filtered by input 2D masks, and these gradients are used as votes to achieve accurate segmentation. As a byproduct, we discovered that inference-time gradients can also be used to prune Gaussians, resulting in up to 21% compression. Additionally, we explore few-shot affordance transfer, allowing annotations from 2D images to be effectively transferred onto 3D Gaussian splats. The robust yet straightforward mathematical formulation underlying this approach makes it a highly effective tool for numerous downstream applications, such as augmented reality (AR), object editing, and robotics.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose SRIF, a novel Semantic shape Registration framework based on diffusion-based Image morphing and Flow estimation. More concretely, given a pair of extrinsically aligned shapes, we first render them from multi-views, and then utilize an image interpolation framework based on diffusion models to generate sequences of intermediate images between them. The images are later fed into a dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting framework, with which we reconstruct and post-process for intermediate point clouds respecting the image morphing processing. In the end, tailored for the above, we propose a novel registration module to estimate continuous normalizing flow, which deforms source shape consistently towards the target, with intermediate point clouds as weak guidance. Our key insight is to leverage large vision models (LVMs) to associate shapes and therefore obtain much richer semantic information on the relationship between shapes than the ad-hoc feature extraction and alignment. As a consequence, SRIF achieves high-quality dense correspondences on challenging shape pairs, but also delivers smooth, semantically meaningful interpolation in between. Empirical evidence justifies the effectiveness and superiority of our method as well as specific design choices. The code is released at https://github.com/rqhuang88/SRIF.

- **Summary**: Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are frequently performed in clinical settings. Opportunistic CT involves repurposing routine CT images to extract diagnostic information and is an emerging tool for detecting underdiagnosed conditions such as sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites. This study utilizes deep learning methods to promote accurate diagnosis and clinical documentation. We analyze 2,674 inpatient CT scans to identify discrepancies between imaging phenotypes (characteristics derived from opportunistic CT scans) and their corresponding documentation in radiology reports and ICD coding. Through our analysis, we find that only 0.5%, 3.2%, and 30.7% of scans diagnosed with sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites (respectively) through either opportunistic imaging or radiology reports were ICD-coded. Our findings demonstrate opportunistic CT's potential to enhance diagnostic precision and accuracy of risk adjustment models, offering advancements in precision medicine.

- **Summary**: A major limitation of minimally invasive surgery is the difficulty in accurately locating the internal anatomical structures of the target organ due to the lack of tactile feedback and transparency. Augmented reality (AR) offers a promising solution to overcome this challenge. Numerous studies have shown that combining learning-based and geometric methods can achieve accurate preoperative and intraoperative data registration. This work proposes a real-time monocular 3D tracking algorithm for post-registration tasks. The ORB-SLAM2 framework is adopted and modified for prior-based 3D tracking. The primitive 3D shape is used for fast initialization of the monocular SLAM. A pseudo-segmentation strategy is employed to separate the target organ from the background for tracking purposes, and the geometric prior of the 3D shape is incorporated as an additional constraint in the pose graph. Experiments from in-vivo and ex-vivo tests demonstrate that the proposed 3D tracking system provides robust 3D tracking and effectively handles typical challenges such as fast motion, out-of-field-of-view scenarios, partial visibility, and "organ-background" relative motion.

- **Summary**: Pose skeleton images are an important reference in pose-controllable image generation. In order to enrich the source of skeleton images, recent works have investigated the generation of pose skeletons based on natural language. These methods are based on GANs. However, it remains challenging to perform diverse, structurally correct and aesthetically pleasing human pose skeleton generation with various textual inputs. To address this problem, we propose a framework with GUNet as the main model, PoseDiffusion. It is the first generative framework based on a diffusion model and also contains a series of variants fine-tuned based on a stable diffusion model. PoseDiffusion demonstrates several desired properties that outperform existing methods. 1) Correct Skeletons. GUNet, a denoising model of PoseDiffusion, is designed to incorporate graphical convolutional neural networks. It is able to learn the spatial relationships of the human skeleton by introducing skeletal information during the training process. 2) Diversity. We decouple the key points of the skeleton and characterise them separately, and use cross-attention to introduce textual conditions. Experimental results show that PoseDiffusion outperforms existing SoTA algorithms in terms of stability and diversity of text-driven pose skeleton generation. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate its superiority for controllable generation in Stable Diffusion.

- **Summary**: Deep visual odometry, despite extensive research, still faces limitations in accuracy and generalizability that prevent its broader application. To address these challenges, we propose an Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB)-guided visual odometry with selective online adaptation named ORB-SfMLearner. We present a novel use of ORB features for learning-based ego-motion estimation, leading to more robust and accurate results. We also introduce the cross-attention mechanism to enhance the explainability of PoseNet and have revealed that driving direction of the vehicle can be explained through attention weights, marking a novel exploration in this area. To improve generalizability, our selective online adaptation allows the network to rapidly and selectively adjust to the optimal parameters across different domains. Experimental results on KITTI and vKITTI datasets show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art deep visual odometry methods in terms of ego-motion accuracy and generalizability.

- **Summary**: Human cognition can leverage fundamental conceptual knowledge, like geometric and kinematic ones, to appropriately perceive, comprehend and interact with novel objects. Motivated by this finding, we aim to endow machine intelligence with an analogous capability through performing at the conceptual level, in order to understand and then interact with articulated objects, especially for those in novel categories, which is challenging due to the intricate geometric structures and diverse joint types of articulated objects. To achieve this goal, we propose Analytic Ontology Template (AOT), a parameterized and differentiable program description of generalized conceptual ontologies. A baseline approach called AOTNet driven by AOTs is designed accordingly to equip intelligent agents with these generalized concepts, and then empower the agents to effectively discover the conceptual knowledge on the structure and affordance of articulated objects. The AOT-driven approach yields benefits in three key perspectives: i) enabling concept-level understanding of articulated objects without relying on any real training data, ii) providing analytic structure information, and iii) introducing rich affordance information indicating proper ways of interaction. We conduct exhaustive experiments and the results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in understanding and then interacting with articulated objects.

- **Summary**: Multi-camera perception methods in Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) have gained wide application in autonomous driving. However, due to the differences between roadside and vehicle-side scenarios, there currently lacks a multi-camera BEV solution in roadside. This paper systematically analyzes the key challenges in multi-camera BEV perception for roadside scenarios compared to vehicle-side. These challenges include the diversity in camera poses, the uncertainty in Camera numbers, the sparsity in perception regions, and the ambiguity in orientation angles. In response, we introduce RopeBEV, the first dense multi-camera BEV approach. RopeBEV introduces BEV augmentation to address the training balance issues caused by diverse camera poses. By incorporating CamMask and ROIMask (Region of Interest Mask), it supports variable camera numbers and sparse perception, respectively. Finally, camera rotation embedding is utilized to resolve orientation ambiguity. Our method ranks 1st on the real-world highway dataset RoScenes and demonstrates its practical value on a private urban dataset that covers more than 50 intersections and 600 cameras.

- **Summary**: Light-Field (LF) image is emerging 4D data of light rays that is capable of realistically presenting spatial and angular information of 3D scene. However, the large data volume of LF images becomes the most challenging issue in real-time processing, transmission, and storage. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep LF Image Compression method Using Disentangled Representation and Asymmetrical Strip Convolution (LFIC-DRASC) to improve coding efficiency. Firstly, we formulate the LF image compression problem as learning a disentangled LF representation network and an image encoding-decoding network. Secondly, we propose two novel feature extractors that leverage the structural prior of LF data by integrating features across different dimensions. Meanwhile, disentangled LF representation network is proposed to enhance the LF feature disentangling and decoupling. Thirdly, we propose the LFIC-DRASC for LF image compression, where two Asymmetrical Strip Convolution (ASC) operators, i.e. horizontal and vertical, are proposed to capture long-range correlation in LF feature space. These two ASC operators can be combined with the square convolution to further decouple LF features, which enhances the model ability in representing intricate spatial relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LFIC-DRASC achieves an average of 20.5\% bit rate reductions comparing with the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised video semantic compression (UVSC), i.e., compressing videos to better support various analysis tasks, has recently garnered attention. However, the semantic richness of previous methods remains limited, due to the single semantic learning objective, limited training data, etc. To address this, we propose to boost the UVSC task by absorbing the off-the-shelf rich semantics from VFMs. Specifically, we introduce a VFMs-shared semantic alignment layer, complemented by VFM-specific prompts, to flexibly align semantics between the compressed video and various VFMs. This allows different VFMs to collaboratively build a mutually-enhanced semantic space, guiding the learning of the compression model. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic trajectory-based inter-frame compression scheme, which first estimates the semantic trajectory based on the historical content, and then traverses along the trajectory to predict the future semantics as the coding context. This reduces the overall bitcost of the system, further improving the compression efficiency. Our approach outperforms previous coding methods on three mainstream tasks and six datasets.

- **Summary**: Current audio-visual representation learning can capture rough object categories (e.g., ``animals'' and ``instruments''), but it lacks the ability to recognize fine-grained details, such as specific categories like ``dogs'' and ``flutes'' within animals and instruments. To address this issue, we introduce DETECLAP, a method to enhance audio-visual representation learning with object information. Our key idea is to introduce an audio-visual label prediction loss to the existing Contrastive Audio-Visual Masked AutoEncoder to enhance its object awareness. To avoid costly manual annotations, we prepare object labels from both audio and visual inputs using state-of-the-art language-audio models and object detectors. We evaluate the method of audio-visual retrieval and classification using the VGGSound and AudioSet20K datasets. Our method achieves improvements in recall@10 of +1.5% and +1.2% for audio-to-visual and visual-to-audio retrieval, respectively, and an improvement in accuracy of +0.6% for audio-visual classification.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce Geometry-Inverse-Meet-Pixel-Insert, short for GEO, an exceptionally versatile image editing technique designed to cater to customized user requirements at both local and global scales. Our approach seamlessly integrates text prompts and image prompts to yield diverse and precise editing outcomes. Notably, our method operates without the need for training and is driven by two key contributions: (i) a novel geometric accumulation loss that enhances DDIM inversion to faithfully preserve pixel space geometry and layout, and (ii) an innovative boosted image prompt technique that combines pixel-level editing for text-only inversion with latent space geometry guidance for standard classifier-free reversion. Leveraging the publicly available Stable Diffusion model, our approach undergoes extensive evaluation across various image types and challenging prompt editing scenarios, consistently delivering high-fidelity editing results for real images.

- **Summary**: Compressed sensing (CS) has emerged to overcome the inefficiency of Nyquist sampling. However, traditional optimization-based reconstruction is slow and can not yield an exact image in practice. Deep learning-based reconstruction has been a promising alternative to optimization-based reconstruction, outperforming it in accuracy and computation speed. Finding an efficient sampling method with deep learning-based reconstruction, especially for Fourier CS remains a challenge. Existing joint optimization of sampling-reconstruction works ($\mathcal{H}_1$) optimize the sampling mask but have low potential as it is not adaptive to each data point. Adaptive sampling ($\mathcal{H}_2$) has also disadvantages of difficult optimization and Pareto sub-optimality. Here, we propose a novel adaptive selection of sampling-reconstruction ($\mathcal{H}_{1.5}$) framework that selects the best sampling mask and reconstruction network for each input data. We provide theorems that our method has a higher potential than $\mathcal{H}_1$ and effectively solves the Pareto sub-optimality problem in sampling-reconstruction by using separate reconstruction networks for different sampling masks. To select the best sampling mask, we propose to quantify the high-frequency Bayesian uncertainty of the input, using a super-resolution space generation model. Our method outperforms joint optimization of sampling-reconstruction ($\mathcal{H}_1$) and adaptive sampling ($\mathcal{H}_2$) by achieving significant improvements on several Fourier CS problems.

- **Summary**: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) significantly affects the social and communication abilities of children, and eye-tracking is commonly used as a diagnostic tool by identifying associated atypical gaze patterns. Traditional methods demand manual identification of Areas of Interest in gaze patterns, lowering the performance of gaze behavior analysis in ASD subjects. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel method to automatically analyze gaze behaviors in ASD children with superior accuracy. To be specific, we first apply and optimize seven clustering algorithms to automatically group gaze points to compare ASD subjects with typically developing peers. Subsequently, we extract 63 significant features to fully describe the patterns. These features can describe correlations between ASD diagnosis and gaze patterns. Lastly, using these features as prior knowledge, we train multiple predictive machine learning models to predict and diagnose ASD based on their gaze behaviors. To evaluate our method, we apply our method to three ASD datasets. The experimental and visualization results demonstrate the improvements of clustering algorithms in the analysis of unique gaze patterns in ASD children. Additionally, these predictive machine learning models achieved state-of-the-art prediction performance ($81\%$ AUC) in the field of automatically constructed gaze point features for ASD diagnosis.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: 3D Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) obtains significant performance improvements with the rapid advancements in 3D object detection, particularly in cost-effective multi-camera setups. However, the prevalent end-to-end training approach for multi-camera trackers results in detector-specific models, limiting their versatility. Moreover, current generic trackers overlook the unique features of multi-camera detectors, i.e., the unreliability of motion observations and the feasibility of visual information. To address these challenges, we propose RockTrack, a 3D MOT method for multi-camera detectors. Following the Tracking-By-Detection framework, RockTrack is compatible with various off-the-shelf detectors. RockTrack incorporates a confidence-guided preprocessing module to extract reliable motion and image observations from distinct representation spaces from a single detector. These observations are then fused in an association module that leverages geometric and appearance cues to minimize mismatches. The resulting matches are propagated through a staged estimation process, forming the basis for heuristic noise modeling. Additionally, we introduce a novel appearance similarity metric for explicitly characterizing object affinities in multi-camera settings. RockTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes vision-only tracking leaderboard with 59.1% AMOTA while demonstrating impressive computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: Achieving human-like memory recall in artificial systems remains a challenging frontier in computer vision. Humans demonstrate remarkable ability to recall images after a single exposure, even after being shown thousands of images. However, this capacity diminishes significantly when confronted with non-natural stimuli such as random textures. In this paper, we present a method inspired by human memory processes to bridge this gap between artificial and biological memory systems. Our approach focuses on encoding images to mimic the high-level information retained by the human brain, rather than storing raw pixel data. By adding noise to images before encoding, we introduce variability akin to the non-deterministic nature of human memory encoding. Leveraging pre-trained models' embedding layers, we explore how different architectures encode images and their impact on memory recall. Our method achieves impressive results, with 97% accuracy on natural images and near-random performance (52%) on textures. We provide insights into the encoding process and its implications for machine learning memory systems, shedding light on the parallels between human and artificial intelligence memory mechanisms.

- **Summary**: In recent years, significant progress has been made in tumor segmentation within the field of digital pathology. However, variations in organs, tissue preparation methods, and image acquisition processes can lead to domain discrepancies among digital pathology images. To address this problem, in this paper, we use Rein, a fine-tuning method, to parametrically and efficiently fine-tune various vision foundation models (VFMs) for MICCAI 2024 Cross-Organ and Cross-Scanner Adenocarcinoma Segmentation (COSAS2024). The core of Rein consists of a set of learnable tokens, which are directly linked to instances, improving functionality at the instance level in each layer. In the data environment of the COSAS2024 Challenge, extensive experiments demonstrate that Rein fine-tuned the VFMs to achieve satisfactory results. Specifically, we used Rein to fine-tune ConvNeXt and DINOv2. Our team used the former to achieve scores of 0.7719 and 0.7557 on the preliminary test phase and final test phase in task1, respectively, while the latter achieved scores of 0.8848 and 0.8192 on the preliminary test phase and final test phase in task2.

- **Summary**: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to incrementally recognize new classes using a few samples while maintaining the performance on previously learned classes. One of the effective methods to solve this challenge is to construct prototypical evolution classifiers. Despite the advancement achieved by most existing methods, the classifier weights are simply initialized using mean features. Because representations for new classes are weak and biased, we argue such a strategy is suboptimal. In this paper, we tackle this issue from two aspects. Firstly, thanks to the development of foundation models, we employ a foundation model, the CLIP, as the network pedestal to provide a general representation for each class. Secondly, to generate a more reliable and comprehensive instance representation, we propose a Knowledge Adapter (KA) module that summarizes the data-specific knowledge from training data and fuses it into the general representation. Additionally, to tune the knowledge learned from the base classes to the upcoming classes, we propose a mechanism of Incremental Pseudo Episode Learning (IPEL) by simulating the actual FSCIL. Taken together, our proposed method, dubbed as Knowledge Adaptation Network (KANet), achieves competitive performance on a wide range of datasets, including CIFAR100, CUB200, and ImageNet-R.

- **Summary**: Deep trackers have proven success in visual tracking. Typically, these trackers employ optimally pre-trained deep networks to represent all diverse objects with multi-channel features from some fixed layers. The deep networks employed are usually trained to extract rich knowledge from massive data used in object classification and so they are capable to represent generic objects very well. However, these networks are too complex to represent a specific moving object, leading to poor generalization as well as high computational and memory costs. This paper presents a novel and general framework termed channel distillation to facilitate deep trackers. To validate the effectiveness of channel distillation, we take discriminative correlation filter (DCF) and ECO for example. We demonstrate that an integrated formulation can turn feature compression, response map generation, and model update into a unified energy minimization problem to adaptively select informative feature channels that improve the efficacy of tracking moving objects on the fly. Channel distillation can accurately extract good channels, alleviating the influence of noisy channels and generally reducing the number of channels, as well as adaptively generalizing to different channels and networks. The resulting deep tracker is accurate, fast, and has low memory requirements. Extensive experimental evaluations on popular benchmarks clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our framework.

- **Summary**: Face recognition in the wild is now advancing towards light-weight models, fast inference speed and resolution-adapted capability. In this paper, we propose a bridge distillation approach to turn a complex face model pretrained on private high-resolution faces into a light-weight one for low-resolution face recognition. In our approach, such a cross-dataset resolution-adapted knowledge transfer problem is solved via two-step distillation. In the first step, we conduct cross-dataset distillation to transfer the prior knowledge from private high-resolution faces to public high-resolution faces and generate compact and discriminative features. In the second step, the resolution-adapted distillation is conducted to further transfer the prior knowledge to synthetic low-resolution faces via multi-task learning. By learning low-resolution face representations and mimicking the adapted high-resolution knowledge, a light-weight student model can be constructed with high efficiency and promising accuracy in recognizing low-resolution faces. Experimental results show that the student model performs impressively in recognizing low-resolution faces with only 0.21M parameters and 0.057MB memory. Meanwhile, its speed reaches up to 14,705, ~934 and 763 faces per second on GPU, CPU and mobile phone, respectively.

- **Summary**: Identification of suspects based on partial and smudged fingerprints, commonly referred to as fingermarks or latent fingerprints, presents a significant challenge in the field of fingerprint recognition. Although fixed-length embeddings have shown effectiveness in recognising rolled and slap fingerprints, the methods for matching latent fingerprints have primarily centred around local minutiae-based embeddings, failing to fully exploit global representations for matching purposes. Consequently, enhancing latent fingerprints becomes critical to ensuring robust identification for forensic investigations. Current approaches often prioritise restoring ridge patterns, overlooking the fine-macroeconomic details crucial for accurate fingerprint recognition. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses generative adversary networks (GANs) to redefine Latent Fingerprint Enhancement (LFE) through a structured approach to fingerprint generation. By directly optimising the minutiae information during the generation process, the model produces enhanced latent fingerprints that exhibit exceptional fidelity to ground-truth instances. This leads to a significant improvement in identification performance. Our framework integrates minutiae locations and orientation fields, ensuring the preservation of both local and structural fingerprint features. Extensive evaluations conducted on two publicly available datasets demonstrate our method's dominance over existing state-of-the-art techniques, highlighting its potential to significantly enhance latent fingerprint recognition accuracy in forensic applications.

- **Summary**: The event camera has demonstrated significant success across a wide range of areas due to its low time latency and high dynamic range. However, the community faces challenges such as data deficiency and limited diversity, often resulting in over-fitting and inadequate feature learning. Notably, the exploration of data augmentation techniques in the event community remains scarce. This work aims to address this gap by introducing a systematic augmentation scheme named EventAug to enrich spatial-temporal diversity. In particular, we first propose Multi-scale Temporal Integration (MSTI) to diversify the motion speed of objects, then introduce Spatial-salient Event Mask (SSEM) and Temporal-salient Event Mask (TSEM) to enrich object variants. Our EventAug can facilitate models learning with richer motion patterns, object variants and local spatio-temporal relations, thus improving model robustness to varied moving speeds, occlusions, and action disruptions. Experiment results show that our augmentation method consistently yields significant improvements across different tasks and backbones (e.g., a 4.87% accuracy gain on DVS128 Gesture). Our code will be publicly available for this community.

- **Summary**: Over the past decade, there has been a steady advancement in enhancing face recognition algorithms leveraging advanced machine learning methods. The role of the loss function is pivotal in addressing face verification problems and playing a game-changing role. These loss functions have mainly explored variations among intra-class or inter-class separation. This research examines the natural phenomenon of facial symmetry in the face verification problem. The symmetry between the left and right hemi faces has been widely used in many research areas in recent decades. This paper adopts this simple approach judiciously by splitting the face image vertically into two halves. With the assumption that the natural phenomena of facial symmetry can enhance face verification methodology, we hypothesize that the two output embedding vectors of split faces must project close to each other in the output embedding space. Inspired by this concept, we penalize the network based on the disparity of embedding of the symmetrical pair of split faces. Symmetrical loss has the potential to minimize minor asymmetric features due to facial expression and lightning conditions, hence significantly increasing the inter-class variance among the classes and leading to more reliable face embedding. This loss function propels any network to outperform its baseline performance across all existing network architectures and configurations, enabling us to achieve SoTA results.

- **Summary**: The recent development of deep learning large models in medicine shows remarkable performance in medical image analysis and diagnosis, but their large number of parameters causes memory and inference latency challenges. Knowledge distillation offers a solution, but the slide-level gradients cannot be backpropagated for student model updates due to high-resolution pathological images and slide-level labels. This study presents an Efficient Fine-tuning on Compressed Models (EFCM) framework with two stages: unsupervised feature distillation and fine-tuning. In the distillation stage, Feature Projection Distillation (FPD) is proposed with a TransScan module for adaptive receptive field adjustment to enhance the knowledge absorption capability of the student model. In the slide-level fine-tuning stage, three strategies (Reuse CLAM, Retrain CLAM, and End2end Train CLAM (ETC)) are compared. Experiments are conducted on 11 downstream datasets related to three large medical models: RETFound for retina, MRM for chest X-ray, and BROW for histopathology. The experimental results demonstrate that the EFCM framework significantly improves accuracy and efficiency in handling slide-level pathological image problems, effectively addressing the challenges of deploying large medical models. Specifically, it achieves a 4.33% increase in ACC and a 5.2% increase in AUC compared to the large model BROW on the TCGA-NSCLC and TCGA-BRCA datasets. The analysis of model inference efficiency highlights the high efficiency of the distillation fine-tuning method.

- **Summary**: 6D object pose estimation is the problem of identifying the position and orientation of an object relative to a chosen coordinate system, which is a core technology for modern XR applications. State-of-the-art 6D object pose estimators directly predict an object pose given an object observation. Due to the ill-posed nature of the pose estimation problem, where multiple different poses can correspond to a single observation, generating additional plausible estimates per observation can be valuable. To address this, we reformulate the state-of-the-art algorithm GDRNPP and introduce EPRO-GDR (End-to-End Probabilistic Geometry-Guided Regression). Instead of predicting a single pose per detection, we estimate a probability density distribution of the pose. Using the evaluation procedure defined by the BOP (Benchmark for 6D Object Pose Estimation) Challenge, we test our approach on four of its core datasets and demonstrate superior quantitative results for EPRO-GDR on LM-O, YCB-V, and ITODD. Our probabilistic solution shows that predicting a pose distribution instead of a single pose can improve state-of-the-art single-view pose estimation while providing the additional benefit of being able to sample multiple meaningful pose candidates.

- **Summary**: Cloth state estimation is an important problem in robotics. It is essential for the robot to know the accurate state to manipulate cloth and execute tasks such as robotic dressing, stitching, and covering/uncovering human beings. However, estimating cloth state accurately remains challenging due to its high flexibility and self-occlusion. This paper proposes a diffusion model-based pipeline that formulates the cloth state estimation as an image generation problem by representing the cloth state as an RGB image that describes the point-wise translation (translation map) between a pre-defined flattened mesh and the deformed mesh in a canonical space. Then we train a conditional diffusion-based image generation model to predict the translation map based on an observation. Experiments are conducted in both simulation and the real world to validate the performance of our method. Results indicate that our method outperforms two recent methods in both accuracy and speed.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces the Neural Transcoding Vision Transformer (\modelname), a generative model designed to estimate high-resolution functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) samples from simultaneous Electroencephalography (EEG) data. A key feature of \modelname is its Domain Matching (DM) sub-module which effectively aligns the latent EEG representations with those of fMRI volumes, enhancing the model's accuracy and reliability. Unlike previous methods that tend to struggle with fidelity and reproducibility of images, \modelname addresses these challenges by ensuring methodological integrity and higher-quality reconstructions which we showcase through extensive evaluation on two benchmark datasets; \modelname outperforms the current state-of-the-art by a significant margin in both cases, e.g. achieving a $10\times$ reduction in RMSE and a $3.14\times$ increase in SSIM on the Oddball dataset. An ablation study also provides insights into the contribution of each component to the model's overall effectiveness. This development is critical in offering a new approach to lessen the time and financial constraints typically linked with high-resolution brain imaging, thereby aiding in the swift and precise diagnosis of neurological disorders. Although it is not a replacement for actual fMRI but rather a step towards making such imaging more accessible, we believe that it represents a pivotal advancement in clinical practice and neuroscience research.

- **Summary**: Photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) is widely used in estimating the camera pose and 3D geometry by assuming a Lambertian world. However, the assumption of photometric consistency is often violated since the non-diffuse reflection is common in real-world environments. The photometric inconsistency significantly affects the reliability of existing PBA methods. To solve this problem, we propose a novel physically-based PBA method. Specifically, we introduce the physically-based weights regarding material, illumination, and light path. These weights distinguish the pixel pairs with different levels of photometric inconsistency. We also design corresponding models for material estimation based on sequential images and illumination estimation based on point clouds. In addition, we establish the first SLAM-related dataset of non-Lambertian scenes with complete ground truth of illumination and material. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our PBA method outperforms existing approaches in accuracy.

- **Summary**: State-space models (SSMs), exemplified by S4, have introduced a novel context modeling method by integrating state-space techniques into deep learning. However, they struggle with global context modeling due to their data-independent matrices. The Mamba model addressed this with data-dependent variants via the S6 selective-scan algorithm, enhancing context modeling, especially for long sequences. However, Mamba-based architectures are difficult to scale with respect to the number of parameters, which is a major limitation for vision applications. This paper addresses the scalability issue of large SSMs for image classification and action recognition without requiring additional techniques like knowledge distillation. We analyze the distinct characteristics of Mamba-based and Attention-based models, proposing a Mamba-Attention interleaved architecture that enhances scalability, robustness, and performance. We demonstrate that the stable and efficient interleaved architecture resolves the scalability issue of Mamba-based architectures for images and videos and increases robustness to common artifacts like JPEG compression. Our thorough evaluation on the ImageNet-1K, Kinetics-400 and Something-Something-v2 benchmarks demonstrates that our approach improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art Mamba-based architectures by up to $+1.7$.

- **Summary**: Gait recognition is a rapidly progressing technique for the remote identification of individuals. Prior research predominantly employing 2D sensors to gather gait data has achieved notable advancements; nonetheless, they have unavoidably neglected the influence of 3D dynamic characteristics on recognition. Gait recognition utilizing LiDAR 3D point clouds not only directly captures 3D spatial features but also diminishes the impact of lighting conditions while ensuring privacy protection.The essence of the problem lies in how to effectively extract discriminative 3D dynamic representation from point clouds.In this paper, we proposes a method named SpheriGait for extracting and enhancing dynamic features from point clouds for Lidar-based gait recognition. Specifically, it substitutes the conventional point cloud plane projection method with spherical projection to augment the perception of dynamic feature.Additionally, a network block named DAM-L is proposed to extract gait cues from the projected point cloud data. We conducted extensive experiments and the results demonstrated the SpheriGait achieved state-of-the-art performance on the SUSTech1K dataset, and verified that the spherical projection method can serve as a universal data preprocessing technique to enhance the performance of other LiDAR-based gait recognition methods, exhibiting exceptional flexibility and practicality.

- **Summary**: In the fast-evolving field of Generative AI, platforms like MidJourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion have transformed Text-to-Image (T2I) Generation. However, despite their impressive ability to create high-quality images, they often struggle to generate accurate text within these images. Theoretically, if we could achieve accurate text generation in AI images in a ``zero-shot'' manner, it would not only make AI-generated images more meaningful but also democratize the graphic design industry. The first step towards this goal is to create a robust scoring matrix for evaluating text accuracy in AI-generated images. Although there are existing bench-marking methods like CLIP SCORE and T2I-CompBench++, there's still a gap in systematically evaluating text and typography in AI-generated images, especially with diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation matrix designed explicitly for quantifying the performance of text and typography generation within AI-generated images. We have used letter by letter matching strategy to compute the exact matching scores from the reference text to the AI generated text. Our novel approach to calculate the score takes care of multiple redundancies such as repetition of words, case sensitivity, mixing of words, irregular incorporation of letters etc. Moreover, we have developed a Novel method named as brevity adjustment to handle excess text. In addition we have also done a quantitative analysis of frequent errors arise due to frequently used words and less frequently used words.

- **Summary**: Efficiently evaluating the performance of text-to-image models is difficult as it inherently requires subjective judgment and human preference, making it hard to compare different models and quantify the state of the art. Leveraging Rapidata's technology, we present an efficient annotation framework that sources human feedback from a diverse, global pool of annotators. Our study collected over 2 million annotations across 4,512 images, evaluating four prominent models (DALL-E 3, Flux.1, MidJourney, and Stable Diffusion) on style preference, coherence, and text-to-image alignment. We demonstrate that our approach makes it feasible to comprehensively rank image generation models based on a vast pool of annotators and show that the diverse annotator demographics reflect the world population, significantly decreasing the risk of biases.

- **Summary**: Background: Voxel-based analysis (VBA) for population level radiotherapy (RT) outcomes modeling requires topology preserving inter-patient deformable image registration (DIR) that preserves tumors on moving images while avoiding unrealistic deformations due to tumors occurring on fixed images. Purpose: We developed a tumor-aware recurrent registration (TRACER) deep learning (DL) method and evaluated its suitability for VBA. Methods: TRACER consists of encoder layers implemented with stacked 3D convolutional long short term memory network (3D-CLSTM) followed by decoder and spatial transform layers to compute dense deformation vector field (DVF). Multiple CLSTM steps are used to compute a progressive sequence of deformations. Input conditioning was applied by including tumor segmentations with 3D image pairs as input channels. Bidirectional tumor rigidity, image similarity, and deformation smoothness losses were used to optimize the network in an unsupervised manner. TRACER and multiple DL methods were trained with 204 3D CT image pairs from patients with lung cancers (LC) and evaluated using (a) Dataset I (N = 308 pairs) with DL segmented LCs, (b) Dataset II (N = 765 pairs) with manually delineated LCs, and (c) Dataset III with 42 LC patients treated with RT. Results: TRACER accurately aligned normal tissues. It best preserved tumors, blackindicated by the smallest tumor volume difference of 0.24\%, 0.40\%, and 0.13 \% and mean square error in CT intensities of 0.005, 0.005, 0.004, computed between original and resampled moving image tumors, for Datasets I, II, and III, respectively. It resulted in the smallest planned RT tumor dose difference computed between original and resampled moving images of 0.01 Gy and 0.013 Gy when using a female and a male reference.

- **Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive performances on numerous tasks but their zero-shot capabilities can be limited compared to dedicated or fine-tuned models. Yet, fine-tuning VLMs comes with limitations as it requires `white-box' access to the model's architecture and weights as well as expertise to design the fine-tuning objectives and optimize the hyper-parameters, which are specific to each VLM and downstream task. In this work, we propose LLM-wrapper, a novel approach to adapt VLMs in a `black-box' manner by leveraging large language models (LLMs) so as to reason on their outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-wrapper on Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), a challenging open-vocabulary task that requires spatial and semantic reasoning. Our approach significantly boosts the performance of off-the-shelf models, resulting in competitive results when compared with classic fine-tuning.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the challenge of generating realistic 3D human motions for action classes that were never seen during the training phase. Our approach involves decomposing complex actions into simpler movements, specifically those observed during training, by leveraging the knowledge of human motion contained in GPTs models. These simpler movements are then combined into a single, realistic animation using the properties of diffusion models. Our claim is that this decomposition and subsequent recombination of simple movements can synthesize an animation that accurately represents the complex input action. This method operates during the inference phase and can be integrated with any pre-trained diffusion model, enabling the synthesis of motion classes not present in the training data. We evaluate our method by dividing two benchmark human motion datasets into basic and complex actions, and then compare its performance against the state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: We present Agglomerative Token Clustering (ATC), a novel token merging method that consistently outperforms previous token merging and pruning methods across image classification, image synthesis, and object detection & segmentation tasks. ATC merges clusters through bottom-up hierarchical clustering, without the introduction of extra learnable parameters. We find that ATC achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks, and can even perform on par with prior state-of-the-art when applied off-the-shelf, i.e. without fine-tuning. ATC is particularly effective when applied with low keep rates, where only a small fraction of tokens are kept and retaining task performance is especially difficult.

- **Summary**: Tooth arrangement is an essential step in the digital orthodontic planning process. Existing learning-based methods use hidden teeth features to directly regress teeth motions, which couples target pose perception and motion regression. It could lead to poor perceptions of three-dimensional transformation. They also ignore the possible overlaps or gaps between teeth of predicted dentition, which is generally unacceptable. Therefore, we propose DTAN, a differentiable collision-supervised tooth arrangement network, decoupling predicting tasks and feature modeling. DTAN decouples the tooth arrangement task by first predicting the hidden features of the final teeth poses and then using them to assist in regressing the motions between the beginning and target teeth. To learn the hidden features better, DTAN also decouples the teeth-hidden features into geometric and positional features, which are further supervised by feature consistency constraints. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable collision loss function for point cloud data to constrain the related gestures between teeth, which can be easily extended to other 3D point cloud tasks. We propose an arch-width guided tooth arrangement network, named C-DTAN, to make the results controllable. We construct three different tooth arrangement datasets and achieve drastically improved performance on accuracy and speed compared with existing methods.

- **Summary**: Real-time rendering of human head avatars is a cornerstone of many computer graphics applications, such as augmented reality, video games, and films, to name a few. Recent approaches address this challenge with computationally efficient geometry primitives in a carefully calibrated multi-view setup. Albeit producing photorealistic head renderings, it often fails to represent complex motion changes such as the mouth interior and strongly varying head poses. We propose a new method to generate highly dynamic and deformable human head avatars from multi-view imagery in real-time. At the core of our method is a hierarchical representation of head models that allows to capture the complex dynamics of facial expressions and head movements. First, with rich facial features extracted from raw input frames, we learn to deform the coarse facial geometry of the template mesh. We then initialize 3D Gaussians on the deformed surface and refine their positions in a fine step. We train this coarse-to-fine facial avatar model along with the head pose as a learnable parameter in an end-to-end framework. This enables not only controllable facial animation via video inputs, but also high-fidelity novel view synthesis of challenging facial expressions, such as tongue deformations and fine-grained teeth structure under large motion changes. Moreover, it encourages the learned head avatar to generalize towards new facial expressions and head poses at inference time. We demonstrate the performance of our method with comparisons against the related methods on different datasets, spanning challenging facial expression sequences across multiple identities. We also show the potential application of our approach by demonstrating a cross-identity facial performance transfer application.

- **Summary**: Tracking any point based on image frames is constrained by frame rates, leading to instability in high-speed scenarios and limited generalization in real-world applications. To overcome these limitations, we propose an image-event fusion point tracker, FE-TAP, which combines the contextual information from image frames with the high temporal resolution of events, achieving high frame rate and robust point tracking under various challenging conditions. Specifically, we designed an Evolution Fusion module (EvoFusion) to model the image generation process guided by events. This module can effectively integrate valuable information from both modalities operating at different frequencies. To achieve smoother point trajectories, we employed a transformer-based refinement strategy that updates the point's trajectories and features iteratively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly improving expected feature age by 24$\%$ on EDS datasets. Finally, we qualitatively validated the robustness of our algorithm in real driving scenarios using our custom-designed high-resolution image-event synchronization device. Our source code will be released at https://github.com/ljx1002/FE-TAP.

- **Summary**: The current bottleneck in continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) research lies in the fact that most publicly available datasets are limited to laboratory environments or television program recordings, resulting in a single background environment with uniform lighting, which significantly deviates from the diversity and complexity found in real-life scenarios. To address this challenge, we have constructed a new, large-scale dataset for Chinese continuous sign language (CSL) based on complex environments, termed the complex environment - chinese sign language dataset (CE-CSL). This dataset encompasses 5,988 continuous CSL video clips collected from daily life scenes, featuring more than 70 different complex backgrounds to ensure representativeness and generalization capability. To tackle the impact of complex backgrounds on CSLR performance, we propose a time-frequency network (TFNet) model for continuous sign language recognition. This model extracts frame-level features and then utilizes both temporal and spectral information to separately derive sequence features before fusion, aiming to achieve efficient and accurate CSLR. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance improvements on the CE-CSL, validating its effectiveness under complex background conditions. Additionally, our proposed method has also yielded highly competitive results when applied to three publicly available CSL datasets.

- **Summary**: End-to-end models are emerging as the mainstream in autonomous driving perception. However, the inability to meticulously deconstruct their internal mechanisms results in diminished development efficacy and impedes the establishment of trust. Pioneering in the issue, we present the Independent Functional Module Evaluation for Bird's-Eye-View Perception Model (BEV-IFME), a novel framework that juxtaposes the module's feature maps against Ground Truth within a unified semantic Representation Space to quantify their similarity, thereby assessing the training maturity of individual functional modules. The core of the framework lies in the process of feature map encoding and representation aligning, facilitated by our proposed two-stage Alignment AutoEncoder, which ensures the preservation of salient information and the consistency of feature structure. The metric for evaluating the training maturity of functional modules, Similarity Score, demonstrates a robust positive correlation with BEV metrics, with an average correlation coefficient of 0.9387, attesting to the framework's reliability for assessment purposes.

- **Summary**: Recent studies suggest a potential link between the physical structure of mitochondria and neurodegenerative diseases. With advances in Electron Microscopy techniques, it has become possible to visualize the boundary and internal membrane structures of mitochondria in detail. It is crucial to automatically segment mitochondria from these images to investigate the relationship between mitochondria and diseases. In this paper, we present a software solution for mitochondrial segmentation, highlighting mitochondria boundaries in electron microscopy tomography images and generating corresponding 3D meshes.

- **Summary**: We present in this paper a novel approach for 3D/2D intraoperative registration during neurosurgery via cross-modal inverse neural rendering. Our approach separates implicit neural representation into two components, handling anatomical structure preoperatively and appearance intraoperatively. This disentanglement is achieved by controlling a Neural Radiance Field's appearance with a multi-style hypernetwork. Once trained, the implicit neural representation serves as a differentiable rendering engine, which can be used to estimate the surgical camera pose by minimizing the dissimilarity between its rendered images and the target intraoperative image. We tested our method on retrospective patients' data from clinical cases, showing that our method outperforms state-of-the-art while meeting current clinical standards for registration.

- **Summary**: Re-identification (ReID) is a critical challenge in computer vision, predominantly studied in the context of pedestrians and vehicles. However, robust object-instance ReID, which has significant implications for tasks such as autonomous exploration, long-term perception, and scene understanding, remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel dual-path object-instance re-identification transformer architecture that integrates multimodal RGB and depth information. By leveraging depth data, we demonstrate improvements in ReID across scenes that are cluttered or have varying illumination conditions. Additionally, we develop a ReID-based localization framework that enables accurate camera localization and pose identification across different viewpoints. We validate our methods using two custom-built RGB-D datasets, as well as multiple sequences from the open-source TUM RGB-D datasets. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in both object instance ReID (mAP of 75.18) and localization accuracy (success rate of 83% on TUM-RGBD), highlighting the essential role of object ReID in advancing robotic perception. Our models, frameworks, and datasets have been made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Forecasting the semantics and 3D structure of scenes is essential for robots to navigate and plan actions safely. Recent methods have explored semantic and panoptic scene forecasting; however, they do not consider the geometry of the scene. In this work, we propose the panoptic-depth forecasting task for jointly predicting the panoptic segmentation and depth maps of unobserved future frames, from monocular camera images. To facilitate this work, we extend the popular KITTI-360 and Cityscapes benchmarks by computing depth maps from LiDAR point clouds and leveraging sequential labeled data. We also introduce a suitable evaluation metric that quantifies both the panoptic quality and depth estimation accuracy of forecasts in a coherent manner. Furthermore, we present two baselines and propose the novel PDcast architecture that learns rich spatio-temporal representations by incorporating a transformer-based encoder, a forecasting module, and task-specific decoders to predict future panoptic-depth outputs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of PDcast across two datasets and three forecasting tasks, consistently addressing the primary challenges. We make the code publicly available at https://pdcast.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

- **Summary**: Significant work has been conducted in the domain of food computing, yet these studies typically focus on single tasks such as t2t (instruction generation from food titles and ingredients), i2t (recipe generation from food images), or t2i (food image generation from recipes). None of these approaches integrate all modalities simultaneously. To address this gap, we introduce a novel food computing foundation model that achieves true multimodality, encompassing tasks such as t2t, t2i, i2t, it2t, and t2ti. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and pre-trained image encoder and decoder models, our model can perform a diverse array of food computing-related tasks, including food understanding, food recognition, recipe generation, and food image generation. Compared to previous models, our foundation model demonstrates a significantly broader range of capabilities and exhibits superior performance, particularly in food image generation and recipe generation tasks. We open-sourced ChefFusion at GitHub.

- **Summary**: As powerful pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP gain prominence, numerous studies have attempted to combine VLMs for downstream tasks. Among these, prompt learning has been validated as an effective method for adapting to new tasks, which only requiring a small number of parameters. However, current prompt learning methods face two challenges: first, a single soft prompt struggles to capture the diverse styles and patterns within a dataset; second, fine-tuning soft prompts is prone to overfitting. To address these challenges, we propose a mixture of soft prompt learning method incorporating a routing module. This module is able to capture a dataset's varied styles and dynamically selects the most suitable prompts for each instance. Additionally, we introduce a novel gating mechanism to ensure the router selects prompts based on their similarity to hard prompt templates, which both retaining knowledge from hard prompts and improving selection accuracy. We also implement semantically grouped text-level supervision, initializing each soft prompt with the token embeddings of manually designed templates from its group and applied a contrastive loss between the resulted text feature and hard prompt encoded text feature. This supervision ensures that the text features derived from soft prompts remain close to those from their corresponding hard prompts, preserving initial knowledge and mitigating overfitting. Our method has been validated on 11 datasets, demonstrating evident improvements in few-shot learning, domain generalization, and base-to-new generalization scenarios compared to existing baselines.

- **Summary**: Understanding the anisotropic reflectance of complex Earth surfaces from satellite imagery is crucial for numerous applications. Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have become popular as a machine learning technique capable of deducing the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) of a scene from multiple images. However, prior research has largely concentrated on applying NeRF to close-range imagery, estimating basic Microfacet BRDF models, which fall short for many Earth surfaces. Moreover, high-quality NeRFs generally require several images captured simultaneously, a rare occurrence in satellite imaging. To address these limitations, we propose BRDF-NeRF, developed to explicitly estimate the Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete (RPV) model, a semi-empirical BRDF model commonly employed in remote sensing. We assess our approach using two datasets: (1) Djibouti, captured in a single epoch at varying viewing angles with a fixed Sun position, and (2) Lanzhou, captured over multiple epochs with different viewing angles and Sun positions. Our results, based on only three to four satellite images for training, demonstrate that BRDF-NeRF can effectively synthesize novel views from directions far removed from the training data and produce high-quality digital surface models (DSMs).

- **Summary**: The occlusion of the sun by clouds is one of the primary sources of uncertainties in solar power generation, and is a factor that affects the wide-spread use of solar power as a primary energy source. Real-time forecasting of cloud movement and, as a result, solar irradiance is necessary to schedule and allocate energy across grid-connected photovoltaic systems. Previous works monitored cloud movement using wide-angle field of view imagery of the sky. However, such images have poor resolution for clouds that appear near the horizon, which reduces their effectiveness for long term prediction of solar occlusion. Specifically, to be able to predict occlusion of the sun over long time periods, clouds that are near the horizon need to be detected, and their velocities estimated precisely. To enable such a system, we design and deploy a catadioptric system that delivers wide-angle imagery with uniform spatial resolution of the sky over its field of view. To enable prediction over a longer time horizon, we design an algorithm that uses carefully selected spatio-temporal slices of the imagery using estimated wind direction and velocity as inputs. Using ray-tracing simulations as well as a real testbed deployed outdoors, we show that the system is capable of predicting solar occlusion as well as irradiance for tens of minutes in the future, which is an order of magnitude improvement over prior work.

- **Summary**: In practical use cases, polygonal mesh editing can be faster than generating new ones, but it can still be challenging and time-consuming for users. Existing solutions for this problem tend to focus on a single task, either geometry or novel view synthesis, which often leads to disjointed results between the mesh and view. In this work, we propose LEMON, a mesh editing pipeline that combines neural deferred shading with localized mesh optimization. Our approach begins by identifying the most important vertices in the mesh for editing, utilizing a segmentation model to focus on these key regions. Given multi-view images of an object, we optimize a neural shader and a polygonal mesh while extracting the normal map and the rendered image from each view. By using these outputs as conditioning data, we edit the input images with a text-to-image diffusion model and iteratively update our dataset while deforming the mesh. This process results in a polygonal mesh that is edited according to the given text instruction, preserving the geometric characteristics of the initial mesh while focusing on the most significant areas. We evaluate our pipeline using the DTU dataset, demonstrating that it generates finely-edited meshes more rapidly than the current state-of-the-art methods. We include our code and additional results in the supplementary material.

- **Summary**: Side-scan sonar (SSS) imagery presents unique challenges in the classification of man-made objects on the seafloor due to the complex and varied underwater environments. Historically, experts have manually interpreted SSS images, relying on conventional machine learning techniques with hand-crafted features. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) significantly advanced automated classification in this domain, they often fall short when dealing with diverse seafloor textures, such as rocky or ripple sand bottoms, where false positive rates may increase. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown potential in addressing these limitations by utilizing a self-attention mechanism to capture global information in image patches, offering more flexibility in processing spatial hierarchies. This paper rigorously compares the performance of ViT models alongside commonly used CNN architectures, such as ResNet and ConvNext, for binary classification tasks in SSS imagery. The dataset encompasses diverse geographical seafloor types and is balanced between the presence and absence of man-made objects. ViT-based models exhibit superior classification performance across f1-score, precision, recall, and accuracy metrics, although at the cost of greater computational resources. CNNs, with their inductive biases, demonstrate better computational efficiency, making them suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments like underwater vehicles. Future research directions include exploring self-supervised learning for ViTs and multi-modal fusion to further enhance performance in challenging underwater environments.

- **Summary**: Facial-video based Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) aims at measuring physiological signals and monitoring heart activity without any contact, showing significant potential in various applications. Previous deep learning based rPPG measurement are primarily based on CNNs and Transformers. However, the limited receptive fields of CNNs restrict their ability to capture long-range spatio-temporal dependencies, while Transformers also struggle with modeling long video sequences with high complexity. Recently, the state space models (SSMs) represented by Mamba are known for their impressive performance on capturing long-range dependencies from long sequences. In this paper, we propose the PhysMamba, a Mamba-based framework, to efficiently represent long-range physiological dependencies from facial videos. Specifically, we introduce the Temporal Difference Mamba block to first enhance local dynamic differences and further model the long-range spatio-temporal context. Moreover, a dual-stream SlowFast architecture is utilized to fuse the multi-scale temporal features. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets to demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of PhysMamba. The codes are available at https://github.com/Chaoqi31/PhysMamba

- **Summary**: The more than 200,000 glaciers outside the ice sheets play a crucial role in our society by influencing sea-level rise, water resource management, natural hazards, biodiversity, and tourism. However, only a fraction of these glaciers benefit from consistent and detailed in-situ observations that allow for assessing their status and changes over time. This limitation can, in part, be overcome by relying on satellite-based Earth Observation techniques. Satellite-based glacier mapping applications have historically mainly relied on manual and semi-automatic detection methods, while recently, a fast and notable transition to deep learning techniques has started.   This chapter reviews how combining multi-sensor remote sensing data and deep learning allows us to better delineate (i.e. map) glaciers and detect their temporal changes. We explain how relying on deep learning multi-sensor frameworks to map glaciers benefits from the extensive availability of regional and global glacier inventories. We also analyse the rationale behind glacier mapping, the benefits of deep learning methodologies, and the inherent challenges in integrating multi-sensor earth observation data with deep learning algorithms.   While our review aims to provide a broad overview of glacier mapping efforts, we highlight a few setups where deep learning multi-sensor remote sensing applications have a considerable potential added value. This includes applications for debris-covered and rock glaciers that are visually difficult to distinguish from surroundings and for calving glaciers that are in contact with the ocean. These specific cases are illustrated through a series of visual imageries, highlighting some significant advantages and challenges when detecting glacier changes, including dealing with seasonal snow cover, changing debris coverage, and distinguishing glacier fronts from the surrounding sea ice.

- **Summary**: Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact method that uses facial video to predict changes in blood volume, enabling physiological metrics measurement. Traditional rPPG models often struggle with poor generalization capacity in unseen domains. Current solutions to this problem is to improve its generalization in the target domain through Domain Generalization (DG) or Domain Adaptation (DA). However, both traditional methods require access to both source domain data and target domain data, which cannot be implemented in scenarios with limited access to source data, and another issue is the privacy of accessing source domain data. In this paper, we propose the first Source-free Domain Adaptation benchmark for rPPG measurement (SFDA-rPPG), which overcomes these limitations by enabling effective domain adaptation without access to source domain data. Our framework incorporates a Three-Branch Spatio-Temporal Consistency Network (TSTC-Net) to enhance feature consistency across domains. Furthermore, we propose a new rPPG distribution alignment loss based on the Frequency-domain Wasserstein Distance (FWD), which leverages optimal transport to align power spectrum distributions across domains effectively and further enforces the alignment of the three branches. Extensive cross-domain experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in source-free domain adaptation settings. Our findings highlight the significant contribution of the proposed FWD loss for distributional alignment, providing a valuable reference for future research and applications.

- **Summary**: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks, particularly as recent advancements have led to increasingly subtle implantation, making the defense more challenging. Existing defense mechanisms typically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and involve retraining an auxiliary model or fine-tuning the entire victim model. However, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always feasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and lightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD-FT, that does not require an additional clean dataset and fine-tunes only a very small part of the model to disinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a simple data purification process to identify and select the most-likely clean data from the poisoned training dataset. The self-purified clean dataset is then used for activation clipping and fine-tuning only the last classification layer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation clipping, and classifier fine-tuning, our mechanism PAD-FT demonstrates superior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as confirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a general refractive camera model and online co-estimation of odometry and the refractive index of unknown media. This enables operation in diverse and varying refractive fluids, given only the camera calibration in air. The refractive index is estimated online as a state variable of a monocular visual-inertial odometry framework in an iterative formulation using the proposed camera model. The method was verified on data collected using an underwater robot traversing inside a pool. The evaluations demonstrate convergence to the ideal refractive index for water despite significant perturbations in the initialization. Simultaneously, the approach enables on-par visual-inertial odometry performance in refractive media without prior knowledge of the refractive index or requirement of medium-specific camera calibration.

- **Summary**: Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at the nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological organization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high-resolution images by conditioning the model on low-resolution information. Additionally, the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images that tend to further increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We show that our model achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously best-performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly, while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.

- **Summary**: Understanding how humans process visual information is one of the crucial steps for unraveling the underlying mechanism of brain activity. Recently, this curiosity has motivated the fMRI-to-image reconstruction task; given the fMRI data from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual stimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex visual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets. Despite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often lack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances. Consequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere visuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs effectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance, and image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image generations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggesting that perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain regions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain regions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from semantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information regions, Brain-Streams provides accurate multi-modal guidance to LDMs. We validate the reconstruction ability of Brain-Streams both quantitatively and qualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI data.

- **Summary**: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive procedure initially designed for the treatment of early gastric cancer but is now widely used for various gastrointestinal lesions. Computer-assisted Surgery systems have played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESD procedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition of surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion characteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real-time surgical phase recognition algorithms. Existing surgical phase recognition algorithms struggle to efficiently capture temporal contexts in video-based scenarios, leading to insufficient performance. To address these issues, we propose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba-based framework for ESD surgical phase recognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long-term temporal modeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance the capture of fine-grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditional temporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers. Moreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate the processing, which is essential for real-time phase recognition in clinical settings. Extensive testing on the ESD385 dataset and the cholecystectomy Cholec80 dataset demonstrates that SPRMamba surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods and exhibits greater robustness across various surgical phase recognition tasks.

- **Summary**: With the ever-growing complexity of models in the field of remote sensing (RS), there is an increasing demand for solutions that balance model accuracy with computational efficiency. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a powerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large, complex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in performance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and its innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer knowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact and efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application across various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and historical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are highlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational efficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical deployments in RS scenarios.

- **Summary**: Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We investigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented displays having well-separated potential target-object locations. Performance was compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption that the information from the different potential target locations is statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than optimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise causes search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These findings have far-reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.

- **Summary**: We introduce MoRAG, a novel multi-part fusion based retrieval-augmented generation strategy for text-based human motion generation. The method enhances motion diffusion models by leveraging additional knowledge obtained through an improved motion retrieval process. By effectively prompting large language models (LLMs), we address spelling errors and rephrasing issues in motion retrieval. Our approach utilizes a multi-part retrieval strategy to improve the generalizability of motion retrieval across the language space. We create diverse samples through the spatial composition of the retrieved motions. Furthermore, by utilizing low-level, part-specific motion information, we can construct motion samples for unseen text descriptions. Our experiments demonstrate that our framework can serve as a plug-and-play module, improving the performance of motion diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumor characterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhances diagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation of lesions is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. Given the rising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods, particularly deep-learning-based approaches, have become increasingly more relevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation of tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting, addressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable solutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET challenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers (FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed a classifier that identifies the tracer of the given PET/CT based on the Maximum Intensity Projection of the PET scan. We trained two individual nnUNet-ensembles for each tracer where anatomical labels are included as a multi-label task to enhance the model's performance. Our final submission achieves cross-validation Dice scores of 76.90% and 61.33% for the publicly available FDG and PSMA datasets, respectively.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel method for joint expression and audio-guided talking face generation. Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker identity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these challenges, we propose a NeRF-based network. Since we train our network on monocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn disentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio features in a self-supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects. By incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned audio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle motion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer-based architecture that learns expression features, capturing long-range facial expressions and disentangling them from the speech-specific mouth movements. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can synthesize high-fidelity talking face videos, achieving state-of-the-art facial expression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.

- **Summary**: The intermittency of solar power, due to occlusion from cloud cover, is one of the key factors inhibiting its widespread use in both commercial and residential settings. Hence, real-time forecasting of solar irradiance for grid-connected photovoltaic systems is necessary to schedule and allocate resources across the grid. Ground-based imagers that capture wide field-of-view images of the sky are commonly used to monitor cloud movement around a particular site in an effort to forecast solar irradiance. However, these wide FOV imagers capture a distorted image of sky image, where regions near the horizon are heavily compressed. This hinders the ability to precisely predict cloud motion near the horizon which especially affects prediction over longer time horizons. In this work, we combat the aforementioned constraint by introducing a deep learning method to predict a future sky image frame with higher resolution than previous methods. Our main contribution is to derive an optimal warping method to counter the adverse affects of clouds at the horizon, and learn a framework for future sky image prediction which better determines cloud evolution for longer time horizons.

- **Summary**: Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring the progression of brain tumors. However, due to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across different MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In this study, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework, multiPI-TransBTS, which integrates multi-physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy. The model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi-modal imaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor characteristics. The multiPI-TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi-source, multi-scale feature decoder. The encoder incorporates a multi-branch architecture to separately extract modality-specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module fuses information from multiple sources using channel-wise and element-wise attention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both common and task-specific features through a Task-Specific Feature Introduction (TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT), Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of multiPI-TransBTS over the state-of-the-art methods. The model consistently achieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results also indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision and recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a significant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving clinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.

- **Summary**: Forecasting long-term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene-aware social transformer model (SAST) to forecast long-term (10s) human motion motion. Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal convolutional encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer-based bottleneck that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to 16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously. Our model outperforms other approaches in terms of realism and diversity on different metrics and in a user study. Code is available at https://github.com/felixbmuller/SAST.

- **Summary**: Bundle adjustment (BA) is a critical technique in various robotic applications, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), augmented reality (AR), and photogrammetry. BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses and 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance of deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to integrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and performance. However, widely-used C++-based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries like PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of debugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we introduce an eager-mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose, providing PyTorch-compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach includes GPU-accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for 2nd-order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear solvers. Our eager-mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency, achieving an average speedup of 18.5$\times$, 22$\times$, and 23$\times$ compared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.

- **Summary**: We present the Qwen2-VL Series, an advanced upgrade of the previous Qwen-VL models that redefines the conventional predetermined-resolution approach in visual processing. Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism, which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for processing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL investigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By scaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the amount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive performance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to leading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models.

- **Summary**: Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex visuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions. Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP, and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best viewed at https://dynamo-ssl.github.io

- **Summary**: We embark on the age-old quest: unveiling the hidden dimensions of objects from mere glimpses of their visible parts. To address this, we present Vista3D, a framework that realizes swift and consistent 3D generation within a mere 5 minutes. At the heart of Vista3D lies a two-phase approach: the coarse phase and the fine phase. In the coarse phase, we rapidly generate initial geometry with Gaussian Splatting from a single image. In the fine phase, we extract a Signed Distance Function (SDF) directly from learned Gaussian Splatting, optimizing it with a differentiable isosurface representation. Furthermore, it elevates the quality of generation by using a disentangled representation with two independent implicit functions to capture both visible and obscured aspects of objects. Additionally, it harmonizes gradients from 2D diffusion prior with 3D-aware diffusion priors by angular diffusion prior composition. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that Vista3D effectively sustains a balance between the consistency and diversity of the generated 3D objects. Demos and code will be available at https://github.com/florinshen/Vista3D.
