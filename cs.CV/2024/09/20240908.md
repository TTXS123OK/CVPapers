- **Summary**: Brain-inspired deep predictive coding networks (DPCNs) effectively model and capture video features through a bi-directional information flow, even without labels. They are based on an overcomplete description of video scenes, and one of the bottlenecks has been the lack of effective sparsification techniques to find discriminative and robust dictionaries. FISTA has been the best alternative. This paper proposes a DPCN with a fast inference of internal model variables (states and causes) that achieves high sparsity and accuracy of feature clustering. The proposed unsupervised learning procedure, inspired by adaptive dynamic programming with a majorization-minimization framework, and its convergence are rigorously analyzed. Experiments in the data sets CIFAR-10, Super Mario Bros video game, and Coil-100 validate the approach, which outperforms previous versions of DPCNs on learning rate, sparsity ratio, and feature clustering accuracy. Because of DCPN's solid foundation and explainability, this advance opens the door for general applications in object recognition in video without labels.

- **Summary**: In this research, we present an innovative, parameter-efficient model that utilizes the attention U-Net architecture for the automatic detection and eradication of non-speech vocal sounds, specifically breath sounds, in vocal recordings. This task is of paramount importance in the field of sound engineering, despite being relatively under-explored. The conventional manual process for detecting and eliminating these sounds requires significant expertise and is extremely time-intensive. Existing automated detection and removal methods often fall short in terms of efficiency and precision. Our proposed model addresses these limitations by offering a streamlined process and superior accuracy, achieved through the application of advanced deep learning techniques. A unique dataset, derived from Device and Produced Speech (DAPS), was employed for this purpose. The training phase of the model emphasizes a log spectrogram and integrates an early stopping mechanism to prevent overfitting. Our model not only conserves precious time for sound engineers but also enhances the quality and consistency of audio production. This constitutes a significant breakthrough, as evidenced by its comparative efficiency, necessitating only 1.9M parameters and a training duration of 3.2 hours - markedly less than the top-performing models in this domain. The model is capable of generating identical outputs as previous models with drastically improved precision, making it an optimal choice.

- **Summary**: Automatic image-based severity estimation is an important task in computer-aided diagnosis. Severity estimation by deep learning requires a large amount of training data to achieve a high performance. In general, severity estimation uses training data annotated with discrete (i.e., quantized) severity labels. Annotating discrete labels is often difficult in images with ambiguous severity, and the annotation cost is high. In contrast, relative annotation, in which the severity between a pair of images is compared, can avoid quantizing severity and thus makes it easier. We can estimate relative disease severity using a learning-to-rank framework with relative annotations, but relative annotation has the problem of the enormous number of pairs that can be annotated. Therefore, the selection of appropriate pairs is essential for relative annotation. In this paper, we propose a deep Bayesian active learning-to-rank that automatically selects appropriate pairs for relative annotation. Our method preferentially annotates unlabeled pairs with high learning efficiency from the model uncertainty of the samples. We prove the theoretical basis for adapting Bayesian neural networks to pairwise learning-to-rank and demonstrate the efficiency of our method through experiments on endoscopic images of ulcerative colitis on both private and public datasets. We also show that our method achieves a high performance under conditions of significant class imbalance because it automatically selects samples from the minority classes.

- **Summary**: Recycled and recirculated books, such as ancient texts and reused textbooks, hold significant value in the second-hand goods market, with their worth largely dependent on surface preservation. However, accurately assessing surface defects is challenging due to the wide variations in shape, size, and the often imprecise detection of defects. To address these issues, we propose DDNet, an innovative detection model designed to enhance defect localization and classification. DDNet introduces a surface defect feature extraction module based on a deformable convolution operator (DC) and a densely connected FPN module (DFPN). The DC module dynamically adjusts the convolution grid to better align with object contours, capturing subtle shape variations and improving boundary delineation and prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, DFPN leverages dense skip connections to enhance feature fusion, constructing a hierarchical structure that generates multi-resolution, high-fidelity feature maps, thus effectively detecting defects of various sizes. In addition to the model, we present a comprehensive dataset specifically curated for surface defect detection in recycled and recirculated books. This dataset encompasses a diverse range of defect types, shapes, and sizes, making it ideal for evaluating the robustness and effectiveness of defect detection models. Through extensive evaluations, DDNet achieves precise localization and classification of surface defects, recording a mAP value of 46.7% on our proprietary dataset - an improvement of 14.2% over the baseline model - demonstrating its superior detection capabilities.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning of point cloud aims to leverage unlabeled 3D data to learn meaningful representations without reliance on manual annotations. However, current approaches face challenges such as limited data diversity and inadequate augmentation for effective feature learning. To address these challenges, we propose GS-PT, which integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into point cloud self-supervised learning for the first time. Our pipeline utilizes transformers as the backbone for self-supervised pre-training and introduces novel contrastive learning tasks through 3DGS. Specifically, the transformers aim to reconstruct the masked point cloud. 3DGS utilizes multi-view rendered images as input to generate enhanced point cloud distributions and novel view images, facilitating data augmentation and cross-modal contrastive learning. Additionally, we incorporate features from depth maps. By optimizing these tasks collectively, our method enriches the tri-modal self-supervised learning process, enabling the model to leverage the correlation across 3D point clouds and 2D images from various modalities. We freeze the encoder after pre-training and test the model's performance on multiple downstream tasks. Experimental results indicate that GS-PT outperforms the off-the-shelf self-supervised learning methods on various downstream tasks including 3D object classification, real-world classifications, and few-shot learning and segmentation.

- **Summary**: Image steganography is a technique to conceal secret messages within digital images. Steganalysis, on the contrary, aims to detect the presence of secret messages within images. Recently, deep-learning-based steganalysis methods have achieved excellent detection performance. As a countermeasure, adversarial steganography has garnered considerable attention due to its ability to effectively deceive deep-learning-based steganalysis. However, steganalysts often employ unknown steganalytic models for detection. Therefore, the ability of adversarial steganography to deceive non-target steganalytic models, known as transferability, becomes especially important. Nevertheless, existing adversarial steganographic methods do not consider how to enhance transferability. To address this issue, we propose a novel adversarial steganographic scheme named Natias. Specifically, we first attribute the output of a steganalytic model to each neuron in the target middle layer to identify critical features. Next, we corrupt these critical features that may be adopted by diverse steganalytic models. Consequently, it can promote the transferability of adversarial steganography. Our proposed method can be seamlessly integrated with existing adversarial steganography frameworks. Thorough experimental analyses affirm that our proposed technique possesses improved transferability when contrasted with former approaches, and it attains heightened security in retraining scenarios.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models have achieved great success in automating skin lesion diagnosis. However, the ethnic disparity in these models' predictions needs to be addressed before deploying them. We introduce a novel approach, PatchAlign, to enhance skin condition image classification accuracy and fairness by aligning with clinical text representations of skin conditions. PatchAlign uses Graph Optimal Transport (GOT) Loss as a regularizer to perform cross-domain alignment. The representations obtained are robust and generalize well across skin tones, even with limited training samples. To reduce the effect of noise and artifacts in clinical dermatology images, we propose a learnable Masked Graph Optimal Transport for cross-domain alignment that further improves fairness metrics.   We compare our model to the state-of-the-art FairDisCo on two skin lesion datasets with different skin types: Fitzpatrick17k and Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI). PatchAlign enhances the accuracy of skin condition image classification by 2.8% (in-domain) and 6.2% (out-domain) on Fitzpatrick17k, and 4.2% (in-domain) on DDI compared to FairDisCo. Additionally, it consistently improves the fairness of true positive rates across skin tones.   The source code for the implementation is available at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/aayushmanace/PatchAlign24, enabling easy reproduction and further experimentation.

- **Summary**: With the rise of deep learning technology in practical applications, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been able to assist humans in solving many real-world problems. To enhance the performance of CNNs, numerous network architectures have been explored. Some of these architectures are designed based on the accumulated experience of researchers over time, while others are designed through neural architecture search methods. The improvements made to CNNs by the aforementioned methods are quite significant, but most of the improvement methods are limited in reality by model size and environmental constraints, making it difficult to fully realize the improved performance. In recent years, research has found that many CNN structures can be explained by the discretization of ordinary differential equations. This implies that we can design theoretically supported deep network structures using higher-order numerical difference methods. It should be noted that most of the previous CNN model structures are based on low-order numerical methods. Therefore, considering that the accuracy of linear multi-step numerical difference methods is higher than that of the forward Euler method, this paper proposes a stacking scheme based on the linear multi-step method. This scheme enhances the performance of ResNet without increasing the model size and compares it with the Runge-Kutta scheme. The experimental results show that the performance of the stacking scheme proposed in this paper is superior to existing stacking schemes (ResNet and HO-ResNet), and it has the capability to be extended to other types of neural networks.

- **Summary**: The computational inefficiency of spiking neural networks (SNNs) is primarily due to the sequential updates of membrane potential, which becomes more pronounced during extended encoding periods compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). This highlights the need to parallelize SNN computations effectively to leverage available hardware parallelism. To address this, we propose Membrane Potential Estimation Parallel Spiking Neurons (MPE-PSN), a parallel computation method for spiking neurons that enhances computational efficiency by enabling parallel processing while preserving the intrinsic dynamic characteristics of SNNs. Our approach exhibits promise for enhancing computational efficiency, particularly under conditions of elevated neuron density. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy and efficiency on neuromorphic datasets without requiring additional training parameters.

- **Summary**: Perceiving the surrounding environment is a fundamental task in autonomous driving. To obtain highly accurate perception results, modern autonomous driving systems typically employ multi-modal sensors to collect comprehensive environmental data. Among these, the radar-camera multi-modal perception system is especially favored for its excellent sensing capabilities and cost-effectiveness. However, the substantial modality differences between radar and camera sensors pose challenges in fusing information. To address this problem, this paper presents RCBEVDet, a radar-camera fusion 3D object detection framework. Specifically, RCBEVDet is developed from an existing camera-based 3D object detector, supplemented by a specially designed radar feature extractor, RadarBEVNet, and a Cross-Attention Multi-layer Fusion (CAMF) module. Firstly, RadarBEVNet encodes sparse radar points into a dense bird's-eye-view (BEV) feature using a dual-stream radar backbone and a Radar Cross Section aware BEV encoder. Secondly, the CAMF module utilizes a deformable attention mechanism to align radar and camera BEV features and adopts channel and spatial fusion layers to fuse them. To further enhance RCBEVDet's capabilities, we introduce RCBEVDet++, which advances the CAMF through sparse fusion, supports query-based multi-view camera perception models, and adapts to a broader range of perception tasks. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes show that our method integrates seamlessly with existing camera-based 3D perception models and improves their performance across various perception tasks. Furthermore, our method achieves state-of-the-art radar-camera fusion results in 3D object detection, BEV semantic segmentation, and 3D multi-object tracking tasks. Notably, with ViT-L as the image backbone, RCBEVDet++ achieves 72.73 NDS and 67.34 mAP in 3D object detection without test-time augmentation or model ensembling.

- **Summary**: Cooperative perception through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential to overcome occlusions and enhance long-distance perception. Great achievements have been made in both datasets and algorithms. However, existing real-world datasets are limited by the presence of few communicable agents, while synthetic datasets typically cover only vehicles. More importantly, the penetration rate of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) , a critical factor for the deployment of cooperative perception technologies, has not been adequately addressed. To tackle these issues, we introduce Multi-V2X, a large-scale, multi-modal, multi-penetration-rate dataset for V2X perception. By co-simulating SUMO and CARLA, we equip a substantial number of cars and roadside units (RSUs) in simulated towns with sensor suites, and collect comprehensive sensing data. Datasets with specified CAV penetration rates can be obtained by masking some equipped cars as normal vehicles. In total, our Multi-V2X dataset comprises 549k RGB frames, 146k LiDAR frames, and 4,219k annotated 3D bounding boxes across six categories. The highest possible CAV penetration rate reaches 86.21%, with up to 31 agents in communication range, posing new challenges in selecting agents to collaborate with. We provide comprehensive benchmarks for cooperative 3D object detection tasks. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/RadetzkyLi/Multi-V2X .

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of machine learning technologies raises questions about the security of machine learning models, with respect to both training-time (poisoning) and test-time (evasion, impersonation, and inversion) attacks. Models performing image-related tasks, e.g. detection, and classification, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can degrade their performance and produce undesirable outcomes. This paper introduces a novel technique for anomaly detection in images called 2DSig-Detect, which uses a 2D-signature-embedded semi-supervised framework rooted in rough path theory. We demonstrate our method in adversarial settings for training-time and test-time attacks, and benchmark our framework against other state of the art methods. Using 2DSig-Detect for anomaly detection, we show both superior performance and a reduction in the computation time to detect the presence of adversarial perturbations in images.

- **Summary**: Visual grounding is the task of locating objects specified by natural language expressions. Existing methods extend generic object detection frameworks to tackle this task. They typically extract visual and textual features separately using independent visual and textual encoders, then fuse these features in a multi-modal decoder for final prediction. However, visual grounding presents unique challenges. It often involves locating objects with different text descriptions within the same image. Existing methods struggle with this task because the independent visual encoder produces identical visual features for the same image, limiting detection performance. Some recently approaches propose various language-guided visual encoders to address this issue, but they mostly rely solely on textual information and require sophisticated designs. In this paper, we introduce Multi-modal Conditional Adaptation (MMCA), which enables the visual encoder to adaptively update weights, directing its focus towards text-relevant regions. Specifically, we first integrate information from different modalities to obtain multi-modal embeddings. Then we utilize a set of weighting coefficients, which generated from the multimodal embeddings, to reorganize the weight update matrices and apply them to the visual encoder of the visual grounding model. Extensive experiments on four widely used datasets demonstrate that MMCA achieves significant improvements and state-of-the-art results. Ablation experiments further demonstrate the lightweight and efficiency of our method. Our source code is available at: https://github.com/Mr-Bigworth/MMCA.

- **Summary**: Patronizing and Condescending Language (PCL) is a form of discriminatory toxic speech targeting vulnerable groups, threatening both online and offline safety. While toxic speech research has mainly focused on overt toxicity, such as hate speech, microaggressions in the form of PCL remain underexplored. Additionally, dominant groups' discriminatory facial expressions and attitudes toward vulnerable communities can be more impactful than verbal cues, yet these frame features are often overlooked. In this paper, we introduce the PCLMM dataset, the first Chinese multimodal dataset for PCL, consisting of 715 annotated videos from Bilibili, with high-quality PCL facial frame spans. We also propose the MultiPCL detector, featuring a facial expression detection module for PCL recognition, demonstrating the effectiveness of modality complementarity in this challenging task. Our work makes an important contribution to advancing microaggression detection within the domain of toxic speech.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation is crucial in the field of medical imaging, aiding in disease diagnosis and surgical planning. Most established segmentation methods rely on supervised deep learning, in which clean and precise labels are essential for supervision and significantly impact the performance of models. However, manually delineated labels often contain noise, such as missing labels and inaccurate boundary delineation, which can hinder networks from correctly modeling target characteristics. In this paper, we propose a deep self-cleansing segmentation framework that can preserve clean labels while cleansing noisy ones in the training phase. To achieve this, we devise a gaussian mixture model-based label filtering module that distinguishes noisy labels from clean labels. Additionally, we develop a label cleansing module to generate pseudo low-noise labels for identified noisy samples. The preserved clean labels and pseudo-labels are then used jointly to supervise the network. Validated on a clinical liver tumor dataset and a public cardiac diagnosis dataset, our method can effectively suppress the interference from noisy labels and achieve prominent segmentation performance.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Surgical navigation based on multimodal image registration has played a significant role in providing intraoperative guidance to surgeons by showing the relative position of the target area to critical anatomical structures during surgery. However, due to the differences between multimodal images and intraoperative image deformation caused by tissue displacement and removal during the surgery, effective registration of preoperative and intraoperative multimodal images faces significant challenges. To address the multimodal image registration challenges in Learn2Reg 2024, an unsupervised multimodal medical image registration method based on multilevel correlation balanced optimization (MCBO) is designed to solve these problems. First, the features of each modality are extracted based on the modality independent neighborhood descriptor, and the multimodal images is mapped to the feature space. Second, a multilevel pyramidal fusion optimization mechanism is designed to achieve global optimization and local detail complementation of the deformation field through dense correlation analysis and weight-balanced coupled convex optimization for input features at different scales. For preoperative medical images in different modalities, the alignment and stacking of valid information between different modalities is achieved by the maximum fusion between deformation fields. Our method focuses on the ReMIND2Reg task in Learn2Reg 2024, and to verify the generality of the method, we also tested it on the COMULIS3DCLEM task. Based on the results, our method achieved second place in the validation of both two tasks.

In comparison to the full-to-full registration task, we find that the objective of partial PCR is still not well-defined, indicating no metric can reliably identify the true transformation. We identify this as the most fundamental challenge in partial PCR tasks. In this paper, instead of directly seeking the optimal transformation, we propose a novel and general Sight View Constraint (SVC) to conclusively identify incorrect transformations, thereby enhancing the robustness of existing PCR methods. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of SVC on both indoor and outdoor scenes. On the challenging 3DLoMatch dataset, our approach increases the registration recall from 78\% to 82\%, achieving the state-of-the-art result. This research also highlights the significance of the decision version problem of partial PCR, which has the potential to provide novel insights into the partial PCR problem.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated their powerful multimodal capabilities. However, they also face serious safety problems, as adversaries can induce robustness issues in LVLMs through the use of well-designed adversarial examples. Therefore, LVLMs are in urgent need of detection tools for adversarial examples to prevent incorrect responses. In this work, we first discover that LVLMs exhibit regular attention patterns for clean images when presented with probe questions. We propose an unconventional method named PIP, which utilizes the attention patterns of one randomly selected irrelevant probe question (e.g., "Is there a clock?") to distinguish adversarial examples from clean examples. Regardless of the image to be tested and its corresponding question, PIP only needs to perform one additional inference of the image to be tested and the probe question, and then achieves successful detection of adversarial examples. Even under black-box attacks and open dataset scenarios, our PIP, coupled with a simple SVM, still achieves more than 98% recall and a precision of over 90%. Our PIP is the first attempt to detect adversarial attacks on LVLMs via simple irrelevant probe questions, shedding light on deeper understanding and introspection within LVLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/btzyd/pip.

- **Summary**: Accurate pain assessment is crucial in healthcare for effective diagnosis and treatment; however, traditional methods relying on self-reporting are inadequate for populations unable to communicate their pain. Cutting-edge AI is promising for supporting clinicians in pain recognition using facial video data. In this paper, we enhance pain recognition by employing facial video analysis within a Transformer-based deep learning model. By combining a powerful Masked Autoencoder with a Transformers-based classifier, our model effectively captures pain level indicators through both expressions and micro-expressions. We conducted our experiment on the AI4Pain dataset, which produced promising results that pave the way for innovative healthcare solutions that are both comprehensive and objective.

- **Summary**: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) has emerged as a prevalent technique for text-to-3D generation, enabling 3D content creation by distilling view-dependent information from text-to-2D guidance. However, they frequently exhibit shortcomings such as over-saturated color and excess smoothness. In this paper, we conduct a thorough analysis of SDS and refine its formulation, finding that the core design is to model the distribution of rendered images. Following this insight, we introduce a novel strategy called Variational Distribution Mapping (VDM), which expedites the distribution modeling process by regarding the rendered images as instances of degradation from diffusion-based generation. This special design enables the efficient training of variational distribution by skipping the calculations of the Jacobians in the diffusion U-Net. We also introduce timestep-dependent Distribution Coefficient Annealing (DCA) to further improve distilling precision. Leveraging VDM and DCA, we use Gaussian Splatting as the 3D representation and build a text-to-3D generation framework. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate the capability of VDM and DCA to generate high-fidelity and realistic assets with optimization efficiency.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning has emerged as a widely adopted technique in the field of medical image segmentation. The existing works either focuses on the construction of consistency constraints or the generation of pseudo labels to provide high-quality supervisory signals, whose main challenge mainly comes from how to keep the continuous improvement of model capabilities. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective semi-supervised learning framework, termed Progressive Mean Teachers (PMT), for medical image segmentation, whose goal is to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels by learning robust and diverse features in the training process. Specifically, our PMT employs a standard mean teacher to penalize the consistency of the current state and utilizes two sets of MT architectures for co-training. The two sets of MT architectures are individually updated for prolonged periods to maintain stable model diversity established through performance gaps generated by iteration differences. Additionally, a difference-driven alignment regularizer is employed to expedite the alignment of lagging models with the representation capabilities of leading models. Furthermore, a simple yet effective pseudo-label filtering algorithm is employed for facile evaluation of models and selection of high-fidelity pseudo-labels outputted when models are operating at high performance for co-training purposes. Experimental results on two datasets with different modalities, i.e., CT and MRI, demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation approaches across various dimensions.

- **Summary**: Currently, a substantial volume of document data exists in an unstructured format, encompassing Portable Document Format (PDF) files and images. Extracting information from these documents presents formidable challenges due to diverse table styles, complex forms, and the inclusion of different languages. Several open-source toolkits, such as Camelot, Plumb a PDF (pdfnumber), and Paddle Paddle Structure V2 (PP-StructureV2), have been developed to facilitate table extraction from PDFs or images. However, each toolkit has its limitations. Camelot and pdfnumber can solely extract tables from digital PDFs and cannot handle image-based PDFs and pictures. On the other hand, PP-StructureV2 can comprehensively extract image-based PDFs and tables from pictures. Nevertheless, it lacks the ability to differentiate between diverse application scenarios, such as wired tables and wireless tables, digital PDFs, and image-based PDFs. To address these issues, we have introduced the PDF table extraction (PdfTable) toolkit. This toolkit integrates numerous open-source models, including seven table recognition models, four Optical character recognition (OCR) recognition tools, and three layout analysis models. By refining the PDF table extraction process, PdfTable achieves adaptability across various application scenarios. We substantiate the efficacy of the PdfTable toolkit through verification on a self-labeled wired table dataset and the open-source wireless Publicly Table Reconition Dataset (PubTabNet). The PdfTable code will available on Github: https://github.com/CycloneBoy/pdf_table.

- **Summary**: Document Structured Extraction (DSE) aims to extract structured content from raw documents. Despite the emergence of numerous DSE systems, their unified evaluation remains inadequate, significantly hindering the field's advancement. This problem is largely attributed to existing benchmark paradigms, which exhibit fragmented and localized characteristics. To address these limitations and offer a thorough evaluation of DSE systems, we introduce a novel benchmark named READoc, which defines DSE as a realistic task of converting unstructured PDFs into semantically rich Markdown. The READoc dataset is derived from 2,233 diverse and real-world documents from arXiv and GitHub. In addition, we develop a DSE Evaluation S$^3$uite comprising Standardization, Segmentation and Scoring modules, to conduct a unified evaluation of state-of-the-art DSE approaches. By evaluating a range of pipeline tools, expert visual models, and general VLMs, we identify the gap between current work and the unified, realistic DSE objective for the first time. We aspire that READoc will catalyze future research in DSE, fostering more comprehensive and practical solutions.

- **Summary**: Aerial scene understanding systems face stringent payload restrictions and must often rely on monocular depth estimation for modelling scene geometry, which is an inherently ill-posed problem. Moreover, obtaining accurate ground truth data required by learning-based methods raises significant additional challenges in the aerial domain. Self-supervised approaches can bypass this problem, at the cost of providing only up-to-scale results. Similarly, recent supervised solutions which make good progress towards zero-shot generalization also provide only relative depth values. This work presents TanDepth, a practical, online scale recovery method for obtaining metric depth results from relative estimations at inference-time, irrespective of the type of model generating them. Tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications, our method leverages sparse measurements from Global Digital Elevation Models (GDEM) by projecting them to the camera view using extrinsic and intrinsic information. An adaptation to the Cloth Simulation Filter is presented, which allows selecting ground points from the estimated depth map to then correlate with the projected reference points. We evaluate and compare our method against alternate scaling methods adapted for UAVs, on a variety of real-world scenes. Considering the limited availability of data for this domain, we construct and release a comprehensive, depth-focused extension to the popular UAVid dataset to further research.

- **Summary**: Within the context of creating new Socially Assistive Robots, emotion recognition has become a key development factor, as it allows the robot to adapt to the user's emotional state in the wild. In this work, we focused on the analysis of two voice recording Spanish datasets: ELRA-S0329 and EmoMatchSpanishDB. Specifically, we centered our work in the paralanguage, e.~g. the vocal characteristics that go along with the message and clarifies the meaning. We proposed the use of the DeepSpectrum method, which consists of extracting a visual representation of the audio tracks and feeding them to a pretrained CNN model. For the classification task, DeepSpectrum is often paired with a Support Vector Classifier --DS-SVC--, or a Fully-Connected deep-learning classifier --DS-FC--. We compared the results of the DS-SVC and DS-FC architectures with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) for ELRA-S0329 and EmoMatchSpanishDB. Moreover, we proposed our own classifier based upon Attention Mechanisms, namely DS-AM. We trained all models against both datasets, and we found that our DS-AM model outperforms the SOTA models for the datasets and the SOTA DeepSpectrum architectures. Finally, we trained our DS-AM model in one dataset and tested it in the other, to simulate real-world conditions on how biased is the model to the dataset.

- **Summary**: With the advancement of computer vision, dynamic 3D reconstruction techniques have seen significant progress and found applications in various fields. However, these techniques generate large amounts of 3D data sequences, necessitating efficient storage and transmission methods. Existing 3D model compression methods primarily focus on static models and do not consider inter-frame information, limiting their ability to reduce data size. Temporal mesh compression, which has received less attention, often requires all input meshes to have the same topology, a condition rarely met in real-world applications. This research proposes a method to compress mesh sequences with arbitrary topology using temporal correspondence and mesh deformation. The method establishes temporal correspondence between consecutive frames, applies a deformation model to transform the mesh from one frame to subsequent frames, and replaces the original meshes with deformed ones if the quality meets a tolerance threshold. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of compression performance. The contributions of this paper include a geometry and motion-based model for establishing temporal correspondence between meshes, a mesh quality assessment for temporal mesh sequences, an entropy-based encoding and corner table-based method for compressing mesh sequences, and extensive experiments showing the effectiveness of the proposed method. All the code will be open-sourced at https://github.com/lszhuhaichao/ultron.

- **Summary**: Image color consistency is the key problem in digital imaging consistency when creating datasets. Here, we propose an improved 3D Thin-Plate Splines (TPS3D) color correction method to be used, in conjunction with color charts (i.e. Macbeth ColorChecker) or other machine-readable patterns, to achieve image consistency by post-processing. Also, we benchmark our method against its former implementation and the alternative methods reported to date with an augmented dataset based on the Gehler's ColorChecker dataset. Benchmark includes how corrected images resemble the ground-truth images and how fast these implementations are. Results demonstrate that the TPS3D is the best candidate to achieve image consistency. Furthermore, our Smooth-TPS3D method shows equivalent results compared to the original method and reduced the 11-15% of ill-conditioned scenarios which the previous method failed to less than 1%. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Smooth-TPS method is 20% faster than the original method. Finally, we discuss how different methods offer different compromises between quality, correction accuracy and computational load.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) object detection is a challenging task due to the absence of open-set OOD data. Inspired by recent advancements in text-to-image generative models, such as Stable Diffusion, we study the potential of generative models trained on large-scale open-set data to synthesize OOD samples, thereby enhancing OOD object detection. We introduce SyncOOD, a simple data curation method that capitalizes on the capabilities of large foundation models to automatically extract meaningful OOD data from text-to-image generative models. This offers the model access to open-world knowledge encapsulated within off-the-shelf foundation models. The synthetic OOD samples are then employed to augment the training of a lightweight, plug-and-play OOD detector, thus effectively optimizing the in-distribution (ID)/OOD decision boundaries. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SyncOOD significantly outperforms existing methods, establishing new state-of-the-art performance with minimal synthetic data usage.

Inspired by continual learning, our method first segments input videos into multiple chunks, followed by training the model chunk by chunk, and finally, fuses features of the first branch and subsequent branches. Experiments on the prevailing DyNeRF dataset demonstrate that our proposed novel representation reaches a great balance between memory consumption, model size, training speed, and rendering quality. Specifically, our method consumes $85\%$ less training memory ($<14$GB) than offline methods and requires significantly lower streaming bandwidth ($<0.4$MB/frame) than other online alternatives.

- **Summary**: Fungal simulation and control are considered crucial techniques in Bio-Art creation. However, coding algorithms for reliable fungal simulations have posed significant challenges for artists. This study equates fungal morphology simulation to a two-dimensional graphic time-series generation problem. We propose a zero-coding, neural network-driven cellular automaton. Fungal spread patterns are learned through an image segmentation model and a time-series prediction model, which then supervise the training of neural network cells, enabling them to replicate real-world spreading behaviors. We further implemented dynamic containment of fungal boundaries with lasers. Synchronized with the automaton, the fungus successfully spreads into pre-designed complex shapes in reality.

- **Summary**: Recently, Machine Learning (ML) methods are built-in as an important component in many smart agriculture platforms. In this paper, we explore the new combination of advanced ML methods for creating a smart agriculture platform where farmers could reach out for assistance from the public, or a closed circle of experts. Specifically, we focus on an easy way to assist the farmers in understanding plant diseases where the farmers can get help to solve the issues from the members of the community. The proposed system utilizes deep learning techniques for identifying the disease of the plant from the affected image, which acts as an initial identifier. Further, Natural Language Processing techniques are employed for ranking the solutions posted by the user community. In this paper, a message channel is built on top of Twitter, a popular social media platform to establish proper communication among farmers. Since the effect of the solutions can differ based on various other parameters, we extend the use of the concept drift approach and come up with a good solution and propose it to the farmer. We tested the proposed framework on the benchmark dataset, and it produces accurate and reliable results.

- **Summary**: Accurate lung nodule detection for computed tomography (CT) scan imagery is challenging in real-world settings due to the sparse occurrence of nodules and similarity to other anatomical structures. In a typical positive case, nodules may appear in as few as 3% of CT slices, complicating detection. To address this, we reframe the problem as an anomaly detection task, targeting rare nodule occurrences in a predominantly normal dataset. We introduce a novel solution leveraging custom data preprocessing and Deformable Detection Transformer (Deformable- DETR). A 7.5mm Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) is utilized to combine adjacent lung slices into single images, reducing the slice count and decreasing nodule sparsity. This enhances spatial context, allowing for better differentiation between nodules and other structures such as complex vascular structures and bronchioles. Deformable-DETR is employed to detect nodules, with a custom focal loss function to better handle the imbalanced dataset. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LUNA16 dataset with an F1 score of 94.2% (95.2% recall, 93.3% precision) on a dataset sparsely populated with lung nodules that is reflective of real-world clinical data.

- **Summary**: As Deep Neural Networks have achieved thrilling breakthroughs in the past decade, data augmentations have garnered increasing attention as regularization techniques when massive labeled data are unavailable. Among existing augmentations, Mixup and relevant data-mixing methods that convexly combine selected samples and the corresponding labels are widely adopted because they yield high performances by generating data-dependent virtual data while easily migrating to various domains. This survey presents a comprehensive review of foundational mixup methods and their applications. We first elaborate on the training pipeline with mixup augmentations as a unified framework containing modules. A reformulated framework could contain various mixup methods and give intuitive operational procedures. Then, we systematically investigate the applications of mixup augmentations on vision downstream tasks, various data modalities, and some analysis \& theorems of mixup. Meanwhile, we conclude the current status and limitations of mixup research and point out further work for effective and efficient mixup augmentations. This survey can provide researchers with the current state of the art in mixup methods and provide some insights and guidance roles in the mixup arena.

Often, one of the bottlenecks of detecting hemophilia is the lack of data available to train the algorithm to increase the accuracy. As a possible solution, this research investigated whether introducing augmented data by data synthesis or traditional augmentation techniques can improve model accuracy, helping to diagnose the diseases. To tackle this research, features of ultrasound images were extracted by the pre-trained VGG-16, and similarities were compared by cosine similarity measure based on extracted features in different distributions among real images, synthetic images, and augmentation images (Real vs. Real, Syn vs. Syn, Real vs. Different Batches of Syn, Real vs. Augmentation Techniques). Model testing performance was investigated using EffientNet-B4 to recognize "blood" images with two augmentation methods. In addition, a gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) visualization was used to interpret the unexpected results like loss of accuracy. Synthetic and real images do not show high similarity, with a mean similarity score of 0.4737. Synthetic batch 1 dataset and images by horizontal flip are more similar to the original images. Classic augmentation techniques and data synthesis can improve model accuracy, and data by traditional augmentation techniques have a better performance than synthetic data. In addition, the Grad-CAM heatmap figured out the loss of accuracy is due to a shift in the domain. Overall, this research found that two augmentation methods, data synthesis and traditional augmentation techniques, both can improve accuracy to a certain extent to help to diagnose rare diseases.

- **Summary**: Video synopsis is an efficient method for condensing surveillance videos. This technique begins with the detection and tracking of objects, followed by the creation of object tubes. These tubes consist of sequences, each containing chronologically ordered bounding boxes of a unique object. To generate a condensed video, the first step involves rearranging the object tubes to maximize the number of non-overlapping objects in each frame. Then, these tubes are stitched to a background image extracted from the source video. The lack of a standard dataset for the video synopsis task hinders the comparison of different video synopsis models. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a standard dataset, called SynoClip, designed specifically for the video synopsis task. SynoClip includes all the necessary features needed to evaluate various models directly and effectively. Additionally, this work introduces a video synopsis model, called FGS, with low computational cost. The model includes an empty-frame object detector to identify frames empty of any objects, facilitating efficient utilization of the deep object detector. Moreover, a tube grouping algorithm is proposed to maintain relationships among tubes in the synthesized video. This is followed by a greedy tube rearrangement algorithm, which efficiently determines the start time of each tube. Finally, the proposed model is evaluated using the proposed dataset. The source code, fine-tuned object detection model, and tutorials are available at https://github.com/Ramtin-ma/VideoSynopsis-FGS.

- **Summary**: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERCs) is a vital area within multimodal interaction research, dedicated to accurately identifying and classifying the emotions expressed by speakers throughout a conversation. Traditional ERC approaches predominantly rely on unimodal cues\-such as text, audio, or visual data\-leading to limitations in their effectiveness. These methods encounter two significant challenges: 1) Consistency in multimodal information. Before integrating various modalities, it is crucial to ensure that the data from different sources is aligned and coherent. 2) Contextual information capture. Successfully fusing multimodal features requires a keen understanding of the evolving emotional tone, especially in lengthy dialogues where emotions may shift and develop over time. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Mamba-enhanced Text-Audio-Video alignment network (MaTAV) for the ERC task. MaTAV is with the advantages of aligning unimodal features to ensure consistency across different modalities and handling long input sequences to better capture contextual multimodal information. The extensive experiments on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that MaTAV significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the ERC task with a big margin.
