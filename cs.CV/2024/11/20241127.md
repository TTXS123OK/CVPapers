- **Summary**: Natural language often struggles to accurately associate positional and attribute information with multiple instances, which limits current text-based visual generation models to simpler compositions featuring only a few dominant instances. To address this limitation, this work enhances diffusion models by introducing regional instance control, where each instance is governed by a bounding box paired with a free-form caption. Previous methods in this area typically rely on implicit position encoding or explicit attention masks to separate regions of interest (ROIs), resulting in either inaccurate coordinate injection or large computational overhead. Inspired by ROI-Align in object detection, we introduce a complementary operation called ROI-Unpool. Together, ROI-Align and ROI-Unpool enable explicit, efficient, and accurate ROI manipulation on high-resolution feature maps for visual generation. Building on ROI-Unpool, we propose ROICtrl, an adapter for pretrained diffusion models that enables precise regional instance control. ROICtrl is compatible with community-finetuned diffusion models, as well as with existing spatial-based add-ons (\eg, ControlNet, T2I-Adapter) and embedding-based add-ons (\eg, IP-Adapter, ED-LoRA), extending their applications to multi-instance generation. Experiments show that ROICtrl achieves superior performance in regional instance control while significantly reducing computational costs.

- **Summary**: Current image immunization defense techniques against diffusion-based editing embed imperceptible noise in target images to disrupt editing models. However, these methods face scalability challenges, as they require time-consuming re-optimization for each image-taking hours for small batches. To address these challenges, we introduce DiffVax, a scalable, lightweight, and optimization-free framework for image immunization, specifically designed to prevent diffusion-based editing. Our approach enables effective generalization to unseen content, reducing computational costs and cutting immunization time from days to milliseconds-achieving a 250,000x speedup. This is achieved through a loss term that ensures the failure of editing attempts and the imperceptibility of the perturbations. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our model is scalable, optimization-free, adaptable to various diffusion-based editing tools, robust against counter-attacks, and, for the first time, effectively protects video content from editing. Our code is provided in our project webpage.

- **Summary**: Adversarial training has emerged as an effective approach to train robust neural network models that are resistant to adversarial attacks, even in low-label regimes where labeled data is scarce. In this paper, we introduce a novel semi-supervised adversarial training approach that enhances both robustness and natural accuracy by generating effective adversarial examples. Our method begins by applying linear interpolation between clean and adversarial examples to create interpolated adversarial examples that cross decision boundaries by a controlled margin. This sample-aware strategy tailors adversarial examples to the characteristics of each data point, enabling the model to learn from the most informative perturbations. Additionally, we propose a global epsilon scheduling strategy that progressively adjusts the upper bound of perturbation strengths during training. The combination of these strategies allows the model to develop increasingly complex decision boundaries with better robustness and natural accuracy. Empirical evaluations show that our approach effectively enhances performance against various adversarial attacks, such as PGD and AutoAttack.

- **Summary**: Few-shot image generation aims to generate diverse and high-quality images for an unseen class given only a few examples in that class. However, existing methods often suffer from a trade-off between image quality and diversity while offering limited control over the attributes of newly generated images. In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Diffusion Autoencoders (HypDAE), a novel approach that operates in hyperbolic space to capture hierarchical relationships among images and texts from seen categories. By leveraging pre-trained foundation models, HypDAE generates diverse new images for unseen categories with exceptional quality by varying semantic codes or guided by textual instructions. Most importantly, the hyperbolic representation introduces an additional degree of control over semantic diversity through the adjustment of radii within the hyperbolic disk. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that HypDAE significantly outperforms prior methods by achieving a superior balance between quality and diversity with limited data and offers a highly controllable and interpretable generation process.

- **Summary**: The forest serves as the most significant terrestrial carbon stock mechanism, effectively reducing atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations and mitigating climate change. Remote sensing provides high data accuracy and enables large-scale observations. Optical images facilitate long-term monitoring, which is crucial for future carbon stock estimation studies. This study focuses on Huize County, Qujing City, Yunnan Province, China, utilizing GF-1 WFV satellite imagery. The KD-VGG and KD-UNet modules were introduced for initial feature extraction, and the improved implicit diffusion model (IIDM) was proposed. The results showed: (1) The VGG module improved initial feature extraction, improving accuracy, and reducing inference time with optimized model parameters. (2) The Cross-attention + MLPs module enabled effective feature fusion, establishing critical relationships between global and local features, achieving high-accuracy estimation. (3) The IIDM model, a novel contribution, demonstrated the highest estimation accuracy with an RMSE of 12.17\%, significantly improving by 41.69\% to 42.33\% compared to the regression model. In carbon stock estimation, the generative model excelled in extracting deeper features, significantly outperforming other models, demonstrating the feasibility of AI-generated content in quantitative remote sensing. The 16-meter resolution estimates provide a robust basis for tailoring forest carbon sink regulations, enhancing regional carbon stock management.

- **Summary**: Low-resolution fine-grained image classification has recently made significant progress, largely thanks to the super-resolution techniques and knowledge distillation methods. However, these approaches lead to an exponential increase in the number of parameters and computational complexity of models. In order to solve this problem, in this letter, we propose a Vision Mamba Distillation (ViMD) approach to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of low-resolution fine-grained image classification. Concretely, a lightweight super-resolution vision Mamba classification network (SRVM-Net) is proposed to improve its capability for extracting visual features by redesigning the classification sub-network with Mamba modeling. Moreover, we design a novel multi-level Mamba knowledge distillation loss boosting the performance, which can transfer prior knowledge obtained from a High-resolution Vision Mamba classification Network (HRVM-Net) as a teacher into the proposed SRVM-Net as a student. Extensive experiments on seven public fine-grained classification datasets related to benchmarks confirm our ViMD achieves a new state-of-the-art performance. While having higher accuracy, ViMD outperforms similar methods with fewer parameters and FLOPs, which is more suitable for embedded device applications.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We present HI-SLAM2, a geometry-aware Gaussian SLAM system that achieves fast and accurate monocular scene reconstruction using only RGB input. Existing Neural SLAM or 3DGS-based SLAM methods often trade off between rendering quality and geometry accuracy, our research demonstrates that both can be achieved simultaneously with RGB input alone. The key idea of our approach is to enhance the ability for geometry estimation by combining easy-to-obtain monocular priors with learning-based dense SLAM, and then using 3D Gaussian splatting as our core map representation to efficiently model the scene. Upon loop closure, our method ensures on-the-fly global consistency through efficient pose graph bundle adjustment and instant map updates by explicitly deforming the 3D Gaussian units based on anchored keyframe updates. Furthermore, we introduce a grid-based scale alignment strategy to maintain improved scale consistency in prior depths for finer depth details. Through extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet, and ScanNet++, we demonstrate significant improvements over existing Neural SLAM methods and even surpass RGB-D-based methods in both reconstruction and rendering quality.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing foundation models largely break away from the traditional paradigm of designing task-specific models, offering greater scalability across multiple tasks. However, they face challenges such as low computational efficiency and limited interpretability, especially when dealing with high-resolution remote sensing images. To overcome these, we draw inspiration from heat conduction, a physical process modeling local heat diffusion. Building on this idea, we are the first to explore the potential of using the parallel computing model of heat conduction to simulate the local region correlations in high-resolution remote sensing images, and introduce RS-vHeat, an efficient multi-modal remote sensing foundation model. Specifically, RS-vHeat 1) applies the Heat Conduction Operator (HCO) with a complexity of $O(N^{1.5})$ and a global receptive field, reducing computational overhead while capturing remote sensing object structure information to guide heat diffusion; 2) learns the frequency distribution representations of various scenes through a self-supervised strategy based on frequency domain hierarchical masking and multi-domain reconstruction; 3) significantly improves efficiency and performance over state-of-the-art techniques across 4 tasks and 10 datasets. Compared to attention-based remote sensing foundation models, we reduces memory consumption by 84%, decreases FLOPs by 24% and improves throughput by 2.7 times.

- **Summary**: Recent researches on video large language models (VideoLLM) predominantly focus on model architectures and training datasets, leaving the interaction format between the user and the model under-explored. In existing works, users often interact with VideoLLMs by using the entire video and a query as input, after which the model generates a response. This interaction format constrains the application of VideoLLMs in scenarios such as live-streaming comprehension where videos do not end and responses are required in a real-time manner, and also results in unsatisfactory performance on time-sensitive tasks that requires localizing video segments. In this paper, we focus on a video-text duet interaction format. This interaction format is characterized by the continuous playback of the video, and both the user and the model can insert their text messages at any position during the video playback. When a text message ends, the video continues to play, akin to the alternative of two performers in a duet. We construct MMDuetIT, a video-text training dataset designed to adapt VideoLLMs to video-text duet interaction format. We also introduce the Multi-Answer Grounded Video Question Answering (MAGQA) task to benchmark the real-time response ability of VideoLLMs. Trained on MMDuetIT, MMDuet demonstrates that adopting the video-text duet interaction format enables the model to achieve significant improvements in various time-sensitive tasks (76% CIDEr on YouCook2 dense video captioning, 90\% mAP on QVHighlights highlight detection and 25% R@0.5 on Charades-STA temporal video grounding) with minimal training efforts, and also enable VideoLLMs to reply in a real-time manner as the video plays.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Inverse rendering seeks to reconstruct both geometry and spatially varying BRDFs (SVBRDFs) from captured images. To address the inherent ill-posedness of inverse rendering, basis BRDF representations are commonly used, modeling SVBRDFs as spatially varying blends of a set of basis BRDFs. However, existing methods often yield basis BRDFs that lack intuitive separation and have limited scalability to scenes of varying complexity. In this paper, we introduce a differentiable inverse rendering method that produces interpretable basis BRDFs. Our approach models a scene using 2D Gaussians, where the reflectance of each Gaussian is defined by a weighted blend of basis BRDFs. We efficiently render an image from the 2D Gaussians and basis BRDFs using differentiable rasterization and impose a rendering loss with the input images. During this analysis-by-synthesis optimization process of differentiable inverse rendering, we dynamically adjust the number of basis BRDFs to fit the target scene while encouraging sparsity in the basis weights. This ensures that the reflectance of each Gaussian is represented by only a few basis BRDFs. This approach enables the reconstruction of accurate geometry and interpretable basis BRDFs that are spatially separated. Consequently, the resulting scene representation, comprising basis BRDFs and 2D Gaussians, supports physically-based novel-view relighting and intuitive scene editing.

- **Summary**: Multispectral pedestrian detection is a crucial component in various critical applications. However, a significant challenge arises due to the misalignment between these modalities, particularly under real-world conditions where data often appear heavily misaligned. Conventional methods developed on well-aligned or minimally misaligned datasets fail to address these discrepancies adequately. This paper introduces a new framework for multispectral pedestrian detection designed specifically to handle heavily misaligned datasets without the need for costly and complex traditional pre-processing calibration. By leveraging Large-scale Vision-Language Models (LVLM) for cross-modal semantic alignment, our approach seeks to enhance detection accuracy by aligning semantic information across the RGB and thermal domains. This method not only simplifies the operational requirements but also extends the practical usability of multispectral detection technologies in practical applications.

- **Summary**: Despite inheriting security measures from underlying language models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) may still be vulnerable to safety alignment issues. Through empirical analysis, we uncover two critical findings: scenario-matched images can significantly amplify harmful outputs, and contrary to common assumptions in gradient-based attacks, minimal loss values do not guarantee optimal attack effectiveness. Building on these insights, we introduce MLAI (Multi-Loss Adversarial Images), a novel jailbreak framework that leverages scenario-aware image generation for semantic alignment, exploits flat minima theory for robust adversarial image selection, and employs multi-image collaborative attacks for enhanced effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate MLAI's significant impact, achieving attack success rates of 77.75% on MiniGPT-4 and 82.80% on LLaVA-2, substantially outperforming existing methods by margins of 34.37% and 12.77% respectively. Furthermore, MLAI shows considerable transferability to commercial black-box VLMs, achieving up to 60.11% success rate. Our work reveals fundamental visual vulnerabilities in current VLMs safety mechanisms and underscores the need for stronger defenses. Warning: This paper contains potentially harmful example text.

- **Summary**: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, computer vision tasks have seen significant improvements, making two-stream neural networks a popular focus for video based action recognition. Traditional models using RGB and optical flow streams achieve strong performance but at a high computational cost. To address this, we introduce a representation flow algorithm to replace the optical flow branch in the egocentric action recognition model, enabling end-to-end training while reducing computational cost and prediction time. Our model, designed for egocentric action recognition, uses class activation maps (CAMs) to improve accuracy and ConvLSTM for spatio temporal encoding with spatial attention. When evaluated on the GTEA61, EGTEA GAZE+, and HMDB datasets, our model matches the accuracy of the original model on GTEA61 and exceeds it by 0.65% and 0.84% on EGTEA GAZE+ and HMDB, respectively. Prediction runtimes are significantly reduced to 0.1881s, 0.1503s, and 0.1459s, compared to the original model's 101.6795s, 25.3799s, and 203.9958s. Ablation studies were also conducted to study the impact of different parameters on model performance.

- **Summary**: In the research area of image super-resolution, Swin-transformer-based models are favored for their global spatial modeling and shifting window attention mechanism. However, existing methods often limit self-attention to non overlapping windows to cut costs and ignore the useful information that exists across channels. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel model, the Hybrid Attention Aggregation Transformer (HAAT), designed to better leverage feature information. HAAT is constructed by integrating Swin-Dense-Residual-Connected Blocks (SDRCB) with Hybrid Grid Attention Blocks (HGAB). SDRCB expands the receptive field while maintaining a streamlined architecture, resulting in enhanced performance. HGAB incorporates channel attention, sparse attention, and window attention to improve nonlocal feature fusion and achieve more visually compelling results. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that HAAT surpasses state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.   Keywords: Image super-resolution, Computer vision, Attention mechanism, Transformer

- **Summary**: Rapid diagnostic tests are crucial for timely disease detection and management, yet accurate interpretation of test results remains challenging. In this study, we propose a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability of rapid diagnostic test result interpretation by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), within a smartphone-based application. The app enables users to take pictures of their test kits, which YOLOv8 then processes to precisely crop and extract the membrane region, even if the test kit is not centered in the frame or is positioned at the very edge of the image. This capability offers greater accessibility, allowing even visually impaired individuals to capture test images without needing perfect alignment, thus promoting user independence and inclusivity. The extracted image is analyzed by an additional CNN classifier that determines if the results are positive, negative, or invalid, providing users with the results and a confidence level. Through validation experiments with commonly used rapid test kits across various diagnostic applications, our results demonstrate that the synergistic integration of AI significantly improves sensitivity and specificity in test result interpretation. This improvement can be attributed to the extraction of the membrane zones from the test kit images using the state-of-the-art YOLO algorithm. Additionally, we performed SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to investigate the factors influencing the model's decisions, identifying reasons behind both correct and incorrect classifications. By facilitating the differentiation of genuine test lines from background noise and providing valuable insights into test line intensity and uniformity, our approach offers a robust solution to challenges in rapid test interpretation.

- **Summary**: Fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are one of the most commonly used platforms for the burgeoning Low-altitude Economy (LAE) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM), due to their long endurance and high-speed capabilities. Classical obstacle avoidance systems, which rely on prior maps or sophisticated sensors, face limitations in unknown low-altitude environments and small UAV platforms. In response, this paper proposes a lightweight deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based UAV collision avoidance system that enables a fixed-wing UAV to avoid unknown obstacles at cruise speed over 30m/s, with only onboard visual sensors. The proposed system employs a single-frame image depth inference module with a streamlined network architecture to ensure real-time obstacle detection, optimized for edge computing devices. After that, a reinforcement learning controller with a novel reward function is designed to balance the target approach and flight trajectory smoothness, satisfying the specific dynamic constraints and stability requirements of a fixed-wing UAV platform. An adaptive entropy adjustment mechanism is introduced to mitigate the exploration-exploitation trade-off inherent in DRL, improving training convergence and obstacle avoidance success rates. Extensive software-in-the-loop and hardware-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms other methods in obstacle avoidance efficiency and flight trajectory smoothness and confirm the feasibility of implementing the algorithm on edge devices.

- **Summary**: Assembling furniture amounts to solving the discrete-continuous optimization task of selecting the furniture parts to assemble and estimating their connecting poses in a physically realistic manner. The problem is hampered by its combinatorially large yet sparse solution space thus making learning to assemble a challenging task for current machine learning models. In this paper, we attempt to solve this task by leveraging the assembly instructions provided in diagrammatic manuals that typically accompany the furniture parts. Our key insight is to use the cues in these diagrams to split the problem into discrete and continuous phases. Specifically, we present Manual-PA, a transformer-based instruction Manual-guided 3D Part Assembly framework that learns to semantically align 3D parts with their illustrations in the manuals using a contrastive learning backbone towards predicting the assembly order and infers the 6D pose of each part via relating it to the final furniture depicted in the manual. To validate the efficacy of our method, we conduct experiments on the benchmark PartNet dataset. Our results show that using the diagrams and the order of the parts lead to significant improvements in assembly performance against the state of the art.

- **Summary**: Ensuring safe, comfortable, and efficient navigation is a critical goal for autonomous driving systems. While end-to-end models trained on large-scale datasets excel in common driving scenarios, they often struggle with rare, long-tail events. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has introduced enhanced reasoning capabilities, but their computational demands pose challenges for real-time decision-making and precise planning. This paper presents FASIONAD, a novel dual-system framework inspired by the cognitive model "Thinking, Fast and Slow." The fast system handles routine navigation tasks using rapid, data-driven path planning, while the slow system focuses on complex reasoning and decision-making in challenging or unfamiliar situations. A dynamic switching mechanism based on score distribution and feedback allows seamless transitions between the two systems. Visual prompts generated by the fast system enable human-like reasoning in the slow system, which provides high-quality feedback to enhance the fast system's decision-making. To evaluate FASIONAD, we introduce a new benchmark derived from the nuScenes dataset, specifically designed to differentiate fast and slow scenarios. FASIONAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark, establishing a new standard for frameworks integrating fast and slow cognitive processes in autonomous driving. This approach paves the way for more adaptive, human-like autonomous driving systems.

- **Summary**: Surgical phase recognition is essential for analyzing procedure-specific surgical videos. While recent transformer-based architectures have advanced sequence processing capabilities, they struggle with maintaining consistency across lengthy surgical procedures. Drawing inspiration from classical hidden Markov models' finite-state interpretations, we introduce the neural finite-state machine (NFSM) module, which bridges procedural understanding with deep learning approaches. NFSM combines procedure-level understanding with neural networks through global state embeddings, attention-based dynamic transition tables, and transition-aware training and inference mechanisms for offline and online applications. When integrated into our future-aware architecture, NFSM improves video-level accuracy, phase-level precision, recall, and Jaccard indices on Cholec80 datasets by 2.3, 3.2, 3.0, and 4.8 percentage points respectively. As an add-on module to existing state-of-the-art models like Surgformer, NFSM further enhances performance, demonstrating its complementary value. Extended experiments on non-surgical datasets validate NFSM's generalizability beyond surgical domains. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating NSFM into deep learning frameworks enables more robust and consistent phase recognition across long procedural videos.

- **Summary**: Integrating RGB and NIR stereo imaging provides complementary spectral information, potentially enhancing robotic 3D vision in challenging lighting conditions. However, existing datasets and imaging systems lack pixel-level alignment between RGB and NIR images, posing challenges for downstream vision tasks. In this paper, we introduce a robotic vision system equipped with pixel-aligned RGB-NIR stereo cameras and a LiDAR sensor mounted on a mobile robot. The system simultaneously captures pixel-aligned pairs of RGB stereo images, NIR stereo images, and temporally synchronized LiDAR points. Utilizing the mobility of the robot, we present a dataset containing continuous video frames under diverse lighting conditions. We then introduce two methods that utilize the pixel-aligned RGB-NIR images: an RGB-NIR image fusion method and a feature fusion method. The first approach enables existing RGB-pretrained vision models to directly utilize RGB-NIR information without fine-tuning. The second approach fine-tunes existing vision models to more effectively utilize RGB-NIR information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using pixel-aligned RGB-NIR images across diverse lighting conditions.

- **Summary**: The Large Vision Language Model (VLM) has recently addressed remarkable progress in bridging two fundamental modalities. VLM, trained by a sufficiently large dataset, exhibits a comprehensive understanding of both visual and linguistic to perform diverse tasks. To distill this knowledge accurately, in this paper, we introduce a novel approach that explicitly utilizes VLM as an objective function form for the Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection task (\textbf{VLM-HOI}). Specifically, we propose a method that quantifies the similarity of the predicted HOI triplet using the Image-Text matching technique. We represent HOI triplets linguistically to fully utilize the language comprehension of VLMs, which are more suitable than CLIP models due to their localization and object-centric nature. This matching score is used as an objective for contrastive optimization. To our knowledge, this is the first utilization of VLM language abilities for HOI detection. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art HOI detection accuracy on benchmarks. We believe integrating VLMs into HOI detection represents important progress towards more advanced and interpretable analysis of human-object interactions.

- **Summary**: Multimodal LLMs have advanced vision-language tasks but still struggle with understanding video scenes. To bridge this gap, Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) has emerged to capture multi-object relationships across video frames. However, prior methods rely on pairwise connections, limiting their ability to handle complex multi-object interactions and reasoning. To this end, we propose Multimodal LLMs on a Scene HyperGraph (HyperGLM), promoting reasoning about multi-way interactions and higher-order relationships. Our approach uniquely integrates entity scene graphs, which capture spatial relationships between objects, with a procedural graph that models their causal transitions, forming a unified HyperGraph. Significantly, HyperGLM enables reasoning by injecting this unified HyperGraph into LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a new Video Scene Graph Reasoning (VSGR) dataset featuring 1.9M frames from third-person, egocentric, and drone views and supports five tasks: Scene Graph Generation, Scene Graph Anticipation, Video Question Answering, Video Captioning, and Relation Reasoning. Empirically, HyperGLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across five tasks, effectively modeling and reasoning complex relationships in diverse video scenes.

- **Summary**: Using lightweight models as backbone networks in gaze estimation tasks often results in significant performance degradation. The main reason is that the number of feature channels in lightweight networks is usually small, which makes the model expression ability limited. In order to improve the performance of lightweight models in gaze estimation tasks, a network model named Multitask-Gaze is proposed. The main components of Multitask-Gaze include Unidirectional Convolution (UC), Spatial and Channel Attention (SCA), Global Convolution Module (GCM), and Multi-task Regression Module(MRM). UC not only significantly reduces the number of parameters and FLOPs, but also extends the receptive field and improves the long-distance modeling capability of the model, thereby improving the model performance. SCA highlights gaze-related features and suppresses gaze-irrelevant features. The GCM replaces the pooling layer and avoids the performance degradation due to information loss. MRM improves the accuracy of individual tasks and strengthens the connections between tasks for overall performance improvement. The experimental results show that compared with the State-of-the-art method SUGE, the performance of Multitask-Gaze on MPIIFaceGaze and Gaze360 datasets is improved by 1.71% and 2.75%, respectively, while the number of parameters and FLOPs are significantly reduced by 75.5% and 86.88%.

- **Summary**: Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is a serious cardiovascular condition that remains a leading cause of mortality and critical illness, underscoring the need for enhanced diagnostic strategies. Conventional clinical methods have limited success in predicting 30-day in-hospital mortality of PE patients. In this study, we present a new algorithm, called PEP-Net, for 30-day mortality prediction of PE patients based on the initial imaging data (CT) that opportunistically integrates a 3D Residual Network (3DResNet) with Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm with patient level binary labels without annotations of the emboli and its extent. Our proposed system offers a comprehensive prediction strategy by handling class imbalance problems, reducing overfitting via regularization, and reducing the prediction variance for more stable predictions. PEP-Net was tested in a cohort of 193 volumetric CT scans diagnosed with Acute PE, and it demonstrated a superior performance by significantly outperforming baseline models (76-78\%) with an accuracy of 94.5\% (+/-0.3) and 94.0\% (+/-0.7) when the input image is either lung region (Lung-ROI) or heart region (Cardiac-ROI). Our results advance PE prognostics by using only initial imaging data, setting a new benchmark in the field. While purely deep learning models have become the go-to for many medical classification (diagnostic) tasks, combined ResNet and XGBoost models herein outperform sole deep learning models due to a potential reason for having lack of enough data.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based appearance gaze estimation methods are gaining popularity due to their high accuracy and fewer constraints from the environment. However, existing high-precision models often rely on deeper networks, leading to problems such as large parameters, long training time, and slow convergence. In terms of this issue, this paper proposes a novel lightweight gaze estimation model FGI-Net(Fusion Global Information). The model fuses global information into the CNN, effectively compensating for the need of multi-layer convolution and pooling to indirectly capture global information, while reducing the complexity of the model, improving the model accuracy and convergence speed. To validate the performance of the model, a large number of experiments are conducted, comparing accuracy with existing classical models and lightweight models, comparing convergence speed with models of different architectures, and conducting ablation experiments. Experimental results show that compared with GazeCaps, the latest gaze estimation model, FGI-Net achieves a smaller angle error with 87.1% and 79.1% reduction in parameters and FLOPs, respectively (MPIIFaceGaze is 3.74{\deg}, EyeDiap is 5.15{\deg}, Gaze360 is 10.50{\deg} and RT-Gene is 6.02{\deg}). Moreover, compared with different architectural models such as CNN and Transformer, FGI-Net is able to quickly converge to a higher accuracy range with fewer iterations of training, when achieving optimal accuracy on the Gaze360 and EyeDiap datasets, the FGI-Net model has 25% and 37.5% fewer iterations of training compared to GazeTR, respectively.

- **Summary**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has achieved significant performance on indoor surface reconstruction and open-vocabulary segmentation. This paper presents GLS, a unified framework of surface reconstruction and open-vocabulary segmentation based on 3DGS. GLS extends two fields by exploring the correlation between them. For indoor surface reconstruction, we introduce surface normal prior as a geometric cue to guide the rendered normal, and use the normal error to optimize the rendered depth. For open-vocabulary segmentation, we employ 2D CLIP features to guide instance features and utilize DEVA masks to enhance their view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of jointly optimizing surface reconstruction and open-vocabulary segmentation, where GLS surpasses state-of-the-art approaches of each task on MuSHRoom, ScanNet++, and LERF-OVS datasets.

- **Summary**: Personalized image generation has been significantly advanced, enabling the creation of highly realistic and customized images. However, existing methods often struggle with generating images of multiple people due to occlusions and fail to accurately personalize full-body shapes. In this paper, we propose PersonaCraft, a novel approach that combines diffusion models with 3D human modeling to address these limitations. Our method effectively manages occlusions by incorporating 3D-aware pose conditioning with SMPLx-ControlNet and accurately personalizes human full-body shapes through SMPLx fitting. Additionally, PersonaCraft enables user-defined body shape adjustments, adding flexibility for individual body customization. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of PersonaCraft in generating high-quality, realistic images of multiple individuals while resolving occlusion issues, thus establishing a new standard for multi-person personalized image synthesis.

- **Summary**: Accurate and reliable predictions of solar flares are essential due to their potentially significant impact on Earth and space-based infrastructure. Although deep learning models have shown notable predictive capabilities in this domain, current evaluations often focus on accuracy while neglecting interpretability and reliability--factors that are especially critical in operational settings. To address this gap, we propose a novel proximity-based framework for analyzing post hoc explanations to assess the interpretability of deep learning models for solar flare prediction. Our study compares two models trained on full-disk line-of-sight (LoS) magnetogram images to predict $\geq$M-class solar flares within a 24-hour window. We employ the Guided Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Guided Grad-CAM) method to generate attribution maps from these models, which we then analyze to gain insights into their decision-making processes. To support the evaluation of explanations in operational systems, we introduce a proximity-based metric that quantitatively assesses the accuracy and relevance of local explanations when regions of interest are known. Our findings indicate that the models' predictions align with active region characteristics to varying degrees, offering valuable insights into their behavior. This framework enhances the evaluation of model interpretability in solar flare forecasting and supports the development of more transparent and reliable operational systems.

- **Summary**: Sparse Multi-view Images can be Learned to predict explicit radiance fields via Generalizable Gaussian Splatting approaches, which can achieve wider application prospects in real-life when ground-truth camera parameters are not required as inputs. In this paper, a novel generalizable Gaussian Splatting method, SmileSplat, is proposed to reconstruct pixel-aligned Gaussian surfels for diverse scenarios only requiring unconstrained sparse multi-view images. First, Gaussian surfels are predicted based on the multi-head Gaussian regression decoder, which can are represented with less degree-of-freedom but have better multi-view consistency. Furthermore, the normal vectors of Gaussian surfel are enhanced based on high-quality of normal priors. Second, the Gaussians and camera parameters (both extrinsic and intrinsic) are optimized to obtain high-quality Gaussian radiance fields for novel view synthesis tasks based on the proposed Bundle-Adjusting Gaussian Splatting module. Extensive experiments on novel view rendering and depth map prediction tasks are conducted on public datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in various 3D vision tasks.

- **Summary**: The detection of prohibited items in X-ray security inspections is vital for ensuring public safety. However, the long-tail distribution of item categories, where certain prohibited items are far less common, poses a big challenge for detection models, as rare categories often lack sufficient training data. Existing methods struggle to classify these rare items accurately due to this imbalance. In this paper, we propose a Dual-level Boost Network (DBNet) specifically designed to overcome these challenges in X-ray security screening. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a specific data augmentation strategy employing Poisson blending, inspired by the characteristics of X-ray images, to generate realistic synthetic instances of rare items which can effectively mitigate data imbalance; and (2) a context-aware feature enhancement module that captures the spatial and semantic interactions between objects and their surroundings, enhancing classification accuracy for underrepresented categories. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DBNet improves detection performance for tail categories, outperforming sota methods in X-ray security inspection scenarios by a large margin 17.2%, thereby ensuring enhanced public safety.

- **Summary**: To detect prohibited items in challenging categories, human inspectors typically rely on images from two distinct views (vertical and side). Can AI detect prohibited items from dual-view X-ray images in the same way humans do? Existing X-ray datasets often suffer from limitations, such as single-view imaging or insufficient sample diversity. To address these gaps, we introduce the Large-scale Dual-view X-ray (LDXray), which consists of 353,646 instances across 12 categories, providing a diverse and comprehensive resource for training and evaluating models. To emulate human intelligence in dual-view detection, we propose the Auxiliary-view Enhanced Network (AENet), a novel detection framework that leverages both the main and auxiliary views of the same object. The main-view pipeline focuses on detecting common categories, while the auxiliary-view pipeline handles more challenging categories using ``expert models" learned from the main view. Extensive experiments on the LDXray dataset demonstrate that the dual-view mechanism significantly enhances detection performance, e.g., achieving improvements of up to 24.7% for the challenging category of umbrellas. Furthermore, our results show that AENet exhibits strong generalization across seven different detection models for X-ray Inspection

- **Summary**: Due to the large size and lack of fine-grained annotation, Whole Slide Images (WSIs) analysis is commonly approached as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, previous studies only learn from training data, posing a stark contrast to how human clinicians teach each other and reason about histopathologic entities and factors. Here we present a novel knowledge concept-based MIL framework, named ConcepPath to fill this gap. Specifically, ConcepPath utilizes GPT-4 to induce reliable diseasespecific human expert concepts from medical literature, and incorporate them with a group of purely learnable concepts to extract complementary knowledge from training data. In ConcepPath, WSIs are aligned to these linguistic knowledge concepts by utilizing pathology vision-language model as the basic building component. In the application of lung cancer subtyping, breast cancer HER2 scoring, and gastric cancer immunotherapy-sensitive subtyping task, ConcepPath significantly outperformed previous SOTA methods which lack the guidance of human expert knowledge.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) can improve model performance by leveraging unlabeled images, which can be collected from public image sources with low costs. In recent years, synthetic images have become increasingly common in public image sources due to rapid advances in generative models. Therefore, it is becoming inevitable to include existing synthetic images in the unlabeled data for SSL. How this kind of contamination will affect SSL remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Real-Synthetic Hybrid SSL (RS-SSL), to investigate the impact of unlabeled data contaminated by synthetic images for SSL. First, we set up a new RS-SSL benchmark to evaluate current SSL methods and found they struggled to improve by unlabeled synthetic images, sometimes even negatively affected. To this end, we propose RSMatch, a novel SSL method specifically designed to handle the challenges of RS-SSL. RSMatch effectively identifies unlabeled synthetic data and further utilizes them for improvement. Extensive experimental results show that RSMatch can transfer synthetic unlabeled data from `obstacles' to `resources.' The effectiveness is further verified through ablation studies and visualization.

However, effectively utilizing LVLMs for ReID remains an open challenge. While LVLMs operate under a generative paradigm by predicting the next output word, ReID requires the extraction of discriminative identity features to match pedestrians across cameras. In this paper, we propose LVLM-ReID, a novel framework that harnesses the strengths of LVLMs to promote ReID. Specifically, we employ instructions to guide the LVLM in generating one pedestrian semantic token that encapsulates key appearance semantics from the person image. This token is further refined through our Semantic-Guided Interaction (SGI) module, establishing a reciprocal interaction between the semantic token and visual tokens. Ultimately, the reinforced semantic token serves as the pedestrian identity representation. Our framework integrates the semantic understanding and generation capabilities of LVLMs into end-to-end ReID training, allowing LVLMs to capture rich semantic cues from pedestrian images during both training and inference. Our method achieves competitive results on multiple benchmarks without additional image-text annotations, demonstrating the potential of LVLM-generated semantics to advance person ReID and offering a promising direction for future research.

- **Summary**: The classification of hyperspectral images (HSI) is a challenging task due to the high spectral dimensionality and limited labeled data typically available for training. In this study, we propose a novel multi-stage active transfer learning (ATL) framework that integrates a Spatial-Spectral Transformer (SST) with an active learning process for efficient HSI classification. Our approach leverages a pre-trained (initially trained) SST model, fine-tuned iteratively on newly acquired labeled samples using an uncertainty-diversity (Spatial-Spectral Neighborhood Diversity) querying mechanism. This mechanism identifies the most informative and diverse samples, thereby optimizing the transfer learning process to reduce both labeling costs and model uncertainty. We further introduce a dynamic freezing strategy, selectively freezing layers of the SST model to minimize computational overhead while maintaining adaptability to spectral variations in new data. One of the key innovations in our work is the self-calibration of spectral and spatial attention weights, achieved through uncertainty-guided active learning. This not only enhances the model's robustness in handling dynamic and disjoint spectral profiles but also improves generalization across multiple HSI datasets. Additionally, we present a diversity-promoting sampling strategy that ensures the selected samples span distinct spectral regions, preventing overfitting to particular spectral classes. Experiments on benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that the SST-ATL framework significantly outperforms existing CNN and SST-based methods, offering superior accuracy, efficiency, and computational performance.

- **Summary**: Robotic grasping in the open world is a critical component of manufacturing and automation processes. While numerous existing approaches depend on 2D segmentation output to facilitate the grasping procedure, accurately determining depth from 2D imagery remains a challenge, often leading to limited performance in complex stacking scenarios. In contrast, techniques utilizing 3D point cloud data inherently capture depth information, thus enabling adeptly navigating and manipulating a diverse range of complex stacking scenes. However, such efforts are considerably hindered by the variance in data capture devices and the unstructured nature of the data, which limits their generalizability. Consequently, much research is narrowly concentrated on managing designated objects within specific settings, which confines their real-world applicability. This paper presents a novel pipeline capable of executing object grasping tasks in open-world scenarios even on previously unseen objects without the necessity for training. Additionally, our pipeline supports the flexible use of different 3D point cloud segmentation models across a variety of scenes. Leveraging the segmentation results, we propose to engage a training-free binary clustering algorithm that not only improves segmentation precision but also possesses the capability to cluster and localize unseen objects for executing grasping operations. In our experiments, we investigate a range of open-world scenarios, and the outcomes underscore the remarkable robustness and generalizability of our pipeline, consistent across various environments, robots, cameras, and objects. The code will be made available upon acceptance of the paper.

- **Summary**: Existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)-based methods have driven significant progress in text-to-3D generation. However, 3D models produced by SDS-based methods tend to exhibit over-smoothing and low-quality outputs. These issues arise from the mode-seeking behavior of current methods, where the scores used to update the model oscillate between multiple modes, resulting in unstable optimization and diminished output quality. To address this problem, we introduce a novel image prompt score distillation loss named ISD, which employs a reference image to direct text-to-3D optimization toward a specific mode. Our ISD loss can be implemented by using IP-Adapter, a lightweight adapter for integrating image prompt capability to a text-to-image diffusion model, as a mode-selection module. A variant of this adapter, when not being prompted by a reference image, can serve as an efficient control variate to reduce variance in score estimates, thereby enhancing both output quality and optimization stability. Our experiments demonstrate that the ISD loss consistently achieves visually coherent, high-quality outputs and improves optimization speed compared to prior text-to-3D methods, as demonstrated through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the T3Bench benchmark suite.

- **Summary**: There have been recent efforts to extend the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by finding visual clues in the input scene, advancing the visual reasoning ability of MLLMs. However, current approaches are specially designed for the tasks where clue finding plays a major role in the whole reasoning process, leading to the difficulty in handling complex visual scenes where clue finding does not actually simplify the whole reasoning task. To deal with this challenge, we propose a new visual reasoning paradigm enabling MLLMs to autonomously modify the input scene to new ones based on its reasoning status, such that CoT is reformulated as conducting simple closed-loop decision-making and reasoning steps under a sequence of imagined visual scenes, leading to natural and general CoT construction. To implement this paradigm, we introduce a novel plug-and-play imagination space, where MLLMs conduct visual modifications through operations like focus, ignore, and transform based on their native reasoning ability without specific training. We validate our approach through a benchmark spanning dense counting, simple jigsaw puzzle solving, and object placement, challenging the reasoning ability beyond clue finding. The results verify that while existing techniques fall short, our approach enables MLLMs to effectively reason step by step through autonomous imagination.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), both general-domain models and those specifically tailored for remote sensing Earth observation, have demonstrated exceptional perception and reasoning abilities within this specific field. However, the current absence of a comprehensive benchmark for holistically evaluating the remote sensing capabilities of these VLMs represents a significant gap. To bridge this gap, we propose COREval, the first benchmark designed to comprehensively and objectively evaluate the hierarchical remote sensing capabilities of VLMs. Concentrating on 2 primary capability dimensions essential to remote sensing: perception and reasoning, we further categorize 6 secondary dimensions and 22 leaf tasks to ensure a well-rounded assessment coverage for this specific field. COREval guarantees the quality of the total of 6,263 problems through a rigorous process of data collection from 50 globally distributed cities, question construction and quality control, and the format of multiple-choice questions with definitive answers allows for an objective and straightforward evaluation of VLM performance. We conducted a holistic evaluation of 13 prominent open-source VLMs from both the general and remote sensing domains, highlighting current shortcomings in their remote sensing capabilities and providing directions for improvements in their application within this specialized context. We hope that COREval will serve as a valuable resource and offer deeper insights into the challenges and potential of VLMs in the field of remote sensing.

- **Summary**: Semantic mapping is a key component of robots operating in and interacting with objects in structured environments. Traditionally, geometric and knowledge representations within a semantic map have only been loosely integrated. However, recent advances in deep learning now allow full integration of prior knowledge, represented as knowledge graphs or language concepts, into sensor data processing and semantic mapping pipelines. Semantic scene graphs and language models enable modern semantic mapping approaches to incorporate graph-based prior knowledge or to leverage the rich information in human language both during and after the mapping process. This has sparked substantial advances in semantic mapping, leading to previously impossible novel applications. This survey reviews these recent developments comprehensively, with a focus on online integration of knowledge into semantic mapping. We specifically focus on methods using semantic scene graphs for integrating symbolic prior knowledge and language models for respective capture of implicit common-sense knowledge and natural language concepts

- **Summary**: While recent text-to-image models can generate photorealistic images from text prompts that reflect detailed instructions, they still face significant challenges in accurately rendering words in the image. In this paper, we propose to retouch erroneous text renderings in the post-processing pipeline. Our approach, called Type-R, identifies typographical errors in the generated image, erases the erroneous text, regenerates text boxes for missing words, and finally corrects typos in the rendered words. Through extensive experiments, we show that Type-R, in combination with the latest text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion or Flux, achieves the highest text rendering accuracy while maintaining image quality and also outperforms text-focused generation baselines in terms of balancing text accuracy and image quality.

- **Summary**: The automatic detection of pedestrian heads in crowded environments is essential for crowd analysis and management tasks, particularly in high-risk settings such as railway platforms and event entrances. These environments, characterized by dense crowds and dynamic movements, are underrepresented in public datasets, posing challenges for existing deep learning models. To address this gap, we introduce the Railway Platforms and Event Entrances-Heads (RPEE-Heads) dataset, a novel, diverse, high-resolution, and accurately annotated resource. It includes 109,913 annotated pedestrian heads across 1,886 images from 66 video recordings, with an average of 56.2 heads per image. Annotations include bounding boxes for visible head regions. In addition to introducing the RPEE-Heads dataset, this paper evaluates eight state-of-the-art object detection algorithms using the RPEE-Heads dataset and analyzes the impact of head size on detection accuracy. The experimental results show that You Only Look Once v9 and Real-Time Detection Transformer outperform the other algorithms, achieving mean average precisions of 90.7% and 90.8%, with inference times of 11 and 14 milliseconds, respectively. Moreover, the findings underscore the need for specialized datasets like RPEE-Heads for training and evaluating accurate models for head detection in railway platforms and event entrances. The dataset and pretrained models are available at https://doi.org/10.34735/ped.2024.2.

- **Summary**: With the advancement of face reconstruction (FR) systems, privacy-preserving face recognition (PPFR) has gained popularity for its secure face recognition, enhanced facial privacy protection, and robustness to various attacks. Besides, specific models and algorithms are proposed for face embedding protection by mapping embeddings to a secure space. However, there is a lack of studies on investigating and evaluating the possibility of extracting face images from embeddings of those systems, especially for PPFR. In this work, we introduce the first approach to exploit Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for conducting embedding-to-face attacks against state-of-the-art (SOTA) FR and PPFR systems. Face embedding mapping (FEM) models are proposed to learn the distribution mapping relation between the embeddings from the initial domain and target domain. In comparison with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), we provide two variants, FEM-KAN and FEM-MLP, for efficient non-linear embedding-to-embedding mapping in order to reconstruct realistic face images from the corresponding face embedding. To verify our methods, we conduct extensive experiments with various PPFR and FR models. We also measure reconstructed face images with different metrics to evaluate the image quality. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FEMs in accurate embedding mapping and face reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Purpose: Endoscopic surgical environments present challenges for dissection zone segmentation due to unclear boundaries between tissue types, leading to segmentation errors where models misidentify or overlook edges. This study aims to provide precise dissection zone suggestions during endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) procedures, enhancing ESD safety.   Methods: We propose the Prompted-based Dissection Zone Segmentation (PDZSeg) model, designed to leverage diverse visual prompts such as scribbles and bounding boxes. By overlaying these prompts onto images and fine-tuning a foundational model on a specialized dataset, our approach improves segmentation performance and user experience through flexible input methods.   Results: The PDZSeg model was validated using three experimental setups: in-domain evaluation, variability in visual prompt availability, and robustness assessment. Using the ESD-DZSeg dataset, results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation approaches. This is the first study to integrate visual prompt design into dissection zone segmentation.   Conclusion: The PDZSeg model effectively utilizes visual prompts to enhance segmentation performance and user experience, supported by the novel ESD-DZSeg dataset as a benchmark for dissection zone segmentation in ESD. Our work establishes a foundation for future research.

- **Summary**: Artificial Neural Networks excel at identifying individual components in an image. However, out-of-the-box, they do not manage to correctly integrate and interpret these components as a whole. One way to alleviate this weakness is to expand the network with explicit knowledge and a separate reasoning component. In this paper, we evaluate an approach to this end, applied to the solving of the popular board game Rummikub. We demonstrate that, for this particular example, the added background knowledge is equally valuable as two-thirds of the data set, and allows to bring down the training time to half the original time.

- **Summary**: Audio Descriptions (ADs) aim to provide a narration of a movie in text form, describing non-dialogue-related narratives, such as characters, actions, or scene establishment. Automatic generation of ADs remains challenging due to: i) the domain gap between movie-AD data and existing data used to train vision-language models, and ii) the issue of contextual redundancy arising from highly similar neighboring visual clips in a long movie. In this work, we propose DistinctAD, a novel two-stage framework for generating ADs that emphasize distinctiveness to produce better narratives. To address the domain gap, we introduce a CLIP-AD adaptation strategy that does not require additional AD corpora, enabling more effective alignment between movie and AD modalities at both global and fine-grained levels. In Stage-II, DistinctAD incorporates two key innovations: (i) a Contextual Expectation-Maximization Attention (EMA) module that reduces redundancy by extracting common bases from consecutive video clips, and (ii) an explicit distinctive word prediction loss that filters out repeated words in the context, ensuring the prediction of unique terms specific to the current AD. Comprehensive evaluations on MAD-Eval, CMD-AD, and TV-AD benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DistinctAD, with the model consistently outperforming baselines, particularly in Recall@k/N, highlighting its effectiveness in producing high-quality, distinctive ADs.

- **Summary**: The field of computational imaging has witnessed a promising paradigm shift with the emergence of untrained neural networks, offering novel solutions to inverse computational imaging problems. While existing techniques have demonstrated impressive results, they often operate either in the high-data regime, leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as image priors, or through untrained iterative reconstruction in a data-agnostic manner. This paper delves into lensless image reconstruction, a subset of computational imaging that replaces traditional lenses with computation, enabling the development of ultra-thin and lightweight imaging systems. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to leverage implicit neural representations for lensless image deblurring, achieving reconstructions without the requirement of prior training. We perform prior-embedded untrained iterative optimization to enhance reconstruction performance and speed up convergence, effectively bridging the gap between the no-data and high-data regimes. Through a thorough comparative analysis encompassing various untrained and low-shot methods, including under-parameterized non-convolutional methods and domain-restricted low-shot methods, we showcase the superior performance of our approach by a significant margin.

- **Summary**: 3D characters are essential to modern creative industries, but making them animatable often demands extensive manual work in tasks like rigging and skinning. Existing automatic rigging tools face several limitations, including the necessity for manual annotations, rigid skeleton topologies, and limited generalization across diverse shapes and poses. An alternative approach is to generate animatable avatars pre-bound to a rigged template mesh. However, this method often lacks flexibility and is typically limited to realistic human shapes. To address these issues, we present Make-It-Animatable, a novel data-driven method to make any 3D humanoid model ready for character animation in less than one second, regardless of its shapes and poses. Our unified framework generates high-quality blend weights, bones, and pose transformations. By incorporating a particle-based shape autoencoder, our approach supports various 3D representations, including meshes and 3D Gaussian splats. Additionally, we employ a coarse-to-fine representation and a structure-aware modeling strategy to ensure both accuracy and robustness, even for characters with non-standard skeleton structures. We conducted extensive experiments to validate our framework's effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in both quality and speed.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models~(VLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in multimodal reasoning tasks. However, they still often generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses due to issues like hallucinated image understandings or unrefined reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we introduce Critic-V, a novel framework inspired by the Actor-Critic paradigm to boost the reasoning capability of VLMs. This framework decouples the reasoning process and critic process by integrating two independent components: the Reasoner, which generates reasoning paths based on visual and textual inputs, and the Critic, which provides constructive critique to refine these paths. In this approach, the Reasoner generates reasoning responses according to text prompts, which can evolve iteratively as a policy based on feedback from the Critic. This interaction process was theoretically driven by a reinforcement learning framework where the Critic offers natural language critiques instead of scalar rewards, enabling more nuanced feedback to boost the Reasoner's capability on complex reasoning tasks. The Critic model is trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a preference dataset of critiques ranked by Rule-based Reward(RBR) to enhance its critic capabilities. Evaluation results show that the Critic-V framework significantly outperforms existing methods, including GPT-4V, on 5 out of 8 benchmarks, especially regarding reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Combining a dynamic text-based policy for the Reasoner and constructive feedback from the preference-optimized Critic enables a more reliable and context-sensitive multimodal reasoning process. Our approach provides a promising solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs, improving their performance in real-world reasoning-heavy multimodal applications such as autonomous driving and embodied intelligence.

- **Summary**: Traditional object detection methods operate under the closed-set assumption, where models can only detect a fixed number of objects predefined in the training set. Recent works on open vocabulary object detection (OVD) enable the detection of objects defined by an unbounded vocabulary, which reduces the cost of training models for specific tasks. However, OVD heavily relies on accurate prompts provided by an ''oracle'', which limits their use in critical applications such as driving scene perception. OVD models tend to misclassify near-out-of-distribution (NOOD) objects that have similar semantics to known classes, and ignore far-out-of-distribution (FOOD) objects. To address theses limitations, we propose a framework that enables OVD models to operate in open world settings, by identifying and incrementally learning novel objects. To detect FOOD objects, we propose Open World Embedding Learning (OWEL) and introduce the concept of Pseudo Unknown Embedding which infers the location of unknown classes in a continuous semantic space based on the information of known classes. We also propose Multi-Scale Contrastive Anchor Learning (MSCAL), which enables the identification of misclassified unknown objects by promoting the intra-class consistency of object embeddings at different scales. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in common open world object detection and autonomous driving benchmarks.

We introduce TimeMarker, a versatile Video-LLM designed for high-quality dialogue based on video content, emphasizing temporal localization. TimeMarker integrates Temporal Separator Tokens to enhance temporal awareness, accurately marking specific moments within videos. It employs the AnyLength mechanism for dynamic frame sampling and adaptive token merging, enabling effective handling of both short and long videos. Additionally, TimeMarker utilizes diverse datasets, including further transformed temporal-related video QA datasets, to bolster its temporal understanding capabilities. Image and interleaved data are also employed to further enhance the model's semantic perception ability. Evaluations demonstrate that TimeMarker achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, excelling in both short and long video categories.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an experimental study of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) applied to computer vision tasks, particularly image classification. KANs introduce learnable activation functions on edges, offering flexible non-linear transformations compared to traditional pre-fixed activation functions with specific neural work like Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). While KANs have shown promise mostly in simplified or small-scale datasets, their effectiveness for more complex real-world tasks such as computer vision tasks remains less explored. To fill this gap, this experimental study aims to provide extended observations and insights into the strengths and limitations of KANs. We reveal that although KANs can perform well in specific vision tasks, they face significant challenges, including increased hyperparameter sensitivity and higher computational costs. These limitations suggest that KANs require architectural adaptations, such as integration with other architectures, to be practical for large-scale vision problems. This study focuses on empirical findings rather than proposing new methods, aiming to inform future research on optimizing KANs, in particular computer vision applications or alike.

- **Summary**: Computational analysis of whole slide images (WSIs) has seen significant research progress in recent years, with applications ranging across important diagnostic and prognostic tasks such as survival or cancer subtype prediction. Many state-of-the-art models process the entire slide - which may be as large as $150,000 \times 150,000$ pixels - as a bag of many patches, the size of which necessitates computationally cheap feature aggregation methods. However, a large proportion of these patches are uninformative, such as those containing only healthy or adipose tissue, adding significant noise and size to the bag. We propose Pathology Transformer with Hierarchical Selection (PATHS), a novel top-down method for hierarchical weakly supervised representation learning on slide-level tasks in computational pathology. PATHS is inspired by the cross-magnification manner in which a human pathologist examines a slide, recursively filtering patches at each magnification level to a small subset relevant to the diagnosis. Our method overcomes the complications of processing the entire slide, enabling quadratic self-attention and providing a simple interpretable measure of region importance. We apply PATHS to five datasets of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and achieve superior performance on slide-level prediction tasks when compared to previous methods, despite processing only a small proportion of the slide.

- **Summary**: We propose SharpDepth, a novel approach to monocular metric depth estimation that combines the metric accuracy of discriminative depth estimation methods (e.g., Metric3D, UniDepth) with the fine-grained boundary sharpness typically achieved by generative methods (e.g., Marigold, Lotus). Traditional discriminative models trained on real-world data with sparse ground-truth depth can accurately predict metric depth but often produce over-smoothed or low-detail depth maps. Generative models, in contrast, are trained on synthetic data with dense ground truth, generating depth maps with sharp boundaries yet only providing relative depth with low accuracy. Our approach bridges these limitations by integrating metric accuracy with detailed boundary preservation, resulting in depth predictions that are both metrically precise and visually sharp. Our extensive zero-shot evaluations on standard depth estimation benchmarks confirm SharpDepth effectiveness, showing its ability to achieve both high depth accuracy and detailed representation, making it well-suited for applications requiring high-quality depth perception across diverse, real-world environments.

- **Summary**: Dynamic MRI enables a range of clinical applications, including cardiac function assessment, organ motion tracking, and radiotherapy guidance. However, fully sampling the dynamic k-space data is often infeasible due to time constraints and physiological motion such as respiratory and cardiac motion. This necessitates undersampling, which degrades the quality of reconstructed images. Poor image quality not only hinders visualization but also impairs the estimation of deformation fields, crucial for registering dynamic (moving) images to a static reference image. This registration enables tasks such as motion correction, treatment planning, and quantitative analysis in applications like cardiac imaging and MR-guided radiotherapy. To overcome the challenges posed by undersampling and motion, we introduce an end-to-end deep learning (DL) framework that integrates adaptive dynamic k-space sampling, reconstruction, and registration. Our approach begins with a DL-based adaptive sampling strategy, optimizing dynamic k-space acquisition to capture the most relevant data for each specific case. This is followed by a DL-based reconstruction module that produces images optimized for accurate deformation field estimation from the undersampled moving data. Finally, a registration module estimates the deformation fields aligning the reconstructed dynamic images with a static reference. The proposed framework is independent of specific reconstruction and registration modules allowing for plug-and-play integration of these components. The entire framework is jointly trained using a combination of supervised and unsupervised loss functions, enabling end-to-end optimization for improved performance across all components. Through controlled experiments and ablation studies, we validate each component, demonstrating that each choice contributes to robust motion estimation from undersampled dynamic data.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models are increasingly applied to real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) task. Given the iterative refinement nature of diffusion models, most existing approaches are computationally expensive. While methods such as SinSR and OSEDiff have emerged to condense inference steps via distillation, their performance in image restoration or details recovery is not satisfied. To address this, we propose TSD-SR, a novel distillation framework specifically designed for real-world image super-resolution, aiming to construct an efficient and effective one-step model. We first introduce the Target Score Distillation, which leverages the priors of diffusion models and real image references to achieve more realistic image restoration. Secondly, we propose a Distribution-Aware Sampling Module to make detail-oriented gradients more readily accessible, addressing the challenge of recovering fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TSD-SR has superior restoration results (most of the metrics perform the best) and the fastest inference speed (e.g. 40 times faster than SeeSR) compared to the past Real-ISR approaches based on pre-trained diffusion priors.

- **Summary**: Recently, multi-view and multi-label classification have become significant domains for comprehensive data analysis and exploration. However, incompleteness both in views and labels is still a real-world scenario for multi-view multi-label classification. In this paper, we seek to focus on double missing multi-view multi-label classification tasks and propose our dual-level contrastive learning framework to solve this issue. Different from the existing works, which couple consistent information and view-specific information in the same feature space, we decouple the two heterogeneous properties into different spaces and employ contrastive learning theory to fully disentangle the two properties. Specifically, our method first introduces a two-channel decoupling module that contains a shared representation and a view-proprietary representation to effectively extract consistency and complementarity information across all views. Second, to efficiently filter out high-quality consistent information from multi-view representations, two consistency objectives based on contrastive learning are conducted on the high-level features and the semantic labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on several widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has more stable and superior classification performance.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in object recognition and scene understanding. However, these models often struggle with precise spatial localization - a critical capability for real-world applications. Inspired by how humans use grid-based references like chess boards and maps, we propose introducing explicit visual position encoding through a simple grid overlay approach. By adding a 9x9 black grid pattern onto input images, our method provides visual spatial guidance analogous to how positional encoding works in transformers, but in an explicit, visual form.   Experiments on the COCO 2017 dataset demonstrate that our grid-based approach achieves significant improvements in localization accuracy, with a 107.4% increase in IoU (from 0.27 to 0.56) and a 194.4% improvement in GIoU (from 0.18 to 0.53) compared to baseline performance. Through attention visualization analysis, we show how this visual position encoding helps models better ground spatial relationships. Our method's simplicity and effectiveness make it particularly valuable for applications requiring accurate spatial reasoning, such as robotic manipulation, medical imaging, and autonomous navigation.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly advanced autonomous driving (AD) by enhancing reasoning capabilities. However, these models remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing research has primarily focused on general VLM attacks, the development of attacks tailored to the safety-critical AD context has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we take the first step toward designing adversarial attacks specifically targeting VLMs in AD, exposing the substantial risks these attacks pose within this critical domain. We identify two unique challenges for effective adversarial attacks on AD VLMs: the variability of textual instructions and the time-series nature of visual scenarios. To this end, we propose ADvLM, the first visual adversarial attack framework specifically designed for VLMs in AD. Our framework introduces Semantic-Invariant Induction, which uses a large language model to create a diverse prompt library of textual instructions with consistent semantic content, guided by semantic entropy. Building on this, we introduce Scenario-Associated Enhancement, an approach where attention mechanisms select key frames and perspectives within driving scenarios to optimize adversarial perturbations that generalize across the entire scenario. Extensive experiments on several AD VLMs over multiple benchmarks show that ADvLM achieves state-of-the-art attack effectiveness. Moreover, real-world attack studies further validate its applicability and potential in practice.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in personalized Text-to-Video (T2V) generation highlight the importance of integrating character-specific identities and actions. However, previous T2V models struggle with identity consistency and controllable motion dynamics, mainly due to limited fine-grained facial and action-based textual prompts, and datasets that overlook key human attributes and actions. To address these challenges, we propose MotionCharacter, an efficient and high-fidelity human video generation framework designed for identity preservation and fine-grained motion control. We introduce an ID-preserving module to maintain identity fidelity while allowing flexible attribute modifications, and further integrate ID-consistency and region-aware loss mechanisms, significantly enhancing identity consistency and detail fidelity. Additionally, our approach incorporates a motion control module that prioritizes action-related text while maintaining subject consistency, along with a dataset, Human-Motion, which utilizes large language models to generate detailed motion descriptions. For simplify user control during inference, we parameterize motion intensity through a single coefficient, allowing for easy adjustments. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of MotionCharacter, demonstrating significant improvements in ID-preserving, high-quality video generation.

- **Summary**: Multispectral object detection, utilizing RGB and TIR (thermal infrared) modalities, is widely recognized as a challenging task. It requires not only the effective extraction of features from both modalities and robust fusion strategies, but also the ability to address issues such as spectral discrepancies, spatial misalignment, and environmental dependencies between RGB and TIR images. These challenges significantly hinder the generalization of multispectral detection systems across diverse scenarios. Although numerous studies have attempted to overcome these limitations, it remains difficult to clearly distinguish the performance gains of multispectral detection systems from the impact of these "optimization techniques". Worse still, despite the rapid emergence of high-performing single-modality detection models, there is still a lack of specialized training techniques that can effectively adapt these models for multispectral detection tasks. The absence of a standardized benchmark with fair and consistent experimental setups also poses a significant barrier to evaluating the effectiveness of new approaches. To this end, we propose the first fair and reproducible benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the training "techniques", which systematically classifies existing multispectral object detection methods, investigates their sensitivity to hyper-parameters, and standardizes the core configurations. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted across multiple representative multispectral object detection datasets, utilizing various backbone networks and detection frameworks. Additionally, we introduce an efficient and easily deployable multispectral object detection framework that can seamlessly optimize high-performing single-modality models into dual-modality models, integrating our advanced training techniques.

- **Summary**: Unthinking execution of human instructions in robotic manipulation can lead to severe safety risks, such as poisonings, fires, and even explosions. In this paper, we present responsible robotic manipulation, which requires robots to consider potential hazards in the real-world environment while completing instructions and performing complex operations safely and efficiently. However, such scenarios in real world are variable and risky for training. To address this challenge, we propose Safety-as-policy, which includes (i) a world model to automatically generate scenarios containing safety risks and conduct virtual interactions, and (ii) a mental model to infer consequences with reflections and gradually develop the cognition of safety, allowing robots to accomplish tasks while avoiding dangers. Additionally, we create the SafeBox synthetic dataset, which includes one hundred responsible robotic manipulation tasks with different safety risk scenarios and instructions, effectively reducing the risks associated with real-world experiments. Experiments demonstrate that Safety-as-policy can avoid risks and efficiently complete tasks in both synthetic dataset and real-world experiments, significantly outperforming baseline methods. Our SafeBox dataset shows consistent evaluation results with real-world scenarios, serving as a safe and effective benchmark for future research.

- **Summary**: In the radiation therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), clinicians typically delineate the gross tumor volume (GTV) using non-contrast planning computed tomography to ensure accurate radiation dose delivery. However, the low contrast between tumors and adjacent normal tissues necessitates that radiation oncologists manually delineate the tumors, often relying on diagnostic MRI for guidance. % In this study, we propose a novel approach to directly segment NPC gross tumors on non-contrast planning CT images, circumventing potential registration errors when aligning MRI or MRI-derived tumor masks to planning CT. To address the low contrast issues between tumors and adjacent normal structures in planning CT, we introduce a 3D Semantic Asymmetry Tumor segmentation (SATs) method. Specifically, we posit that a healthy nasopharyngeal region is characteristically bilaterally symmetric, whereas the emergence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma disrupts this symmetry. Then, we propose a Siamese contrastive learning segmentation framework that minimizes the voxel-wise distance between original and flipped areas without tumor and encourages a larger distance between original and flipped areas with tumor. Thus, our approach enhances the sensitivity of features to semantic asymmetries. % Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SATs achieves the leading NPC GTV segmentation performance in both internal and external testing, \emph{e.g.}, with at least 2\% absolute Dice score improvement and 12\% average distance error reduction when compared to other state-of-the-art methods in the external testing.

- **Summary**: Face swapping aims to generate results that combine the identity from the source with attributes from the target. Existing methods primarily focus on image-based face swapping. When processing videos, each frame is handled independently, making it difficult to ensure temporal stability. From a model perspective, face swapping is gradually shifting from generative adversarial networks (GANs) to diffusion models (DMs), as DMs have been shown to possess stronger generative capabilities. Current diffusion-based approaches often employ inpainting techniques, which struggle to preserve fine-grained attributes like lighting and makeup. To address these challenges, we propose a high fidelity video face swapping (HiFiVFS) framework, which leverages the strong generative capability and temporal prior of Stable Video Diffusion (SVD). We build a fine-grained attribute module to extract identity-disentangled and fine-grained attribute features through identity desensitization and adversarial learning. Additionally, We introduce detailed identity injection to further enhance identity similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in video face swapping, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Underwater images are often affected by light refraction and absorption, reducing visibility and interfering with subsequent applications. Existing underwater image enhancement methods primarily focus on improving visual quality while overlooking practical implications. To strike a balance between visual quality and application, we propose a heuristic invertible network for underwater perception enhancement, dubbed HUPE, which enhances visual quality and demonstrates flexibility in handling other downstream tasks. Specifically, we introduced an information-preserving reversible transformation with embedded Fourier transform to establish a bidirectional mapping between underwater images and their clear images. Additionally, a heuristic prior is incorporated into the enhancement process to better capture scene information. To further bridge the feature gap between vision-based enhancement images and application-oriented images, a semantic collaborative learning module is applied in the joint optimization process of the visual enhancement task and the downstream task, which guides the proposed enhancement model to extract more task-oriented semantic features while obtaining visually pleasing images. Extensive experiments, both quantitative and qualitative, demonstrate the superiority of our HUPE over state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Representing the cutting-edge technique of text-to-image models, the latest Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) largely mitigates many generation issues existing in previous models. However, we discover that it still suffers from subject neglect or mixing when the input text prompt contains multiple subjects of similar semantics or appearance. We identify three possible ambiguities within the MMDiT architecture that cause this problem: Inter-block Ambiguity, Text Encoder Ambiguity, and Semantic Ambiguity. To address these issues, we propose to repair the ambiguous latent on-the-fly by test-time optimization at early denoising steps. In detail, we design three loss functions: Block Alignment Loss, Text Encoder Alignment Loss, and Overlap Loss, each tailored to mitigate these ambiguities. Despite significant improvements, we observe that semantic ambiguity persists when generating multiple similar subjects, as the guidance provided by overlap loss is not explicit enough. Therefore, we further propose Overlap Online Detection and Back-to-Start Sampling Strategy to alleviate the problem. Experimental results on a newly constructed challenging dataset of similar subjects validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing superior generation quality and much higher success rates over existing methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/wtybest/EnMMDiT.

- **Summary**: We present InfiniDreamer, a novel framework for arbitrarily long human motion generation. InfiniDreamer addresses the limitations of current motion generation methods, which are typically restricted to short sequences due to the lack of long motion training data. To achieve this, we first generate sub-motions corresponding to each textual description and then assemble them into a coarse, extended sequence using randomly initialized transition segments. We then introduce an optimization-based method called Segment Score Distillation (SSD) to refine the entire long motion sequence. SSD is designed to utilize an existing motion prior, which is trained only on short clips, in a training-free manner. Specifically, SSD iteratively refines overlapping short segments sampled from the coarsely extended long motion sequence, progressively aligning them with the pre-trained motion diffusion prior. This process ensures local coherence within each segment, while the refined transitions between segments maintain global consistency across the entire sequence. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments validate the superiority of our framework, showcasing its ability to generate coherent, contextually aware motion sequences of arbitrary length.

- **Summary**: CT report generation (CTRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports for 3D volumes, relieving clinicians' workload and improving patient care. Despite clinical value, existing works fail to effectively incorporate diagnostic information from multiple anatomical views and lack related clinical expertise essential for accurate and reliable diagnosis. To resolve these limitations, we propose a novel Multi-view perception Knowledge-enhanced Tansformer (MvKeTR) to mimic the diagnostic workflow of clinicians. Just as radiologists first examine CT scans from multiple planes, a Multi-View Perception Aggregator (MVPA) with view-aware attention effectively synthesizes diagnostic information from multiple anatomical views. Then, inspired by how radiologists further refer to relevant clinical records to guide diagnostic decision-making, a Cross-Modal Knowledge Enhancer (CMKE) retrieves the most similar reports based on the query volume to incorporate domain knowledge into the diagnosis procedure. Furthermore, instead of traditional MLPs, we employ Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with learnable nonlinear activation functions as the fundamental building blocks of both modules to better capture intricate diagnostic patterns in CT interpretation. Extensive experiments on the public CTRG-Chest-548K dataset demonstrate that our method outpaces prior state-of-the-art models across all metrics.

- **Summary**: In computer graphics, there is a need to recover easily modifiable representations of 3D geometry and appearance from image data. We introduce a novel method for this task using 3D Gaussian Splatting, which enables intuitive scene editing through mesh adjustments. Starting with input images and camera poses, we reconstruct the underlying geometry using a neural Signed Distance Field and extract a high-quality mesh. Our model then estimates a set of Gaussians, where each component is flat, and the opacity is conditioned on the recovered neural surface. To facilitate editing, we produce a proxy representation that encodes information about the Gaussians' shape and position. Unlike other methods, our pipeline allows modifications applied to the extracted mesh to be propagated to the proxy representation, from which we recover the updated parameters of the Gaussians. This effectively transfers the mesh edits back to the recovered appearance representation. By leveraging mesh-guided transformations, our approach simplifies 3D scene editing and offers improvements over existing methods in terms of usability and visual fidelity of edits.

- **Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promising potential for parameter-efficient scaling across various domains. However, the implementation in computer vision remains limited, and often requires large-scale datasets comprising billions of samples. In this study, we investigate the integration of MoE within computer vision models and explore various MoE configurations on open datasets. When introducing MoE layers in image classification, the best results are obtained for models with a moderate number of activated parameters per sample. However, such improvements gradually vanish when the number of parameters per sample increases.

- **Summary**: Event-based Action Recognition (EAR) possesses the advantages of high-temporal resolution capturing and privacy preservation compared with traditional action recognition. Current leading EAR solutions typically follow two regimes: project unconstructed event streams into dense constructed event frames and adopt powerful frame-specific networks, or employ lightweight point-specific networks to handle sparse unconstructed event points directly. However, such two regimes are blind to a fundamental issue: failing to accommodate the unique dense temporal and sparse spatial properties of asynchronous event data. In this article, we present a synergy-aware framework, i.e., EventCrab, that adeptly integrates the "lighter" frame-specific networks for dense event frames with the "heavier" point-specific networks for sparse event points, balancing accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we establish a joint frame-text-point representation space to bridge distinct event frames and points. In specific, to better exploit the unique spatiotemporal relationships inherent in asynchronous event points, we devise two strategies for the "heavier" point-specific embedding: i) a Spiking-like Context Learner (SCL) that extracts contextualized event points from raw event streams. ii) an Event Point Encoder (EPE) that further explores event-point long spatiotemporal features in a Hilbert-scan way. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate the significant performance of our proposed EventCrab, particularly gaining improvements of 5.17% on SeAct and 7.01% on HARDVS.

- **Summary**: Despite considerable progress in stereo depth estimation, omnidirectional imaging remains underexplored, mainly due to the lack of appropriate data. We introduce Helvipad, a real-world dataset for omnidirectional stereo depth estimation, consisting of 40K frames from video sequences across diverse environments, including crowded indoor and outdoor scenes with diverse lighting conditions. Collected using two 360{\deg} cameras in a top-bottom setup and a LiDAR sensor, the dataset includes accurate depth and disparity labels by projecting 3D point clouds onto equirectangular images. Additionally, we provide an augmented training set with a significantly increased label density by using depth completion. We benchmark leading stereo depth estimation models for both standard and omnidirectional images. The results show that while recent stereo methods perform decently, a significant challenge persists in accurately estimating depth in omnidirectional imaging. To address this, we introduce necessary adaptations to stereo models, achieving improved performance.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF), a novel task focused on generating standardized garment images from single photos of clothed individuals. Unlike traditional Virtual Try-On (VTON), which digitally dresses models, VTOFF aims to extract a canonical garment image, posing unique challenges in capturing garment shape, texture, and intricate patterns. This well-defined target makes VTOFF particularly effective for evaluating reconstruction fidelity in generative models. We present TryOffDiff, a model that adapts Stable Diffusion with SigLIP-based visual conditioning to ensure high fidelity and detail retention. Experiments on a modified VITON-HD dataset show that our approach outperforms baseline methods based on pose transfer and virtual try-on with fewer pre- and post-processing steps. Our analysis reveals that traditional image generation metrics inadequately assess reconstruction quality, prompting us to rely on DISTS for more accurate evaluation. Our results highlight the potential of VTOFF to enhance product imagery in e-commerce applications, advance generative model evaluation, and inspire future work on high-fidelity reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Perception and understanding are two pillars of computer vision. While multimodal large language models (MLLM) have demonstrated remarkable visual understanding capabilities, they arguably lack accurate perception abilities, e.g. the stage-of-the-art model Qwen2-VL only achieves a 43.9 recall rate on the COCO dataset, limiting many tasks requiring the combination of perception and understanding. In this work, we aim to bridge this perception gap from both model designing and data development perspectives. We first introduce ChatRex, an MLLM with a decoupled perception design. Instead of having the LLM directly predict box coordinates, we feed the output boxes from a universal proposal network into the LLM, allowing it to output the corresponding box indices to represent its detection results, turning the regression task into a retrieval-based task that LLM handles more proficiently. From the data perspective, we build a fully automated data engine and construct the Rexverse-2M dataset which possesses multiple granularities to support the joint training of perception and understanding. After standard two-stage training, ChatRex demonstrates strong perception capabilities while preserving multimodal understanding performance. The combination of these two capabilities simultaneously unlocks many attractive applications, demonstrating the complementary roles of both perception and understanding in MLLM.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in imitation learning for 3D robotic manipulation have shown promising results with diffusion-based policies. However, achieving human-level dexterity requires seamless integration of geometric precision and semantic understanding. We present G3Flow, a novel framework that constructs real-time semantic flow, a dynamic, object-centric 3D semantic representation by leveraging foundation models. Our approach uniquely combines 3D generative models for digital twin creation, vision foundation models for semantic feature extraction, and robust pose tracking for continuous semantic flow updates. This integration enables complete semantic understanding even under occlusions while eliminating manual annotation requirements. By incorporating semantic flow into diffusion policies, we demonstrate significant improvements in both terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization. Extensive experiments across five simulation tasks show that G3Flow consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 68.3% and 50.1% average success rates on terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization tasks respectively. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of G3Flow in enhancing real-time dynamic semantic feature understanding for robotic manipulation policies.

- **Summary**: The high computational cost and slow inference time are major obstacles to deploying the video diffusion model (VDM) in practical applications. To overcome this, we introduce a new Video Diffusion Model Compression approach using individual content and motion dynamics preserved pruning and consistency loss. First, we empirically observe that deeper VDM layers are crucial for maintaining the quality of \textbf{motion dynamics} e.g., coherence of the entire video, while shallower layers are more focused on \textbf{individual content} e.g., individual frames. Therefore, we prune redundant blocks from the shallower layers while preserving more of the deeper layers, resulting in a lightweight VDM variant called VDMini. Additionally, we propose an \textbf{Individual Content and Motion Dynamics (ICMD)} Consistency Loss to gain comparable generation performance as larger VDM, i.e., the teacher to VDMini i.e., the student. Particularly, we first use the Individual Content Distillation (ICD) Loss to ensure consistency in the features of each generated frame between the teacher and student models. Next, we introduce a Multi-frame Content Adversarial (MCA) Loss to enhance the motion dynamics across the generated video as a whole. This method significantly accelerates inference time while maintaining high-quality video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our VDMini on two important video generation tasks, Text-to-Video (T2V) and Image-to-Video (I2V), where we respectively achieve an average 2.5 $\times$ and 1.4 $\times$ speed up for the I2V method SF-V and the T2V method T2V-Turbo-v2, while maintaining the quality of the generated videos on two benchmarks, i.e., UCF101 and VBench.

- **Summary**: Tracking the full body motions of users in XR (AR/VR) devices is a fundamental challenge to bring a sense of authentic social presence. Due to the absence of dedicated leg sensors, currently available body tracking methods adopt a synthesis approach to generate plausible motions given a 3-point signal from the head and controller tracking. In order to enable mixed reality features, modern XR devices are capable of estimating depth information of the headset surroundings using available sensors combined with dedicated machine learning models. Such egocentric depth sensing cannot drive the body directly, as it is not registered and is incomplete due to limited field-of-view and body self-occlusions. For the first time, we propose to leverage the available depth sensing signal combined with self-supervision to learn a multi-modal pose estimation model capable of tracking full body motions in real time on XR devices. We demonstrate how current 3-point motion synthesis models can be extended to point cloud modalities using a semantic point cloud encoder network combined with a residual network for multi-modal pose estimation. These modules are trained jointly in a self-supervised way, leveraging a combination of real unregistered point clouds and simulated data obtained from motion capture. We compare our approach against several state-of-the-art systems for XR body tracking and show that our method accurately tracks a diverse range of body motions. XR-MBT tracks legs in XR for the first time, whereas traditional synthesis approaches based on partial body tracking are blind.



### Federated Learning with Uncertainty and Personalization via Efficient Second-order Optimization

- **Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising method to collaboratively learn from decentralized and heterogeneous data available at different clients without the requirement of data ever leaving the clients. Recent works on FL have advocated taking a Bayesian approach to FL as it offers a principled way to account for the model and predictive uncertainty by learning a posterior distribution for the client and/or server models. Moreover, Bayesian FL also naturally enables personalization in FL to handle data heterogeneity across the different clients by having each client learn its own distinct personalized model. In particular, the hierarchical Bayesian approach enables all the clients to learn their personalized models while also taking into account the commonalities via a prior distribution provided by the server. However, despite their promise, Bayesian approaches for FL can be computationally expensive and can have high communication costs as well because of the requirement of computing and sending the posterior distributions. We present a novel Bayesian FL method using an efficient second-order optimization approach, with a computational cost that is similar to first-order optimization methods like Adam, but also provides the various benefits of the Bayesian approach for FL (e.g., uncertainty, personalization), while also being significantly more efficient and accurate than SOTA Bayesian FL methods (both for standard as well as personalized FL settings). Our method achieves improved predictive accuracies as well as better uncertainty estimates as compared to the baselines which include both optimization based as well as Bayesian FL methods.

- **Summary**: We present a novel class of Convolutional Neural Networks called Pre-defined Filter Convolutional Neural Networks (PFCNNs), where all nxn convolution kernels with n>1 are pre-defined and constant during training. It involves a special form of depthwise convolution operation called a Pre-defined Filter Module (PFM). In the channel-wise convolution part, the 1xnxn kernels are drawn from a fixed pool of only a few (16) different pre-defined kernels. In the 1x1 convolution part linear combinations of the pre-defined filter outputs are learned. Despite this harsh restriction, complex and discriminative features are learned. These findings provide a novel perspective on the way how information is processed within deep CNNs. We discuss various properties of PFCNNs and prove their effectiveness using the popular datasets Caltech101, CIFAR10, CUB-200-2011, FGVC-Aircraft, Flowers102, and Stanford Cars. Our implementation of PFCNNs is provided on Github https://github.com/Criscraft/PredefinedFilterNetworks

- **Summary**: Gene expression profiling provides profound insights into molecular mechanisms, but its time-consuming and costly nature often presents significant challenges. In contrast, whole-slide hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histological images are readily accessible and allow for detailed examinations of tissue structure and composition at the microscopic level. Recent advancements have utilized these histological images to predict spatially resolved gene expression profiles. However, state-of-the-art works treat gene expression prediction as a multi-output regression problem, where each gene is learned independently with its own weights, failing to capture the shared dependencies and co-expression patterns between genes. Besides, existing works can only predict gene expression values for genes seen during training, limiting their ability to generalize to new, unseen genes.   To address the above limitations, this paper presents GeneQuery, which aims to solve this gene expression prediction task in a question-answering (QA) manner for better generality and flexibility. Specifically, GeneQuery takes gene-related texts as queries and whole-slide images as contexts and then predicts the queried gene expression values. With such a transformation, GeneQuery can implicitly estimate the gene distribution by introducing the gene random variable. Besides, the proposed GeneQuery consists of two architecture implementations, i.e., spot-aware GeneQuery for capturing patterns between images and gene-aware GeneQuery for capturing patterns between genes. Comprehensive experiments on spatial transcriptomics datasets show that the proposed GeneQuery outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on known and unseen genes. More results also demonstrate that GeneQuery can potentially analyze the tissue structure.

- **Summary**: The rapid development of deep learning provides a significant improvement of salient object detection combining both RGB and thermal images. However, existing deep learning-based models suffer from two major shortcomings. First, the computation and memory demands of Transformer-based models with quadratic complexity are unbearable, especially in handling high-resolution bi-modal feature fusion. Second, even if learning converges to an ideal solution, there remains a frequency gap between the prediction and ground truth. Therefore, we propose a purely fast Fourier transform-based model, namely deep Fourier-embedded network (DFENet), for learning bi-modal information of RGB and thermal images. On one hand, fast Fourier transform efficiently fetches global dependencies with low complexity. Inspired by this, we design modal-coordinated perception attention to fuse the frequency gap between RGB and thermal modalities with multi-dimensional representation enhancement. To obtain reliable detailed information during decoding, we design the frequency-decomposed edge-aware module (FEM) to clarify object edges by deeply decomposing low-level features. Moreover, we equip proposed Fourier residual channel attention block in each decoder layer to prioritize high-frequency information while aligning channel global relationships. On the other hand, we propose co-focus frequency loss (CFL) to steer FEM towards minimizing the frequency gap. CFL dynamically weights hard frequencies during edge frequency reconstruction by cross-referencing the bi-modal edge information in the Fourier domain. This frequency-level refinement of edge features further contributes to the quality of the final pixel-level prediction. Extensive experiments on four bi-modal salient object detection benchmark datasets demonstrate our proposed DFENet outperforms twelve existing state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: Blind all-in-one image restoration models aim to recover a high-quality image from an input degraded with unknown distortions. However, these models require all the possible degradation types to be defined during the training stage while showing limited generalization to unseen degradations, which limits their practical application in complex cases. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective adaptive blind all-in-one restoration (ABAIR) model, which can address multiple degradations, generalizes well to unseen degradations, and efficiently incorporate new degradations by training a small fraction of parameters. First, we train our baseline model on a large dataset of natural images with multiple synthetic degradations, augmented with a segmentation head to estimate per-pixel degradation types, resulting in a powerful backbone able to generalize to a wide range of degradations. Second, we adapt our baseline model to varying image restoration tasks using independent low-rank adapters. Third, we learn to adaptively combine adapters to versatile images via a flexible and lightweight degradation estimator. Our model is both powerful in handling specific distortions and flexible in adapting to complex tasks, it not only outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin on five- and three-task IR setups, but also shows improved generalization to unseen degradations and also composite distortions.

- **Summary**: Tomographic imaging reveals internal structures of 3D objects and is crucial for medical diagnoses. Visualizing the morphology and appearance of non-planar sparse anatomical structures that extend over multiple 2D slices in tomographic volumes is inherently difficult but valuable for decision-making and reporting. Hence, various organ-specific unfolding techniques exist to map their densely sampled 3D surfaces to a distortion-minimized 2D representation. However, there is no versatile framework to flatten complex sparse structures including vascular, duct or bone systems. We deploy a neural field to fit the transformation of the anatomy of interest to a 2D overview image. We further propose distortion regularization strategies and combine geometric with intensity-based loss formulations to also display non-annotated and auxiliary targets. In addition to improved versatility, our unfolding technique outperforms mesh-based baselines for sparse structures w.r.t. peak distortion and our regularization scheme yields smoother transformations compared to Jacobian formulations from neural field-based image registration.

We explore whether this advanced generative model can accurately capture the physical characteristics of galaxies based solely on their images and redshift measurements. Our findings demonstrate that this model not only produces visually realistic galaxy images but also encodes the underlying changes in physical properties with redshift that are the result of galaxy evolution. This approach marks a significant advancement in using generative models to enhance our scientific insight into cosmic phenomena.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in all-in-one image restoration models have revolutionized the ability to address diverse degradations through a unified framework. However, parameters tied to specific tasks often remain inactive for other tasks, making mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures a natural extension. Despite this, MoEs often show inconsistent behavior, with some experts unexpectedly generalizing across tasks while others struggle within their intended scope. This hinders leveraging MoEs' computational benefits by bypassing irrelevant experts during inference. We attribute this undesired behavior to the uniform and rigid architecture of traditional MoEs. To address this, we introduce ``complexity experts" -- flexible expert blocks with varying computational complexity and receptive fields. A key challenge is assigning tasks to each expert, as degradation complexity is unknown in advance. Thus, we execute tasks with a simple bias toward lower complexity. To our surprise, this preference effectively drives task-specific allocation, assigning tasks to experts with the appropriate complexity. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating the ability to bypass irrelevant experts during inference while maintaining superior performance. The proposed MoCE-IR model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, affirming its efficiency and practical applicability.

- **Summary**: Fast progress in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has made 3D Gaussians popular for 3D modeling and image rendering, but this creates big challenges in data storage and transmission. To obtain a highly compact 3DGS representation, we propose a hybrid entropy model for Gaussian Splatting (HEMGS) data compression, which comprises two primary components, a hyperprior network and an autoregressive network. To effectively reduce structural redundancy across attributes, we apply a progressive coding algorithm to generate hyperprior features, in which we use previously compressed attributes and location as prior information. In particular, to better extract the location features from these compressed attributes, we adopt a domain-aware and instance-aware architecture to respectively capture domain-aware structural relations without additional storage costs and reveal scene-specific features through MLPs. Additionally, to reduce redundancy within each attribute, we leverage relationships between neighboring compressed elements within the attributes through an autoregressive network. Given its unique structure, we propose an adaptive context coding algorithm with flexible receptive fields to effectively capture adjacent compressed elements. Overall, we integrate our HEMGS into an end-to-end optimized 3DGS compression framework and the extensive experimental results on four benchmarks indicate that our method achieves about 40\% average reduction in size while maintaining the rendering quality over our baseline method and achieving state-of-the-art compression results.

- **Summary**: Accurately mapping large-scale cropland is crucial for agricultural production management and planning. Currently, the combination of remote sensing data and deep learning techniques has shown outstanding performance in cropland mapping. However, those approaches require massive precise labels, which are labor-intensive. To reduce the label cost, this study presented a weakly supervised framework considering multi-temporal information for large-scale cropland mapping. Specifically, we extract high-quality labels according to their consistency among global land cover (GLC) products to construct the supervised learning signal. On the one hand, to alleviate the overfitting problem caused by the model's over-trust of remaining errors in high-quality labels, we encode the similarity/aggregation of cropland in the visual/spatial domain to construct the unsupervised learning signal, and take it as the regularization term to constrain the supervised part. On the other hand, to sufficiently leverage the plentiful information in the samples without high-quality labels, we also incorporate the unsupervised learning signal in these samples, enriching the diversity of the feature space. After that, to capture the phenological features of croplands, we introduce dense satellite image time series (SITS) to extend the proposed framework in the temporal dimension. We also visualized the high dimensional phenological features to uncover how multi-temporal information benefits cropland extraction, and assessed the method's robustness under conditions of data scarcity. The proposed framework has been experimentally validated for strong adaptability across three study areas (Hunan Province, Southeast France, and Kansas) in large-scale cropland mapping, and the internal mechanism and temporal generalizability are also investigated.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a preliminary study of an efficient object tracking approach, comparing the performance of two different 3D point cloud sensory sources: LiDAR and stereo cameras, which have significant price differences. In this preliminary work, we focus on single object tracking. We first developed a fast heuristic object detector that utilizes prior information about the environment and target. The resulting target points are subsequently fed into an extended object tracking framework, where the target shape is parameterized using a star-convex hypersurface model. Experimental results show that our object tracking method using a stereo camera achieves performance similar to that of a LiDAR sensor, with a cost difference of more than tenfold.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in visual understanding and generation tasks. However, generating interleaved image-text content remains a challenge, which requires integrated multimodal understanding and generation abilities. While the progress in unified models offers new solutions, existing benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating these methods due to data size and diversity limitations. To bridge this gap, we introduce GATE OpenING (OpenING), a comprehensive benchmark comprising 5,400 high-quality human-annotated instances across 56 real-world tasks. OpenING covers diverse daily scenarios such as travel guide, design, and brainstorming, offering a robust platform for challenging interleaved generation methods. In addition, we present IntJudge, a judge model for evaluating open-ended multimodal generation methods. Trained with a novel data pipeline, our IntJudge achieves an agreement rate of 82. 42% with human judgments, outperforming GPT-based evaluators by 11.34%. Extensive experiments on OpenING reveal that current interleaved generation methods still have substantial room for improvement. Key findings on interleaved image-text generation are further presented to guide the development of next-generation models. The OpenING is open-sourced at https://opening.github.io.

- **Summary**: Precise weed management is essential for sustaining crop productivity and ecological balance. Traditional herbicide applications face economic and environmental challenges, emphasizing the need for intelligent weed control systems powered by deep learning. These systems require vast amounts of high-quality training data. The reality of scarcity of well-annotated training data, however, is often addressed through generating more data using data augmentation. Nevertheless, conventional augmentation techniques such as random flipping, color changes, and blurring lack sufficient fidelity and diversity. This paper investigates a generative AI-based augmentation technique that uses the Stable Diffusion model to produce diverse synthetic images that improve the quantity and quality of training datasets for weed detection models. Moreover, this paper explores the impact of these synthetic images on the performance of real-time detection systems, thus focusing on compact CNN-based models such as YOLO nano for edge devices. The experimental results show substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP50 and mAP50-95) scores for YOLO models trained with generative AI-augmented datasets, demonstrating the promising potential of synthetic data to enhance model robustness and accuracy.

- **Summary**: The patterns on wafer maps play a crucial role in helping engineers identify the causes of production issues during semiconductor manufacturing. In order to reduce costs and improve accuracy, automation technology is essential, and recent developments in deep learning have led to impressive results in wafer map pattern recognition. In this context, inspired by the effectiveness of semi-supervised learning and contrastive learning methods, we introduce an innovative approach that integrates the Mean Teacher framework with the supervised contrastive learning loss for enhanced wafer map pattern recognition. Our methodology not only addresses the nuances of wafer patterns but also tackles challenges arising from limited labeled data. To further refine the process, we address data imbalance in the wafer dataset by employing SMOTE and under-sampling techniques. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of our proposed method and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments using real-world dataset WM811K obtained from semiconductor manufacturers. Compared to the baseline method, our method has achieved 5.46%, 6.68%, 5.42%, and 4.53% improvements in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score, respectively.

- **Summary**: Visual Language Navigation is a task that challenges robots to navigate in realistic environments based on natural language instructions. While previous research has largely focused on static settings, real-world navigation must often contend with dynamic human obstacles. Hence, we propose an extension to the task, termed Adaptive Visual Language Navigation (AdaVLN), which seeks to narrow this gap. AdaVLN requires robots to navigate complex 3D indoor environments populated with dynamically moving human obstacles, adding a layer of complexity to navigation tasks that mimic the real-world. To support exploration of this task, we also present AdaVLN simulator and AdaR2R datasets. The AdaVLN simulator enables easy inclusion of fully animated human models directly into common datasets like Matterport3D. We also introduce a "freeze-time" mechanism for both the navigation task and simulator, which pauses world state updates during agent inference, enabling fair comparisons and experimental reproducibility across different hardware. We evaluate several baseline models on this task, analyze the unique challenges introduced by AdaVLN, and demonstrate its potential to bridge the sim-to-real gap in VLN research.

- **Summary**: We present PhyCAGE, the first approach for physically plausible compositional 3D asset generation from a single image. Given an input image, we first generate consistent multi-view images for components of the assets. These images are then fitted with 3D Gaussian Splatting representations. To ensure that the Gaussians representing objects are physically compatible with each other, we introduce a Physical Simulation-Enhanced Score Distillation Sampling (PSE-SDS) technique to further optimize the positions of the Gaussians. It is achieved by setting the gradient of the SDS loss as the initial velocity of the physical simulation, allowing the simulator to act as a physics-guided optimizer that progressively corrects the Gaussians' positions to a physically compatible state. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate physically plausible compositional 3D assets given a single image.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models are proficient at generating high-quality images. They are however effective only when operating at the resolution used during training. Inference at a scaled resolution leads to repetitive patterns and structural distortions. Retraining at higher resolutions quickly becomes prohibitive. Thus, methods enabling pre-existing diffusion models to operate at flexible test-time resolutions are highly desirable. Previous works suffer from frequent artifacts and often introduce large latency overheads. We propose two simple modules that combine to solve these issues. We introduce a Frequency Modulation (FM) module that leverages the Fourier domain to improve the global structure consistency, and an Attention Modulation (AM) module which improves the consistency of local texture patterns, a problem largely ignored in prior works. Our method, coined Fam diffusion, can seamlessly integrate into any latent diffusion model and requires no additional training. Extensive qualitative results highlight the effectiveness of our method in addressing structural and local artifacts, while quantitative results show state-of-the-art performance. Also, our method avoids redundant inference tricks for improved consistency such as patch-based or progressive generation, leading to negligible latency overheads.

- **Summary**: Dexterous manipulation with contact-rich interactions is crucial for advanced robotics. While recent diffusion-based planning approaches show promise for simpler manipulation tasks, they often produce unrealistic ghost states (e.g., the object automatically moves without hand contact) or lack adaptability when handling complex sequential interactions. In this work, we introduce DexDiffuser, an interaction-aware diffusion planning framework for adaptive dexterous manipulation. DexDiffuser models joint state-action dynamics through a dual-phase diffusion process which consists of pre-interaction contact alignment and post-contact goal-directed control, enabling goal-adaptive generalizable dexterous manipulation. Additionally, we incorporate dynamics model-based dual guidance and leverage large language models for automated guidance function generation, enhancing generalizability for physical interactions and facilitating diverse goal adaptation through language cues. Experiments on physical interaction tasks such as door opening, pen and block re-orientation, and hammer striking demonstrate DexDiffuser's effectiveness on goals outside training distributions, achieving over twice the average success rate (59.2% vs. 29.5%) compared to existing methods. Our framework achieves 70.0% success on 30-degree door opening, 40.0% and 36.7% on pen and block half-side re-orientation respectively, and 46.7% on hammer nail half drive, highlighting its robustness and flexibility in contact-rich manipulation.

- **Summary**: Face manipulation detection has been receiving a lot of attention for the reliability and security of the face images/videos. Recent studies focus on using auxiliary information or prior knowledge to capture robust manipulation traces, which are shown to be promising. As one of the important face features, the face depth map, which has shown to be effective in other areas such as face recognition or face detection, is unfortunately paid little attention to in literature for face manipulation detection. In this paper, we explore the possibility of incorporating the face depth map as auxiliary information for robust face manipulation detection. To this end, we first propose a Face Depth Map Transformer (FDMT) to estimate the face depth map patch by patch from an RGB face image, which is able to capture the local depth anomaly created due to manipulation. The estimated face depth map is then considered as auxiliary information to be integrated with the backbone features using a Multi-head Depth Attention (MDA) mechanism that is newly designed. We also propose an RGB-Depth Inconsistency Attention (RDIA) module to effectively capture the inter-frame inconsistency for multi-frame input. Various experiments demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method for face manipulation detection.

- **Summary**: While vision transformers show promise in numerous image restoration (IR) tasks, the challenge remains in efficiently generalizing and scaling up a model for multiple IR tasks. To strike a balance between efficiency and model capacity for a generalized transformer-based IR method, we propose a hierarchical information flow mechanism for image restoration, dubbed Hi-IR, which progressively propagates information among pixels in a bottom-up manner. Hi-IR constructs a hierarchical information tree representing the degraded image across three levels. Each level encapsulates different types of information, with higher levels encompassing broader objects and concepts and lower levels focusing on local details. Moreover, the hierarchical tree architecture removes long-range self-attention, improves the computational efficiency and memory utilization, thus preparing it for effective model scaling. Based on that, we explore model scaling to improve our method's capabilities, which is expected to positively impact IR in large-scale training settings. Extensive experimental results show that Hi-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance in seven common image restoration tasks, affirming its effectiveness and generalizability.

- **Summary**: The search for evidence of past life on Mars presents a tremendous challenge that requires the usage of very advanced robotic technologies to overcome it. Current digital microscopic imagers and spectrometers used for astrobiological examination suffer from limitations such as insufficient resolution, narrow detection range, and lack of portability. To overcome these challenges, this research study presents modifications to the Phoenix rover to expand its capability for detecting biosignatures on Mars. This paper examines the modifications implemented on the Phoenix rover to enhance its capability to detect a broader spectrum of biosignatures. One of the notable improvements comprises the integration of advanced digital microscopic imagers and spectrometers, enabling high-resolution examination of soil samples. Additionally, the mechanical components of the device have been reinforced to enhance maneuverability and optimize subsurface sampling capabilities. Empirical investigations have demonstrated that Phoenix has the capability to navigate diverse geological environments and procure samples for the purpose of biomolecular analysis. The biomolecular instrumentation and hybrid analytical methods showcased in this study demonstrate considerable potential for future astrobiology missions on Mars. The potential for enhancing the system lies in the possibility of broadening the range of detectable biomarkers and biosignatures.

- **Summary**: We introduce a structured light system that captures full-frame depth at rates of a thousand frames per second, four times faster than the previous state of the art. Our key innovation to this end is the design of an acousto-optic light scanning device that can scan light planes at rates up to two million planes per second. We combine this device with an event camera for structured light, using the sparse events triggered on the camera as we sweep a light plane on the scene for depth triangulation. In contrast to prior work, where light scanning is the bottleneck towards faster structured light operation, our light scanning device is three orders of magnitude faster than the event camera's full-frame bandwidth, thus allowing us to take full advantage of the event camera's fast operation. To surpass this bandwidth, we additionally demonstrate adaptive scanning of only regions of interest, at speeds an order of magnitude faster than the theoretical full-frame limit for event cameras.

- **Summary**: Purpose: To explore best-practice approaches for generating synthetic chest X-ray images and augmenting medical imaging datasets to optimize the performance of deep learning models in downstream tasks like classification and segmentation. Materials and Methods: We utilized a latent diffusion model to condition the generation of synthetic chest X-rays on text prompts and/or segmentation masks. We explored methods like using a proxy model and using radiologist feedback to improve the quality of synthetic data. These synthetic images were then generated from relevant disease information or geometrically transformed segmentation masks and added to ground truth training set images from the CheXpert, CANDID-PTX, SIIM, and RSNA Pneumonia datasets to measure improvements in classification and segmentation model performance on the test sets. F1 and Dice scores were used to evaluate classification and segmentation respectively. One-tailed t-tests with Bonferroni correction assessed the statistical significance of performance improvements with synthetic data. Results: Across all experiments, the synthetic data we generated resulted in a maximum mean classification F1 score improvement of 0.150453 (CI: 0.099108-0.201798; P=0.0031) compared to using only real data. For segmentation, the maximum Dice score improvement was 0.14575 (CI: 0.108267-0.183233; P=0.0064). Conclusion: Best practices for generating synthetic chest X-ray images for downstream tasks include conditioning on single-disease labels or geometrically transformed segmentation masks, as well as potentially using proxy modeling for fine-tuning such generations.

CAT4D leverages a multi-view video diffusion model trained on a diverse combination of datasets to enable novel view synthesis at any specified camera poses and timestamps. Combined with a novel sampling approach, this model can transform a single monocular video into a multi-view video, enabling robust 4D reconstruction via optimization of a deformable 3D Gaussian representation. We demonstrate competitive performance on novel view synthesis and dynamic scene reconstruction benchmarks, and highlight the creative capabilities for 4D scene generation from real or generated videos.

- **Summary**: Advancing towards generalist agents necessitates the concurrent processing of multiple tasks using a unified model, thereby underscoring the growing significance of simultaneous model training on multiple downstream tasks. A common issue in multi-task learning is the occurrence of gradient conflict, which leads to potential competition among different tasks during joint training. This competition often results in improvements in one task at the expense of deterioration in another. Although several optimization methods have been developed to address this issue by manipulating task gradients for better task balancing, they cannot decrease the incidence of gradient conflict. In this paper, we systematically investigate the occurrence of gradient conflict across different methods and propose a strategy to reduce such conflicts through sparse training (ST), wherein only a portion of the model's parameters are updated during training while keeping the rest unchanged. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ST effectively mitigates conflicting gradients and leads to superior performance. Furthermore, ST can be easily integrated with gradient manipulation techniques, thus enhancing their effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models produce impressive results but are frustrating tools for artists who desire fine-grained control. For example, a common use case is to create images of a specific instance in novel contexts, i.e., "identity-preserving generation". This setting, along with many other tasks (e.g., relighting), is a natural fit for image+text-conditional generative models. However, there is insufficient high-quality paired data to train such a model directly. We propose Diffusion Self-Distillation, a method for using a pre-trained text-to-image model to generate its own dataset for text-conditioned image-to-image tasks. We first leverage a text-to-image diffusion model's in-context generation ability to create grids of images and curate a large paired dataset with the help of a Visual-Language Model. We then fine-tune the text-to-image model into a text+image-to-image model using the curated paired dataset. We demonstrate that Diffusion Self-Distillation outperforms existing zero-shot methods and is competitive with per-instance tuning techniques on a wide range of identity-preservation generation tasks, without requiring test-time optimization.

- **Summary**: The recent advancements in auto-regressive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising progress for vision-language tasks. While there exists a variety of studies investigating the processing of linguistic information within large language models, little is currently known about the inner working mechanism of MLLMs and how linguistic and visual information interact within these models. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by examining the information flow between different modalities -- language and vision -- in MLLMs, focusing on visual question answering. Specifically, given an image-question pair as input, we investigate where in the model and how the visual and linguistic information are combined to generate the final prediction. Conducting experiments with a series of models from the LLaVA series, we find that there are two distinct stages in the process of integration of the two modalities. In the lower layers, the model first transfers the more general visual features of the whole image into the representations of (linguistic) question tokens. In the middle layers, it once again transfers visual information about specific objects relevant to the question to the respective token positions of the question. Finally, in the higher layers, the resulting multimodal representation is propagated to the last position of the input sequence for the final prediction. Overall, our findings provide a new and comprehensive perspective on the spatial and functional aspects of image and language processing in the MLLMs, thereby facilitating future research into multimodal information localization and editing.

- **Summary**: In the 21st-century information age, with the development of big data technology, effectively extracting valuable information from massive data has become a key issue. Traditional data mining methods are inadequate when faced with large-scale, high-dimensional and complex data. Especially when labeled data is scarce, their performance is greatly limited. This study optimizes data mining algorithms by introducing semi-supervised learning methods, aiming to improve the algorithm's ability to utilize unlabeled data, thereby achieving more accurate data analysis and pattern recognition under limited labeled data conditions. Specifically, we adopt a self-training method and combine it with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image feature extraction and classification, and continuously improve the model prediction performance through an iterative process. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset. Notable improvements were observed in key performance metrics, including accuracy, recall, and F1 score. Furthermore, the robustness and noise-resistance capabilities of the semi-supervised CNN model were validated through experiments under varying noise levels, confirming its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: 3D geometric information is essential for manipulation tasks, as robots need to perceive the 3D environment, reason about spatial relationships, and interact with intricate spatial configurations. Recent research has increasingly focused on the explicit extraction of 3D features, while still facing challenges such as the lack of large-scale robotic 3D data and the potential loss of spatial geometry. To address these limitations, we propose the Lift3D framework, which progressively enhances 2D foundation models with implicit and explicit 3D robotic representations to construct a robust 3D manipulation policy. Specifically, we first design a task-aware masked autoencoder that masks task-relevant affordance patches and reconstructs depth information, enhancing the 2D foundation model's implicit 3D robotic representation. After self-supervised fine-tuning, we introduce a 2D model-lifting strategy that establishes a positional mapping between the input 3D points and the positional embeddings of the 2D model. Based on the mapping, Lift3D utilizes the 2D foundation model to directly encode point cloud data, leveraging large-scale pretrained knowledge to construct explicit 3D robotic representations while minimizing spatial information loss. In experiments, Lift3D consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across several simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Given a single in-the-wild human photo, it remains a challenging task to reconstruct a high-fidelity 3D human model. Existing methods face difficulties including a) the varying body proportions captured by in-the-wild human images; b) diverse personal belongings within the shot; and c) ambiguities in human postures and inconsistency in human textures. In addition, the scarcity of high-quality human data intensifies the challenge. To address these problems, we propose a Generalizable image-to-3D huMAN reconstruction framework, dubbed GeneMAN, building upon a comprehensive multi-source collection of high-quality human data, including 3D scans, multi-view videos, single photos, and our generated synthetic human data. GeneMAN encompasses three key modules. 1) Without relying on parametric human models (e.g., SMPL), GeneMAN first trains a human-specific text-to-image diffusion model and a view-conditioned diffusion model, serving as GeneMAN 2D human prior and 3D human prior for reconstruction, respectively. 2) With the help of the pretrained human prior models, the Geometry Initialization-&-Sculpting pipeline is leveraged to recover high-quality 3D human geometry given a single image. 3) To achieve high-fidelity 3D human textures, GeneMAN employs the Multi-Space Texture Refinement pipeline, consecutively refining textures in the latent and the pixel spaces. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GeneMAN could generate high-quality 3D human models from a single image input, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods. Notably, GeneMAN could reveal much better generalizability in dealing with in-the-wild images, often yielding high-quality 3D human models in natural poses with common items, regardless of the body proportions in the input images.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction and rendering technique due to its high-quality results and fast training and rendering time. However, pixels covered by the same Gaussian are always shaded in the same color up to a Gaussian falloff scaling factor. Furthermore, the finest geometric detail any individual Gaussian can represent is a simple ellipsoid. These properties of 3DGS greatly limit the expressivity of individual Gaussian primitives. To address these issues, we draw inspiration from texture and alpha mapping in traditional graphics and integrate it with 3DGS. Specifically, we propose a new generalized Gaussian appearance representation that augments each Gaussian with alpha~(A), RGB, or RGBA texture maps to model spatially varying color and opacity across the extent of each Gaussian. As such, each Gaussian can represent a richer set of texture patterns and geometric structures, instead of just a single color and ellipsoid as in naive Gaussian Splatting. Surprisingly, we found that the expressivity of Gaussians can be greatly improved by using alpha-only texture maps, and further augmenting Gaussians with RGB texture maps achieves the highest expressivity. We validate our method on a wide variety of standard benchmark datasets and our own custom captures at both the object and scene levels. We demonstrate image quality improvements over existing methods while using a similar or lower number of Gaussians.
