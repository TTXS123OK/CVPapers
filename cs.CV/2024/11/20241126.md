- **Summary**: Foundation models have the potential to transform the landscape of remote sensing (RS) data analysis by enabling large computer vision models to be pre-trained on vast amounts of remote sensing data. These models can then be fine-tuned with small amounts of labeled training and applied to a variety of applications. Most existing foundation models are designed for high spatial resolution, cloud-free satellite imagery or photos, limiting their applicability in scenarios that require frequent temporal monitoring or broad spectral profiles. As a result, foundation models trained solely on cloud-free images have limited utility for applications that involve atmospheric variables or require atmospheric corrections. We introduce SatVision-TOA, a novel foundation model pre-trained on 14-band MODIS L1B Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) radiance imagery, addressing the need for models pre-trained to handle moderate- and coarse-resolution all-sky remote sensing data. The SatVision-TOA model is pre-trained using a Masked-Image-Modeling (MIM) framework and the SwinV2 architecture, and learns detailed contextual representations through self-supervised learning without the need for labels. It is a 3 billion parameter model that is trained on 100 million images. To our knowledge this is the largest foundation model trained solely on satellite RS imagery. Results show that SatVision-TOA achieves superior performance over baseline methods on downstream tasks such as 3D cloud retrieval. Notably, the model achieves a mean intersection over union (mIOU) of 0.46, a substantial improvement over the baseline mIOU of 0.22. Additionally, the rate of false negative results in the fine-tuning task were reduced by over 50% compared to the baseline. Our work advances pre-trained vision modeling for multispectral RS by learning from a variety of atmospheric and aerosol conditions to improve cloud and land surface monitoring.

- **Summary**: Vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, have shown unprecedented zero-shot performance across a wide range of tasks. Nevertheless, these models may be unreliable under distributional shifts, as their performance is significantly degraded. In this work, we explore how to efficiently leverage class text information to mitigate these distribution drifts encountered by large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) during test-time inference. In particular, we propose to generate pseudo-labels for the test-time samples by exploiting generic class text embeddings as fixed centroids of a label assignment problem, which is efficiently solved with Optimal Transport. Furthermore, the proposed adaptation method (CLIP-OT) integrates a multiple template knowledge distillation approach, which replicates multi-view contrastive learning strategies in unsupervised representation learning but without incurring additional computational complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple popular test-time adaptation benchmarks presenting diverse complexity empirically show the superiority of CLIP-OT, achieving performance gains of up to 7% over recent state-of-the-art methods, yet being computationally and memory efficient.

- **Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a biologically inspired paradigm offering an energy-efficient alternative to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs) for Computer Vision (CV) applications. This paper presents a systematic review of datasets, architectures, learning methods, implementation techniques, and evaluation methodologies used in CV-based object detection tasks using SNNs. Based on an analysis of 151 journal and conference articles, the review codifies: 1) the effectiveness of fully connected, convolutional, and recurrent architectures; 2) the performance of direct unsupervised, direct supervised, and indirect learning methods; and 3) the trade-offs in energy consumption, latency, and memory in neuromorphic hardware implementations. An open-source repository along with detailed examples of Python code and resources for building SNN models, event-based data processing, and SNN simulations are provided. Key challenges in SNN training, hardware integration, and future directions for CV applications are also identified.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Virtual Try-On (VTO) have demonstrated exceptional efficacy in generating realistic images and preserving garment details, largely attributed to the robust generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion backbones. However, the T2I models that underpin these methods have become outdated, thereby limiting the potential for further improvement in VTO. Additionally, current methods face notable challenges in accurately rendering text on garments without distortion and preserving fine-grained details, such as textures and material fidelity. The emergence of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) based T2I models has showcased impressive performance and offers a promising opportunity for advancing VTO. Directly applying existing VTO techniques to transformer-based T2I models is ineffective due to substantial architectural differences, which hinder their ability to fully leverage the models' advanced capabilities for improved text generation. To address these challenges and unlock the full potential of DiT-based T2I models for VTO, we propose TED-VITON, a novel framework that integrates a Garment Semantic (GS) Adapter for enhancing garment-specific features, a Text Preservation Loss to ensure accurate and distortion-free text rendering, and a constraint mechanism to generate prompts by optimizing Large Language Model (LLM). These innovations enable state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in visual quality and text fidelity, establishing a new benchmark for VTO task.

- **Summary**: The classification of road signs by autonomous systems, especially those reliant on visual inputs, is highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. Traditional approaches to mitigating such vulnerabilities have focused on enhancing the robustness of classification models. In contrast, this paper adopts a fundamentally different strategy aimed at increasing robustness through the redesign of road signs themselves. We propose an attacker-agnostic learning scheme to automatically design road signs that are robust to a wide array of patch-based attacks. Empirical tests conducted in both digital and physical environments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces vulnerability to patch attacks, outperforming existing techniques.

- **Comment**: The 2nd Place and Innovation Award Solution of Predictive World Model
  at the CVPR 2024 Autonomous Grand Challenge
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: This technical report summarizes the second-place solution for the Predictive World Model Challenge held at the CVPR-2024 Workshop on Foundation Models for Autonomous Systems. We introduce D$^2$-World, a novel World model that effectively forecasts future point clouds through Decoupled Dynamic flow. Specifically, the past semantic occupancies are obtained via existing occupancy networks (e.g., BEVDet). Following this, the occupancy results serve as the input for a single-stage world model, generating future occupancy in a non-autoregressive manner. To further simplify the task, dynamic voxel decoupling is performed in the world model. The model generates future dynamic voxels by warping the existing observations through voxel flow, while remaining static voxels can be easily obtained through pose transformation. As a result, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenScene Predictive World Model benchmark, securing second place, and trains more than 300% faster than the baseline model. Code is available at https://github.com/zhanghm1995/D2-World.

- **Summary**: We introduce Generalizable 3D-Language Feature Fields (g3D-LF), a 3D representation model pre-trained on large-scale 3D-language dataset for embodied tasks. Our g3D-LF processes posed RGB-D images from agents to encode feature fields for: 1) Novel view representation predictions from any position in the 3D scene; 2) Generations of BEV maps centered on the agent; 3) Querying targets using multi-granularity language within the above-mentioned representations. Our representation can be generalized to unseen environments, enabling real-time construction and dynamic updates. By volume rendering latent features along sampled rays and integrating semantic and spatial relationships through multiscale encoders, our g3D-LF produces representations at different scales and perspectives, aligned with multi-granularity language, via multi-level contrastive learning. Furthermore, we prepare a large-scale 3D-language dataset to align the representations of the feature fields with language. Extensive experiments on Vision-and-Language Navigation under both Panorama and Monocular settings, Zero-shot Object Navigation, and Situated Question Answering tasks highlight the significant advantages and effectiveness of our g3D-LF for embodied tasks.

Furthermore, this survey addresses the challenges of multimodal data integration - including alignment issues, noise resilience, and disparities in feature representation - while focusing on applications in domains like social media analysis, medical imaging, and emotion recognition. The insights provided are intended to guide future research towards optimizing multimodal learning systems to enhance their scalability, robustness, and generalizability across various applications.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generative tasks like text-to-image (T2I) and text-to-video (T2V) synthesis. However, achieving accurate text alignment in T2V generation remains challenging due to the complex temporal dependency across frames. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches to enhance text alignment often require differentiable reward functions or are constrained to limited prompts, hindering their scalability and applicability. In this paper, we propose Free$^2$Guide, a novel gradient-free framework for aligning generated videos with text prompts without requiring additional model training. Leveraging principles from path integral control, Free$^2$Guide approximates guidance for diffusion models using non-differentiable reward functions, thereby enabling the integration of powerful black-box Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) as reward model. Additionally, our framework supports the flexible ensembling of multiple reward models, including large-scale image-based models, to synergistically enhance alignment without incurring substantial computational overhead. We demonstrate that Free$^2$Guide significantly improves text alignment across various dimensions and enhances the overall quality of generated videos.

- **Summary**: Existing 4D Gaussian methods for dynamic scene reconstruction offer high visual fidelity and fast rendering. However, these methods suffer from excessive memory and storage demands, which limits their practical deployment. This paper proposes a 4D anchor-based framework that retains visual quality and rendering speed of 4D Gaussians while significantly reducing storage costs. Our method extends 3D scaffolding to 4D space, and leverages sparse 4D grid-aligned anchors with compressed feature vectors. Each anchor models a set of neural 4D Gaussians, each of which represent a local spatiotemporal region. In addition, we introduce a temporal coverage-aware anchor growing strategy to effectively assign additional anchors to under-reconstructed dynamic regions. Our method adjusts the accumulated gradients based on Gaussians' temporal coverage, improving reconstruction quality in dynamic regions. To reduce the number of anchors, we further present enhanced formulations of neural 4D Gaussians. These include the neural velocity, and the temporal opacity derived from a generalized Gaussian distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art visual quality and 97.8% storage reduction over 4DGS.

- **Summary**: Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) is an advanced technique that enables knowledge transfer from a teacher model to a student model without relying on original training data. While DFKD methods have achieved success on smaller datasets like CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, they encounter challenges on larger, high-resolution datasets such as ImageNet. A primary issue with previous approaches is their generation of synthetic images at high resolutions (e.g., $224 \times 224$) without leveraging information from real images, often resulting in noisy images that lack essential class-specific features in large datasets. Additionally, the computational cost of generating the extensive data needed for effective knowledge transfer can be prohibitive. In this paper, we introduce MUlti-reSolution data-freE (MUSE) to address these limitations. MUSE generates images at lower resolutions while using Class Activation Maps (CAMs) to ensure that the generated images retain critical, class-specific features. To further enhance model diversity, we propose multi-resolution generation and embedding diversity techniques that strengthen latent space representations, leading to significant performance improvements. Experimental results demonstrate that MUSE achieves state-of-the-art performance across both small- and large-scale datasets, with notable performance gains of up to two digits in nearly all ImageNet and subset experiments.

- **Summary**: The current text-to-video (T2V) generation has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic general videos, but it is still under-explored in identity-specific human video generation with customized ID images. The key challenge lies in maintaining high ID fidelity consistently while preserving the original motion dynamic and semantic following after the identity injection. Current video identity customization methods mainly rely on reconstructing given identity images on text-to-image models, which have a divergent distribution with the T2V model. This process introduces a tuning-inference gap, leading to dynamic and semantic degradation. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework, dubbed \textbf{PersonalVideo}, that applies direct supervision on videos synthesized by the T2V model to bridge the gap. Specifically, we introduce a learnable Isolated Identity Adapter to customize the specific identity non-intrusively, which does not comprise the original T2V model's abilities (e.g., motion dynamic and semantic following). With the non-reconstructive identity loss, we further employ simulated prompt augmentation to reduce overfitting by supervising generated results in more semantic scenarios, gaining good robustness even with only a single reference image available. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in delivering high identity faithfulness while preserving the inherent video generation qualities of the original T2V model, outshining prior approaches. Notably, our PersonalVideo seamlessly integrates with pre-trained SD components, such as ControlNet and style LoRA, requiring no extra tuning overhead.

- **Summary**: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are crucial in automotive, aerospace, maritime and medical applications, but are limited by the complexity, cost and computational requirements of directly calculating the flow, often taking days of compute time. Machine-learning architectures, such as controlled generative adversarial networks (cGANs) hold significant potential in enhancing or replacing CFD investigations, due to cGANs ability to approximate the underlying data distribution of a dataset. Unlike traditional cGAN applications, where the entire image carries information, CFD data contains small regions of highly variant data, immersed in a large context of low variance that is of minimal importance. This renders most existing deep learning techniques that give equal importance to every portion of the data during training, inefficient. To mitigate this, a novel loss function is proposed called Gradient Mean Squared Error (GMSE) which automatically and dynamically identifies the regions of importance on a field-by-field basis, assigning appropriate weights according to the local variance. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed solution, three identical networks were trained; optimised with Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, proposed GMSE loss and a dynamic variant of GMSE (DGMSE). The novel loss function resulted in faster loss convergence, correlating to reduced training time, whilst also displaying an 83.6% reduction in structural similarity error between the generated field and ground truth simulations, a 76.6% higher maximum rate of loss and an increased ability to fool a discriminator network. It is hoped that this loss function will enable accelerated machine learning within computational fluid dynamics.

- **Summary**: The Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved notable success in computer vision, with its variants extensively validated across various downstream tasks, including semantic segmentation. However, designed as general-purpose visual encoders, ViT backbones often overlook the specific needs of task decoders, revealing opportunities to design decoders tailored to efficient semantic segmentation. This paper proposes Strip Cross-Attention (SCASeg), an innovative decoder head explicitly designed for semantic segmentation. Instead of relying on the simple conventional skip connections, we employ lateral connections between the encoder and decoder stages, using encoder features as Queries for the cross-attention modules. Additionally, we introduce a Cross-Layer Block that blends hierarchical feature maps from different encoder and decoder stages to create a unified representation for Keys and Values. To further boost computational efficiency, SCASeg compresses queries and keys into strip-like patterns to optimize memory usage and inference speed over the traditional vanilla cross-attention. Moreover, the Cross-Layer Block incorporates the local perceptual strengths of convolution, enabling SCASeg to capture both global and local context dependencies across multiple layers. This approach facilitates effective feature interaction at different scales, improving the overall performance. Experiments show that the adaptable decoder of SCASeg produces competitive performance across different setups, surpassing leading segmentation architectures on all benchmark datasets, including ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff 164k, and Pascal VOC2012, even under varying computational limitations.

- **Summary**: Despite remarkable progress in multi-modal AI research, there is a salient domain in which modern AI continues to lag considerably behind even human children: the reliable deployment of logical operators. Here, we examine three forms of logical operators: relations, negations, and discrete numbers. We asked human respondents (N=178 in total) to evaluate images generated by a state-of-the-art image-generating AI (DALL-E 3) prompted with these `logical probes', and find that none reliably produce human agreement scores greater than 50\%. The negation probes and numbers (beyond 3) fail most frequently. In a 4th experiment, we assess a `grounded diffusion' pipeline that leverages targeted prompt engineering and structured intermediate representations for greater compositional control, but find its performance is judged even worse than that of DALL-E 3 across prompts. To provide further clarity on potential sources of success and failure in these text-to-image systems, we supplement our 4 core experiments with multiple auxiliary analyses and schematic diagrams, directly quantifying, for example, the relationship between the N-gram frequency of relational prompts and the average match to generated images; the success rates for 3 different prompt modification strategies in the rendering of negation prompts; and the scalar variability / ratio dependence (`approximate numeracy') of prompts involving integers. We conclude by discussing the limitations inherent to `grounded' multimodal learning systems whose grounding relies heavily on vector-based semantics (e.g. DALL-E 3), or under-specified syntactical constraints (e.g. `grounded diffusion'), and propose minimal modifications (inspired by development, based in imagery) that could help to bridge the lingering compositional gap between scale and structure.

- **Summary**: Geometric reconstruction of opaque surfaces from images is a longstanding challenge in computer vision, with renewed interest from volumetric view synthesis algorithms using radiance fields. We leverage the geometry field proposed in recent work for stochastic opaque surfaces, which can then be converted to volume densities. We adapt Gaussian kernels or surfels to splat the geometry field rather than the volume, enabling precise reconstruction of opaque solids. Our first contribution is to derive an efficient and almost exact differentiable rendering algorithm for geometry fields parameterized by Gaussian surfels, while removing current approximations involving Taylor series and no self-attenuation. Next, we address the discontinuous loss landscape when surfels cluster near geometry, showing how to guarantee that the rendered color is a continuous function of the colors of the kernels, irrespective of ordering. Finally, we use latent representations with spherical harmonics encoded reflection vectors rather than spherical harmonics encoded colors to better address specular surfaces. We demonstrate significant improvement in the quality of reconstructed 3D surfaces on widely-used datasets.

- **Summary**: Accurate diagnosis and prognosis assisted by pathology images are essential for cancer treatment selection and planning. Despite the recent trend of adopting deep-learning approaches for analyzing complex pathology images, they fall short as they often overlook the domain-expert understanding of tissue structure and cell composition. In this work, we focus on a challenging Open-ended Pathology VQA (PathVQA-Open) task and propose a novel framework named Path-RAG, which leverages HistoCartography to retrieve relevant domain knowledge from pathology images and significantly improves performance on PathVQA-Open. Admitting the complexity of pathology image analysis, Path-RAG adopts a human-centered AI approach by retrieving domain knowledge using HistoCartography to select the relevant patches from pathology images.

- **Summary**: As Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has proven effective in conditional diffusion model sampling for improved condition alignment, many applications use a negated CFG term to filter out unwanted features from samples. However, simply negating CFG guidance creates an inverted probability distribution, often distorting samples away from the marginal distribution. Inspired by recent advances in conditional diffusion models for inverse problems, here we present a novel method to enhance negative CFG guidance using contrastive loss. Specifically, our guidance term aligns or repels the denoising direction based on the given condition through contrastive loss, achieving a nearly identical guiding direction to traditional CFG for positive guidance while overcoming the limitations of existing negative guidance methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively removes undesirable concepts while maintaining sample quality across diverse scenarios, from simple class conditions to complex and overlapping text prompts.

- **Summary**: Terraced field is a significant engineering practice for soil and water conservation (SWC). Terraced field extraction from remotely sensed imagery is the foundation for monitoring and evaluating SWC. This study is the first to propose a novel dual-modal {\Omega}-like super-resolution Transformer network for intelligent TFVE, offering the following advantages: (1) reducing edge segmentation error from conventional multi-scale downsampling encoder, through fusing original high-resolution features with downsampling features at each step of encoder and leveraging a multi-head attention mechanism; (2) improving the accuracy of TFVE by proposing a {\Omega}-like network structure, which fully integrates rich high-level features from both spectral and terrain data to form cross-scale super-resolution features; (3) validating an optimal fusion scheme for cross-modal and cross-scale (i.e., inconsistent spatial resolution between remotely sensed imagery and DEM) super-resolution feature extraction; (4) mitigating uncertainty between segmentation edge pixels by a coarse-to-fine and spatial topological semantic relationship optimization (STSRO) segmentation strategy; (5) leveraging contour vibration neural network to continuously optimize parameters and iteratively vectorize terraced fields from semantic segmentation results. Moreover, a DMRVD for deep-learning-based TFVE was created for the first time, which covers nine study areas in four provinces of China, with a total coverage area of 22441 square kilometers. To assess the performance of {\Omega}SFormer, classic and SOTA networks were compared. The mIOU of {\Omega}SFormer has improved by 0.165, 0.297 and 0.128 respectively, when compared with best accuracy single-modal remotely sensed imagery, single-modal DEM and dual-modal result.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) models have shown superior performance at the cost of multiple denoising steps. However, even though the denoising step has been reduced to one, they require high computational costs and storage requirements, making it difficult for deployment on hardware devices. To address these issues, we propose a novel post-training quantization approach with adaptive scale in one-step diffusion (OSD) image SR, PassionSR. First, we simplify OSD model to two core components, UNet and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by removing the CLIPEncoder. Secondly, we propose Learnable Boundary Quantizer (LBQ) and Learnable Equivalent Transformation (LET) to optimize the quantization process and manipulate activation distributions for better quantization. Finally, we design a Distributed Quantization Calibration (DQC) strategy that stabilizes the training of quantized parameters for rapid convergence. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PassionSR with 8-bit and 6-bit obtains comparable visual results with full-precision model. Moreover, our PassionSR achieves significant advantages over recent leading low-bit quantization methods for image SR. Our code will be at https://github.com/libozhu03/PassionSR.

- **Summary**: The widespread dissemination of hate speech, harassment, harmful and sexual content, and violence across websites and media platforms presents substantial challenges and provokes widespread concern among different sectors of society. Governments, educators, and parents are often at odds with media platforms about how to regulate, control, and limit the spread of such content. Technologies for detecting and censoring the media contents are a key solution to addressing these challenges. Techniques from natural language processing and computer vision have been used widely to automatically identify and filter out sensitive content such as offensive languages, violence, nudity, and addiction in both text, images, and videos, enabling platforms to enforce content policies at scale. However, existing methods still have limitations in achieving high detection accuracy with fewer false positives and false negatives. Therefore, more sophisticated algorithms for understanding the context of both text and image may open rooms for improvement in content censorship to build a more efficient censorship system. In this paper, we evaluate existing LLM-based content moderation solutions such as OpenAI moderation model and Llama-Guard3 and study their capabilities to detect sensitive contents. Additionally, we explore recent LLMs such as GPT, Gemini, and Llama in identifying inappropriate contents across media outlets. Various textual and visual datasets like X tweets, Amazon reviews, news articles, human photos, cartoons, sketches, and violence videos have been utilized for evaluation and comparison. The results demonstrate that LLMs outperform traditional techniques by achieving higher accuracy and lower false positive and false negative rates. This highlights the potential to integrate LLMs into websites, social media platforms, and video-sharing services for regulatory and content moderation purposes.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have increasingly emphasized grounding and referring capabilities to achieve detailed understanding and flexible user interaction. However, in the realm of visual document understanding, these capabilities lag behind due to the scarcity of fine-grained datasets and comprehensive benchmarks. To fill this gap, we propose the DOcument Grounding and Eferring data engine (DOGE-Engine), which produces two types of high-quality fine-grained document data: multi-granular parsing data for enhancing fundamental text localization and recognition capabilities; and instruction-tuning data to activate MLLM's grounding and referring capabilities during dialogue and reasoning. Additionally, using our engine, we construct DOGE-Bench, which encompasses 7 grounding and referring tasks across 3 document types (chart, poster, PDF document), providing comprehensive evaluations for fine-grained document understanding. Furthermore, leveraging the data generated by our engine, we develop a strong baseline model, DOGE. This pioneering MLLM is capable of accurately referring and grounding texts at multiple granularities within document images. Our code, data, and model will be open-sourced for community development.

- **Summary**: To guide a learner to master the action skills, it is crucial for a coach to 1) reason through the learner's action execution and technical keypoints, and 2) provide detailed, understandable feedback on what is done well and what can be improved. However, existing score-based action assessment methods are still far from this practical scenario. To bridge this gap, we investigate a new task termed Descriptive Action Coaching (DAC) which requires a model to provide detailed commentary on what is done well and what can be improved beyond a quality score from an action execution. To this end, we construct a new dataset named EE4D-DAC. With an LLM-based annotation pipeline, our dataset goes beyond the existing action assessment datasets by providing the hierarchical coaching commentary at both keypoint and instance levels. Furthermore, we propose TechCoach, a new framework that explicitly incorporates keypoint-level reasoning into the DAC process. The central to our method lies in the Context-aware Keypoint Reasoner, which enables TechCoach to learn keypoint-related quality representations by querying visual context under the supervision of keypoint-level coaching commentary. Prompted by the visual context and the keypoint-related quality representations, a unified Keypoint-aware Action Assessor is then employed to provide the overall coaching commentary together with the quality score. Combining all of these, we build a new benchmark for DAC and evaluate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments. Data and code will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: To provide a lightweight and cost-effective solution for the long-wave infrared imaging using a singlet, we develop a camera by integrating a High-Frequency-Enhancing Cycle-GAN neural network into a metalens imaging system. The High-Frequency-Enhancing Cycle-GAN improves the quality of the original metalens images by addressing inherent frequency loss introduced by the metalens. In addition to the bidirectional cyclic generative adversarial network, it incorporates a high-frequency adversarial learning module. This module utilizes wavelet transform to extract high-frequency components, and then establishes a high-frequency feedback loop. It enables the generator to enhance the camera outputs by integrating adversarial feedback from the high-frequency discriminator. This ensures that the generator adheres to the constraints imposed by the high-frequency adversarial loss, thereby effectively recovering the camera's frequency loss. This recovery guarantees high-fidelity image output from the camera, facilitating smooth video production. Our camera is capable of achieving dynamic imaging at 125 frames per second with an End Point Error value of 12.58. We also achieve 0.42 for Fr\'echet Inception Distance, 30.62 for Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, and 0.69 for Structural Similarity in the recorded videos.

- **Summary**: Crack detection plays a pivotal role in the maintenance and safety of infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings, as timely identification of structural damage can prevent accidents and reduce costly repairs. Traditionally, manual inspection has been the norm, but it is labor-intensive, subjective, and hazardous. This paper introduces an advanced approach for crack detection in infrastructure using deep learning, leveraging transfer learning, spatial attention mechanisms, and genetic algorithm(GA) optimization. To address the challenge of the inaccessability of large amount of data, we employ ResNet50 as a pre-trained model, utilizing its strong feature extraction capabilities while reducing the need for extensive training datasets. We enhance the model with a spatial attention layer as well as a customized neural network which architecture was fine-tuned using GA. A comprehensive case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed Attention-ResNet50-GA model, achieving a precision of 0.9967 and an F1 score of 0.9983, outperforming conventional methods. The results highlight the model's ability to accurately detect cracks in various conditions, making it highly suitable for real-world applications where large annotated datasets are scarce.

- **Summary**: Simultaneously using multimodal inputs from multiple sensors to train segmentors is intuitively advantageous but practically challenging. A key challenge is unimodal bias, where multimodal segmentors over rely on certain modalities, causing performance drops when others are missing, common in real world applications. To this end, we develop the first framework for learning robust segmentor that can handle any combinations of visual modalities. Specifically, we first introduce a parallel multimodal learning strategy for learning a strong teacher. The cross-modal and unimodal distillation is then achieved in the multi scale representation space by transferring the feature level knowledge from multimodal to anymodal segmentors, aiming at addressing the unimodal bias and avoiding over-reliance on specific modalities. Moreover, a prediction level modality agnostic semantic distillation is proposed to achieve semantic knowledge transferring for segmentation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world multi-sensor benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance.

- **Summary**: Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) has advanced with recent vision-language models (VLMs), enabling segmentation beyond predefined categories through various learning schemes. Notably, training-free methods offer scalable, easily deployable solutions for handling unseen data, a key goal of OVSS. Yet, a critical issue persists: lack of object-level context consideration when segmenting complex objects in the challenging environment of OVSS based on arbitrary query prompts. This oversight limits models' ability to group semantically consistent elements within object and map them precisely to user-defined arbitrary classes. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that overcomes this limitation by incorporating object-level contextual knowledge within images. Specifically, our model enhances intra-object consistency by distilling spectral-driven features from vision foundation models into the attention mechanism of the visual encoder, enabling semantically coherent components to form a single object mask. Additionally, we refine the text embeddings with zero-shot object presence likelihood to ensure accurate alignment with the specific objects represented in the images. By leveraging object-level contextual knowledge, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalizability across diverse datasets.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the problem of on-road object importance estimation, which utilizes video sequences captured from the driver's perspective as the input. Although this problem is significant for safer and smarter driving systems, the exploration of this problem remains limited. On one hand, publicly-available large-scale datasets are scarce in the community. To address this dilemma, this paper contributes a new large-scale dataset named Traffic Object Importance (TOI). On the other hand, existing methods often only consider either bottom-up feature or single-fold guidance, leading to limitations in handling highly dynamic and diverse traffic scenarios. Different from existing methods, this paper proposes a model that integrates multi-fold top-down guidance with the bottom-up feature. Specifically, three kinds of top-down guidance factors (ie, driver intention, semantic context, and traffic rule) are integrated into our model. These factors are important for object importance estimation, but none of the existing methods simultaneously consider them. To our knowledge, this paper proposes the first on-road object importance estimation model that fuses multi-fold top-down guidance factors with bottom-up feature. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins, achieving 23.1% Average Precision (AP) improvement compared with the recently proposed model (ie, Goal).

- **Summary**: Typical deep neural video compression networks usually follow the hybrid approach of classical video coding that contains two separate modules: motion coding and residual coding. In addition, a symmetric auto-encoder is often used as a normal architecture for both motion and residual coding. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that handles the drawbacks of the two typical above-mentioned architectures, we call it kernel-based motion-free video coding. The advantages of the motion-free approach are twofold: it improves the coding efficiency of the network and significantly reduces computational complexity thanks to eliminating motion estimation, motion compensation, and motion coding which are the most time-consuming engines. In addition, the kernel-based auto-encoder alleviates blur artifacts that usually occur with the conventional symmetric autoencoder. Consequently, it improves the visual quality of the reconstructed frames. Experimental results show the proposed framework outperforms the SOTA deep neural video compression networks on the HEVC-class B dataset and is competitive on the UVG and MCL-JCV datasets. In addition, it generates high-quality reconstructed frames in comparison with conventional motion coding-based symmetric auto-encoder meanwhile its model size is much smaller than that of the motion-based networks around three to four times.

- **Summary**: In autonomous driving, recent advances in lane segment perception provide autonomous vehicles with a comprehensive understanding of driving scenarios. Moreover, incorporating prior information input into such perception model represents an effective approach to ensure the robustness and accuracy. However, utilizing diverse sources of prior information still faces three key challenges: the acquisition of high-quality prior information, alignment between prior and online perception, efficient integration. To address these issues, we investigate prior augmentation from a novel perspective of trajectory priors. In this paper, we initially extract crowdsourcing trajectory data from Argoverse2 motion forecasting dataset and encode trajectory data into rasterized heatmap and vectorized instance tokens, then we incorporate such prior information into the online mapping model through different ways. Besides, with the purpose of mitigating the misalignment between prior and online perception, we design a confidence-based fusion module that takes alignment into account during the fusion process. We conduct extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 dataset. The results indicate that our method's performance significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in face restoration. Yet, their multi-step inference process remains computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Moreover, existing methods often struggle to generate face images that are harmonious, realistic, and consistent with the subject's identity. In this work, we propose OSDFace, a novel one-step diffusion model for face restoration. Specifically, we propose a visual representation embedder (VRE) to better capture prior information and understand the input face. In VRE, low-quality faces are processed by a visual tokenizer and subsequently embedded with a vector-quantized dictionary to generate visual prompts. Additionally, we incorporate a facial identity loss derived from face recognition to further ensure identity consistency. We further employ a generative adversarial network (GAN) as a guidance model to encourage distribution alignment between the restored face and the ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that OSDFace surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics, generating high-fidelity, natural face images with high identity consistency. The code and model will be released at https://github.com/jkwang28/OSDFace.

- **Summary**: Relic landslide, formed over a long period, possess the potential for reactivation, making them a hazardous geological phenomenon. While reliable relic landslide detection benefits the effective monitoring and prevention of landslide disaster, semantic segmentation using high-resolution remote sensing images for relic landslides faces many challenges, including the object visual blur problem, due to the changes of appearance caused by prolonged natural evolution and human activities, and the small-sized dataset problem, due to difficulty in recognizing and labelling the samples. To address these challenges, a semantic segmentation model, termed mask-recovering and interactive-feature-enhancing (MRIFE), is proposed for more efficient feature extraction and separation. Specifically, a contrastive learning and mask reconstruction method with locally significant feature enhancement is proposed to improve the ability to distinguish between the target and background and represent landslide semantic features. Meanwhile, a dual-branch interactive feature enhancement architecture is used to enrich the extracted features and address the issue of visual ambiguity. Self-distillation learning is introduced to leverage the feature diversity both within and between samples for contrastive learning, improving sample utilization, accelerating model convergence, and effectively addressing the problem of the small-sized dataset. The proposed MRIFE is evaluated on a real relic landslide dataset, and experimental results show that it greatly improves the performance of relic landslide detection. For the semantic segmentation task, compared to the baseline, the precision increases from 0.4226 to 0.5347, the mean intersection over union (IoU) increases from 0.6405 to 0.6680, the landslide IoU increases from 0.3381 to 0.3934, and the F1-score increases from 0.5054 to 0.5646.

- **Summary**: 6D object pose estimation is crucial for robotic perception and precise manipulation. Occlusion and incomplete object visibility are common challenges in this task, but existing pose refinement methods often struggle to handle these issues effectively. To tackle this problem, we propose a global motion-guided recurrent flow estimation method called GMFlow for pose estimation. GMFlow overcomes local ambiguities caused by occlusion or missing parts by seeking global explanations. We leverage the object's structural information to extend the motion of visible parts of the rigid body to its invisible regions. Specifically, we capture global contextual information through a linear attention mechanism and guide local motion information to generate global motion estimates. Furthermore, we introduce object shape constraints in the flow iteration process, making flow estimation suitable for pose estimation scenarios. Experiments on the LM-O and YCB-V datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in accuracy while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: Despite the significant advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generative models, users often face a trial-and-error challenge in practical scenarios. This challenge arises from the complexity and uncertainty of tedious steps such as crafting suitable prompts, selecting appropriate models, and configuring specific arguments, making users resort to labor-intensive attempts for desired images. This paper proposes Automatic T2I generation, which aims to automate these tedious steps, allowing users to simply describe their needs in a freestyle chatting way. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce ChatGenBench, a novel benchmark designed for Automatic T2I. It features high-quality paired data with diverse freestyle inputs, enabling comprehensive evaluation of automatic T2I models across all steps.

- **Summary**: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) has emerged as a promising approach in image generation, offering competitive potential and performance comparable to diffusion-based models. However, current AR-based visual generation models require substantial computational resources, limiting their applicability on resource-constrained devices. To address this issue, we conducted analysis and identified significant redundancy in three dimensions of the VAR model: (1) the attention map, (2) the attention outputs when using classifier free guidance, and (3) the data precision. Correspondingly, we proposed efficient attention mechanism and low-bit quantization method to enhance the efficiency of VAR models while maintaining performance. With negligible performance lost (less than 0.056 FID increase), we could achieve 85.2% reduction in attention computation, 50% reduction in overall memory and 1.5x latency reduction. To ensure deployment feasibility, we developed efficient training-free compression techniques and analyze the deployment feasibility and efficiency gain of each technique.

- **Summary**: Many real-world user queries (e.g. "How do to make egg fried rice?") could benefit from systems capable of generating responses with both textual steps with accompanying images, similar to a cookbook. Models designed to generate interleaved text and images face challenges in ensuring consistency within and across these modalities. To address these challenges, we present ISG, a comprehensive evaluation framework for interleaved text-and-image generation. ISG leverages a scene graph structure to capture relationships between text and image blocks, evaluating responses on four levels of granularity: holistic, structural, block-level, and image-specific. This multi-tiered evaluation allows for a nuanced assessment of consistency, coherence, and accuracy, and provides interpretable question-answer feedback. In conjunction with ISG, we introduce a benchmark, ISG-Bench, encompassing 1,150 samples across 8 categories and 21 subcategories. This benchmark dataset includes complex language-vision dependencies and golden answers to evaluate models effectively on vision-centric tasks such as style transfer, a challenging area for current models. Using ISG-Bench, we demonstrate that recent unified vision-language models perform poorly on generating interleaved content. While compositional approaches that combine separate language and image models show a 111% improvement over unified models at the holistic level, their performance remains suboptimal at both block and image levels. To facilitate future work, we develop ISG-Agent, a baseline agent employing a "plan-execute-refine" pipeline to invoke tools, achieving a 122% performance improvement.

- **Summary**: We introduce PhysMotion, a novel framework that leverages principled physics-based simulations to guide intermediate 3D representations generated from a single image and input conditions (e.g., applied force and torque), producing high-quality, physically plausible video generation. By utilizing continuum mechanics-based simulations as a prior knowledge, our approach addresses the limitations of traditional data-driven generative models and result in more consistent physically plausible motions. Our framework begins by reconstructing a feed-forward 3D Gaussian from a single image through geometry optimization. This representation is then time-stepped using a differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) with continuum mechanics-based elastoplasticity models, which provides a strong foundation for realistic dynamics, albeit at a coarse level of detail. To enhance the geometry, appearance and ensure spatiotemporal consistency, we refine the initial simulation using a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model with cross-frame attention, resulting in a physically plausible video that retains intricate details comparable to the input image. We conduct comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations to validate the efficacy of our method.

- **Summary**: We propose SelfSplat, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting model designed to perform pose-free and 3D prior-free generalizable 3D reconstruction from unposed multi-view images. These settings are inherently ill-posed due to the lack of ground-truth data, learned geometric information, and the need to achieve accurate 3D reconstruction without finetuning, making it difficult for conventional methods to achieve high-quality results. Our model addresses these challenges by effectively integrating explicit 3D representations with self-supervised depth and pose estimation techniques, resulting in reciprocal improvements in both pose accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a matching-aware pose estimation network and a depth refinement module to enhance geometry consistency across views, ensuring more accurate and stable 3D reconstructions. To present the performance of our method, we evaluated it on large-scale real-world datasets, including RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. SelfSplat achieves superior results over previous state-of-the-art methods in both appearance and geometry quality, also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization capabilities. Extensive ablation studies and analysis also validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Code and pretrained models are available at https://gynjn.github.io/selfsplat/

- **Summary**: This paper contributes to the "BraTS 2024 Brain MR Image Synthesis Challenge" and presents a conditional Wavelet Diffusion Model (cWDM) for directly solving a paired image-to-image translation task on high-resolution volumes. While deep learning-based brain tumor segmentation models have demonstrated clear clinical utility, they typically require MR scans from various modalities (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR) as input. However, due to time constraints or imaging artifacts, some of these modalities may be missing, hindering the application of well-performing segmentation algorithms in clinical routine. To address this issue, we propose a method that synthesizes one missing modality image conditioned on three available images, enabling the application of downstream segmentation models. We treat this paired image-to-image translation task as a conditional generation problem and solve it by combining a Wavelet Diffusion Model for high-resolution 3D image synthesis with a simple conditioning strategy. This approach allows us to directly apply our model to full-resolution volumes, avoiding artifacts caused by slice- or patch-wise data processing. While this work focuses on a specific application, the presented method can be applied to all kinds of paired image-to-image translation problems, such as CT $\leftrightarrow$ MR and MR $\leftrightarrow$ PET translation, or mask-conditioned anatomically guided image generation.

- **Summary**: Deepfake facial manipulation has garnered significant public attention due to its impacts on enhancing human experiences and posing privacy threats. Despite numerous passive algorithms that have been attempted to thwart malicious Deepfake attacks, they mostly struggle with the generalizability challenge when confronted with hyper-realistic synthetic facial images. To tackle the problem, this paper proposes a proactive Deepfake detection approach by introducing a novel training-free landmark perceptual watermark, LampMark for short. We first analyze the structure-sensitive characteristics of Deepfake manipulations and devise a secure and confidential transformation pipeline from the structural representations, i.e. facial landmarks, to binary landmark perceptual watermarks. Subsequently, we present an end-to-end watermarking framework that imperceptibly and robustly embeds and extracts watermarks concerning the images to be protected. Relying on promising watermark recovery accuracies, Deepfake detection is accomplished by assessing the consistency between the content-matched landmark perceptual watermark and the robustly recovered watermark of the suspect image. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in watermark recovery and Deepfake detection compared to state-of-the-art methods across in-dataset, cross-dataset, and cross-manipulation scenarios.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in image super-resolution (SR) have significantly benefited from the incorporation of Transformer architectures. However, conventional techniques aimed at enlarging the self-attention window to capture broader contexts come with inherent drawbacks, especially the significantly increased computational demands. Moreover, the feature perception within a fixed-size window of existing models restricts the effective receptive fields and the intermediate feature diversity. This study demonstrates that a flexible integration of attention across diverse spatial extents can yield significant performance enhancements. In line with this insight, we introduce Multi-Range Attention Transformer (MAT) tailored for SR tasks. MAT leverages the computational advantages inherent in dilation operation, in conjunction with self-attention mechanism, to facilitate both multi-range attention (MA) and sparse multi-range attention (SMA), enabling efficient capture of both regional and sparse global features. Further coupled with local feature extraction, MAT adeptly capture dependencies across various spatial ranges, improving the diversity and efficacy of its feature representations. We also introduce the MSConvStar module, which augments the model's ability for multi-range representation learning. Comprehensive experiments show that our MAT exhibits superior performance to existing state-of-the-art SR models with remarkable efficiency (~3.3 faster than SRFormer-light).

- **Summary**: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has made great progress in anomaly segmentation tasks due to its impressive generalization ability. However, existing methods that directly apply SAM through prompting often overlook the domain shift issue, where SAM performs well on natural images but struggles in industrial scenarios. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) offers a promising solution, but it may yield suboptimal performance by not adequately addressing the perception challenges during adaptation to anomaly images. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-Perceptinon Tuning (SPT) method, aiming to enhance SAM's perception capability for anomaly segmentation. The SPT method incorporates a self-drafting tuning strategy, which generates an initial coarse draft of the anomaly mask, followed by a refinement process. Additionally, a visual-relation-aware adapter is introduced to improve the perception of discriminative relational information for mask generation. Extensive experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPT method can significantly outperform baseline methods, validating its effectiveness. Models and codes will be available online.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs) has led to the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence generated videos (AIGVs), which highlights the pressing need for effective video quality assessment (VQA) models designed specifically for AIGVs. Current VQA models generally fall short in accurately assessing the perceptual quality of AIGVs due to the presence of unique distortions, such as unrealistic objects, unnatural movements, or inconsistent visual elements. To address this challenge, we first present AIGVQA-DB, a large-scale dataset comprising 36,576 AIGVs generated by 15 advanced text-to-video models using 1,048 diverse prompts. With these AIGVs, a systematic annotation pipeline including scoring and ranking processes is devised, which collects 370k expert ratings to date. Based on AIGVQA-DB, we further introduce AIGV-Assessor, a novel VQA model that leverages spatiotemporal features and LMM frameworks to capture the intricate quality attributes of AIGVs, thereby accurately predicting precise video quality scores and video pair preferences. Through comprehensive experiments on both AIGVQA-DB and existing AIGV databases, AIGV-Assessor demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing existing scoring or evaluation methods in terms of multiple perceptual quality dimensions.

- **Summary**: Subject-driven image inpainting has emerged as a popular task in image editing alongside recent advancements in diffusion models. Previous methods primarily focus on identity preservation but struggle to maintain the editability of inserted objects. In response, this paper introduces DreamMix, a diffusion-based generative model adept at inserting target objects into given scenes at user-specified locations while concurrently enabling arbitrary text-driven modifications to their attributes. In particular, we leverage advanced foundational inpainting models and introduce a disentangled local-global inpainting framework to balance precise local object insertion with effective global visual coherence. Additionally, we propose an Attribute Decoupling Mechanism (ADM) and a Textual Attribute Substitution (TAS) module to improve the diversity and discriminative capability of the text-based attribute guidance, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamMix effectively balances identity preservation and attribute editability across various application scenarios, including object insertion, attribute editing, and small object inpainting.

- **Summary**: Restoring images captured under adverse weather conditions is a fundamental task for many computer vision applications. However, most existing weather restoration approaches are only capable of handling a specific type of degradation, which is often insufficient in real-world scenarios, such as rainy-snowy or rainy-hazy weather. Towards being able to address these situations, we propose a multi-weather Transformer, or MWFormer for short, which is a holistic vision Transformer that aims to solve multiple weather-induced degradations using a single, unified architecture. MWFormer uses hyper-networks and feature-wise linear modulation blocks to restore images degraded by various weather types using the same set of learned parameters. We first employ contrastive learning to train an auxiliary network that extracts content-independent, distortion-aware feature embeddings that efficiently represent predicted weather types, of which more than one may occur. Guided by these weather-informed predictions, the image restoration Transformer adaptively modulates its parameters to conduct both local and global feature processing, in response to multiple possible weather. Moreover, MWFormer allows for a novel way of tuning, during application, to either a single type of weather restoration or to hybrid weather restoration without any retraining, offering greater controllability than existing methods. Our experimental results on multi-weather restoration benchmarks show that MWFormer achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, without requiring much computational cost. Moreover, we demonstrate that our methodology of using hyper-networks can be integrated into various network architectures to further boost their performance.

- **Summary**: Current methods for extracting intrinsic image components, such as reflectance and shading, primarily rely on statistical priors. These methods focus mainly on simple synthetic scenes and isolated objects and struggle to perform well on challenging real-world data. To address this issue, we propose MLI-NeRF, which integrates \textbf{M}ultiple \textbf{L}ight information in \textbf{I}ntrinsic-aware \textbf{Ne}ural \textbf{R}adiance \textbf{F}ields. By leveraging scene information provided by different light source positions complementing the multi-view information, we generate pseudo-label images for reflectance and shading to guide intrinsic image decomposition without the need for ground truth data. Our method introduces straightforward supervision for intrinsic component separation and ensures robustness across diverse scene types. We validate our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we demonstrate its applicability to various image editing tasks.

- **Summary**: The development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enables the evaluation of image quality through natural language descriptions. This advancement allows for more detailed assessments. However, these MLLM-based IQA methods primarily rely on general contextual descriptions, sometimes limiting fine-grained quality assessment. To address this limitation, we introduce a new image quality assessment (IQA) task paradigm, grounding-IQA. This paradigm integrates multimodal referring and grounding with IQA to realize more fine-grained quality perception. Specifically, grounding-IQA comprises two subtasks: grounding-IQA-description (GIQA-DES) and visual question answering (GIQA-VQA). GIQA-DES involves detailed descriptions with precise locations (e.g., bounding boxes), while GIQA-VQA focuses on quality QA for local regions. To realize grounding-IQA, we construct a corresponding dataset, GIQA-160K, through our proposed automated annotation pipeline. Furthermore, we develop a well-designed benchmark, GIQA-Bench. The benchmark comprehensively evaluates the model grounding-IQA performance from three perspectives: description quality, VQA accuracy, and grounding precision. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed task paradigm, dataset, and benchmark facilitate the more fine-grained IQA application. Code: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/Grounding-IQA.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present DM-Calib, a diffusion-based approach for estimating pinhole camera intrinsic parameters from a single input image. Monocular camera calibration is essential for many 3D vision tasks. However, most existing methods depend on handcrafted assumptions or are constrained by limited training data, resulting in poor generalization across diverse real-world images. Recent advancements in stable diffusion models, trained on massive data, have shown the ability to generate high-quality images with varied characteristics. Emerging evidence indicates that these models implicitly capture the relationship between camera focal length and image content. Building on this insight, we explore how to leverage the powerful priors of diffusion models for monocular pinhole camera calibration. Specifically, we introduce a new image-based representation, termed Camera Image, which losslessly encodes the numerical camera intrinsics and integrates seamlessly with the diffusion framework. Using this representation, we reformulate the problem of estimating camera intrinsics as the generation of a dense Camera Image conditioned on an input image. By fine-tuning a stable diffusion model to generate a Camera Image from a single RGB input, we can extract camera intrinsics via a RANSAC operation. We further demonstrate that our monocular calibration method enhances performance across various 3D tasks, including zero-shot metric depth estimation, 3D metrology, pose estimation and sparse-view reconstruction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms baselines and provides broad benefits to 3D vision tasks.

- **Summary**: Sign language translation (SLT) is challenging, as it involves converting sign language videos into natural language. Previous studies have prioritized accuracy over diversity. However, diversity is crucial for handling lexical and syntactic ambiguities in machine translation, suggesting it could similarly benefit SLT. In this work, we propose DiffSLT, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages a diffusion model, enabling diverse translations while preserving sign language semantics. DiffSLT transforms random noise into the target latent representation, conditioned on the visual features of input video. To enhance visual conditioning, we design Guidance Fusion Module, which fully utilizes the multi-level spatiotemporal information of the visual features. We also introduce DiffSLT-P, a DiffSLT variant that conditions on pseudo-glosses and visual features, providing key textual guidance and reducing the modality gap. As a result, DiffSLT and DiffSLT-P significantly improve diversity over previous gloss-free SLT methods and achieve state-of-the-art performance on two SLT datasets, thereby markedly improving translation quality.

- **Summary**: We present Buffer Anytime, a framework for estimation of depth and normal maps (which we call geometric buffers) from video that eliminates the need for paired video--depth and video--normal training data. Instead of relying on large-scale annotated video datasets, we demonstrate high-quality video buffer estimation by leveraging single-image priors with temporal consistency constraints. Our zero-shot training strategy combines state-of-the-art image estimation models based on optical flow smoothness through a hybrid loss function, implemented via a lightweight temporal attention architecture. Applied to leading image models like Depth Anything V2 and Marigold-E2E-FT, our approach significantly improves temporal consistency while maintaining accuracy. Experiments show that our method not only outperforms image-based approaches but also achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art video models trained on large-scale paired video datasets, despite using no such paired video data.

- **Summary**: Accurate detection and tracking of small objects such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorbikes are critical for traffic surveillance systems, which are crucial in improving road safety and decision-making in intelligent transportation systems. However, traditional methods struggle with challenges such as occlusion, low resolution, and dynamic traffic conditions, necessitating innovative approaches to address these limitations. This paper introduces DGNN-YOLO, a novel framework integrating dynamic graph neural networks (DGNN) with YOLO11 to enhance small object detection and tracking in traffic surveillance systems. The framework leverages YOLO11's advanced spatial feature extraction capabilities for precise object detection and incorporates DGNN to model spatial-temporal relationships for robust real-time tracking dynamically. By constructing and updating graph structures, DGNN-YOLO effectively represents objects as nodes and their interactions as edges, ensuring adaptive and accurate tracking in complex and dynamic environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DGNN-YOLO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting and tracking small objects under diverse traffic conditions, achieving the highest precision (0.8382), recall (0.6875), and mAP@0.5:0.95 (0.6476), showcasing its robustness and scalability, particularly in challenging scenarios involving small and occluded objects. This work provides a scalable, real-time traffic surveillance and analysis solution, significantly contributing to intelligent transportation systems.

- **Summary**: Decision-making and planning in autonomous driving critically reflect the safety of the system, making effective planning imperative. Current imitation learning-based planning algorithms often merge historical trajectories with present observations to predict future candidate paths. However, these algorithms typically assess the current and historical plans independently, leading to discontinuities in driving intentions and an accumulation of errors with each step in a discontinuous plan. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces LHPF, an imitation learning planner that integrates historical planning information. Our approach employs a historical intention aggregation module that pools historical planning intentions, which are then combined with a spatial query vector to decode the final planning trajectory. Furthermore, we incorporate a comfort auxiliary task to enhance the human-like quality of the driving behavior. Extensive experiments using both real-world and synthetic data demonstrate that LHPF not only surpasses existing advanced learning-based planners in planning performance but also marks the first instance of a purely learning-based planner outperforming the expert. Additionally, the application of the historical intention aggregation module across various backbones highlights the considerable potential of the proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Facial Expression Recognition has a wide application prospect in social robotics, health care, driver fatigue monitoring, and many other practical scenarios. Automatic recognition of facial expressions has been extensively studied by the Computer Vision research society. But Facial Expression Recognition in real-world is still a challenging task, partially due to the long-tailed distribution of the dataset. Many recent studies use data augmentation for Long-Tailed Recognition tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic augmentation method. By introducing randomness into the encoding of the source data in the latent space of VAE-GAN, new samples are generated. Then, for facial expression recognition in RAF-DB dataset, we use our augmentation method to balance the long-tailed distribution. Our method can be used in not only FER tasks, but also more diverse data-hungry scenarios.

- **Summary**: Detecting and quantifying bone changes in micro-CT scans of rodents is a common task in preclinical drug development studies. However, this task is manual, time-consuming and subject to inter- and intra-observer variability. In 2024, Anonymous Company organized an internal challenge to develop models for automatic bone quantification. We prepared and annotated a high-quality dataset of 3D $\mu$CT bone scans from $83$ mice. The challenge attracted over $80$ AI scientists from around the globe who formed $23$ teams. The participants were tasked with developing a solution to identify the plane where the bone growth happens, which is essential for fully automatic segmentation of trabecular bone. As a result, six computer vision solutions were developed that can accurately identify the location of the growth plate plane. The solutions achieved the mean absolute error of $1.91\pm0.87$ planes from the ground truth on the test set, an accuracy level acceptable for practical use by a radiologist. The annotated 3D scans dataset along with the six solutions and source code, is being made public, providing researchers with opportunities to develop and benchmark their own approaches. The code, trained models, and the data will be shared.

- **Summary**: AIGC images are prevalent across various fields, yet they frequently suffer from quality issues like artifacts and unnatural textures. Specialized models aim to predict defect region heatmaps but face two primary challenges: (1) lack of explainability, failing to provide reasons and analyses for subtle defects, and (2) inability to leverage common sense and logical reasoning, leading to poor generalization. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise better comprehension and reasoning but face their own challenges: (1) difficulty in fine-grained defect localization due to the limitations in capturing tiny details; and (2) constraints in providing pixel-wise outputs necessary for precise heatmap generation. To address these challenges, we propose HEIE: a novel MLLM-Based Hierarchical Explainable image Implausibility Evaluator. We introduce the CoT-Driven Explainable Trinity Evaluator, which integrates heatmaps, scores, and explanation outputs, using CoT to decompose complex tasks into subtasks of increasing difficulty and enhance interpretability. Our Adaptive Hierarchical Implausibility Mapper synergizes low-level image features with high-level mapper tokens from LLMs, enabling precise local-to-global hierarchical heatmap predictions through an uncertainty-based adaptive token approach. Moreover, we propose a new dataset: Expl-AIGI-Eval, designed to facilitate interpretable implausibility evaluation of AIGC images. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance through extensive experiments.

- **Summary**: Aligning the behaviors of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with human preferences is crucial for developing robust and trustworthy AI systems. While recent attempts have employed human experts or powerful auxiliary AI systems to provide more accurate preference feedback, such as determining the preferable responses from MLLMs or directly rewriting hallucination-free responses, extensive resource overhead compromise the scalability of the feedback collection. In this work, we introduce Topic-level Preference Overwriting (TPO), a self-correctional approach that guide the model itself to mitigate its own hallucination at the topic level. Through a deconfounded strategy that replaces each topic within the response with the best or worst alternatives generated by the model itself, TPO creates more contrasting pairwise preference feedback, enhancing the feedback quality without human or proprietary model intervention. Notably, the experimental results demonstrate proposed TPO achieves state-of-the-art performance in trustworthiness, significantly reducing the object hallucinations by 92% and overall hallucinations by 38%. Code, model and data will be released.

- **Summary**: The newly introduced Visual State Space Model (VMamba), which employs \textit{State Space Mechanisms} (SSM) to interpret images as sequences of patches, has shown exceptional performance compared to Vision Transformers (ViT) across various computer vision tasks. However, recent studies have highlighted that deep models are susceptible to adversarial attacks. One common approach is to embed a trigger in the training data to retrain the model, causing it to misclassify data samples into a target class, a phenomenon known as a backdoor attack. In this paper, we first evaluate the robustness of the VMamba model against existing backdoor attacks. Based on this evaluation, we introduce a novel architectural backdoor attack, termed BadScan, designed to deceive the VMamba model. This attack utilizes bit plane slicing to create visually imperceptible backdoored images. During testing, if a trigger is detected by performing XOR operations between the $k^{th}$ bit planes of the modified triggered patches, the traditional 2D selective scan (SS2D) mechanism in the visual state space (VSS) block of VMamba is replaced with our newly designed BadScan block, which incorporates four newly developed scanning patterns. We demonstrate that the BadScan backdoor attack represents a significant threat to visual state space models and remains effective even after complete retraining from scratch. Experimental results on two widely used image classification datasets, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-1K, reveal that while visual state space models generally exhibit robustness against current backdoor attacks, the BadScan attack is particularly effective, achieving a higher Triggered Accuracy Ratio (TAR) in misleading the VMamba model and its variants.

- **Summary**: Majority subspace clustering (SC) algorithms depend on one or more hyperparameters that need to be carefully tuned for the SC algorithms to achieve high clustering performance. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is often performed using grid-search, assuming that some labeled data is available. In some domains, such as medicine, this assumption does not hold true in many cases. One avenue of research focuses on developing SC algorithms that are inherently free of hyperparameters. For hyperparameters-dependent SC algorithms, one approach to label-independent HPO tuning is based on internal clustering quality metrics (if available), whose performance should ideally match that of external (label-dependent) clustering quality metrics. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to label-independent HPO that uses clustering quality metrics, such as accuracy (ACC) or normalized mutual information (NMI), that are computed based on pseudo-labels obtained from the SC algorithm across a predefined grid of hyperparameters. Assuming that ACC (or NMI) is a smooth function of hyperparameter values it is possible to select subintervals of hyperparameters. These subintervals are then iteratively further split into halves or thirds until a relative error criterion is satisfied. In principle, the hyperparameters of any SC algorithm can be tuned using the proposed method. We demonstrate this approach on several single- and multi-view SC algorithms, comparing the achieved performance with their oracle versions across six datasets representing digits, faces and objects. The proposed method typically achieves clustering performance that is 5% to 7% lower than that of the oracle versions. We also make our proposed method interpretable by visualizing subspace bases, which are estimated from the computed clustering partitions. This aids in the initial selection of the hyperparameter search space.

- **Summary**: Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems are known for their poor performance in out-of-distribution datasets. An issue that was addressed in previous works through ensemble learning, answer re-ranking, or artificially growing the training set. In this work, we show for the first time that robust Visual Question Answering is attainable by simply enhancing the training strategy. Our proposed approach, Task Progressive Curriculum Learning (TPCL), breaks the main VQA problem into smaller, easier tasks based on the question type. Then, it progressively trains the model on a (carefully crafted) sequence of tasks. We further support the method by a novel distributional-based difficulty measurer. Our approach is conceptually simple, model-agnostic, and easy to implement. We demonstrate TPCL effectiveness through a comprehensive evaluation on standard datasets. Without either data augmentation or explicit debiasing mechanism, it achieves state-of-the-art on VQA-CP v2, VQA-CP v1 and VQA v2 datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TPCL outperforms the most competitive robust VQA approaches by more than 5% and 7% on VQA-CP v2 and VQA-CP v1; respectively. TPCL also can boost VQA baseline backbone performance by up to 28.5%.

- **Summary**: We present three biometric datasets (iCarB-Face, iCarB-Fingerprint, iCarB-Voice) containing face videos, fingerprint images, and voice samples, collected inside a car from 200 consenting volunteers. The data was acquired using a near-infrared camera, two fingerprint scanners, and two microphones, while the volunteers were seated in the driver's seat of the car. The data collection took place while the car was parked both indoors and outdoors, and different "noises" were added to simulate non-ideal biometric data capture that may be encountered in real-life driver recognition. Although the datasets are specifically tailored to in-vehicle biometric recognition, their utility is not limited to the automotive environment. The iCarB datasets, which are available to the research community, can be used to: (i) evaluate and benchmark face, fingerprint, and voice recognition systems (we provide several evaluation protocols); (ii) create multimodal pseudo-identities, to train/test multimodal fusion algorithms; (iii) create Presentation Attacks from the biometric data, to evaluate Presentation Attack Detection algorithms; (iv) investigate demographic and environmental biases in biometric systems, using the provided metadata. To the best of our knowledge, ours are the largest and most diverse publicly available in-vehicle biometric datasets. Most other datasets contain only one biometric modality (usually face), while our datasets consist of three modalities, all acquired in the same automotive environment. Moreover, iCarB-Fingerprint seems to be the first publicly available in-vehicle fingerprint dataset. Finally, the iCarB datasets boast a rare level of demographic diversity among the 200 data subjects, including a 50/50 gender split, skin colours across the whole Fitzpatrick-scale spectrum, and a wide age range (18-60+). So, these datasets will be valuable for advancing biometrics research.

- **Summary**: The recent success of denoising diffusion models has significantly advanced text-to-image generation. While these large-scale pretrained models show excellent performance in general image synthesis, downstream objectives often require fine-tuning to meet specific criteria such as aesthetics or human preference. Reward gradient-based strategies are promising in this context, yet existing methods are limited to single-reward tasks, restricting their applicability in real-world scenarios that demand adapting to multiple objectives introduced incrementally over time. In this paper, we first define this more realistic and unexplored problem, termed Reward Incremental Learning (RIL), where models are desired to adapt to multiple downstream objectives incrementally. Additionally, while the models adapt to the ever-emerging new objectives, we observe a unique form of catastrophic forgetting in diffusion model fine-tuning, affecting both metric-wise and visual structure-wise image quality. To address this catastrophic forgetting challenge, we propose Reward Incremental Distillation (RID), a method that mitigates forgetting with minimal computational overhead, enabling stable performance across sequential reward tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of RID in achieving consistent, high-quality generation in RIL scenarios. The source code of our work will be publicly available upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Light-matter interactions modify both the intensity and polarization state of light. Changes in polarization, represented by a Mueller matrix, encode detailed scene information. Existing optical ellipsometers capture Mueller-matrix images; however, they are often limited to capturing static scenes due to long acquisition times. Here, we introduce Event Ellipsometer, a method for acquiring a Mueller-matrix video for dynamic scenes. Our imaging system employs fast-rotating quarter-wave plates (QWPs) in front of a light source and an event camera that asynchronously captures intensity changes induced by the rotating QWPs. We develop an ellipsometric-event image formation model, a calibration method, and an ellipsometric-event reconstruction method. We experimentally demonstrate that Event Ellipsometer enables Mueller-matrix video imaging at 30fps, extending ellipsometry to dynamic scenes.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we focus on the task of instruction-based image editing. Previous works like InstructPix2Pix, InstructDiffusion, and SmartEdit have explored end-to-end editing. However, two limitations still remain: First, existing datasets suffer from low resolution, poor background consistency, and overly simplistic instructions. Second, current approaches mainly condition on the text while the rich image information is underexplored, therefore inferior in complex instruction following and maintaining background consistency. Targeting these issues, we first curated the AdvancedEdit dataset using a novel data construction pipeline, formulating a large-scale dataset with high visual quality, complex instructions, and good background consistency. Then, to further inject the rich image information, we introduce a two-stream bridging mechanism utilizing both the textual and visual features reasoned by the powerful Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) to guide the image editing process more precisely. Extensive results demonstrate that our approach, InsightEdit, achieves state-of-the-art performance, excelling in complex instruction following and maintaining high background consistency with the original image.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces MotionLLaMA, a unified framework for motion synthesis and comprehension, along with a novel full-body motion tokenizer called the HoMi Tokenizer. MotionLLaMA is developed based on three core principles. First, it establishes a powerful unified representation space through the HoMi Tokenizer. Using a single codebook, the HoMi Tokenizer in MotionLLaMA achieves reconstruction accuracy comparable to residual vector quantization tokenizers utilizing six codebooks, outperforming all existing single-codebook tokenizers. Second, MotionLLaMA integrates a large language model to tackle various motion-related tasks. This integration bridges various modalities, facilitating both comprehensive and intricate motion synthesis and comprehension. Third, MotionLLaMA introduces the MotionHub dataset, currently the most extensive multimodal, multitask motion dataset, which enables fine-tuning of large language models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MotionLLaMA not only covers the widest range of motion-related tasks but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in motion completion, interaction dual-person text-to-motion, and all comprehension tasks while reaching performance comparable to SOTA in the remaining tasks. The code and MotionHub dataset are publicly available.

- **Summary**: Persistent homology is a widely-used tool in topological data analysis (TDA) for understanding the underlying shape of complex data. By constructing a filtration of simplicial complexes from data points, it captures topological features such as connected components, loops, and voids across multiple scales. These features are encoded in persistence diagrams (PDs), which provide a concise summary of the data's topological structure. However, the non-Hilbert nature of the space of PDs poses challenges for their direct use in machine learning applications. To address this, kernel methods and vectorization techniques have been developed to transform PDs into machine-learning-compatible formats. In this paper, we introduce a new software package designed to streamline the vectorization of PDs, offering an intuitive workflow and advanced functionalities. We demonstrate the necessity of the package through practical examples and provide a detailed discussion on its contributions to applied TDA. Definitions of all vectorization summaries used in the package are included in the appendix.

- **Summary**: Every year, thousands of people suffer from skull damage and require personalized implants to fill the cranial cavity. Unfortunately, the waiting time for reconstruction surgery can extend to several weeks or even months, especially in less developed countries. One factor contributing to the extended waiting period is the intricate process of personalized implant modeling. Currently, the preparation of these implants by experienced biomechanical experts is both costly and time-consuming. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, especially in deep learning, offer promising potential for automating the process. However, deep learning-based cranial reconstruction faces several challenges: (i) the limited size of training datasets, (ii) the high resolution of the volumetric data, and (iii) significant data heterogeneity. In this work, we propose a novel approach to address these challenges by enhancing the reconstruction through learnable symmetry enforcement. We demonstrate that it is possible to train a neural network dedicated to calculating skull symmetry, which can be utilized either as an additional objective function during training or as a post-reconstruction objective during the refinement step. We quantitatively evaluate the proposed method using open SkullBreak and SkullFix datasets, and qualitatively using real clinical cases. The results indicate that the symmetry-preserving reconstruction network achieves considerably better outcomes compared to the baseline (0.94/0.94/1.31 vs 0.84/0.76/2.43 in terms of DSC, bDSC, and HD95). Moreover, the results are comparable to the best-performing methods while requiring significantly fewer computational resources (< 500 vs > 100,000 GPU hours). The proposed method is a considerable contribution to the field of applied artificial intelligence in medicine and is a step toward automatic cranial defect reconstruction in clinical practice.

- **Summary**: Advancing human-robot communication is crucial for autonomous systems operating in dynamic environments, where accurate real-time interpretation of human signals is essential. RoboCup provides a compelling scenario for testing these capabilities, requiring robots to understand referee gestures and whistle with minimal network reliance. Using the NAO robot platform, this study implements a two-stage pipeline for gesture recognition through keypoint extraction and classification, alongside continuous convolutional neural networks (CCNNs) for efficient whistle detection. The proposed approach enhances real-time human-robot interaction in a competitive setting like RoboCup, offering some tools to advance the development of autonomous systems capable of cooperating with humans.

- **Summary**: Multi-view contrastive clustering (MVCC) has gained significant attention for generating consistent clustering structures from multiple views through contrastive learning. However, most existing MVCC methods create cross-views by combining any two views, leading to a high volume of unreliable pairs. Furthermore, these approaches often overlook discrepancies in multi-view representations, resulting in representation degeneration. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel model called Dual-Weighted Contrastive Learning (DWCL) for Multi-View Clustering. Specifically, to reduce the impact of unreliable cross-views, we introduce an innovative Best-Other (B-O) contrastive mechanism that enhances the representation of individual views at a low computational cost. Furthermore, we develop a dual weighting strategy that combines a view quality weight, reflecting the quality of each view, with a view discrepancy weight. This approach effectively mitigates representation degeneration by downplaying cross-views that are both low in quality and high in discrepancy. We theoretically validate the efficiency of the B-O contrastive mechanism and the effectiveness of the dual weighting strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DWCL outperforms previous methods across eight multi-view datasets, showcasing superior performance and robustness in MVCC. Specifically, our method achieves absolute accuracy improvements of 5.4\% and 5.6\% compared to state-of-the-art methods on the Caltech6V7 and MSRCv1 datasets, respectively.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation often faces the challenge of prohibitively expensive annotation costs. While few-shot learning offers a promising solution to alleviate this burden, conventional approaches still rely heavily on pre-training with large volumes of labeled data from known categories. To address this issue, we propose leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pre-trained on over 1 billion masks, thus circumventing the need for extensive domain-specific annotated data. In light of this, we developed SAM-MPA, an innovative SAM-based framework for few-shot medical image segmentation using Mask Propagation-based Auto-prompting. Initially, we employ k-centroid clustering to select the most representative examples for labelling to construct the support set. These annotated examples are registered to other images yielding deformation fields that facilitate the propagation of the mask knowledge to obtain coarse masks across the dataset. Subsequently, we automatically generate visual prompts based on the region and boundary expansion of the coarse mask, including points, box and a coarse mask. Finally, we can obtain the segmentation predictions by inputting these prompts into SAM and refine the results by post refinement module. We validate the performance of the proposed framework through extensive experiments conducted on two medical image datasets with different modalities. Our method achieves Dices of 74.53%, 94.36% on Breast US, Chest X-ray, respectively. Experimental results substantiate that SAM-MPA yields high-accuracy segmentations within 10 labeled examples, outperforming other state-of-the-art few-shot auto-segmentation methods. Our method enables the customization of SAM for any medical image dataset with a small number of labeled examples.

- **Summary**: This paper jointly addresses three key limitations in conventional pedestrian trajectory forecasting: pedestrian perception errors, real-world data collection costs, and person ID annotation costs. We propose a novel framework, RealTraj, that enhances the real-world applicability of trajectory forecasting. Our approach includes two training phases--self-supervised pretraining on synthetic data and weakly-supervised fine-tuning with limited real-world data--to minimize data collection efforts. To improve robustness to real-world errors, we focus on both model design and training objectives. Specifically, we present Det2TrajFormer, a trajectory forecasting model that remains invariant in tracking noise by using past detections as inputs. Additionally, we pretrain the model using multiple pretext tasks, which enhance robustness and improve forecasting performance based solely on detection data. Unlike previous trajectory forecasting methods, our approach fine-tunes the model using only ground-truth detections, significantly reducing the need for costly person ID annotations. In the experiments, we comprehensively verify the effectiveness of the proposed method against the limitations, and the method outperforms state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting methods on multiple datasets. The code will be released at https://fujiry0.github.io/RealTraj-project-page.

- **Summary**: The automatic generation of anchor-style product promotion videos presents promising opportunities in online commerce, advertising, and consumer engagement. However, this remains a challenging task despite significant advancements in pose-guided human video generation. In addressing this challenge, we identify the integration of human-object interactions (HOI) into pose-guided human video generation as a core issue. To this end, we introduce AnchorCrafter, a novel diffusion-based system designed to generate 2D videos featuring a target human and a customized object, achieving high visual fidelity and controllable interactions. Specifically, we propose two key innovations: the HOI-appearance perception, which enhances object appearance recognition from arbitrary multi-view perspectives and disentangles object and human appearance, and the HOI-motion injection, which enables complex human-object interactions by overcoming challenges in object trajectory conditioning and inter-occlusion management. Additionally, we introduce the HOI-region reweighting loss, a training objective that enhances the learning of object details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed system outperforms existing methods in preserving object appearance and shape awareness, while simultaneously maintaining consistency in human appearance and motion.

- **Summary**: Large-scale pre-trained vision models are becoming increasingly prevalent, offering expressive and generalizable visual representations that benefit various downstream tasks. Recent studies on the emergent properties of these models have revealed their high-level geometric understanding, in particular in the context of depth perception. However, it remains unclear how depth perception arises in these models without explicit depth supervision provided during pre-training. To investigate this, we examine whether the monocular depth cues, similar to those used by the human visual system, emerge in these models. We introduce a new benchmark, DepthCues, designed to evaluate depth cue understanding, and present findings across 20 diverse and representative pre-trained vision models. Our analysis shows that human-like depth cues emerge in more recent larger models. We also explore enhancing depth perception in large vision models by fine-tuning on DepthCues, and find that even without dense depth supervision, this improves depth estimation. To support further research, our benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available for studying depth perception in vision models.

- **Summary**: Segmenting 3D blood vessels is a critical yet challenging task in medical image analysis. This is due to significant imaging modality-specific variations in artifacts, vascular patterns and scales, signal-to-noise ratios, and background tissues. These variations, along with domain gaps arising from varying imaging protocols, limit the generalization of existing supervised learning-based methods, requiring tedious voxel-level annotations for each dataset separately. While foundation models promise to alleviate this limitation, they typically fail to generalize to the task of blood vessel segmentation, posing a unique, complex problem. In this work, we present vesselFM, a foundation model designed specifically for the broad task of 3D blood vessel segmentation. Unlike previous models, vesselFM can effortlessly generalize to unseen domains. To achieve zero-shot generalization, we train vesselFM on three heterogeneous data sources: a large, curated annotated dataset, data generated by a domain randomization scheme, and data sampled from a flow matching-based generative model. Extensive evaluations show that vesselFM outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation foundation models across four (pre-)clinically relevant imaging modalities in zero-, one-, and few-shot scenarios, therefore providing a universal solution for 3D blood vessel segmentation.

- **Summary**: No-Reference Image Quality Assessment for distorted images has always been a challenging problem due to image content variance and distortion diversity. Previous IQA models mostly encode explicit single-quality features of synthetic images to obtain quality-aware representations for quality score prediction. However, performance decreases when facing real-world distortion and restored images from restoration models. The reason is that they do not consider the degradation factors of the low-quality images adequately. To address this issue, we first introduce the DRI method to obtain degradation vectors and quality vectors of images, which separately model the degradation and quality information of low-quality images. After that, we add the restoration network to provide the MOS score predictor with degradation information. Then, we design the Representation-based Semantic Loss (RS Loss) to assist in enhancing effective interaction between representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against existing state-of-the-art models on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing continuous surfaces from unoriented and unordered 3D points is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Recent advancements address this problem by training neural signed distance functions to pull 3D location queries to their closest points on a surface, following the predicted signed distances and the analytical gradients computed by the network. In this paper, we introduce NumGrad-Pull, leveraging the representation capability of tri-plane structures to accelerate the learning of signed distance functions and enhance the fidelity of local details in surface reconstruction. To further improve the training stability of grid-based tri-planes, we propose to exploit numerical gradients, replacing conventional analytical computations. Additionally, we present a progressive plane expansion strategy to facilitate faster signed distance function convergence and design a data sampling strategy to mitigate reconstruction artifacts. Our extensive experiments across a variety of benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. Code is available at https://github.com/CuiRuikai/NumGrad-Pull

- **Summary**: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLM) have demonstrated remarkable capability in image classification. These VLMs leverage a predefined set of categories to construct text prompts for zero-shot reasoning. However, in more open-ended domains like autonomous driving, using a predefined set of labels becomes impractical, as the semantic label space is unknown and constantly evolving. Additionally, fixed embedding text prompts often tend to predict a single label (while in reality, multiple labels commonly exist per image). In this paper, we introduce CoA, an innovative Chain-of-Action (CoA) method that generates labels aligned with all contextually relevant features of an image. CoA is designed based on the observation that enriched and valuable contextual information improves generative performance during inference. Traditional vision-language models tend to output singular and redundant responses. Therefore, we employ a tailored CoA to alleviate this problem. We first break down the generative labeling task into detailed actions and construct an CoA leading to the final generative objective. Each action extracts and merges key information from the previous action and passes the enriched information as context to the next action, ultimately improving the VLM in generating comprehensive and accurate semantic labels. We assess the effectiveness of CoA through comprehensive evaluations on widely-used benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate significant improvements across key performance metrics.

- **Summary**: Developing a central nervous system (CNS) tumor classifier by integrating DNA methylation data with Whole Slide Images (WSI) offers significant potential for enhancing diagnostic precision in neuropathology. Existing approaches typically integrate encoded omic data with histology only once - either at an early or late fusion stage - while reintroducing encoded omic data to create a dual fusion variant remains unexplored. Nevertheless, reintroduction of omic embeddings during early and late fusion enables the capture of complementary information from localized patch-level and holistic slide-level interactions, allowing boosted performance through advanced multimodal integration. To achieve this, we propose a dual fusion framework that integrates omic data at both early and late stages, fully leveraging its diagnostic strength. In the early fusion stage, omic embeddings are projected into a patch-wise latent space, generating omic-WSI embeddings that encapsulate per-patch molecular and morphological insights, effectively incorporating this information into the spatial representation of histology. These embeddings are refined with a multiple instance learning gated attention mechanism to attend to critical patches. In the late fusion stage, we reintroduce the omic data by fusing it with slide-level omic-WSI embeddings using a Multimodal Outer Arithmetic Block (MOAB), which richly intermingles features from both modalities, capturing their global correlations and complementarity. We demonstrate accurate CNS tumor subtyping across 20 fine-grained subtypes and validate our approach on benchmark datasets, achieving improved survival prediction on TCGA-BLCA and competitive performance on TCGA-BRCA compared to state-of-the-art methods. This dual fusion strategy enhances interpretability and classification performance, highlighting its potential for clinical diagnostics.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in generative models have enabled high-quality 3D character reconstruction from multi-modal. However, animating these generated characters remains a challenging task, especially for complex elements like garments and hair, due to the lack of large-scale datasets and effective rigging methods. To address this gap, we curate AnimeRig, a large-scale dataset with detailed skeleton and skinning annotations. Building upon this, we propose DRiVE, a novel framework for generating and rigging 3D human characters with intricate structures. Unlike existing methods, DRiVE utilizes a 3D Gaussian representation, facilitating efficient animation and high-quality rendering. We further introduce GSDiff, a 3D Gaussian-based diffusion module that predicts joint positions as spatial distributions, overcoming the limitations of regression-based approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRiVE achieves precise rigging results, enabling realistic dynamics for clothing and hair, and surpassing previous methods in both quality and versatility. The code and dataset will be made public for academic use upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Tracking geographic entities from historical maps, such as buildings, offers valuable insights into cultural heritage, urbanization patterns, environmental changes, and various historical research endeavors. However, linking these entities across diverse maps remains a persistent challenge for researchers. Traditionally, this has been addressed through a two-step process: detecting entities within individual maps and then associating them via a heuristic-based post-processing step. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines segmentation and association of geographic entities in historical maps using video instance segmentation (VIS). This method significantly streamlines geographic entity alignment and enhances automation. However, acquiring high-quality, video-format training data for VIS models is prohibitively expensive, especially for historical maps that often contain hundreds or thousands of geographic entities. To mitigate this challenge, we explore self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to enhance VIS performance on historical maps. We evaluate the performance of VIS models under different pretraining configurations and introduce a novel method for generating synthetic videos from unlabeled historical map images for pretraining. Our proposed self-supervised VIS method substantially reduces the need for manual annotation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed self-supervised VIS approach, achieving a 24.9\% improvement in AP and a 0.23 increase in F1 score compared to the model trained from scratch.

- **Summary**: Autonomous intelligent agents must bridge computational challenges at disparate levels of abstraction, from the low-level spaces of sensory input and motor commands to the high-level domain of abstract reasoning and planning. A key question in designing such agents is how best to instantiate the representational space that will interface between these two levels -- ideally without requiring supervision in the form of expensive data annotations. These objectives can be efficiently achieved by representing the world in terms of objects (grounded in perception and action). In this work, we present a novel, brain-inspired, deep-learning architecture that learns from pixels to interpret, control, and reason about its environment, using object-centric representations. We show the utility of our approach through tasks in synthetic environments that require a combination of (high-level) logical reasoning and (low-level) continuous control. Results show that the agent can learn emergent conditional behavioural reasoning, such as $(A \to B) \land (\neg A \to C)$, as well as logical composition $(A \to B) \land (A \to C) \vdash A \to (B \land C)$ and XOR operations, and successfully controls its environment to satisfy objectives deduced from these logical rules. The agent can adapt online to unexpected changes in its environment and is robust to mild violations of its world model, thanks to dynamic internal desired goal generation. While the present results are limited to synthetic settings (2D and 3D activated versions of dSprites), which fall short of real-world levels of complexity, the proposed architecture shows how to manipulate grounded object representations, as a key inductive bias for unsupervised learning, to enable behavioral reasoning.

- **Summary**: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation aims to create high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity. It is an important task in video generation but remains an open problem for generative models. This paper pushes the technical frontier of IPT2V in two directions that have not been resolved in literature: (1) A tuning-free pipeline without tedious case-by-case finetuning, and (2) A frequency-aware heuristic identity-preserving DiT-based control scheme. We propose ConsisID, a tuning-free DiT-based controllable IPT2V model to keep human identity consistent in the generated video. Inspired by prior findings in frequency analysis of diffusion transformers, it employs identity-control signals in the frequency domain, where facial features can be decomposed into low-frequency global features and high-frequency intrinsic features. First, from a low-frequency perspective, we introduce a global facial extractor, which encodes reference images and facial key points into a latent space, generating features enriched with low-frequency information. These features are then integrated into shallow layers of the network to alleviate training challenges associated with DiT. Second, from a high-frequency perspective, we design a local facial extractor to capture high-frequency details and inject them into transformer blocks, enhancing the model's ability to preserve fine-grained features. We propose a hierarchical training strategy to leverage frequency information for identity preservation, transforming a vanilla pre-trained video generation model into an IPT2V model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our frequency-aware heuristic scheme provides an optimal control solution for DiT-based models. Thanks to this scheme, our ConsisID generates high-quality, identity-preserving videos, making strides towards more effective IPT2V.

- **Summary**: Vision-language generative reward models (VL-GenRMs) play a crucial role in aligning and evaluating multimodal AI systems, yet their own evaluation remains under-explored. Current assessment methods primarily rely on AI-annotated preference labels from traditional VL tasks, which can introduce biases and often fail to effectively challenge state-of-the-art models. To address these limitations, we introduce VL-RewardBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning general multimodal queries, visual hallucination detection, and complex reasoning tasks. Through our AI-assisted annotation pipeline combining sample selection with human verification, we curate 1,250 high-quality examples specifically designed to probe model limitations. Comprehensive evaluation across 16 leading large vision-language models, demonstrates VL-RewardBench's effectiveness as a challenging testbed, where even GPT-4o achieves only 65.4% accuracy, and state-of-the-art open-source models such as Qwen2-VL-72B, struggle to surpass random-guessing. Importantly, performance on VL-RewardBench strongly correlates (Pearson's r > 0.9) with MMMU-Pro accuracy using Best-of-N sampling with VL-GenRMs. Analysis experiments uncover three critical insights for improving VL-GenRMs: (i) models predominantly fail at basic visual perception tasks rather than reasoning tasks; (ii) inference-time scaling benefits vary dramatically by model capacity; and (iii) training VL-GenRMs to learn to judge substantially boosts judgment capability (+14.7% accuracy for a 7B VL-GenRM). We believe VL-RewardBench along with the experimental insights will become a valuable resource for advancing VL-GenRMs.

- **Summary**: Given a query from one modality, few-shot cross-modal retrieval (CMR) retrieves semantically similar instances in another modality with the target domain including classes that are disjoint from the source domain. Compared with classical few-shot CMR methods, vision-language pretraining methods like CLIP have shown great few-shot or zero-shot learning performance. However, they still suffer challenges due to (1) the feature degradation encountered in the target domain and (2) the extreme data imbalance. To tackle these issues, we propose FLEX-CLIP, a novel Feature-level Generation Network Enhanced CLIP. FLEX-CLIP includes two training stages. In multimodal feature generation, we propose a composite multimodal VAE-GAN network to capture real feature distribution patterns and generate pseudo samples based on CLIP features, addressing data imbalance. For common space projection, we develop a gate residual network to fuse CLIP features with projected features, reducing feature degradation in X-shot scenarios. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show a 7%-15% improvement over state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies demonstrating enhancement of CLIP features.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in imitation learning have shown significant promise for robotic control and embodied intelligence. However, achieving robust generalization across diverse mounted camera observations remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce a video-based spatial perception framework that leverages 3D spatial representations to address environmental variability, with a focus on handling lighting changes. Our approach integrates a novel image augmentation technique, AugBlender, with a state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation model trained on internet-scale data. Together, these components form a cohesive system designed to enhance robustness and adaptability in dynamic scenarios. Our results demonstrate that our approach significantly boosts the success rate across diverse camera exposures, where previous models experience performance collapse. Our findings highlight the potential of video-based spatial perception models in advancing robustness for end-to-end robotic learning, paving the way for scalable, low-cost solutions in embodied intelligence.

- **Summary**: Video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes videos into a low-dimensional latent space, becoming a key component of most Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) to reduce model training costs. However, as the resolution and duration of generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a limiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference method adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when processing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational bottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently encoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into multiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly, we thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages multi-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into latent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache, which maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference. Compared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior performance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and 4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality.

- **Summary**: Building Graphical User Interface (GUI) assistants holds significant promise for enhancing human workflow productivity. While most agents are language-based, relying on closed-source API with text-rich meta-information (e.g., HTML or accessibility tree), they show limitations in perceiving UI visuals as humans do, highlighting the need for GUI visual agents. In this work, we develop a vision-language-action model in digital world, namely ShowUI, which features the following innovations: (i) UI-Guided Visual Token Selection to reduce computational costs by formulating screenshots as an UI connected graph, adaptively identifying their redundant relationship and serve as the criteria for token selection during self-attention blocks; (ii) Interleaved Vision-Language-Action Streaming that flexibly unifies diverse needs within GUI tasks, enabling effective management of visual-action history in navigation or pairing multi-turn query-action sequences per screenshot to enhance training efficiency; (iii) Small-scale High-quality GUI Instruction-following Datasets by careful data curation and employing a resampling strategy to address significant data type imbalances. With above components, ShowUI, a lightweight 2B model using 256K data, achieves a strong 75.1% accuracy in zero-shot screenshot grounding. Its UI-guided token selection further reduces 33% of redundant visual tokens during training and speeds up the performance by 1.4x. Navigation experiments across web Mind2Web, mobile AITW, and online MiniWob environments further underscore the effectiveness and potential of our model in advancing GUI visual agents.

- **Summary**: Adversarial perturbations aim to deceive neural networks into predicting inaccurate results. For visual object trackers, adversarial attacks have been developed to generate perturbations by manipulating the outputs. However, transformer trackers predict a specific bounding box instead of an object candidate list, which limits the applicability of many existing attack scenarios. To address this issue, we present a novel white-box approach to attack visual object trackers with transformer backbones using only one bounding box. From the tracker predicted bounding box, we generate a list of adversarial bounding boxes and compute the adversarial loss for those bounding boxes. Experimental results demonstrate that our simple yet effective attack outperforms existing attacks against several robust transformer trackers, including TransT-M, ROMTrack, and MixFormer, on popular benchmark tracking datasets such as GOT-10k, UAV123, and VOT2022STS.

- **Summary**: Mamba has shown great potential for computer vision due to its linear complexity in modeling the global context with respect to the input length. However, existing lightweight Mamba-based backbones cannot demonstrate performance that matches Convolution or Transformer-based methods. We observe that simply modifying the scanning path in the image domain is not conducive to fully exploiting the potential of vision Mamba. In this paper, we first perform comprehensive spectral and quantitative analyses, and verify that the Mamba block mainly models low-frequency information under Convolution-Mamba hybrid architecture. Based on the analyses, we introduce a novel Laplace mixer to decouple the features in terms of frequency and input only the low-frequency components into the Mamba block. In addition, considering the redundancy of the features and the different requirements for high-frequency details and low-frequency global information at different stages, we introduce a frequency ramp inception, i.e., gradually reduce the input dimensions of the high-frequency branches, so as to efficiently trade-off the high-frequency and low-frequency components at different layers. By integrating mobile-friendly convolution and efficient Laplace mixer, we build a series of tiny hybrid vision Mamba called TinyViM. The proposed TinyViM achieves impressive performance on several downstream tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation. In particular, TinyViM outperforms Convolution, Transformer and Mamba-based models with similar scales, and the throughput is about 2-3 times higher than that of other Mamba-based models.

- **Summary**: Video Paragraph Grounding (VPG) aims to precisely locate the most appropriate moments within a video that are relevant to a given textual paragraph query. However, existing methods typically rely on large-scale annotated temporal labels and assume that the correspondence between videos and paragraphs is known. This is impractical in real-world applications, as constructing temporal labels requires significant labor costs, and the correspondence is often unknown. To address this issue, we propose a Dual-task Mutual Reinforcing Embedded Joint Video Paragraph Retrieval and Grounding method (DMR-JRG). In this method, retrieval and grounding tasks are mutually reinforced rather than being treated as separate issues. DMR-JRG mainly consists of two branches: a retrieval branch and a grounding branch. The retrieval branch uses inter-video contrastive learning to roughly align the global features of paragraphs and videos, reducing modality differences and constructing a coarse-grained feature space to break free from the need for correspondence between paragraphs and videos. Additionally, this coarse-grained feature space further facilitates the grounding branch in extracting fine-grained contextual representations. In the grounding branch, we achieve precise cross-modal matching and grounding by exploring the consistency between local, global, and temporal dimensions of video segments and textual paragraphs. By synergizing these dimensions, we construct a fine-grained feature space for video and textual features, greatly reducing the need for large-scale annotated temporal labels.

- **Summary**: Deep-learning-based MR-to-CT synthesis can estimate the electron density of tissues, thereby facilitating PET attenuation correction in whole-body PET/MR imaging. However, whole-body MR-to-CT synthesis faces several challenges including the issue of spatial misalignment and the complexity of intensity mapping, primarily due to the variety of tissues and organs throughout the whole body. Here we propose a novel whole-body MR-to-CT synthesis framework, which consists of three novel modules to tackle these challenges: (1) Structure-Guided Synthesis module leverages structure-guided attention gates to enhance synthetic image quality by diminishing unnecessary contours of soft tissues; (2) Spatial Alignment module yields precise registration between paired MR and CT images by taking into account the impacts of tissue volumes and respiratory movements, thus providing well-aligned ground-truth CT images during training; (3) Semantic Alignment module utilizes contrastive learning to constrain organ-related semantic information, thereby ensuring the semantic authenticity of synthetic CT images.We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the proposed whole-body MR-to-CT framework can produce visually plausible and semantically realistic CT images, and validate its utility in PET attenuation correction.

- **Summary**: Modern reconstruction techniques can effectively model complex 3D scenes from sparse 2D views. However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of no-reference image metrics in predicting detailed artifact maps. The absence of such quality metrics hinders accurate predictions of the quality of generated views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose a new no-reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the input views to establish a scene-specific distribution that is later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. We test and evaluate our method in the context of 3D reconstruction; to this end, we collected a novel dataset of human quality assessment in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method can not only successfully localize artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, but do so without direct references. Surprisingly, our metric outperforms both no-reference metrics and popular full-reference image metrics. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

- **Summary**: Structuring latent representations in a hierarchical manner enables models to learn patterns at multiple levels of abstraction. However, most prevalent image understanding models focus on visual similarity, and learning visual hierarchies is relatively unexplored. In this work, for the first time, we introduce a learning paradigm that can encode user-defined multi-level visual hierarchies in hyperbolic space without requiring explicit hierarchical labels. As a concrete example, first, we define a part-based image hierarchy using object-level annotations within and across images. Then, we introduce an approach to enforce the hierarchy using contrastive loss with pairwise entailment metrics. Finally, we discuss new evaluation metrics to effectively measure hierarchical image retrieval. Encoding these complex relationships ensures that the learned representations capture semantic and structural information that transcends mere visual similarity. Experiments in part-based image retrieval show significant improvements in hierarchical retrieval tasks, demonstrating the capability of our model in capturing visual hierarchies.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in comprehending complex visual content. However, the mechanisms underlying how VLMs process visual information remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis, focusing on attention modules across layers. We reveal several key insights about how these models process visual data: (i) the internal representation of the query tokens (e.g., representations of "describe the image"), is utilized by VLMs to store global image information; we demonstrate that these models generate surprisingly descriptive responses solely from these tokens, without direct access to image tokens. (ii) Cross-modal information flow is predominantly influenced by the middle layers (approximately 25% of all layers), while early and late layers contribute only marginally.(iii) Fine-grained visual attributes and object details are directly extracted from image tokens in a spatially localized manner, i.e., the generated tokens associated with a specific object or attribute attend strongly to their corresponding regions in the image. We propose novel quantitative evaluation to validate our observations, leveraging real-world complex visual scenes. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our findings in facilitating efficient visual processing in state-of-the-art VLMs.

- **Summary**: Modern deep-learning based super-resolution techniques process images and videos independently of the underlying content and viewing conditions. However, the sensitivity of the human visual system to image details changes depending on the underlying content characteristics, such as spatial frequency, luminance, color, contrast, or motion. This observation hints that computational resources spent on up-sampling visual content may be wasted whenever a viewer cannot resolve the results. Motivated by this observation, we propose a perceptually inspired and architecture-agnostic approach for controlling the visual quality and efficiency of super-resolution techniques. The core is a perceptual model that dynamically guides super-resolution methods according to the human's sensitivity to image details. Our technique leverages the limitations of the human visual system to improve the efficiency of super-resolution techniques by focusing computational resources on perceptually important regions; judged on the basis of factors such as adapting luminance, contrast, spatial frequency, motion, and viewing conditions. We demonstrate the application of our proposed model in combination with network branching, and network complexity reduction to improve the computational efficiency of super-resolution methods without visible quality loss. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including user studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing FLOPS by factors of 2$\mathbf{x}$ and greater, without sacrificing perceived quality.

- **Summary**: Decomposing physically-based materials from images into their constituent properties remains challenging, particularly when maintaining both computational efficiency and physical consistency. While recent diffusion-based approaches have shown promise, they face substantial computational overhead due to multiple denoising steps and separate models for different material properties. We present SuperMat, a single-step framework that achieves high-quality material decomposition with one-step inference. This enables end-to-end training with perceptual and re-render losses while decomposing albedo, metallic, and roughness maps at millisecond-scale speeds. We further extend our framework to 3D objects through a UV refinement network, enabling consistent material estimation across viewpoints while maintaining efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SuperMat achieves state-of-the-art PBR material decomposition quality while reducing inference time from seconds to milliseconds per image, and completes PBR material estimation for 3D objects in approximately 3 seconds.

- **Summary**: We investigate the approximation and estimation rates of conditional diffusion transformers (DiTs) with classifier-free guidance. We present a comprehensive analysis for ``in-context'' conditional DiTs under four common data assumptions. We show that both conditional DiTs and their latent variants lead to the minimax optimality of unconditional DiTs under identified settings. Specifically, we discretize the input domains into infinitesimal grids and then perform a term-by-term Taylor expansion on the conditional diffusion score function under H\"older smooth data assumption. This enables fine-grained use of transformers' universal approximation through a more detailed piecewise constant approximation and hence obtains tighter bounds. Additionally, we extend our analysis to the latent setting under the linear latent subspace assumption. We not only show that latent conditional DiTs achieve lower bounds than conditional DiTs both in approximation and estimation, but also show the minimax optimality of latent unconditional DiTs. Our findings establish statistical limits for conditional and unconditional DiTs, and offer practical guidance toward developing more efficient and accurate DiT models.

- **Summary**: We present the updated version of the HSI-Drive dataset aimed at developing automated driving systems (ADS) using hyperspectral imaging (HSI). The v2.0 version includes new annotated images from videos recorded during winter and fall in real driving scenarios. Added to the spring and summer images included in the previous v1.1 version, the new dataset contains 752 images covering the four seasons. In this paper, we show the improvements achieved over previously published results obtained on the v1.1 dataset, showcasing the enhanced performance of models trained on the new v2.0 dataset. We also show the progress made in comprehensive scene understanding by experimenting with more capable image segmentation models. These models include new segmentation categories aimed at the identification of essential road safety objects such as the presence of vehicles and road signs, as well as highly vulnerable groups like pedestrians and cyclists. In addition, we provide evidence of the performance and robustness of the models when applied to segmenting HSI video sequences captured in various environments and conditions. Finally, for a correct assessment of the results described in this work, the constraints imposed by the processing platforms that can sensibly be deployed in vehicles for ADS must be taken into account. Thus, and although implementation details are out of the scope of this paper, we focus our research on the development of computationally efficient, lightweight ML models that can eventually operate at high throughput rates. The dataset and some examples of segmented videos are available in https://ipaccess.ehu.eus/HSI-Drive/.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models achieve impressive performance in human motion generation. However, current approaches typically ignore the significance of frequency-domain information in capturing fine-grained motions within the latent space (e.g., low frequencies correlate with static poses, and high frequencies align with fine-grained motions). Additionally, there is a semantic discrepancy between text and motion, leading to inconsistency between the generated motions and the text descriptions. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based FTMoMamba framework equipped with a Frequency State Space Model (FreqSSM) and a Text State Space Model (TextSSM). Specifically, to learn fine-grained representation, FreqSSM decomposes sequences into low-frequency and high-frequency components, guiding the generation of static pose (e.g., sits, lay) and fine-grained motions (e.g., transition, stumble), respectively. To ensure the consistency between text and motion, TextSSM encodes text features at the sentence level, aligning textual semantics with sequential features. Extensive experiments show that FTMoMamba achieves superior performance on the text-to-motion generation task, especially gaining the lowest FID of 0.181 (rather lower than 0.421 of MLD) on the HumanML3D dataset.

- **Summary**: Generative models have proven to be very effective in generating synthetic medical images and find applications in downstream tasks such as enhancing rare disease datasets, long-tailed dataset augmentation, and scaling machine learning algorithms. For medical applications, the synthetically generated medical images by such models are still reasonable in quality when evaluated based on traditional metrics such as FID score, precision, and recall. However, these metrics fail to capture the medical/biological plausibility of the generated images. Human expert feedback has been used to get biological plausibility which demonstrates that these generated images have very low plausibility. Recently, the research community has further integrated this human feedback through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback(RLHF), which generates more medically plausible images. However, incorporating human feedback is a costly and slow process. In this work, we propose a novel approach to improve the medical plausibility of generated images without the need for human feedback. We introduce IMPROVE:Improving Medical Plausibility without Reliance on Human Validation - An Enhanced Prototype-Guided Diffusion Framework, a prototype-guided diffusion process for medical image generation and show that it substantially enhances the biological plausibility of the generated medical images without the need for any human feedback. We perform experiments on Bone Marrow and HAM10000 datasets and show that medical accuracy can be substantially increased without human feedback.

- **Summary**: Object detection and semantic segmentation are both scene understanding tasks yet they differ in data structure and information level. Object detection requires box coordinates for object instances while semantic segmentation requires pixel-wise class labels. Making use of one task's information to train the other would be beneficial for multi-task partially supervised learning where each training example is annotated only for a single task, having the potential to expand training sets with different-task datasets. This paper studies various weak losses for partially annotated data in combination with existing supervised losses. We propose Box-for-Mask and Mask-for-Box strategies, and their combination BoMBo, to distil necessary information from one task annotations to train the other. Ablation studies and experimental results on VOC and COCO datasets show favorable results for the proposed idea. Source code and data splits can be found at https://github.com/lhoangan/multas.

- **Summary**: The article discusses the use of low cost System-On-Module (SOM) platforms for the implementation of efficient hyperspectral imaging (HSI) processors for application in autonomous driving. The work addresses the challenges of shaping and deploying multiple layer fully convolutional networks (FCN) for low-latency, on-board image semantic segmentation using resource- and power-constrained processing devices. The paper describes in detail the steps followed to redesign and customize a successfully trained HSI segmentation lightweight FCN that was previously tested on a high-end heterogeneous multiprocessing system-on-chip (MPSoC) to accommodate it to the constraints imposed by a low-cost SOM. This SOM features a lower-end but much cheaper MPSoC suitable for the deployment of automatic driving systems (ADS). In particular the article reports the data- and hardware-specific quantization techniques utilized to fit the FCN into a commercial fixed-point programmable AI coprocessor IP, and proposes a full customized post-training quantization scheme to reduce computation and storage costs without compromising segmentation accuracy.

- **Summary**: Incorporating modern computer vision techniques into clinical protocols shows promise in improving skin lesion segmentation. The U-Net architecture has been a key model in this area, iteratively improved to address challenges arising from the heterogeneity of dermatologic images due to varying clinical settings, lighting, patient attributes, and hair density. To further improve skin lesion segmentation, we developed TAFM-Net, an innovative model leveraging self-adaptive transformer attention (TA) coupled with focal modulation (FM). Our model integrates an EfficientNetV2B1 encoder, which employs TA to enhance spatial and channel-related saliency, while a densely connected decoder integrates FM within skip connections, enhancing feature emphasis, segmentation performance, and interpretability crucial for medical image analysis. A novel dynamic loss function amalgamates region and boundary information, guiding effective model training. Our model achieves competitive performance, with Jaccard coefficients of 93.64\%, 86.88\% and 92.88\% in the ISIC2016, ISIC2017 and ISIC2018 datasets, respectively, demonstrating its potential in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is an excellent model organism because of its short lifespan and high degree of homology with human genes, and it has been widely used in a variety of human health and disease models. However, the segmentation of C. elegans remains challenging due to the following reasons: 1) the activity trajectory of C. elegans is uncontrollable, and multiple nematodes often overlap, resulting in blurred boundaries of C. elegans. This makes it impossible to clearly study the life trajectory of a certain nematode; and 2) in the microscope images of overlapping C. elegans, the translucent tissues at the edges obscure each other, leading to inaccurate boundary segmentation. To solve these problems, a Bilayer Segmentation-Recombination Network (BR-Net) for the segmentation of C. elegans instances is proposed. The network consists of three parts: A Coarse Mask Segmentation Module (CMSM), a Bilayer Segmentation Module (BSM), and a Semantic Consistency Recombination Module (SCRM). The CMSM is used to extract the coarse mask, and we introduce a Unified Attention Module (UAM) in CMSM to make CMSM better aware of nematode instances. The Bilayer Segmentation Module (BSM) segments the aggregated C. elegans into overlapping and non-overlapping regions. This is followed by integration by the SCRM, where semantic consistency regularization is introduced to segment nematode instances more accurately. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified on the C. elegans dataset. The experimental results show that BR-Net exhibits good competitiveness and outperforms other recently proposed instance segmentation methods in processing C. elegans occlusion images.

- **Summary**: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenge task that combines natural language processing and computer vision techniques and gradually becomes a benchmark test task in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The goal of our survey is to provide an overview of the development of VQA and a detailed description of the latest models with high timeliness. This survey gives an up-to-date synthesis of natural language understanding of images and text, as well as the knowledge reasoning module based on image-question information on the core VQA tasks. In addition, we elaborate on recent advances in extracting and fusing modal information with vision-language pretraining models and multimodal large language models in VQA. We also exhaustively review the progress of knowledge reasoning in VQA by detailing the extraction of internal knowledge and the introduction of external knowledge. Finally, we present the datasets of VQA and different evaluation metrics and discuss possible directions for future work.

- **Summary**: White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) are key neuroradiological markers of small vessel disease present in brain MRI. Assessment of WMH is important in research and clinics. However, WMH are challenging to segment due to their high variability in shape, location, size, poorly defined borders, and similar intensity profile to other pathologies (e.g stroke lesions) and artefacts (e.g head motion). In this work, we apply the most effective techniques for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in segmentation to the WMH segmentation task across multiple test-time data distributions. We find a combination of Stochastic Segmentation Networks with Deep Ensembles yields the highest Dice and lowest Absolute Volume Difference % (AVD) score on in-domain and out-of-distribution data. We demonstrate the downstream utility of UQ, proposing a novel method for classification of the clinical Fazekas score using spatial features extracted for WMH segmentation and UQ maps. We show that incorporating WMH uncertainty information improves Fazekas classification performance and calibration, with median class balanced accuracy for classification models with (UQ and spatial WMH features)/(spatial WMH features)/(WMH volume only) of 0.71/0.66/0.60 in the Deep WMH and 0.82/0.77/0.73 in the Periventricular WMH regions respectively. We demonstrate that stochastic UQ techniques with high sample diversity can improve the detection of poor quality segmentations. Finally, we qualitatively analyse the semantic information captured by UQ techniques and demonstrate that uncertainty can highlight areas where there is ambiguity between WMH and stroke lesions, while identifying clusters of small WMH in deep white matter unsegmented by the model.

- **Summary**: Memory-based trackers are video object segmentation methods that form the target model by concatenating recently tracked frames into a memory buffer and localize the target by attending the current image to the buffered frames. While already achieving top performance on many benchmarks, it was the recent release of SAM2 that placed memory-based trackers into focus of the visual object tracking community. Nevertheless, modern trackers still struggle in the presence of distractors. We argue that a more sophisticated memory model is required, and propose a new distractor-aware memory model for SAM2 and an introspection-based update strategy that jointly addresses the segmentation accuracy as well as tracking robustness. The resulting tracker is denoted as SAM2.1++. We also propose a new distractor-distilled DiDi dataset to study the distractor problem better. SAM2.1++ outperforms SAM2.1 and related SAM memory extensions on seven benchmarks and sets a solid new state-of-the-art on six of them.

- **Summary**: Point clouds acquired in constrained and challenging real-world settings are incomplete, non-uniformly sparse, or both. These obstacles present acute challenges for a vital task - point cloud completion. Using tools from Algebraic Topology and Persistent Homology ($\mathcal{PH}$), we demonstrate that current benchmark synthetic point clouds lack rich topological features that are important constituents of point clouds captured in realistic settings. To facilitate research in this direction, we contribute the first real-world industrial point cloud dataset for point cloud completion, RealPC - a diverse set of rich and varied point clouds, consisting of $\sim$ 40,000 pairs across 21 categories of industrial structures in railway establishments. Our benchmark results on several strong baselines reveal a striking observation - the existing methods are tailored for synthetic datasets and fail miserably in real-world settings. Building on our observation that RealPC consists of several 0 and 1-dimensional $\mathcal{PH}$-based topological features, we demonstrate the potential of integrating Homology-based topological priors into existing works. More specifically, we present how 0-dimensional $\mathcal{PH}$ priors, which extract the global topology of a complete shape in the form of a 3-D skeleton, can assist a model in generating topologically-consistent complete shapes.

- **Summary**: In recent years, interest in synthetic data has grown, particularly in the context of pre-training the image modality to support a range of computer vision tasks, including object classification, medical imaging etc. Previous work has demonstrated that synthetic samples, automatically produced by various generative processes, can replace real counterparts and yield strong visual representations. This approach resolves issues associated with real data such as collection and labeling costs, copyright and privacy.   We extend this trend to the video domain applying it to the task of action recognition. Employing fractal geometry, we present methods to automatically produce large-scale datasets of short synthetic video clips, which can be utilized for pre-training neural models. The generated video clips are characterized by notable variety, stemmed by the innate ability of fractals to generate complex multi-scale structures. To narrow the domain gap, we further identify key properties of real videos and carefully emulate them during pre-training. Through thorough ablations, we determine the attributes that strengthen downstream results and offer general guidelines for pre-training with synthetic videos. The proposed approach is evaluated by fine-tuning pre-trained models on established action recognition datasets HMDB51 and UCF101 as well as four other video benchmarks related to group action recognition, fine-grained action recognition and dynamic scenes. Compared to standard Kinetics pre-training, our reported results come close and are even superior on a portion of downstream datasets.

- **Summary**: Despite the typical inversion-then-editing paradigm using text-to-image (T2I) models has demonstrated promising results, directly extending it to text-to-video (T2V) models still suffers severe artifacts such as color flickering and content distortion. Consequently, current video editing methods primarily rely on T2I models, which inherently lack temporal-coherence generative ability, often resulting in inferior editing results. In this paper, we attribute the failure of the typical editing paradigm to: 1) Tightly Spatial-temporal Coupling. The vanilla pivotal-based inversion strategy struggles to disentangle spatial-temporal information in the video diffusion model; 2) Complicated Spatial-temporal Layout. The vanilla cross-attention control is deficient in preserving the unedited content. To address these limitations, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled guidance (STDG) and multi-frame null-text optimization strategy to provide pivotal temporal cues for more precise pivotal inversion. Furthermore, we introduce a self-attention control strategy to maintain higher fidelity for precise partial content editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method (termed VideoDirector) effectively harnesses the powerful temporal generation capabilities of T2V models, producing edited videos with state-of-the-art performance in accuracy, motion smoothness, realism, and fidelity to unedited content.

- **Summary**: We present DGGS, a novel framework addressing the previously unexplored challenge of Distractor-free Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). It accomplishes two key objectives: fortifying generalizable 3DGS against distractor-laden data during both training and inference phases, while successfully extending cross-scene adaptation capabilities to conventional distractor-free approaches. To achieve these objectives, DGGS introduces a scene-agnostic reference-based mask prediction and refinement methodology during training phase, coupled with a training view selection strategy, effectively improving distractor prediction accuracy and training stability. Moreover, to address distractor-induced voids and artifacts during inference stage, we propose a two-stage inference framework for better reference selection based on the predicted distractor masks, complemented by a distractor pruning module to eliminate residual distractor effects. Extensive generalization experiments demonstrate DGGS's advantages under distractor-laden conditions. Additionally, experimental results show that our scene-agnostic mask inference achieves accuracy comparable to scene-specific trained methods. Homepage is \url{https://github.com/bbbbby-99/DGGS}.

- **Summary**: This paper aims to address universal segmentation for image and video perception with the strong reasoning ability empowered by Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs). Despite significant progress in current unified segmentation methods, limitations in adaptation to both image and video scenarios, as well as the complex reasoning segmentation, make it difficult for them to handle various challenging instructions and achieve an accurate understanding of fine-grained vision-language correlations. We propose HyperSeg, the first VLLM-based universal segmentation model for pixel-level image and video perception, encompassing generic segmentation tasks and more complex reasoning perception tasks requiring powerful reasoning abilities and world knowledge. Besides, to fully leverage the recognition capabilities of VLLMs and the fine-grained visual information, HyperSeg incorporates hybrid entity recognition and fine-grained visual perceiver modules for various segmentation tasks. Combined with the temporal adapter, HyperSeg achieves a comprehensive understanding of temporal information. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our insights in resolving universal image and video segmentation tasks, including the more complex reasoning perception tasks. Our code is available.

- **Summary**: In autonomous driving, environment perception has significantly advanced with the utilization of deep learning techniques for diverse sensors such as cameras, depth sensors, or infrared sensors. The diversity in the sensor stack increases the safety and contributes to robustness against adverse weather and lighting conditions. However, the variance in data acquired from different sensors poses challenges. In the context of continual learning (CL), incremental learning is especially challenging for considerably large domain shifts, e.g. different sensor modalities. This amplifies the problem of catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we formulate the concept of modality-incremental learning and examine its necessity, by contrasting it with existing incremental learning paradigms. We propose the use of a modified Relevance Mapping Network (RMN) to incrementally learn new modalities while preserving performance on previously learned modalities, in which relevance maps are disjoint. Experimental results demonstrate that the prevention of shared connections in this approach helps alleviate the problem of forgetting within the constraints of a strict continual learning framework.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT), an emerging image and video generation model architecture, has demonstrated great potential because of its high generation quality and scalability properties. Despite the impressive performance, its practical deployment is constrained by computational complexity and redundancy in the sequential denoising process. While feature caching across timesteps has proven effective in accelerating diffusion models, its application to DiT is limited by fundamental architectural differences from U-Net-based approaches. Through empirical analysis of DiT feature dynamics, we identify that significant feature variation between DiT blocks presents a key challenge for feature reusability. To address this, we convert standard DiT into Skip-DiT with skip branches to enhance feature smoothness. Further, we introduce Skip-Cache which utilizes the skip branches to cache DiT features across timesteps at the inference time. We validated effectiveness of our proposal on different DiT backbones for video and image generation, showcasing skip branches to help preserve generation quality and achieve higher speedup. Experimental results indicate that Skip-DiT achieves a 1.5x speedup almost for free and a 2.2x speedup with only a minor reduction in quantitative metrics.

- **Summary**: The integration of machine learning in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), specifically in neuroimaging, is proving to be incredibly effective, leading to better diagnostic accuracy, accelerated image analysis, and data-driven insights, which can potentially transform patient care. Deep learning models utilize multiple layers of processing to capture intricate details of complex data, which can then be used on a variety of tasks, including brain tumor classification, segmentation, image synthesis, and registration. Previous research demonstrates high accuracy in tumor segmentation using various model architectures, including nn-UNet and Swin-UNet. U-Mamba, which uses state space modeling, also achieves high accuracy in medical image segmentation. To leverage these models, we propose a deep learning framework that ensembles these state-of-the-art architectures to achieve accurate segmentation and produce finely synthesized images.

- **Summary**: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) relies on natural language expressions to segment an object in a video clip. Existing methods restrict reasoning either to independent short clips, losing global context, or process the entire video offline, impairing their application in a streaming fashion. In this work, we aim to surpass these limitations and design an RVOS method capable of effectively operating in streaming-like scenarios while retaining contextual information from past frames. We build upon the Segment-Anything 2 (SAM2) model, that provides robust segmentation and tracking capabilities and is naturally suited for streaming processing. We make SAM2 wiser, by empowering it with natural language understanding and explicit temporal modeling at the feature extraction stage, without fine-tuning its weights, and without outsourcing modality interaction to external models. To this end, we introduce a novel adapter module that injects temporal information and multi-modal cues in the feature extraction process. We further reveal the phenomenon of tracking bias in SAM2 and propose a learnable module to adjust its tracking focus when the current frame features suggest a new object more aligned with the caption. Our proposed method, SAMWISE, achieves state-of-the-art across various benchmarks, by adding a negligible overhead of just 4.2 M parameters.

- **Summary**: Recent progress in scene synthesis makes standalone SLAM systems purely based on optimizing hyperprimitives with a Rendering objective possible \cite{monogs}.   However, the tracking performance still lacks behind traditional \cite{orbslam} and end-to-end SLAM systems \cite{droid}.   An optimal trade-off between robustness, speed and accuracy has not yet been reached, especially for monocular video.   In this paper, we introduce a SLAM system based on an end-to-end Tracker and extend it with a Renderer based on recent 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques.   Our framework \textbf{DroidSplat} achieves both SotA tracking and rendering results on common SLAM benchmarks.   We implemented multiple building blocks of modern SLAM systems to run in parallel, allowing for fast inference on common consumer GPU's.   Recent progress in monocular depth prediction and camera calibration allows our system to achieve strong results even on in-the-wild data without known camera intrinsics.

- **Summary**: Vision-based pose estimation of articulated robots with unknown joint angles has applications in collaborative robotics and human-robot interaction tasks. Current frameworks use neural network encoders to extract image features and downstream layers to predict joint angles and robot pose. While images of robots inherently contain rich information about the robot's physical structures, existing methods often fail to leverage it fully; therefore, limiting performance under occlusions and truncations. To address this, we introduce RoboPEPP, a method that fuses information about the robot's physical model into the encoder using a masking-based self-supervised embedding-predictive architecture. Specifically, we mask the robot's joints and pre-train an encoder-predictor model to infer the joints' embeddings from surrounding unmasked regions, enhancing the encoder's understanding of the robot's physical model. The pre-trained encoder-predictor pair, along with joint angle and keypoint prediction networks, is then fine-tuned for pose and joint angle estimation. Random masking of input during fine-tuning and keypoint filtering during evaluation further improves robustness. Our method, evaluated on several datasets, achieves the best results in robot pose and joint angle estimation while being the least sensitive to occlusions and requiring the lowest execution time.

- **Summary**: Sketching serves as a versatile tool for externalizing ideas, enabling rapid exploration and visual communication that spans various disciplines. While artificial systems have driven substantial advances in content creation and human-computer interaction, capturing the dynamic and abstract nature of human sketching remains challenging. In this work, we introduce SketchAgent, a language-driven, sequential sketch generation method that enables users to create, modify, and refine sketches through dynamic, conversational interactions. Our approach requires no training or fine-tuning. Instead, we leverage the sequential nature and rich prior knowledge of off-the-shelf multimodal large language models (LLMs). We present an intuitive sketching language, introduced to the model through in-context examples, enabling it to "draw" using string-based actions. These are processed into vector graphics and then rendered to create a sketch on a pixel canvas, which can be accessed again for further tasks. By drawing stroke by stroke, our agent captures the evolving, dynamic qualities intrinsic to sketching. We demonstrate that SketchAgent can generate sketches from diverse prompts, engage in dialogue-driven drawing, and collaborate meaningfully with human users.

- **Summary**: To accelerate the inference of heavy Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), this study rethinks the current landscape of training-free token reduction research. We regret to find that the critical components of existing methods are tightly intertwined, with their interconnections and effects remaining unclear for comparison, transfer, and expansion. Therefore, we propose a unified ''filter-correlate-compress'' paradigm that decomposes the token reduction into three distinct stages within a pipeline, maintaining consistent design objectives and elements while allowing for unique implementations. We additionally demystify the popular works and subsume them into our paradigm to showcase its universality. Finally, we offer a suite of methods grounded in the paradigm, striking a balance between speed and accuracy throughout different phases of the inference. Experimental results across 10 benchmarks indicate that our methods can achieve up to an 82.4% reduction in FLOPs with a minimal impact on performance, simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art training-free methods.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based models for All-In-One Image Restoration (AIOR) have achieved significant advancements in recent years. However, their practical applicability is limited by poor generalization to samples outside the training distribution. This limitation arises primarily from insufficient diversity in degradation variations and scenes within existing datasets, resulting in inadequate representations of real-world scenarios. Additionally, capturing large-scale real-world paired data for degradations such as haze, low-light, and raindrops is often cumbersome and sometimes infeasible. In this paper, we leverage the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to synthesize high-quality degraded images from their clean counterparts. Specifically, we introduce GenDeg, a degradation and intensity-aware conditional diffusion model capable of producing diverse degradation patterns on clean images. Using GenDeg, we synthesize over 550k samples across six degradation types: haze, rain, snow, motion blur, low-light, and raindrops. These generated samples are integrated with existing datasets to form the GenDS dataset, comprising over 750k samples. Our experiments reveal that image restoration models trained on the GenDS dataset exhibit significant improvements in out-of-distribution performance compared to those trained solely on existing datasets. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive analyses on the implications of diffusion model-based synthetic degradations for AIOR. The code will be made publicly available.



### Visatronic: A Multimodal Decoder-Only Model for Speech Synthesis

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a new task -- generating speech from videos of people and their transcripts (VTTS) -- to motivate new techniques for multimodal speech generation. This task generalizes the task of generating speech from cropped lip videos, and is also more complicated than the task of generating generic audio clips (e.g., dog barking) from videos and text. Multilingual versions of the task could lead to new techniques for cross-lingual dubbing. We also present a decoder-only multimodal model for this task, which we call Visatronic. This model embeds vision, text and speech directly into the common subspace of a transformer model and uses an autoregressive loss to learn a generative model of discretized mel-spectrograms conditioned on speaker videos and transcripts of their speech. By embedding all modalities into a common subspace, Visatronic can achieve improved results over models that use only text or video as input. Further, it presents a much simpler approach for multimodal speech generation compared to prevailing approaches which rely on lip-detectors and complicated architectures to fuse modalities while producing better results. Since the model is flexible enough to accommodate different ways of ordering inputs as a sequence, we carefully explore different strategies to better understand the best way to propagate information to the generative steps. To facilitate further research on VTTS, we will release (i) our code, (ii) clean transcriptions for the large-scale VoxCeleb2 dataset, and (iii) a standardized evaluation protocol for VTTS incorporating both objective and subjective metrics.

- **Summary**: Image-based relighting of indoor rooms creates an immersive virtual understanding of the space, which is useful for interior design, virtual staging, and real estate. Relighting indoor rooms from a single image is especially challenging due to complex illumination interactions between multiple lights and cluttered objects featuring a large variety in geometrical and material complexity. Recently, generative models have been successfully applied to image-based relighting conditioned on a target image or a latent code, albeit without detailed local lighting control. In this paper, we introduce ScribbleLight, a generative model that supports local fine-grained control of lighting effects through scribbles that describe changes in lighting. Our key technical novelty is an Albedo-conditioned Stable Image Diffusion model that preserves the intrinsic color and texture of the original image after relighting and an encoder-decoder-based ControlNet architecture that enables geometry-preserving lighting effects with normal map and scribble annotations. We demonstrate ScribbleLight's ability to create different lighting effects (e.g., turning lights on/off, adding highlights, cast shadows, or indirect lighting from unseen lights) from sparse scribble annotations.

- **Summary**: Current diffusion models for human image animation struggle to ensure identity (ID) consistency. This paper presents StableAnimator, the first end-to-end ID-preserving video diffusion framework, which synthesizes high-quality videos without any post-processing, conditioned on a reference image and a sequence of poses. Building upon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator contains carefully designed modules for both training and inference striving for identity consistency. In particular, StableAnimator begins by computing image and face embeddings with off-the-shelf extractors, respectively and face embeddings are further refined by interacting with image embeddings using a global content-aware Face Encoder. Then, StableAnimator introduces a novel distribution-aware ID Adapter that prevents interference caused by temporal layers while preserving ID via alignment. During inference, we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation-based optimization to further enhance the face quality. We demonstrate that solving the HJB equation can be integrated into the diffusion denoising process, and the resulting solution constrains the denoising path and thus benefits ID preservation. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show the effectiveness of StableAnimator both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Generating sound effects for videos often requires creating artistic sound effects that diverge significantly from real-life sources and flexible control in the sound design. To address this problem, we introduce MultiFoley, a model designed for video-guided sound generation that supports multimodal conditioning through text, audio, and video. Given a silent video and a text prompt, MultiFoley allows users to create clean sounds (e.g., skateboard wheels spinning without wind noise) or more whimsical sounds (e.g., making a lion's roar sound like a cat's meow). MultiFoley also allows users to choose reference audio from sound effects (SFX) libraries or partial videos for conditioning. A key novelty of our model lies in its joint training on both internet video datasets with low-quality audio and professional SFX recordings, enabling high-quality, full-bandwidth (48kHz) audio generation. Through automated evaluations and human studies, we demonstrate that MultiFoley successfully generates synchronized high-quality sounds across varied conditional inputs and outperforms existing methods.
