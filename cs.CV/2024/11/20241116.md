- **Summary**: Bird's eye view (BEV)-based 3D perception plays a crucial role in autonomous driving applications. The rise of large language models has spurred interest in BEV-based captioning to understand object behavior in the surrounding environment. However, existing approaches treat perception and captioning as separate tasks, focusing on the performance of only one of the tasks and overlooking the potential benefits of multimodal alignment. To bridge this gap between modalities, we introduce MTA, a novel multimodal task alignment framework that boosts both BEV perception and captioning. MTA consists of two key components: (1) BEV-Language Alignment (BLA), a contextual learning mechanism that aligns the BEV scene representations with ground-truth language representations, and (2) Detection-Captioning Alignment (DCA), a cross-modal prompting mechanism that aligns detection and captioning outputs. MTA integrates into state-of-the-art baselines during training, adding no extra computational complexity at runtime. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and TOD3Cap datasets show that MTA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 4.9% improvement in perception and a 9.2% improvement in captioning. These results underscore the effectiveness of unified alignment in reconciling BEV-based perception and captioning.

- **Summary**: The emergence and growing popularity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significant potential to enhance various aspects of daily life, from improving communication to facilitating learning and problem-solving. Mobile phones, as essential daily companions, represent the most effective and accessible deployment platform for MLLMs, enabling seamless integration into everyday tasks. However, deploying MLLMs on mobile phones presents challenges due to limitations in memory size and computational capability, making it difficult to achieve smooth and real-time processing without extensive optimization. In this paper, we present BlueLM-V-3B, an algorithm and system co-design approach specifically tailored for the efficient deployment of MLLMs on mobile platforms. To be specific, we redesign the dynamic resolution scheme adopted by mainstream MLLMs and implement system optimization for hardware-aware deployment to optimize model inference on mobile phones. BlueLM-V-3B boasts the following key highlights: (1) Small Size: BlueLM-V-3B features a language model with 2.7B parameters and a vision encoder with 400M parameters. (2) Fast Speed: BlueLM-V-3B achieves a generation speed of 24.4 token/s on the MediaTek Dimensity 9300 processor with 4-bit LLM weight quantization. (3) Strong Performance: BlueLM-V-3B has attained the highest average score of 66.1 on the OpenCompass benchmark among models with $\leq$ 4B parameters and surpassed a series of models with much larger parameter sizes (e.g., MiniCPM-V-2.6, InternVL2-8B).

- **Summary**: Iterative methods such as iterative closest point (ICP) for point cloud registration often suffer from bad local optimality (e.g. saddle points), due to the nature of nonconvex optimization. To address this fundamental challenge, in this paper we propose learning to form the loss landscape of a deep iterative method w.r.t. predictions at test time into a convex-like shape locally around each ground truth given data, namely Deep Loss Convexification (DLC), thanks to the overparametrization in neural networks. To this end, we formulate our learning objective based on adversarial training by manipulating the ground-truth predictions, rather than input data. In particular, we propose using star-convexity, a family of structured nonconvex functions that are unimodal on all lines that pass through a global minimizer, as our geometric constraint for reshaping loss landscapes, leading to (1) extra novel hinge losses appended to the original loss and (2) near-optimal predictions. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance using DLC with existing network architectures for the tasks of training recurrent neural networks (RNNs), 3D point cloud registration, and multimodel image alignment.

- **Summary**: The practical applications of Wasserstein distances (WDs) are constrained by their sample and computational complexities. Sliced-Wasserstein distances (SWDs) provide a workaround by projecting distributions onto one-dimensional subspaces, leveraging the more efficient, closed-form WDs for one-dimensional distributions. However, in high dimensions, most random projections become uninformative due to the concentration of measure phenomenon. Although several SWD variants have been proposed to focus on \textit{informative} slices, they often introduce additional complexity, numerical instability, and compromise desirable theoretical (metric) properties of SWD. Amidst the growing literature that focuses on directly modifying the slicing distribution, which often face challenges, we revisit the classical Sliced-Wasserstein and propose instead to rescale the 1D Wasserstein to make all slices equally informative. Importantly, we show that with an appropriate data assumption and notion of \textit{slice informativeness}, rescaling for all individual slices simplifies to \textbf{a single global scaling factor} on the SWD. This, in turn, translates to the standard learning rate search for gradient-based learning in common machine learning workflows. We perform extensive experiments across various machine learning tasks showing that the classical SWD, when properly configured, can often match or surpass the performance of more complex variants. We then answer the following question: "Is Sliced-Wasserstein all you need for common learning tasks?"

- **Summary**: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a significant mental health challenge that affects individuals exposed to traumatic events. Early detection and effective intervention for PTSD are crucial, as it can lead to long-term psychological distress if untreated. Accurate detection of PTSD is essential for timely and targeted mental health interventions, especially in disaster-affected populations. Existing research has explored machine learning approaches for classifying PTSD, but many face limitations in terms of model performance and generalizability. To address these issues, we implemented a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline. This included data cleaning, missing value treatment using the SimpleImputer, label encoding of categorical variables, data augmentation using SMOTE to balance the dataset, and feature scaling with StandardScaler. The dataset was split into 80\% training and 20\% testing. We developed an ensemble model using a majority voting technique among several classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and a customized Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The ensemble model achieved an accuracy of 96.76\% with a benchmark dataset, significantly outperforming individual models. The proposed method's advantages include improved robustness through the combination of multiple models, enhanced ability to generalize across diverse data points, and increased accuracy in detecting PTSD. Additionally, the use of SMOTE for data augmentation ensured better handling of imbalanced datasets, leading to more reliable predictions. The proposed approach offers valuable insights for policymakers and healthcare providers by leveraging predictive analytics to address mental health issues in vulnerable populations, particularly those affected by disasters.

- **Summary**: The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls over 60 years ago is widely regarded as one of the greatest archaeological breakthroughs in modern history. Recent study of the scrolls presents ongoing computational challenges, including determining the provenance of fragments, clustering fragments based on their degree of similarity, and pairing fragments that originate from the same manuscript -- all tasks that require focusing on individual letter and fragment shapes. This paper presents a computational method for segmenting ink and parchment regions in multispectral images of Dead Sea Scroll fragments. Using the newly developed Qumran Segmentation Dataset (QSD) consisting of 20 fragments, we apply multispectral thresholding to isolate ink and parchment regions based on their unique spectral signatures. To refine segmentation accuracy, we introduce an energy minimization technique that leverages ink contours, which are more distinguishable from the background and less noisy than inner ink regions. Experimental results demonstrate that this Multispectral Thresholding and Energy Minimization (MTEM) method achieves significant improvements over traditional binarization approaches like Otsu and Sauvola in parchment segmentation and is successful at delineating ink borders, in distinction from holes and background regions.

- **Summary**: As the research of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) becomes popular, an advancing MLLM model is typically required to handle various textual and visual tasks (e.g., VQA, Detection, OCR, and ChartQA) simultaneously for real-world applications. However, due to the significant differences in representation and distribution among data from various tasks, simply mixing data of all tasks together leads to the well-known``multi-task conflict" issue, resulting in performance degradation across various tasks. To address this issue, we propose Awaker2.5-VL, a Mixture of Experts~(MoE) architecture suitable for MLLM, which acquires the multi-task capabilities through multiple sparsely activated experts. To speed up the training and inference of Awaker2.5-VL, each expert in our model is devised as a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) structure. Extensive experiments on multiple latest benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of Awaker2.5-VL. The code and model weight are released in our Project Page: https://github.com/MetabrainAGI/Awaker.

- **Summary**: Euclidean representation learning methods have achieved commendable results in image fusion tasks, which can be attributed to their clear advantages in handling with linear space. However, data collected from a realistic scene usually have a non-Euclidean structure, where Euclidean metric might be limited in representing the true data relationships, degrading fusion performance. To address this issue, a novel SPD (symmetric positive definite) manifold learning framework is proposed for multi-modal image fusion, named SPDFusion, which extends the image fusion approach from the Euclidean space to the SPD manifolds. Specifically, we encode images according to the Riemannian geometry to exploit their intrinsic statistical correlations, thereby aligning with human visual perception. Actually, the SPD matrix underpins our network learning, with a cross-modal fusion strategy employed to harness modality-specific dependencies and augment complementary information. Subsequently, an attention module is designed to process the learned weight matrix, facilitating the weighting of spatial global correlation semantics via SPD matrix multiplication. Based on this, we design an end-to-end fusion network based on cross-modal manifold learning. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our framework exhibits superior performance compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.



### Underwater Image Enhancement with Cascaded Contrastive Learning

- **Summary**: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) is a highly challenging task due to the complexity of underwater environment and the diversity of underwater image degradation. Due to the application of deep learning, current UIE methods have made significant progress. Most of the existing deep learning-based UIE methods follow a single-stage network which cannot effectively address the diverse degradations simultaneously. In this paper, we propose to address this issue by designing a two-stage deep learning framework and taking advantage of cascaded contrastive learning to guide the network training of each stage. The proposed method is called CCL-Net in short. Specifically, the proposed CCL-Net involves two cascaded stages, i.e., a color correction stage tailored to the color deviation issue and a haze removal stage tailored to improve the visibility and contrast of underwater images. To guarantee the underwater image can be progressively enhanced, we also apply contrastive loss as an additional constraint to guide the training of each stage. In the first stage, the raw underwater images are used as negative samples for building the first contrastive loss, ensuring the enhanced results of the first color correction stage are better than the original inputs. While in the second stage, the enhanced results rather than the raw underwater images of the first color correction stage are used as the negative samples for building the second contrastive loss, thus ensuring the final enhanced results of the second haze removal stage are better than the intermediate color corrected results. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CCL-Net can achieve superior performance compared to many state-of-the-art methods. The source code of CCL-Net will be released at https://github.com/lewis081/CCL-Net.

- **Summary**: Chest X-ray imaging is a widely accessible and non-invasive diagnostic tool for detecting thoracic abnormalities. While numerous AI models assist radiologists in interpreting these images, most overlook patients' historical data. To bridge this gap, we introduce Temporal MIMIC dataset, which integrates five years of patient history, including radiographic scans and reports from MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-IV, encompassing 12,221 patients and thirteen pathologies. Building on this, we present HIST-AID, a framework that enhances automatic diagnostic accuracy using historical reports. HIST-AID emulates the radiologist's comprehensive approach, leveraging historical data to improve diagnostic accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with AUROC increasing by 6.56% and AUPRC by 9.51% compared to models that rely solely on radiographic scans. These gains were consistently observed across diverse demographic groups, including variations in gender, age, and racial categories. We show that while recent data boost performance, older data may reduce accuracy due to changes in patient conditions. Our work paves the potential of incorporating historical data for more reliable automatic diagnosis, providing critical support for clinical decision-making.



### From Prototypes to General Distributions: An Efficient Curriculum for Masked Image Modeling

- **Summary**: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has emerged as a powerful self-supervised learning paradigm for visual representation learning, enabling models to acquire rich visual representations by predicting masked portions of images from their visible regions. While this approach has shown promising results, we hypothesize that its effectiveness may be limited by optimization challenges during early training stages, where models are expected to learn complex image distributions from partial observations before developing basic visual processing capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a prototype-driven curriculum leagrning framework that structures the learning process to progress from prototypical examples to more complex variations in the dataset. Our approach introduces a temperature-based annealing scheme that gradually expands the training distribution, enabling more stable and efficient learning trajectories. Through extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, we demonstrate that our curriculum learning strategy significantly improves both training efficiency and representation quality while requiring substantially fewer training epochs compared to standard Masked Auto-Encoding. Our findings suggest that carefully controlling the order of training examples plays a crucial role in self-supervised visual learning, providing a practical solution to the early-stage optimization challenges in MIM.

- **Summary**: Spurious features associated with class labels can lead image classifiers to rely on shortcuts that don't generalize well to new domains. This is especially problematic in medical settings, where biased models fail when applied to different hospitals or systems. In such cases, data-driven methods to reduce spurious correlations are preferred, as clinicians can directly validate the modified images. While Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (Diffusion Models) show promise for natural images, they are impractical for medical use due to the difficulty of describing spurious medical features. To address this, we propose Masked Medical Image Inpainting (MaskMedPaint), which uses text-to-image diffusion models to augment training images by inpainting areas outside key classification regions to match the target domain. We demonstrate that MaskMedPaint enhances generalization to target domains across both natural (Waterbirds, iWildCam) and medical (ISIC 2018, Chest X-ray) datasets, given limited unlabeled target images.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel and efficient logit distillation method, Multi-perspective Contrastive Logit Distillation (MCLD), which leverages contrastive learning to distill logits from multiple perspectives in knowledge distillation. Recent research on logit distillation has primarily focused on maximizing the information learned from the teacher model's logits to enhance the performance of the student model. To this end, we propose MCLD, which consists of three key components: Instance-wise CLD, Sample-wise CLD, and Category-wise CLD. These components are designed to facilitate the transfer of more information from the teacher's logits to the student model. Comprehensive evaluations on image classification tasks using CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, alongside representation transferability assessments on STL-10 and Tiny-ImageNet, highlight the significant advantages of our method. The knowledge distillation with our MCLD, surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods.



### Diffusion-based Layer-wise Semantic Reconstruction for Unsupervised Out-of-Distribution Detection

- **Summary**: Unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to identify out-of-domain data by learning only from unlabeled In-Distribution (ID) training samples, which is crucial for developing a safe real-world machine learning system. Current reconstruction-based methods provide a good alternative approach by measuring the reconstruction error between the input and its corresponding generative counterpart in the pixel/feature space. However, such generative methods face a key dilemma: improving the reconstruction power of the generative model while keeping a compact representation of the ID data. To address this issue, we propose the diffusion-based layer-wise semantic reconstruction approach for unsupervised OOD detection. The innovation of our approach is that we leverage the diffusion model's intrinsic data reconstruction ability to distinguish ID samples from OOD samples in the latent feature space. Moreover, to set up a comprehensive and discriminative feature representation, we devise a multi-layer semantic feature extraction strategy. By distorting the extracted features with Gaussian noise and applying the diffusion model for feature reconstruction, the separation of ID and OOD samples is implemented according to the reconstruction errors. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmarks built upon various datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of detection accuracy and speed.

- **Summary**: Image restoration models often face the simultaneous interaction of multiple degradations in real-world scenarios. Existing approaches typically handle single or composite degradations based on scene descriptors derived from text or image embeddings. However, due to the varying proportions of different degradations within an image, these scene descriptors may not accurately differentiate between degradations, leading to suboptimal restoration in practical applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel Transformer-based restoration framework, AllRestorer. In AllRestorer, we enable the model to adaptively consider all image impairments, thereby avoiding errors from scene descriptor misdirection. Specifically, we introduce an All-in-One Transformer Block (AiOTB), which adaptively removes all degradations present in a given image by modeling the relationships between all degradations and the image embedding in latent space. To accurately address different variations potentially present within the same type of degradation and minimize ambiguity, AiOTB utilizes a composite scene descriptor consisting of both image and text embeddings to define the degradation. Furthermore, AiOTB includes an adaptive weight for each degradation, allowing for precise control of the restoration intensity. By leveraging AiOTB, AllRestorer avoids misdirection caused by inaccurate scene descriptors, achieving a 5.00 dB increase in PSNR compared to the baseline on the CDD-11 dataset.

- **Summary**: With the development of digital imaging in medical microscopy, artificial intelligent-based analysis of pathological whole slide images (WSIs) provides a powerful tool for cancer diagnosis. Limited by the expensive cost of pixel-level annotation, current research primarily focuses on representation learning with slide-level labels, showing success in various downstream tasks. However, given the diversity of lesion types and the complex relationships between each other, these techniques still deserve further exploration in addressing advanced pathology tasks. To this end, we introduce the concept of hierarchical pathological image classification and propose a representation learning called PathTree. PathTree considers the multi-classification of diseases as a binary tree structure. Each category is represented as a professional pathological text description, which messages information with a tree-like encoder. The interactive text features are then used to guide the aggregation of hierarchical multiple representations. PathTree uses slide-text similarity to obtain probability scores and introduces two extra tree specific losses to further constrain the association between texts and slides. Through extensive experiments on three challenging hierarchical classification datasets: in-house cryosectioned lung tissue lesion identification, public prostate cancer grade assessment, and public breast cancer subtyping, our proposed PathTree is consistently competitive compared to the state-of-the-art methods and provides a new perspective on the deep learning-assisted solution for more complex WSI classification.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal sensor fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation has become the leading approach in 3D object detection. However, existing methods often rely on depth estimators or transformer encoders for view transformation, incurring substantial computational overhead. Furthermore, the lack of precise geometric correspondence between 2D and 3D spaces leads to spatial and ray-directional misalignments, restricting the effectiveness of BEV representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 3D object detector via efficient view transformation (EVT), which leverages a well-structured BEV representation to enhance accuracy and efficiency. EVT focuses on two main areas. First, it employs Adaptive Sampling and Adaptive Projection (ASAP), using LiDAR guidance to generate 3D sampling points and adaptive kernels. The generated points and kernels are then used to facilitate the transformation of image features into BEV space and refine the BEV features. Second, EVT includes an improved transformer-based detection framework, which contains a group-wise query initialization method and an enhanced query update framework. It is designed to effectively utilize the obtained multi-modal BEV features within the transformer decoder. By leveraging the geometric properties of object queries, this framework significantly enhances detection performance, especially in a multi-layer transformer decoder structure. EVT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes test set with real-time inference speed.

- **Summary**: We developed a shoe-mounted gait monitoring system capable of tracking up to 17 gait parameters, including gait length, step time, stride velocity, and others. The system employs a stereo camera mounted on one shoe to track a marker placed on the opposite shoe, enabling the estimation of spatial gait parameters. Additionally, a Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) affixed to the heel of the shoe, combined with a custom-designed algorithm, is utilized to measure temporal gait parameters. Through testing on multiple participants and comparison with the gait mat, the proposed gait monitoring system exhibited notable performance, with the accuracy of all measured gait parameters exceeding 93.61%. The system also demonstrated a low drift of 4.89% during long-distance walking. A gait identification task conducted on participants using a trained Transformer model achieved 95.7% accuracy on the dataset collected by the proposed system, demonstrating that our hardware has the potential to collect long-sequence gait data suitable for integration with current Large Language Models (LLMs). The system is cost-effective, user-friendly, and well-suited for real-life measurements.

- **Summary**: Existing studies for gait recognition primarily utilized sequences of either binary silhouette or human parsing to encode the shapes and dynamics of persons during walking. Silhouettes exhibit accurate segmentation quality and robustness to environmental variations, but their low information entropy may result in sub-optimal performance. In contrast, human parsing provides fine-grained part segmentation with higher information entropy, but the segmentation quality may deteriorate due to the complex environments. To discover the advantages of silhouette and parsing and overcome their limitations, this paper proposes a novel cross-granularity alignment gait recognition method, named XGait, to unleash the power of gait representations of different granularity. To achieve this goal, the XGait first contains two branches of backbone encoders to map the silhouette sequences and the parsing sequences into two latent spaces, respectively. Moreover, to explore the complementary knowledge across the features of two representations, we design the Global Cross-granularity Module (GCM) and the Part Cross-granularity Module (PCM) after the two encoders. In particular, the GCM aims to enhance the quality of parsing features by leveraging global features from silhouettes, while the PCM aligns the dynamics of human parts between silhouette and parsing features using the high information entropy in parsing sequences. In addition, to effectively guide the alignment of two representations with different granularity at the part level, an elaborate-designed learnable division mechanism is proposed for the parsing features. Comprehensive experiments on two large-scale gait datasets not only show the superior performance of XGait with the Rank-1 accuracy of 80.5% on Gait3D and 88.3% CCPG but also reflect the robustness of the learned features even under challenging conditions like occlusions and cloth changes.

- **Summary**: We firstly present a diffusion-based action recognition with zero-shot learning for skeleton inputs. In zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition, aligning skeleton features with the text features of action labels is essential for accurately predicting unseen actions. Previous methods focus on direct alignment between skeleton and text latent spaces, but the modality gaps between these spaces hinder robust generalization learning. Motivated from the remarkable performance of text-to-image diffusion models, we leverage their alignment capabilities between different modalities mostly by focusing on the training process during reverse diffusion rather than using their generative power. Based on this, our framework is designed as a Triplet Diffusion for Skeleton-Text Matching (TDSM) method which aligns skeleton features with text prompts through reverse diffusion, embedding the prompts into the unified skeleton-text latent space to achieve robust matching. To enhance discriminative power, we introduce a novel triplet diffusion (TD) loss that encourages our TDSM to correct skeleton-text matches while pushing apart incorrect ones. Our TDSM significantly outperforms the very recent state-of-the-art methods with large margins of 2.36%-point to 13.05%-point, demonstrating superior accuracy and scalability in zero-shot settings through effective skeleton-text matching.

- **Summary**: Chest X-rays (CXRs) often display various diseases with disparate class frequencies, leading to a long-tailed, multi-label data distribution. In response to this challenge, we explore the Pruned MIMIC-CXR-LT dataset, a curated collection derived from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, specifically designed to represent a long-tailed and multi-label data scenario. We introduce LTCXNet, a novel framework that integrates the ConvNeXt model, ML-Decoder, and strategic data augmentation, further enhanced by an ensemble approach. We demonstrate that LTCXNet improves the performance of CXR interpretation across all classes, especially enhancing detection in rarer classes like `Pneumoperitoneum' and `Pneumomediastinum' by 79\% and 48\%, respectively. Beyond performance metrics, our research extends into evaluating fairness, highlighting that some methods, while improving model accuracy, could inadvertently affect fairness across different demographic groups negatively. This work contributes to advancing the understanding and management of long-tailed, multi-label data distributions in medical imaging, paving the way for more equitable and effective diagnostic tools.

- **Summary**: Advances in optical microscopy scanning have significantly contributed to computational pathology (CPath) by converting traditional histopathological slides into whole slide images (WSIs). This development enables comprehensive digital reviews by pathologists and accelerates AI-driven diagnostic support for WSI analysis. Recent advances in foundational pathology models have increased the need for benchmarking tasks. The Camelyon series is one of the most widely used open-source datasets in computational pathology. However, the quality, accessibility, and clinical relevance of the labels have not been comprehensively evaluated. In this study, we reprocessed 1,399 WSIs and labels from the Camelyon-16 and Camelyon-17 datasets, removing low-quality slides, correcting erroneous labels, and providing expert pixel annotations for tumor regions in the previously unreleased test set. Based on the sizes of re-annotated tumor regions, we upgraded the binary cancer screening task to a four-class task: negative, micro-metastasis, macro-metastasis, and Isolated Tumor Cells (ITC). We reevaluated pre-trained pathology feature extractors and multiple instance learning (MIL) methods using the cleaned dataset, providing a benchmark that advances AI development in histopathology.

- **Summary**: We introduce and demonstrate a new paradigm for quantitative parameter mapping in MRI. Parameter mapping techniques, such as diffusion MRI and quantitative MRI, have the potential to robustly and repeatably measure biologically-relevant tissue maps that strongly relate to underlying microstructure. Quantitative maps are calculated by fitting a model to multiple images, e.g. with least-squares or machine learning. However, the overwhelming majority of model fitting techniques assume that each voxel is independent, ignoring any co-dependencies in the data. This makes model fitting sensitive to voxelwise measurement noise, hampering reliability and repeatability. We propose a self-supervised deep variational approach that breaks the assumption of independent pixels, leveraging redundancies in the data to effectively perform data-driven regularisation of quantitative maps. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms current model fitting techniques in dMRI simulations and real data. Especially with a Gaussian mixture prior, our model enables sharper quantitative maps, revealing finer anatomical details that are not presented in the baselines. Our approach can hence support the clinical adoption of parameter mapping methods such as dMRI and qMRI.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in neural camera imaging pipelines have demonstrated notable progress. Nevertheless, the real-world imaging pipeline still faces challenges including the lack of joint optimization in system components, computational redundancies, and optical distortions such as lens shading.In light of this, we propose an end-to-end camera imaging pipeline (RealCamNet) to enhance real-world camera imaging performance. Our methodology diverges from conventional, fragmented multi-stage image signal processing towards end-to-end architecture. This architecture facilitates joint optimization across the full pipeline and the restoration of coordinate-biased distortions. RealCamNet is designed for high-quality conversion from RAW to RGB and compact image compression. Specifically, we deeply analyze coordinate-dependent optical distortions, e.g., vignetting and dark shading, and design a novel Coordinate-Aware Distortion Restoration (CADR) module to restore coordinate-biased distortions. Furthermore, we propose a Coordinate-Independent Mapping Compression (CIMC) module to implement tone mapping and redundant information compression. Existing datasets suffer from misalignment and overly idealized conditions, making them inadequate for training real-world imaging pipelines. Therefore, we collected a real-world imaging dataset. Experiment results show that RealCamNet achieves the best rate-distortion performance with lower inference latency.

- **Summary**: The rise of HDR-WCG display devices has highlighted the need to convert SDRTV to HDRTV, as most video sources are still in SDR. Existing methods primarily focus on designing neural networks to learn a single-style mapping from SDRTV to HDRTV. However, the limited information in SDRTV and the diversity of styles in real-world conversions render this process an ill-posed problem, thereby constraining the performance and generalization of these methods. Inspired by generative approaches, we propose a novel method for SDRTV to HDRTV conversion guided by real HDRTV priors. Despite the limited information in SDRTV, introducing real HDRTV as reference priors significantly constrains the solution space of the originally high-dimensional ill-posed problem. This shift transforms the task from solving an unreferenced prediction problem to making a referenced selection, thereby markedly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the conversion process. Specifically, our approach comprises two stages: the first stage employs a Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network to capture HDRTV priors, while the second stage matches these priors to the input SDRTV content to recover realistic HDRTV outputs. We evaluate our method on public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness with significant improvements in both objective and subjective metrics across real and synthetic datasets.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) develop at an unprecedented pace, supported by thorough theoretical exploration and empirical analysis. Unfortunately, the discrepancy between DMs and autoregressive models (ARMs) complicates the path toward achieving the goal of unified vision and language generation. Recently, the masked generative Transformer (MGT) serves as a promising intermediary between DM and ARM by predicting randomly masked image tokens (i.e., masked image modeling), combining the efficiency of DM with the discrete token nature of ARM. However, we find that the comprehensive analyses regarding the inference for MGT are virtually non-existent, and thus we aim to present positive design choices to fill this gap. We modify and re-design a set of DM-based inference techniques for MGT and further elucidate their performance on MGT. We also discuss the approach to correcting token's distribution to enhance inference. Extensive experiments and empirical analyses lead to concrete and effective design choices, and these design choices can be merged to achieve further performance gains. For instance, in terms of enhanced inference, we achieve winning rates of approximately 70% compared to vanilla sampling on HPS v2 with the recent SOTA MGT Meissonic. Our contributions have the potential to further enhance the capabilities and future development of MGTs.

- **Summary**: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery provides robust environmental and temporal coverage (e.g., during clouds, seasons, day-night cycles), yet its noise and unique structural patterns pose interpretation challenges, especially for non-experts. SAR-to-EO (Electro-Optical) image translation (SET) has emerged to make SAR images more perceptually interpretable. However, traditional approaches trained from scratch on limited SAR-EO datasets are prone to overfitting. To address these challenges, we introduce Confidence Diffusion for SAR-to-EO Translation, called C-DiffSET, a framework leveraging pretrained Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) extensively trained on natural images, thus enabling effective adaptation to the EO domain. Remarkably, we find that the pretrained VAE encoder aligns SAR and EO images in the same latent space, even with varying noise levels in SAR inputs. To further improve pixel-wise fidelity for SET, we propose a confidence-guided diffusion (C-Diff) loss that mitigates artifacts from temporal discrepancies, such as appearing or disappearing objects, thereby enhancing structural accuracy. C-DiffSET achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple datasets, significantly outperforming the very recent image-to-image translation methods and SET methods with large margins.

- **Summary**: Radiology reporting generative AI holds significant potential to alleviate clinical workloads and streamline medical care. However, achieving high clinical accuracy is challenging, as radiological images often feature subtle lesions and intricate structures. Existing systems often fall short, largely due to their reliance on fixed size, patch-level image features and insufficient incorporation of pathological information. This can result in the neglect of such subtle patterns and inconsistent descriptions of crucial pathologies. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative approach that leverages pathology-aware regional prompts to explicitly integrate anatomical and pathological information of various scales, significantly enhancing the precision and clinical relevance of generated reports. We develop an anatomical region detector that extracts features from distinct anatomical areas, coupled with a novel multi-label lesion detector that identifies global pathologies. Our approach emulates the diagnostic process of radiologists, producing clinically accurate reports with comprehensive diagnostic capabilities. Experimental results show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on most natural language generation and clinical efficacy metrics, with formal expert evaluations affirming its potential to enhance radiology practice.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical to ensure the safe deployment of deep learning models in critical applications. Deep learning models can often misidentify OOD samples as in-distribution (ID) samples. This vulnerability worsens in the presence of spurious correlation in the training set. Likewise, in fine-grained classification settings, detection of fine-grained OOD samples becomes inherently challenging due to their high similarity to ID samples. However, current research on OOD detection has largely ignored these challenging scenarios, focusing instead on relatively easier (conventional) cases. In this work, we present a unified Approach to Spurious, fine-grained, and Conventional OOD Detection (ASCOOD). First, we propose synthesizing virtual outliers from ID data by approximating the destruction of invariant features. We identify invariant features with the pixel attribution method using the model being learned. This approach eliminates the burden of curating external OOD datasets. Then, we simultaneously incentivize ID classification and predictive uncertainty towards the virtual outliers leveraging standardized feature representation. Our approach effectively mitigates the impact of spurious correlations and encourages capturing fine-grained attributes. Extensive experiments across six datasets demonstrate the merit of ASCOOD in spurious, fine-grained, and conventional settings. The code is available at: https://github.com/sudarshanregmi/ASCOOD/

- **Summary**: Real-world image super-resolution (Real SR) aims to generate high-fidelity, detail-rich high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) counterparts. Existing Real SR methods primarily focus on generating details from the LR RGB domain, often leading to a lack of richness or fidelity in fine details. In this paper, we pioneer the use of details hidden in RAW data to complement existing RGB-only methods, yielding superior outputs. We argue that key image processing steps in Image Signal Processing, such as denoising and demosaicing, inherently result in the loss of fine details in LR images, making LR RAW a valuable information source. To validate this, we present RealSR-RAW, a comprehensive dataset comprising over 10,000 pairs with LR and HR RGB images, along with corresponding LR RAW, captured across multiple smartphones under varying focal lengths and diverse scenes. Additionally, we propose a novel, general RAW adapter to efficiently integrate LR RAW data into existing CNNs, Transformers, and Diffusion-based Real SR models by suppressing the noise contained in LR RAW and aligning its distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating RAW data significantly enhances detail recovery and improves Real SR performance across ten evaluation metrics, including both fidelity and perception-oriented metrics. Our findings open a new direction for the Real SR task, with the dataset and code will be made available to support future research.

- **Summary**: We consider the problem of conditional text-to-image synthesis with diffusion models. Most recent works need to either finetune specific parts of the base diffusion model or introduce new trainable parameters, leading to deployment inflexibility due to the need for training. To address this gap in the current literature, we propose our method called TINTIN: Test-time Conditional Text-to-Image Synthesis using Diffusion Models which is a new training-free test-time only algorithm to condition text-to-image diffusion model outputs on conditioning factors such as color palettes and edge maps. In particular, we propose to interpret noise predictions during denoising as gradients of an energy-based model, leading to a flexible approach to manipulate the noise by matching predictions inferred from them to the ground truth conditioning input. This results in, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to control model outputs with input color palettes, which we realize using a novel color distribution matching loss. We also show this test-time noise manipulation can be easily extensible to other types of conditioning, e.g., edge maps. We conduct extensive experiments using a variety of text prompts, color palettes, and edge maps and demonstrate significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: The vision tokens in multimodal large language models usually exhibit significant spatial and temporal redundancy and take up most of the input tokens, which harms their inference efficiency. To solve this problem, some recent works were introduced to drop the unimportant tokens during inference where the importance of each token is decided only by the information in either the vision encoding stage or the prefilling stage. In this paper, we propose Multi-stage Token Dropping (MustDrop) to measure the importance of each token from the whole lifecycle, including the vision encoding stage, prefilling stage, and decoding stage. Concretely, in the visual encoding stage, MustDrop merges spatially adjacent tokens with high similarity, and establishes a key token set to retain the most vision-critical tokens, preventing them from being discarded in later stages. In the prefilling stage, MustDrop further compresses vision tokens by the guidance of text semantics, with a dual-attention filtering strategy. In the decoding stage, an output-aware cache policy is proposed to further reduce the size of the KV cache. By leveraging tailored strategies in the multi-stage process, MustDrop can more precisely recognize the important and redundant tokens, thus achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. For instance, MustDrop reduces about 88.5\% FLOPs on LLaVA with a compression ratio of 92.2\% while maintaining comparable accuracy.

- **Summary**: While deep learning-based Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis has recently made significant advancements, particularly in predicting the conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD based on MRI images, there remains a critical gap in research regarding the group robustness of the diagnosis. Although numerous studies pointed out that deep learning-based classifiers may exhibit poor performance in certain groups by relying on unimportant attributes, this issue has been largely overlooked in the early diagnosis of MCI to AD conversion. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation of the group robustness in the early diagnosis of MCI to AD conversion using MRI images, focusing on disparities in accuracy between groups, specifically sMCI and pMCI individuals divided by age. Our experiments reveal that standard classifiers consistently underperform for certain groups across different architectures, highlighting the need for more tailored approaches. To address this, we propose a novel method, dubbed DEAL (DEcoupled classifier with Adaptive Linear modulation), comprising two key components: (1) a linear modulation of features from the penultimate layer, incorporating easily obtainable age and cognitive indicative tabular features, and (2) a decoupled classifier that provides more tailored decision boundaries for each group, further improving performance. Through extensive experiments and evaluations across different architectures, we demonstrate the efficacy of DEAL in improving the group robustness of the MCI to AD conversion prediction.

- **Summary**: Sketch animations offer a powerful medium for visual storytelling, from simple flip-book doodles to professional studio productions. While traditional animation requires teams of skilled artists to draw key frames and in-between frames, existing automation attempts still demand significant artistic effort through precise motion paths or keyframe specification. We present FlipSketch, a system that brings back the magic of flip-book animation -- just draw your idea and describe how you want it to move! Our approach harnesses motion priors from text-to-video diffusion models, adapting them to generate sketch animations through three key innovations: (i) fine-tuning for sketch-style frame generation, (ii) a reference frame mechanism that preserves visual integrity of input sketch through noise refinement, and (iii) a dual-attention composition that enables fluid motion without losing visual consistency. Unlike constrained vector animations, our raster frames support dynamic sketch transformations, capturing the expressive freedom of traditional animation. The result is an intuitive system that makes sketch animation as simple as doodling and describing, while maintaining the artistic essence of hand-drawn animation.

- **Summary**: Recent image-to-3D reconstruction models have greatly advanced geometry generation, but they still struggle to faithfully generate realistic appearance. To address this, we introduce ARM, a novel method that reconstructs high-quality 3D meshes and realistic appearance from sparse-view images. The core of ARM lies in decoupling geometry from appearance, processing appearance within the UV texture space. Unlike previous methods, ARM improves texture quality by explicitly back-projecting measurements onto the texture map and processing them in a UV space module with a global receptive field. To resolve ambiguities between material and illumination in input images, ARM introduces a material prior that encodes semantic appearance information, enhancing the robustness of appearance decomposition. Trained on just 8 H100 GPUs, ARM outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.



### Neighboring Slice Noise2Noise: Self-Supervised Medical Image Denoising from Single Noisy Image Volume

- **Summary**: In the last few years, with the rapid development of deep learning technologies, supervised methods based on convolutional neural networks have greatly enhanced the performance of medical image denoising. However, these methods require large quantities of noisy-clean image pairs for training, which greatly limits their practicality. Although some researchers have attempted to train denoising networks using only single noisy images, existing self-supervised methods, including blind-spot-based and data-splitting-based methods, heavily rely on the assumption that noise is pixel-wise independent. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world medical images. Therefore, in the field of medical imaging, there remains a lack of simple and practical denoising methods that can achieve high-quality denoising performance using only single noisy images. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised medical image denoising method, Neighboring Slice Noise2Noise (NS-N2N). The proposed method utilizes neighboring slices within a single noisy image volume to construct weighted training data, and then trains the denoising network using a self-supervised scheme with regional consistency loss and inter-slice continuity loss. NS-N2N only requires a single noisy image volume obtained from one medical imaging procedure to achieve high-quality denoising of the image volume itself. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising methods in both denoising performance and processing efficiency. Furthermore, since NS-N2N operates solely in the image domain, it is free from device-specific issues such as reconstruction geometry, making it easier to apply in various clinical practices.

- **Summary**: We present a unified controllable video generation approach AnimateAnything that facilitates precise and consistent video manipulation across various conditions, including camera trajectories, text prompts, and user motion annotations. Specifically, we carefully design a multi-scale control feature fusion network to construct a common motion representation for different conditions. It explicitly converts all control information into frame-by-frame optical flows. Then we incorporate the optical flows as motion priors to guide final video generation. In addition, to reduce the flickering issues caused by large-scale motion, we propose a frequency-based stabilization module. It can enhance temporal coherence by ensuring the video's frequency domain consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness around the world and demands precise AI-based diagnostic tools. Traditional loss functions in multi-class classification, such as Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE), are very common but break down with class imbalance, especially in cases with inherently challenging or overlapping classes, which leads to biased and less sensitive models. Since a heavy imbalance exists in the number of examples for higher severity stage 4 diabetic retinopathy, etc., classes compared to those very early stages like class 0, achieving class balance is key. For this purpose, we propose the Adaptive Hybrid Focal-Entropy Loss which combines the ideas of focal loss and entropy loss with adaptive weighting in order to focus on minority classes and highlight the challenging samples. The state-of-the art models applied for diabetic retinopathy detection with AHFE revealed good performance improvements, indicating the top performances of ResNet50 at 99.79%, DenseNet121 at 98.86%, Xception at 98.92%, MobileNetV2 at 97.84%, and InceptionV3 at 93.62% accuracy. This sheds light into how AHFE promotes enhancement in AI-driven diagnostics for complex and imbalanced medical datasets.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel method for discovering systematic errors in segmentation models. For instance, a systematic error in the segmentation model can be a sufficiently large number of misclassifications from the model as a parking meter for a target class of pedestrians. With the rapid deployment of these models in critical applications such as autonomous driving, it is vital to detect and interpret these systematic errors. However, the key challenge is automatically discovering such failures on unlabelled data and forming interpretable semantic sub-groups for intervention. For this, we leverage multimodal foundation models to retrieve errors and use conceptual linkage along with erroneous nature to study the systematic nature of these errors. We demonstrate that such errors are present in SOTA segmentation models (UperNet ConvNeXt and UperNet Swin) trained on the Berkeley Deep Drive and benchmark the approach qualitatively and quantitatively, showing its effectiveness by discovering coherent systematic errors for these models. Our work opens up the avenue to model analysis and intervention that have so far been underexplored in semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: Boundary Representation (B-Rep) is the de facto representation of 3D solids in Computer-Aided Design (CAD). B-Rep solids are defined with a set of NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) surfaces forming a closed volume. To represent a surface, current works often employ the UV-grid approximation, i.e., sample points uniformly on the surface. However, the UV-grid method is not efficient in surface representation and sometimes lacks precision and regularity. In this work, we propose NeuroNURBS, a representation learning method to directly encode the parameters of NURBS surfaces. Our evaluation in solid generation and segmentation tasks indicates that the NeuroNURBS performs comparably and, in some cases, superior to UV-grids, but with a significantly improved efficiency: for training the surface autoencoder, GPU consumption is reduced by 86.7%; memory requirement drops by 79.9% for storing 3D solids. Moreover, adapting BrepGen for solid generation with our NeuroNURBS improves the FID from 30.04 to 27.24, and resolves the undulating issue in generated surfaces.

- **Summary**: Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RSVQA) is a challenging task that involves interpreting complex satellite imagery to answer natural language questions. Traditional approaches often rely on separate visual feature extractors and language processing models, which can be computationally intensive and limited in their ability to handle open-ended questions. In this paper, we propose a novel method that leverages a generative Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to streamline the RSVQA process. Our approach consists of a two-step training strategy: domain-adaptive pretraining and prompt-based finetuning. This method enables the LVLM to generate natural language answers by conditioning on both visual and textual inputs, without the need for predefined answer categories. We evaluate our model on the RSVQAxBEN dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a human evaluation study shows that our method produces answers that are more accurate, relevant, and fluent. The results highlight the potential of generative LVLMs in advancing the field of remote sensing analysis.

- **Summary**: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) plays a crucial role in computer vision, with significant applications in human-computer interaction, affective computing, and areas such as mental health monitoring and personalized learning environments. However, a major challenge in FER task is the class imbalance commonly found in available datasets, which can hinder both model performance and generalization. In this paper, we tackle the issue of data imbalance by incorporating synthetic data augmentation and leveraging the ResEmoteNet model to enhance the overall performance on facial emotion recognition task. We employed Stable Diffusion 2 and Stable Diffusion 3 Medium models to generate synthetic facial emotion data, augmenting the training sets of the FER2013 and RAF-DB benchmark datasets. Training ResEmoteNet with these augmented datasets resulted in substantial performance improvements, achieving accuracies of 96.47% on FER2013 and 99.23% on RAF-DB. These findings shows an absolute improvement of 16.68% in FER2013, 4.47% in RAF-DB and highlight the efficacy of synthetic data augmentation in strengthening FER models and underscore the potential of advanced generative models in FER research and applications.

- **Summary**: Latest developments in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have broadened their capabilities to include video understanding. Specifically, Text-to-video (T2V) models have made significant progress in quality, comprehension, and duration, excelling at creating videos from simple textual prompts. Yet, they still frequently produce hallucinated content that clearly signals the video is AI-generated. We introduce ViBe: a large-scale Text-to-Video Benchmark of hallucinated videos from T2V models. We identify five major types of hallucination: Vanishing Subject, Numeric Variability, Temporal Dysmorphia, Omission Error, and Physical Incongruity. Using 10 open-source T2V models, we developed the first large-scale dataset of hallucinated videos, comprising 3,782 videos annotated by humans into these five categories. ViBe offers a unique resource for evaluating the reliability of T2V models and provides a foundation for improving hallucination detection and mitigation in video generation. We establish classification as a baseline and present various ensemble classifier configurations, with the TimeSFormer + CNN combination yielding the best performance, achieving 0.345 accuracy and 0.342 F1 score. This benchmark aims to drive the development of robust T2V models that produce videos more accurately aligned with input prompts.

- **Summary**: With the growing application of transformer in computer vision, hybrid architecture that combine convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers demonstrates competitive ability in medical image segmentation. However, direct fusion of features from CNNs and transformers often leads to feature imbalance and redundant information. To address these issues, we propose a Feaure Imbalance-Aware Segmentation (FIAS) network, which incorporates a dual-path encoder and a novel Mixing Attention (MixAtt) decoder. The dual-branches encoder integrates a DilateFormer for long-range global feature extraction and a Depthwise Multi-Kernel (DMK) convolution for capturing fine-grained local details. A Context-Aware Fusion (CAF) block dynamically balances the contribution of these global and local features, preventing feature imbalance. The MixAtt decoder further enhances segmentation accuracy by combining self-attention and Monte Carlo attention, enabling the model to capture both small details and large-scale dependencies. Experimental results on the Synapse multi-organ and ACDC datasets demonstrate the strong competitiveness of our approach in medical image segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: Recovering metric depth from a single image remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision, requiring both scene understanding and accurate scaling. While deep learning has advanced monocular depth estimation, current models often struggle with unfamiliar scenes and layouts, particularly in zero-shot scenarios and when predicting scale-ergodic metric depth. We present MetricGold, a novel approach that harnesses generative diffusion model's rich priors to improve metric depth estimation. Building upon recent advances in MariGold, DDVM and Depth Anything V2 respectively, our method combines latent diffusion, log-scaled metric depth representation, and synthetic data training. MetricGold achieves efficient training on a single RTX 3090 within two days using photo-realistic synthetic data from HyperSIM, VirtualKitti, and TartanAir. Our experiments demonstrate robust generalization across diverse datasets, producing sharper and higher quality metric depth estimates compared to existing approaches.

- **Summary**: In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and amid accelerating climate change, emerging infectious diseases, particularly those arising from zoonotic spillover, remain a global threat. Mpox (caused by the monkeypox virus) is a notable example of a zoonotic infection that often goes undiagnosed, especially as its rash progresses through stages, complicating detection across diverse populations with different presentations. In August 2024, the WHO Director-General declared the mpox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern for a second time. Despite the deployment of deep learning techniques for detecting diseases from skin lesion images, a robust and publicly accessible foundation model for mpox diagnosis is still lacking due to the unavailability of open-source mpox skin lesion images, multimodal clinical data, and specialized training pipelines. To address this gap, we propose MpoxVLM, a vision-language model (VLM) designed to detect mpox by analyzing both skin lesion images and patient clinical information. MpoxVLM integrates the CLIP visual encoder, an enhanced Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier for skin lesions, and LLaMA-2-7B models, pre-trained and fine-tuned on visual instruction-following question-answer pairs from our newly released mpox skin lesion dataset. Our work achieves 90.38% accuracy for mpox detection, offering a promising pathway to improve early diagnostic accuracy in combating mpox.

- **Summary**: Incorporating stochasticity into the training process of deep convolutional networks is a widely used technique to reduce overfitting and improve regularization. Existing techniques often require modifying the architecture of the network by adding specialized layers, are effective only to specific network topologies or types of layers - linear or convolutional, and result in a trained model that is different from the deployed one. We present ChannelDropBack, a simple stochastic regularization approach that introduces randomness only into the backward information flow, leaving the forward pass intact. ChannelDropBack randomly selects a subset of channels within the network during the backpropagation step and applies weight updates only to them. As a consequence, it allows for seamless integration into the training process of any model and layers without the need to change its architecture, making it applicable to various network topologies, and the exact same network is deployed during training and inference. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating improved accuracy on popular datasets and models, including ImageNet and ViT.

- **Summary**: While state-of-the-art models for breast cancer detection leverage multi-view mammograms for enhanced diagnostic accuracy, they often focus solely on visual mammography data. However, radiologists document valuable lesion descriptors that contain additional information that can enhance mammography-based breast cancer screening. A key question is whether deep learning models can benefit from these expert-derived features. To address this question, we introduce a novel multi-modal approach that combines textual BI-RADS lesion descriptors with visual mammogram content. Our method employs iterative attention layers to effectively fuse these different modalities, significantly improving classification performance over image-only models. Experiments on the CBIS-DDSM dataset demonstrate substantial improvements across all metrics, demonstrating the contribution of handcrafted features to end-to-end.

- **Summary**: The performance of active learning algorithms can be improved in two ways. The often used and intuitive way is by reducing the overall error rate within the test set. The second way is to ensure that correct predictions are not forgotten when the training set is increased in between rounds. The former is measured by the accuracy of the model and the latter is captured in negative flips between rounds. Negative flips are samples that are correctly predicted when trained with the previous/smaller dataset and incorrectly predicted after additional samples are labeled. In this paper, we discuss improving the performance of active learning algorithms both in terms of prediction accuracy and negative flips. The first observation we make in this paper is that negative flips and overall error rates are decoupled and reducing one does not necessarily imply that the other is reduced. Our observation is important as current active learning algorithms do not consider negative flips directly and implicitly assume the opposite. The second observation is that performing targeted active learning on subsets of the unlabeled pool has a significant impact on the behavior of the active learning algorithm and influences both negative flips and prediction accuracy. We then develop ROSE - a plug-in algorithm that utilizes a small labeled validation set to restrict arbitrary active learning acquisition functions to negative flips within the unlabeled pool. We show that integrating a validation set results in a significant performance boost in terms of accuracy, negative flip rate reduction, or both.

- **Summary**: Lane detection involves identifying lanes on the road and accurately determining their location and shape. This is a crucial technique for modern assisted and autonomous driving systems. However, several unique properties of lanes pose challenges for detection methods. The lack of distinctive features can cause lane detection algorithms to be confused by other objects with similar appearances. Additionally, the varying number of lanes and the diversity in lane line patterns, such as solid, broken, single, double, merging, and splitting lines, further complicate the task. To address these challenges, Deep Learning (DL) approaches can be employed in various ways. Merging DL models with an attention mechanism has recently surfaced as a new approach. In this context, two deep learning-based lane recognition methods are proposed in this study. The first method employs the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) model, delivering an impressive 87.59% accuracy in detecting road lanes. The second method, which incorporates attention layers into the U-Net model, significantly boosts the performance of semantic segmentation tasks. The advanced model, achieving an extraordinary 98.98% accuracy and far surpassing the basic U-Net model, clearly showcases its superiority over existing methods in a comparative analysis. The groundbreaking findings of this research pave the way for the development of more effective and reliable road lane detection methods, significantly advancing the capabilities of modern assisted and autonomous driving systems.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion generative models can generate high quality images at the cost of tedious prompt engineering. Controllability can be improved by introducing layout conditioning, however existing methods lack layout editing ability and fine-grained control over object attributes. The concept of multi-layer generation holds great potential to address these limitations, however generating image instances concurrently to scene composition limits control over fine-grained object attributes, relative positioning in 3D space and scene manipulation abilities. In this work, we propose a novel multi-stage generation paradigm that is designed for fine-grained control, flexibility and interactivity. To ensure control over instance attributes, we devise a novel training paradigm to adapt a diffusion model to generate isolated scene components as RGBA images with transparency information. To build complex images, we employ these pre-generated instances and introduce a multi-layer composite generation process that smoothly assembles components in realistic scenes. Our experiments show that our RGBA diffusion model is capable of generating diverse and high quality instances with precise control over object attributes. Through multi-layer composition, we demonstrate that our approach allows to build and manipulate images from highly complex prompts with fine-grained control over object appearance and location, granting a higher degree of control than competing methods.
