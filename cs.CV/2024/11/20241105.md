- **Summary**: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have fundamentally transformed the field of computer vision, providing unprecedented performance. However, these ANNs for image processing demand substantial computational resources, often hindering real-time operation. In this paper, we demonstrate an optical encoder that can perform convolution simultaneously in three color channels during the image capture, effectively implementing several initial convolutional layers of a ANN. Such an optical encoding results in ~24,000 times reduction in computational operations, with a state-of-the art classification accuracy (~73.2%) in free-space optical system. In addition, our analog optical encoder, trained for CIFAR-10 data, can be transferred to the ImageNet subset, High-10, without any modifications, and still exhibits moderate accuracy. Our results evidence the potential of hybrid optical/digital computer vision system in which the optical frontend can pre-process an ambient scene to reduce the energy and latency of the whole computer vision system.

- **Summary**: We explore how intermediate policy representations can facilitate generalization by providing guidance on how to perform manipulation tasks. Existing representations such as language, goal images, and trajectory sketches have been shown to be helpful, but these representations either do not provide enough context or provide over-specified context that yields less robust policies. We propose conditioning policies on affordances, which capture the pose of the robot at key stages of the task. Affordances offer expressive yet lightweight abstractions, are easy for users to specify, and facilitate efficient learning by transferring knowledge from large internet datasets. Our method, RT-Affordance, is a hierarchical model that first proposes an affordance plan given the task language, and then conditions the policy on this affordance plan to perform manipulation. Our model can flexibly bridge heterogeneous sources of supervision including large web datasets and robot trajectories. We additionally train our model on cheap-to-collect in-domain affordance images, allowing us to learn new tasks without collecting any additional costly robot trajectories. We show on a diverse set of novel tasks how RT-Affordance exceeds the performance of existing methods by over 50%, and we empirically demonstrate that affordances are robust to novel settings.

- **Summary**: Breast cancer presents the second largest cancer risk in the world to women. Early detection of cancer has been shown to be effective in reducing mortality. Population screening programs schedule regular mammography imaging for participants, promoting early detection. Currently, such screening programs require manual reading. False-positive errors in the reading process unnecessarily leads to costly follow-up and patient anxiety. Automated methods promise to provide more efficient, consistent and effective reading. To facilitate their development, a number of datasets have been created. With the aim of specifically targeting population screening programs, we introduce NL-Breast-Screening, a dataset from a Canadian provincial screening program. The dataset consists of 5997 mammography exams, each of which has four standard views and is biopsy-confirmed. Cases where radiologist reading was a false-positive are identified. NL-Breast is made publicly available as a new resource to promote advances in automation for population screening programs.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) suffer from hallucination, resulting in misalignment between the output textual response and the input visual content. Recent research indicates that the over-reliance on the Large Language Model (LLM) backbone, as one cause of the LVLM hallucination, inherently introduces bias from language priors, leading to insufficient context attention to the visual inputs.   We tackle this issue of hallucination by mitigating such over-reliance through preference learning. We propose Vision-guided Direct Preference Optimization (V-DPO) to enhance visual context learning at training time. To interpret the effectiveness and generalizability of V-DPO on different types of training data, we construct a synthetic dataset containing both response- and image-contrast preference pairs, compared against existing human-annotated hallucination samples. Our approach achieves significant improvements compared with baseline methods across various hallucination benchmarks. Our analysis indicates that V-DPO excels in learning from image-contrast preference data, demonstrating its superior ability to elicit and understand nuances of visual context. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/YuxiXie/V-DPO.

- **Summary**: Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CSS) requires that a model learn to segment new classes without forgetting how to segment previous ones: this is typically achieved by distilling the current knowledge and incorporating the latest data. However, bypassing iterative distillation by directly transferring outputs of initial classes to the current learning task is not supported in existing class-specific CSS methods. Via Softmax, they enforce dependency between classes and adjust the output distribution at each learning step, resulting in a large probability distribution gap between initial and current tasks. We introduce a simple, yet effective Class Independent Transformation (CIT) that converts the outputs of existing semantic segmentation models into class-independent forms with negligible cost or performance loss. By utilizing class-independent predictions facilitated by CIT, we establish an accumulative distillation framework, ensuring equitable incorporation of all class information. We conduct extensive experiments on various segmentation architectures, including DeepLabV3, Mask2Former, and SegViTv2. Results from these experiments show minimal task forgetting across different datasets, with less than 5% for ADE20K in the most challenging 11 task configurations and less than 1% across all configurations for the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.

- **Summary**: Purpose: Automatic and accurate segmentation of fundus vessel images has become an essential prerequisite for computer-aided diagnosis of ophthalmic diseases such as diabetes mellitus. The task of high-precision retinal vessel segmentation still faces difficulties due to the low contrast between the branch ends of retinal vessels and the background, the long and thin vessel span, and the variable morphology of the optic disc and optic cup in fundus vessel images. Methods: We propose a more advanced U-shaped architecture for a hybrid Transformer and CNN: TransUNext, which integrates an Efficient Self-attention Mechanism into the encoder and decoder of U-Net to capture both local features and global dependencies with minimal computational overhead. Meanwhile, the Global Multi-Scale Fusion (GMSF) module is further introduced to upgrade skip-connections, fuse high-level semantic and low-level detailed information, and eliminate high- and low-level semantic differences. Inspired by ConvNeXt, TransNeXt Block is designed to optimize the computational complexity of each base block in U-Net and avoid the information loss caused by the compressed dimension when the information is converted between the feature spaces of different dimensions. Results: We evaluated the proposed method on four public datasets DRIVE, STARE, CHASE-DB1, and HRF. In the experimental results, the AUC (area under the ROC curve) values were 0.9867, 0.9869, 0.9910, and 0.9887, which exceeded the other state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of large vision language models (LVLMs), these models have shown excellent results in various multimodal tasks. Since LVLMs are prone to hallucinations and there are currently few datasets and evaluation methods specifically designed for remote sensing, their performance is typically poor when applied to remote sensing tasks. To address these issues, this paper introduces a high quality remote sensing LVLMs dataset, DDFAV, created using data augmentation and data mixing strategies. Next, a training instruction set is produced based on some high-quality remote sensing images selected from the proposed dataset. Finally, we develop a remote sensing LVLMs hallucination evaluation method RSPOPE based on the proposed dataset and evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of different LVLMs. Our proposed dataset, instruction set, and evaluation method files are available at https://github.com/HaodongLi2024/rspope.

- **Summary**: Foundation models refer to artificial intelligence (AI) models that are trained on massive amounts of data and demonstrate broad generalizability across various tasks with high accuracy. These models offer versatile, one-for-many or one-for-all solutions, eliminating the need for developing task-specific AI models. Examples of such foundation models include the Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). These models have been trained on millions to billions of samples and have shown wide-ranging and accurate applications in numerous tasks such as text processing (using ChatGPT) and natural image segmentation (using SAM). In medical image segmentation - finding target regions in medical images - there is a growing need for these one-for-many or one-for-all foundation models. Such models could obviate the need to develop thousands of task-specific AI models, which is currently standard practice in the field. They can also be adapted to tasks with datasets too small for effective training. We discuss two paths to achieve foundation models for medical image segmentation and comment on progress, challenges, and opportunities. One path is to adapt or fine-tune existing models, originally developed for natural images, for use with medical images. The second path entails building models from scratch, exclusively training on medical images.



### Efficient Feature Aggregation and Scale-Aware Regression for Monocular 3D Object Detection

- **Summary**: Monocular 3D object detection has attracted great attention due to simplicity and low cost. Existing methods typically follow conventional 2D detection paradigms, first locating object centers and then predicting 3D attributes via neighboring features. However, these methods predominantly rely on progressive cross-scale feature aggregation and focus solely on local information, which may result in a lack of global awareness and the omission of small-scale objects. In addition, due to large variation in object scales across different scenes and depths, inaccurate receptive fields often lead to background noise and degraded feature representation. To address these issues, we introduces MonoASRH, a novel monocular 3D detection framework composed of Efficient Hybrid Feature Aggregation Module (EH-FAM) and Adaptive Scale-Aware 3D Regression Head (ASRH). Specifically, EH-FAM employs multi-head attention with a global receptive field to extract semantic features for small-scale objects and leverages lightweight convolutional modules to efficiently aggregate visual features across different scales. The ASRH encodes 2D bounding box dimensions and then fuses scale features with the semantic features aggregated by EH-FAM through a scale-semantic feature fusion module. The scale-semantic feature fusion module guides ASRH in learning dynamic receptive field offsets, incorporating scale priors into 3D position prediction for better scale-awareness. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate that MonoASRH achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: As medical datasets rapidly expand, creating detailed annotations of different body structures becomes increasingly expensive and time-consuming. We consider that requesting radiologists to create detailed annotations is unnecessarily burdensome and that pre-existing AI models can largely automate this process. Following the spirit don't use a sledgehammer on a nut, we find that, rather than creating annotations from scratch, radiologists only have to review and edit errors if the Best-AI Labels have mistakes. To obtain the Best-AI Labels among multiple AI Labels, we developed an automatic tool, called Label Critic, that can assess label quality through tireless pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when incorporated with our developed Image-Prompt pairs, pre-existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM), trained on natural images and texts, achieve 96.5% accuracy when choosing the best label in a pair-wise comparison, without extra fine-tuning. By transforming the manual annotation task (30-60 min/scan) into an automatic comparison task (15 sec/scan), we effectively reduce the manual efforts required from radiologists by an order of magnitude. When the Best-AI Labels are sufficiently accurate (81% depending on body structures), they will be directly adopted as the gold-standard annotations for the dataset, with lower-quality AI Labels automatically discarded. Label Critic can also check the label quality of a single AI Label with 71.8% accuracy when no alternatives are available for comparison, prompting radiologists to review and edit if the estimated quality is low (19% depending on body structures).

- **Summary**: The EcoCropsAID dataset is a comprehensive collection of 5,400 aerial images captured between 2014 and 2018 using the Google Earth application. This dataset focuses on five key economic crops in Thailand: rice, sugarcane, cassava, rubber, and longan. The images were collected at various crop growth stages: early cultivation, growth, and harvest, resulting in significant variability within each category and similarities across different categories. These variations, coupled with differences in resolution, color, and contrast introduced by multiple remote imaging sensors, present substantial challenges for land use classification. The dataset is an interdisciplinary resource that spans multiple research domains, including remote sensing, geoinformatics, artificial intelligence, and computer vision. The unique features of the EcoCropsAID dataset offer opportunities for researchers to explore novel approaches, such as extracting spatial and temporal features, developing deep learning architectures, and implementing transformer-based models. The EcoCropsAID dataset provides a valuable platform for advancing research in land use classification, with implications for optimizing agricultural practices and enhancing sustainable development. This study explicitly investigates the use of deep learning algorithms to classify economic crop areas in northeastern Thailand, utilizing satellite imagery to address the challenges posed by diverse patterns and similarities across categories.

- **Summary**: The Thai One-Stage Fingerspelling (One-Stage-TFS) dataset is a comprehensive resource designed to advance research in hand gesture recognition, explicitly focusing on the recognition of Thai sign language. This dataset comprises 7,200 images capturing 15 one-stage consonant gestures performed by undergraduate students from Rajabhat Maha Sarakham University, Thailand. The contributors include both expert students from the Special Education Department with proficiency in Thai sign language and students from other departments without prior sign language experience. Images were collected between July and December 2021 using a DSLR camera, with contributors demonstrating hand gestures against both simple and complex backgrounds. The One-Stage-TFS dataset presents challenges in detecting and recognizing hand gestures, offering opportunities to develop novel end-to-end recognition frameworks. Researchers can utilize this dataset to explore deep learning methods, such as YOLO, EfficientDet, RetinaNet, and Detectron, for hand detection, followed by feature extraction and recognition using techniques like convolutional neural networks, transformers, and adaptive feature fusion networks. The dataset is accessible via the Mendeley Data repository and supports a wide range of applications in computer science, including deep learning, computer vision, and pattern recognition, thereby encouraging further innovation and exploration in these fields.



### FedBlock: A Blockchain Approach to Federated Learning against Backdoor Attacks

- **Comment**: This paper has been accepted as a full paper for the IEEE Special
  Session Federated Learning on Big Data 2024 (IEEE BigData 2024)
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning method for training with private data locally stored in distributed machines without gathering them into one place for central learning. Despite its promises, FL is prone to critical security risks. First, because FL depends on a central server to aggregate local training models, this is a single point of failure. The server might function maliciously. Second, due to its distributed nature, FL might encounter backdoor attacks by participating clients. They can poison the local model before submitting to the server. Either type of attack, on the server or the client side, would severely degrade learning accuracy. We propose FedBlock, a novel blockchain-based FL framework that addresses both of these security risks. FedBlock is uniquely desirable in that it involves only smart contract programming, thus deployable atop any blockchain network. Our framework is substantiated with a comprehensive evaluation study using real-world datasets. Its robustness against backdoor attacks is competitive with the literature of FL backdoor defense. The latter, however, does not address the server risk as we do.

- **Summary**: With the ongoing increase in the worldwide population and escalating consumption habits,there's a surge in the amount of waste produced.The situation poses considerable challenges for waste management and the optimization of recycling operations.The research tackles the pressing issue of waste classification for recycling by analyzing various deep learning models,including Convolutional Neural Network(CNN),AlexNet,ResNet,ResNet50 plus Support Vector Machine(SVM),and transformers,across a wide array of waste categories.The research meticulously compares these models on several targets like parameters settings,category accuracy,total accuracy and model parameters to establish a uniform evaluation criterion.This research presents a novel method that incorporates SVM with deep learning frameworks,particularly ResNet50.The results indicate the method significantly boosts accuracy in complex waste categories.Moreover,the transformer model outshines others in average accuracy,showcasing its aptitude for intricate classification tasks.To improve performance in poorly performing categories,the research advocates for enlarging the dataset,employing data augmentation,and leveraging sophisticated models such as transformers,along with refining training methodologies.The research paves the way for future advancements in multi-category waste recycling and underscores the pivotal role of deep learning in promoting environmental sustainability.



### Toward Robust Incomplete Multimodal Sentiment Analysis via Hierarchical Representation Learning

- **Summary**: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) is an important research area that aims to understand and recognize human sentiment through multiple modalities. The complementary information provided by multimodal fusion promotes better sentiment analysis compared to utilizing only a single modality. Nevertheless, in real-world applications, many unavoidable factors may lead to situations of uncertain modality missing, thus hindering the effectiveness of multimodal modeling and degrading the model's performance. To this end, we propose a Hierarchical Representation Learning Framework (HRLF) for the MSA task under uncertain missing modalities. Specifically, we propose a fine-grained representation factorization module that sufficiently extracts valuable sentiment information by factorizing modality into sentiment-relevant and modality-specific representations through crossmodal translation and sentiment semantic reconstruction. Moreover, a hierarchical mutual information maximization mechanism is introduced to incrementally maximize the mutual information between multi-scale representations to align and reconstruct the high-level semantics in the representations. Ultimately, we propose a hierarchical adversarial learning mechanism that further aligns and adapts the latent distribution of sentiment-relevant representations to produce robust joint multimodal representations. Comprehensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that HRLF significantly improves MSA performance under uncertain modality missing cases.



### Real-Time Text Detection with Similar Mask in Traffic, Industrial, and Natural Scenes

- **Summary**: Texts on the intelligent transportation scene include mass information. Fully harnessing this information is one of the critical drivers for advancing intelligent transportation. Unlike the general scene, detecting text in transportation has extra demand, such as a fast inference speed, except for high accuracy. Most existing real-time text detection methods are based on the shrink mask, which loses some geometry semantic information and needs complex post-processing. In addition, the previous method usually focuses on correct output, which ignores feature correction and lacks guidance during the intermediate process. To this end, we propose an efficient multi-scene text detector that contains an effective text representation similar mask (SM) and a feature correction module (FCM). Unlike previous methods, the former aims to preserve the geometric information of the instances as much as possible. Its post-progressing saves 50$\%$ of the time, accurately and efficiently reconstructing text contours. The latter encourages false positive features to move away from the positive feature center, optimizing the predictions from the feature level. Some ablation studies demonstrate the efficiency of the SM and the effectiveness of the FCM. Moreover, the deficiency of existing traffic datasets (such as the low-quality annotation or closed source data unavailability) motivated us to collect and annotate a traffic text dataset, which introduces motion blur. In addition, to validate the scene robustness of the SM-Net, we conduct experiments on traffic, industrial, and natural scene datasets. Extensive experiments verify it achieves (SOTA) performance on several benchmarks. The code and dataset are available at: \url{https://github.com/fengmulin/SMNet}.

- **Summary**: Following its success for vision and text, the "foundation model" (FM) paradigm -- pretraining large models on massive data, then fine-tuning on target tasks -- has rapidly expanded to domains in the sciences, engineering, healthcare, and beyond. Has this achieved what the original FMs accomplished, i.e. the supplanting of traditional supervised learning in their domains? To answer we look at three modalities -- genomics, satellite imaging, and time series -- with multiple recent FMs and compare them to a standard supervised learning workflow: model development, hyperparameter tuning, and training, all using only data from the target task. Across these three specialized domains, we find that it is consistently possible to train simple supervised models -- no more complicated than a lightly modified wide ResNet or UNet -- that match or even outperform the latest foundation models. Our work demonstrates that the benefits of large-scale pretraining have yet to be realized in many specialized areas, reinforces the need to compare new FMs to strong, well-tuned baselines, and introduces two new, easy-to-use, open-source, and automated workflows for doing so.

- **Summary**: We propose an image-adaptive object detection method for adverse weather conditions such as fog and low-light. Our framework employs differentiable preprocessing filters to perform image enhancement suitable for later-stage object detections. Our framework introduces two differentiable filters: a B\'ezier curve-based pixel-wise (BPW) filter and a kernel-based local (KBL) filter. These filters unify the functions of classical image processing filters and improve performance of object detection. We also propose a domain-agnostic data augmentation strategy using the BPW filter. Our method does not require data-specific customization of the filter combinations, parameter ranges, and data augmentation. We evaluate our proposed approach, called Enhanced Robustness by Unified Image Processing (ERUP)-YOLO, by applying it to the YOLOv3 detector. Experiments on adverse weather datasets demonstrate that our proposed filters match or exceed the expressiveness of conventional methods and our ERUP-YOLO achieved superior performance in a wide range of adverse weather conditions, including fog and low-light conditions.

- **Summary**: We introduce NEOviz, an interactive visualization system designed to assist planetary defense experts in the visual analysis of the movements of near-Earth objects in the Solar System that might prove hazardous to Earth. Asteroids are often discovered using optical telescopes and their trajectories are calculated from images, resulting in an inherent asymmetric uncertainty in their position and velocity. Consequently, we typically cannot determine the exact trajectory of an asteroid, and an ensemble of trajectories must be generated to estimate an asteroid's movement over time. When propagating these ensembles over decades, it is challenging to visualize the varying paths and determine their potential impact on Earth, which could cause catastrophic damage. NEOviz equips experts with the necessary tools to effectively analyze the existing catalog of asteroid observations. In particular, we present a novel approach for visualizing the 3D uncertainty region through which an asteroid travels, while providing accurate spatial context in relation to system-critical infrastructure such as Earth, the Moon, and artificial satellites. Furthermore, we use NEOviz to visualize the divergence of asteroid trajectories, capturing high-variance events in an asteroid's orbital properties. For potential impactors, we combine the 3D visualization with an uncertainty-aware impact map to illustrate the potential risks to human populations. NEOviz was developed with continuous input from members of the planetary defense community through a participatory design process. It is exemplified in three real-world use cases and evaluated via expert feedback interviews.

- **Summary**: Precision therapy for liver cancer necessitates accurately delineating liver sub-regions to protect healthy tissue while targeting tumors, which is essential for reducing recurrence and improving survival rates. However, the segmentation of hepatic segments, known as Couinaud segmentation, is challenging due to indistinct sub-region boundaries and the need for extensive annotated datasets. This study introduces LiverFormer, a novel Couinaud segmentation model that effectively integrates global context with low-level local features based on a 3D hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture. Additionally, a registration-based data augmentation strategy is equipped to enhance the segmentation performance with limited labeled data. Evaluated on CT images from 123 patients, LiverFormer demonstrated high accuracy and strong concordance with expert annotations across various metrics, allowing for enhanced treatment planning for surgery and radiation therapy. It has great potential to reduces complications and minimizes potential damages to surrounding tissue, leading to improved outcomes for patients undergoing complex liver cancer treatments.

- **Summary**: In recent years, advanced artificial intelligence technologies, such as ChatGPT, have significantly impacted various fields, including education and research. Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT is a powerful language model that presents numerous opportunities for students and educators. It offers personalized feedback, enhances accessibility, enables interactive conversations, assists with lesson preparation and evaluation, and introduces new methods for teaching complex subjects. However, ChatGPT also poses challenges to traditional education and research systems. These challenges include the risk of cheating on online exams, the generation of human-like text that may compromise academic integrity, a potential decline in critical thinking skills, and difficulties in assessing the reliability of information generated by AI. This study examines both the opportunities and challenges ChatGPT brings to education from the perspectives of students and educators. Specifically, it explores the role of ChatGPT in helping students develop their subjective skills. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conducted several subjective experiments using ChatGPT, such as generating solutions from subjective problem descriptions. Additionally, surveys were conducted with students and teachers to gather insights into how ChatGPT supports subjective learning and teaching. The results and analysis of these surveys are presented to highlight the impact of ChatGPT in this context.



### Conditional Vendi Score: An Information-Theoretic Approach to Diversity Evaluation of Prompt-based Generative Models

- **Summary**: Text-conditioned generation models are commonly evaluated based on the quality of the generated data and its alignment with the input text prompt. On the other hand, several applications of prompt-based generative models require sufficient diversity in the generated data to ensure the models' capability of generating image and video samples possessing a variety of features. However, most existing diversity metrics are designed for unconditional generative models, and thus cannot distinguish the diversity arising from variations in text prompts and that contributed by the generative model itself. In this work, our goal is to quantify the prompt-induced and model-induced diversity in samples generated by prompt-based models. We propose an information-theoretic approach for internal diversity quantification, where we decompose the kernel-based entropy $H(X)$ of the generated data $X$ into the sum of the conditional entropy $H(X|T)$, given text variable $T$, and the mutual information $I(X; T)$ between the text and data variables. We introduce the \emph{Conditional-Vendi} score based on $H(X|T)$ to quantify the internal diversity of the model and the \emph{Information-Vendi} score based on $I(X; T)$ to measure the statistical relevance between the generated data and text prompts. We provide theoretical results to statistically interpret these scores and relate them to the unconditional Vendi score. We conduct several numerical experiments to show the correlation between the Conditional-Vendi score and the internal diversity of text-conditioned generative models.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS) has been largely driven by space-time memory (STM) networks, which store past frame features in a spatiotemporal memory to segment the current frame via softmax attention. However, STM networks face memory limitations due to the quadratic complexity of softmax matching, restricting their applicability as video length and resolution increase. To address this, we propose LiVOS, a lightweight memory network that employs linear matching via linear attention, reformulating memory matching into a recurrent process that reduces the quadratic attention matrix to a constant-size, spatiotemporal-agnostic 2D state. To enhance selectivity, we introduce gated linear matching, where a data-dependent gate matrix is multiplied with the state matrix to control what information to retain or discard. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. It achieved 64.8 J&F on MOSE and 85.1 J&F on DAVIS, surpassing all non-STM methods and narrowing the gap with STM-based approaches. For longer and higher-resolution videos, it matched STM-based methods with 53% less GPU memory and supports 4096p inference on a 32G consumer-grade GPU--a previously cost-prohibitive capability--opening the door for long and high-resolution video foundation models.

- **Summary**: Contextual information plays a critical role in object recognition models within computer vision, where changes in context can significantly affect accuracy, underscoring models' dependence on contextual cues. This study investigates how context manipulation influences both model accuracy and feature attribution, providing insights into the reliance of object recognition models on contextual information as understood through the lens of feature attribution methods.   We employ a range of feature attribution techniques to decipher the reliance of deep neural networks on context in object recognition tasks. Using the ImageNet-9 and our curated ImageNet-CS datasets, we conduct experiments to evaluate the impact of contextual variations, analyzed through feature attribution methods. Our findings reveal several key insights: (a) Correctly classified images predominantly emphasize object volume attribution over context volume attribution. (b) The dependence on context remains relatively stable across different context modifications, irrespective of classification accuracy. (c) Context change exerts a more pronounced effect on model performance than Context perturbations. (d) Surprisingly, context attribution in `no-information' scenarios is non-trivial. Our research moves beyond traditional methods by assessing the implications of broad-level modifications on object recognition, either in the object or its context.

- **Summary**: The inherent challenge of image fusion lies in capturing the correlation of multi-source images and comprehensively integrating effective information from different sources. Most existing techniques fail to perform dynamic image fusion while notably lacking theoretical guarantees, leading to potential deployment risks in this field. Is it possible to conduct dynamic image fusion with a clear theoretical justification? In this paper, we give our solution from a generalization perspective. We proceed to reveal the generalized form of image fusion and derive a new test-time dynamic image fusion paradigm. It provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error. Specifically, we decompose the fused image into multiple components corresponding to its source data. The decomposed components represent the effective information from the source data, thus the gap between them reflects the Relative Dominability (RD) of the uni-source data in constructing the fusion image. Theoretically, we prove that the key to reducing generalization error hinges on the negative correlation between the RD-based fusion weight and the uni-source reconstruction loss. Intuitively, RD dynamically highlights the dominant regions of each source and can be naturally converted to the corresponding fusion weight, achieving robust results. Extensive experiments and discussions with in-depth analysis on multiple benchmarks confirm our findings and superiority. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yinan-Xia/TTD.

- **Summary**: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) represents an innovative biomedical imaging modality that harnesses the advantages of optical resolution and acoustic penetration depth while ensuring enhanced safety. Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.

- **Summary**: As object detection techniques continue to evolve, understanding their relationships with complementary visual tasks becomes crucial for optimising model architectures and computational resources. This paper investigates the correlations between object detection accuracy and two fundamental visual tasks: depth prediction and visual saliency prediction. Through comprehensive experiments using state-of-the-art models (DeepGaze IIE, Depth Anything, DPT-Large, and Itti's model) on COCO and Pascal VOC datasets, we find that visual saliency shows consistently stronger correlations with object detection accuracy (mA$\rho$ up to 0.459 on Pascal VOC) compared to depth prediction (mA$\rho$ up to 0.283). Our analysis reveals significant variations in these correlations across object categories, with larger objects showing correlation values up to three times higher than smaller objects. These findings suggest incorporating visual saliency features into object detection architectures could be more beneficial than depth information, particularly for specific object categories. The observed category-specific variations also provide insights for targeted feature engineering and dataset design improvements, potentially leading to more efficient and accurate object detection systems.

- **Summary**: Reducing global poverty is a key objective of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Achieving this requires high-frequency, granular data to capture neighborhood-level changes, particularly in data scarce regions such as low- and middle-income countries. To fill in the data gaps, recent computer vision methods combining machine learning (ML) with earth observation (EO) data to improve poverty estimation. However, while much progress have been made, they often omit intra-annual variations, which are crucial for estimating poverty in agriculturally dependent countries. We explored the impact of integrating intra-annual NDVI information with annual multi-spectral data on model accuracy. To evaluate our method, we created a simulated dataset using Landsat imagery and nighttime light data to evaluate EO-ML methods that use intra-annual EO data. Additionally, we evaluated our method against the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) dataset across Africa. Our results indicate that integrating specific NDVI-derived features with multi-spectral data provides valuable insights for poverty analysis, emphasizing the importance of retaining intra-annual information.

- **Summary**: Multi-object multi-part scene segmentation is a challenging task whose complexity scales exponentially with part granularity and number of scene objects. To address the task, we propose a plug-and-play approach termed OLAF. First, we augment the input (RGB) with channels containing object-based structural cues (fg/bg mask, boundary edge mask). We propose a weight adaptation technique which enables regular (RGB) pre-trained models to process the augmented (5-channel) input in a stable manner during optimization. In addition, we introduce an encoder module termed LDF to provide low-level dense feature guidance. This assists segmentation, particularly for smaller parts. OLAF enables significant mIoU gains of $\mathbf{3.3}$ (Pascal-Parts-58), $\mathbf{3.5}$ (Pascal-Parts-108) over the SOTA model. On the most challenging variant (Pascal-Parts-201), the gain is $\mathbf{4.0}$. Experimentally, we show that OLAF's broad applicability enables gains across multiple architectures (CNN, U-Net, Transformer) and datasets. The code is available at olafseg.github.io

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a novel continual audio-visual sound separation task, aiming to continuously separate sound sources for new classes while preserving performance on previously learned classes, with the aid of visual guidance. This problem is crucial for practical visually guided auditory perception as it can significantly enhance the adaptability and robustness of audio-visual sound separation models, making them more applicable for real-world scenarios where encountering new sound sources is commonplace. The task is inherently challenging as our models must not only effectively utilize information from both modalities in current tasks but also preserve their cross-modal association in old tasks to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during audio-visual continual learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach named ContAV-Sep (\textbf{Cont}inual \textbf{A}udio-\textbf{V}isual Sound \textbf{Sep}aration). ContAV-Sep presents a novel Cross-modal Similarity Distillation Constraint (CrossSDC) to uphold the cross-modal semantic similarity through incremental tasks and retain previously acquired knowledge of semantic similarity in old models, mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting. The CrossSDC can seamlessly integrate into the training process of different audio-visual sound separation frameworks. Experiments demonstrate that ContAV-Sep can effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and achieve significantly better performance compared to other continual learning baselines for audio-visual sound separation.

- **Summary**: Developing accurate and efficient detectors for drone imagery is challenging due to the inherent complexity of aerial scenes. While some existing methods aim to achieve high accuracy by utilizing larger models, their computational cost is prohibitive for drones. Recently, Knowledge Distillation (KD) has shown promising potential for maintaining satisfactory accuracy while significantly compressing models in general object detection. Considering the advantages of KD, this paper presents the first attempt to adapt it to object detection on drone imagery and addresses two intrinsic issues: (1) low foreground-background ratio and (2) small instances and complex backgrounds, which lead to inadequate training, resulting insufficient distillation. Therefore, we propose a task-wise Lightweight Mutual Lifting (Light-ML) module with a Centerness-based Instance-aware Distillation (CID) strategy. The Light-ML module mutually harmonizes the classification and localization branches by channel shuffling and convolution, integrating teacher supervision across different tasks during back-propagation, thus facilitating training the student model. The CID strategy extracts valuable regions surrounding instances through the centerness of proposals, enhancing distillation efficacy. Experiments on the VisDrone, UAVDT, and COCO benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach promotes the accuracies of existing state-of-the-art KD methods with comparable computational requirements. Codes will be available upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Accurate tissue segmentation in fetal brain MRI remains challenging due to the dynamically changing anatomical anatomy and contrast during fetal development. To enhance segmentation accuracy throughout gestation, we introduced AtlasSeg, a dual-U-shape convolution network incorporating gestational age (GA) specific information as guidance. By providing a publicly available fetal brain atlas with segmentation label at the corresponding GA, AtlasSeg effectively extracted the contextual features of age-specific patterns in atlas branch and generated tissue segmentation in segmentation branch. Multi-scale attentive atlas feature fusions were constructed in all stages during encoding and decoding, giving rise to a dual-U-shape network to assist feature flow and information interactions between two branches. AtlasSeg outperformed six well-known segmentation networks in both our internal fetal brain MRI dataset and the external FeTA dataset. Ablation experiments demonstrate the efficiency of atlas guidance and the attention mechanism. The proposed AtlasSeg demonstrated superior segmentation performance against other convolution networks with higher segmentation accuracy, and may facilitate fetal brain MRI analysis in large-scale fetal brain studies.

- **Summary**: Despite remarkable achievements in deep learning across various domains, its inherent vulnerability to adversarial examples still remains a critical concern for practical deployment. Adversarial training has emerged as one of the most effective defensive techniques for improving model robustness against such malicious inputs. However, existing adversarial training schemes often lead to limited generalization ability against underlying adversaries with diversity due to their overreliance on a point-by-point augmentation strategy by mapping each clean example to its adversarial counterpart during training. In addition, adversarial examples can induce significant disruptions in the statistical information w.r.t. the target model, thereby introducing substantial uncertainty and challenges to modeling the distribution of adversarial examples. To circumvent these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware distributional adversarial training method, which enforces adversary modeling by leveraging both the statistical information of adversarial examples and its corresponding uncertainty estimation, with the goal of augmenting the diversity of adversaries. Considering the potentially negative impact induced by aligning adversaries to misclassified clean examples, we also refine the alignment reference based on the statistical proximity to clean examples during adversarial training, thereby reframing adversarial training within a distribution-to-distribution matching framework interacted between the clean and adversarial domains. Furthermore, we design an introspective gradient alignment approach via matching input gradients between these domains without introducing external models. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and various network architectures demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art adversarial robustness and maintains natural performance.

- **Summary**: Diffeomorphic image registration is crucial for various medical imaging applications because it can preserve the topology of the transformation. This study introduces DCCNN-LSTM-Reg, a learning framework that evolves dynamically and learns a symmetrical registration path by satisfying a specified control increment system. This framework aims to obtain symmetric diffeomorphic deformations between moving and fixed images. To achieve this, we combine deep learning networks with diffeomorphic mathematical mechanisms to create a continuous and dynamic registration architecture, which consists of multiple Symmetric Registration (SR) modules cascaded on five different scales. Specifically, our method first uses two U-nets with shared parameters to extract multiscale feature pyramids from the images. We then develop an SR-module comprising a sequential CNN-LSTM architecture to progressively correct the forward and reverse multiscale deformation fields using control increment learning and the homotopy continuation technique. Through extensive experiments on three 3D registration tasks, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

- **Summary**: We recently developed a new approach to get a stabilized image from a sequence of frames acquired through atmospheric turbulence. The goal of this algorihtm is to remove the geometric distortions due by the atmosphere movements. This method is based on a variational formulation and is efficiently solved by the use of Bregman iterations and the operator splitting method. In this paper we propose to study the influence of the choice of the regularizing term in the model. Then we proposed to experiment some of the most used regularization constraints available in the litterature.

- **Summary**: In this paper we present a new approach to deblur the effect of atmospheric turbulence in the case of long range imaging. Our method is based on an analytical formulation, the Fried kernel, of the atmosphere modulation transfer function (MTF) and a framelet based deconvolution algorithm. An important parameter is the refractive index structure which requires specific measurements to be known. Then we propose a method which provides a good estimation of this parameter from the input blurred image. The final algorithms are very easy to implement and show very good results on both simulated blur and real images.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models (VLLMs) exhibit promising capabilities for processing multi-modal tasks across various application scenarios. However, their emergence also raises significant data security concerns, given the potential inclusion of sensitive information, such as private photos and medical records, in their training datasets. Detecting inappropriately used data in VLLMs remains a critical and unresolved issue, mainly due to the lack of standardized datasets and suitable methodologies. In this study, we introduce the first membership inference attack (MIA) benchmark tailored for various VLLMs to facilitate training data detection. Then, we propose a novel MIA pipeline specifically designed for token-level image detection. Lastly, we present a new metric called MaxR\'enyi-K%, which is based on the confidence of the model output and applies to both text and image data. We believe that our work can deepen the understanding and methodology of MIAs in the context of VLLMs. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/VL-MIA.

- **Summary**: Open-set single-source domain generalization aims to use a single-source domain to learn a robust model that can be generalized to unknown target domains with both domain shifts and label shifts. The scarcity of the source domain and the unknown data distribution of the target domain pose a great challenge for domain-invariant feature learning and unknown class recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel learning approach based on domain expansion and boundary growth to expand the scarce source samples and enlarge the boundaries across the known classes that indirectly broaden the boundary between the known and unknown classes. Specifically, we achieve domain expansion by employing both background suppression and style augmentation on the source data to synthesize new samples. Then we force the model to distill consistent knowledge from the synthesized samples so that the model can learn domain-invariant information. Furthermore, we realize boundary growth across classes by using edge maps as an additional modality of samples when training multi-binary classifiers. In this way, it enlarges the boundary between the inliers and outliers, and consequently improves the unknown class recognition during open-set generalization. Extensive experiments show that our approach can achieve significant improvements and reach state-of-the-art performance on several cross-domain image classification datasets.

- **Summary**: Accurate Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps are essential for understanding the drivers of sustainable development, in terms of its complex interrelationships between human activities and natural resources. However, existing LULC maps often lack precise urban and rural classifications, particularly in diverse regions like Africa. This study presents a novel construction of a high-resolution rural-urban map using deep learning techniques and satellite imagery. We developed a deep learning model based on the DeepLabV3 architecture, which was trained on satellite imagery from Landsat-8 and the ESRI LULC dataset, augmented with human settlement data from the GHS-SMOD. The model utilizes semantic segmentation to classify land into detailed categories, including urban and rural areas, at a 10-meter resolution. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating LULC along with urban and rural classifications significantly enhances the model's ability to accurately distinguish between urban, rural, and non-human settlement areas. Therefore, our maps can support more informed decision-making for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders. We release a continent wide urban-rural map, covering the period 2016 and 2022.

- **Summary**: Diffusion model, as a powerful generative model, has found a wide range of applications including MRI reconstruction. However, most existing diffusion model-based MRI reconstruction methods operate directly in pixel space, which makes their optimization and inference computationally expensive. Latent diffusion models were introduced to address this problem in natural image processing, but directly applying them to MRI reconstruction still faces many challenges, including the lack of control over the generated results, the adaptability of Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to MRI, and the exploration of applicable data consistency in latent space. To address these challenges, a Latent Diffusion Prior based undersampled MRI reconstruction (LDPM) method is proposed. A sketcher module is utilized to provide appropriate control and balance the quality and fidelity of the reconstructed MR images. A VAE adapted for MRI tasks (MR-VAE) is explored, which can serve as the backbone for future MR-related tasks. Furthermore, a variation of the DDIM sampler, called the Dual-Stage Sampler, is proposed to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction in the latent space. The proposed method achieves competitive results on fastMRI datasets, and the effectiveness of each module is demonstrated in ablation experiments.

- **Summary**: LiDAR Semantic Segmentation is a fundamental task in autonomous driving perception consisting of associating each LiDAR point to a semantic label. Fully-supervised models have widely tackled this task, but they require labels for each scan, which either limits their domain or requires impractical amounts of expensive annotations. Camera images, which are generally recorded alongside LiDAR pointclouds, can be processed by the widely available 2D foundation models, which are generic and dataset-agnostic. However, distilling knowledge from 2D data to improve LiDAR perception raises domain adaptation challenges. For example, the classical perspective projection suffers from the parallax effect produced by the position shift between both sensors at their respective capture times. We propose a Semi-Supervised Learning setup to leverage unlabeled LiDAR pointclouds alongside distilled knowledge from the camera images. To self-supervise our model on the unlabeled scans, we add an auxiliary NeRF head and cast rays from the camera viewpoint over the unlabeled voxel features. The NeRF head predicts densities and semantic logits at each sampled ray location which are used for rendering pixel semantics. Concurrently, we query the Segment-Anything (SAM) foundation model with the camera image to generate a set of unlabeled generic masks. We fuse the masks with the rendered pixel semantics from LiDAR to produce pseudo-labels that supervise the pixel predictions. During inference, we drop the NeRF head and run our model with only LiDAR. We show the effectiveness of our approach in three public LiDAR Semantic Segmentation benchmarks: nuScenes, SemanticKITTI and ScribbleKITTI.

- **Summary**: In this work, the seasonal predictive capabilities of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) applied to satellite images are investigated. Focusing on the utilization of satellite data, the study explores how Sat-NeRF, a novel approach in computer vision, performs in predicting seasonal variations across different months. Through comprehensive analysis and visualization, the study examines the model's ability to capture and predict seasonal changes, highlighting specific challenges and strengths. Results showcase the impact of the sun direction on predictions, revealing nuanced details in seasonal transitions, such as snow cover, color accuracy, and texture representation in different landscapes. Given these results, we propose Planet-NeRF, an extension to Sat-NeRF capable of incorporating seasonal variability through a set of month embedding vectors. Comparative evaluations reveal that Planet-NeRF outperforms prior models in the case where seasonal changes are present. The extensive evaluation combined with the proposed method offers promising avenues for future research in this domain.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a cornerstone of image segmentation, demonstrating exceptional performance across various applications, particularly in autonomous driving and medical imaging, where precise segmentation is crucial. However, SAM is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can significantly impair its functionality through minor input perturbations. Traditional techniques, such as FGSM and PGD, are often ineffective in segmentation tasks due to their reliance on global perturbations that overlook spatial nuances. Recent methods like Attack-SAM-K and UAD have begun to address these challenges, but they frequently depend on external cues and do not fully leverage the structural interdependencies within segmentation processes. This limitation underscores the need for a novel adversarial strategy that exploits the unique characteristics of segmentation tasks. In response, we introduce the Region-Guided Attack (RGA), designed specifically for SAM. RGA utilizes a Region-Guided Map (RGM) to manipulate segmented regions, enabling targeted perturbations that fragment large segments and expand smaller ones, resulting in erroneous outputs from SAM. Our experiments demonstrate that RGA achieves high success rates in both white-box and black-box scenarios, emphasizing the need for robust defenses against such sophisticated attacks. RGA not only reveals SAM's vulnerabilities but also lays the groundwork for developing more resilient defenses against adversarial threats in image segmentation.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing from multi-view images is a longstanding problem in 3D vision, where neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have shown great potential and get realistic rendered images of novel views. Currently, most NeRF methods either require accurate camera poses or a large number of input images, or even both. Reconstructing NeRF from few-view images without poses is challenging and highly ill-posed. To address this problem, we propose CAD-NeRF, a method reconstructed from less than 10 images without any known poses. Specifically, we build a mini library of several CAD models from ShapeNet and render them from many random views. Given sparse-view input images, we run a model and pose retrieval from the library, to get a model with similar shapes, serving as the density supervision and pose initializations. Here we propose a multi-view pose retrieval method to avoid pose conflicts among views, which is a new and unseen problem in uncalibrated NeRF methods. Then, the geometry of the object is trained by the CAD guidance. The deformation of the density field and camera poses are optimized jointly. Then texture and density are trained and fine-tuned as well. All training phases are in self-supervised manners. Comprehensive evaluations of synthetic and real images show that CAD-NeRF successfully learns accurate densities with a large deformation from retrieved CAD models, showing the generalization abilities.

- **Summary**: Multimodal foundation models (MFMs) have revolutionized sequential recommender systems through advanced representation learning. While Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is commonly used to adapt these models, studies often prioritize parameter efficiency, neglecting GPU memory and training speed. To address this, we introduced the IISAN framework, significantly enhancing efficiency. However, IISAN was limited to symmetrical MFMs and identical text and image encoders, preventing the use of state-of-the-art Large Language Models. To overcome this, we developed IISAN-Versa, a versatile plug-and-play architecture compatible with both symmetrical and asymmetrical MFMs. IISAN-Versa employs a Decoupled PEFT structure and utilizes both intra- and inter-modal adaptation. It effectively handles asymmetry through a simple yet effective combination of group layer-dropping and dimension transformation alignment. Our research demonstrates that IISAN-Versa effectively adapts large text encoders, and we further identify a scaling effect where larger encoders generally perform better. IISAN-Versa also demonstrates strong versatility in our defined multimodal scenarios, which include raw titles and captions generated from images and videos. Additionally, IISAN-Versa achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Microlens public benchmark. We will release our code and datasets to support future research.

- **Summary**: The global shift towards renewable energy has pushed PV cell manufacturing as a pivotal point as they are the fundamental building block of green energy. However, the manufacturing process is complex enough to lose its purpose due to probable defects experienced during the time impacting the overall efficiency. However, at the moment, manual inspection is being conducted to detect the defects that can cause bias, leading to time and cost inefficiency. Even if automated solutions have also been proposed, most of them are resource-intensive, proving ineffective in production environments. In that context, this study presents PV-faultNet, a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture optimized for efficient and real-time defect detection in photovoltaic (PV) cells, designed to be deployable on resource-limited production devices. Addressing computational challenges in industrial PV manufacturing environments, the model includes only 2.92 million parameters, significantly reducing processing demands without sacrificing accuracy. Comprehensive data augmentation techniques were implemented to tackle data scarcity, thus enhancing model generalization and maintaining a balance between precision and recall. The proposed model achieved high performance with 91\% precision, 89\% recall, and a 90\% F1 score, demonstrating its effectiveness for scalable quality control in PV production.

We employed InternVL-2.0, a pioneering open-source multi-modal model, and enhanced it by refining both the model input and training methodologies. For the input data, we strategically concatenated and formatted the multi-view images. It is worth mentioning that we utilized the coordinates of the original images without transformation. In terms of model training, we initially pre-trained the model on publicly available autonomous driving scenario datasets to bolster its alignment capabilities of the challenge tasks, followed by fine-tuning on the DriveLM-nuscenes Dataset. During the fine-tuning phase, we innovatively modified the loss function to enhance the model's precision in predicting coordinate values. These approaches ensure that our model possesses advanced cognitive and decision-making capabilities in driving scenarios. Consequently, our model achieved a score of 0.6064, securing the first prize on the competition's final results.

- **Summary**: Accurate and robust 3D object detection is a critical component in autonomous vehicles and robotics. While recent radar-camera fusion methods have made significant progress by fusing information in the bird's-eye view (BEV) representation, they often struggle to effectively capture the motion of dynamic objects, leading to limited performance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CRT-Fusion, a novel framework that integrates temporal information into radar-camera fusion to address this challenge. Our approach comprises three key modules: Multi-View Fusion (MVF), Motion Feature Estimator (MFE), and Motion Guided Temporal Fusion (MGTF). The MVF module fuses radar and image features within both the camera view and bird's-eye view, thereby generating a more precise unified BEV representation. The MFE module conducts two simultaneous tasks: estimation of pixel-wise velocity information and BEV segmentation. Based on the velocity and the occupancy score map obtained from the MFE module, the MGTF module aligns and fuses feature maps across multiple timestamps in a recurrent manner. By considering the motion of dynamic objects, CRT-Fusion can produce robust BEV feature maps, thereby improving detection accuracy and robustness. Extensive evaluations on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that CRT-Fusion achieves state-of-the-art performance for radar-camera-based 3D object detection. Our approach outperforms the previous best method in terms of NDS by +1.7%, while also surpassing the leading approach in mAP by +1.4%. These significant improvements in both metrics showcase the effectiveness of our proposed fusion strategy in enhancing the reliability and accuracy of 3D object detection.

- **Summary**: Federated Learning is a privacy preserving decentralized machine learning paradigm designed to collaboratively train models across multiple clients by exchanging gradients to the server and keeping private data local. Nevertheless, recent research has revealed that the security of Federated Learning is compromised, as private ground truth data can be recovered through a gradient inversion technique known as Deep Leakage. While these attacks are crafted with a focus on applications in Federated Learning, they generally are not evaluated in realistic scenarios. This paper introduces the FEDLAD Framework (Federated Evaluation of Deep Leakage Attacks and Defenses), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Deep Leakage attacks and defenses within a realistic Federated context. By implementing a unified benchmark that encompasses multiple state-of-the-art Deep Leakage techniques and various defense strategies, our framework facilitates the evaluation and comparison of the efficacy of these methods across different datasets and training states. This work highlights a crucial trade-off between privacy and model accuracy in Federated Learning and aims to advance the understanding of security challenges in decentralized machine learning systems, stimulate future research, and enhance reproducibility in evaluating Deep Leakage attacks and defenses.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art methods for Transformer-based semantic segmentation typically adopt Transformer decoders that are used to extract additional embeddings from image embeddings via cross-attention, refine either or both types of embeddings via self-attention, and project image embeddings onto the additional embeddings via dot-product. Despite their remarkable success, these empirical designs still lack theoretical justifications or interpretations, thus hindering potentially principled improvements. In this paper, we argue that there are fundamental connections between semantic segmentation and compression, especially between the Transformer decoders and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). From such a perspective, we derive a white-box, fully attentional DEcoder for PrIncipled semantiC segemenTation (DEPICT), with the interpretations as follows: 1) the self-attention operator refines image embeddings to construct an ideal principal subspace that aligns with the supervision and retains most information; 2) the cross-attention operator seeks to find a low-rank approximation of the refined image embeddings, which is expected to be a set of orthonormal bases of the principal subspace and corresponds to the predefined classes; 3) the dot-product operation yields compact representation for image embeddings as segmentation masks. Experiments conducted on dataset ADE20K find that DEPICT consistently outperforms its black-box counterpart, Segmenter, and it is light weight and more robust.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a popular solution to alleviate the high annotation cost in medical image classification. As a main branch of SSL, consistency regularization engages in imposing consensus between the predictions of a single sample from different views, termed as Absolute Location consistency (AL-c). However, only AL-c may be insufficient. Just like when diagnosing a case in practice, besides the case itself, the doctor usually refers to certain related trustworthy cases to make more reliable decisions.Therefore, we argue that solely relying on AL-c may ignore the relative differences across samples, which we interpret as relative locations, and only exploit limited information from one perspective. To address this issue, we propose a Sample Consistency Mean Teacher (SCMT) which not only incorporates AL c but also additionally enforces consistency between the samples' relative similarities to its related samples, called Relative Location consistency (RL c). AL c and RL c conduct consistency regularization from two different perspectives, jointly extracting more diverse semantic information for classification. On the other hand, due to the highly similar structures in medical images, the sample distribution could be overly dense in feature space, making their relative locations susceptible to noise. To tackle this problem, we further develop a Sample Scatter Mean Teacher (SSMT) by utilizing contrastive learning to sparsify the sample distribution and obtain robust and effective relative locations. Extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.

- **Summary**: Objective: We present the PaHaW Parkinson's disease handwriting database, consisting of handwriting samples from Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and healthy controls. Our goal is to show that kinematic features and pressure features in handwriting can be used for the differential diagnosis of PD. Methods and Material: The database contains records from 37 PD patients and 38 healthy controls performing eight different handwriting tasks. The tasks include drawing an Archimedean spiral, repetitively writing orthographically simple syllables and words, and writing of a sentence. In addition to the conventional kinematic features related to the dynamics of handwriting, we investigated new pressure features based on the pressure exerted on the writing surface. To discriminate between PD patients and healthy subjects, three different classifiers were compared: K-nearest neighbors (K-NN), ensemble AdaBoost classifier, and support vector machines (SVM). Results: For predicting PD based on kinematic and pressure features of handwriting, the best performing model was SVM with classification accuracy of Pacc = 81.3% (sensitivity Psen = 87.4% and specificity of Pspe = 80.9%). When evaluated separately, pressure features proved to be relevant for PD diagnosis, yielding Pacc = 82.5% compared to Pacc = 75.4% using kinematic features. Conclusion: Experimental results showed that an analysis of kinematic and pressure features during handwriting can help assess subtle characteristics of handwriting and discriminate between PD patients and healthy controls.

- **Summary**: Neural implicit functions have brought impressive advances to the state-of-the-art of clothed human digitization from multiple or even single images. However, despite the progress, current arts still have difficulty generalizing to unseen images with complex cloth deformation and body poses. In this work, we present GarVerseLOD, a new dataset and framework that paves the way to achieving unprecedented robustness in high-fidelity 3D garment reconstruction from a single unconstrained image. Inspired by the recent success of large generative models, we believe that one key to addressing the generalization challenge lies in the quantity and quality of 3D garment data. Towards this end, GarVerseLOD collects 6,000 high-quality cloth models with fine-grained geometry details manually created by professional artists. In addition to the scale of training data, we observe that having disentangled granularities of geometry can play an important role in boosting the generalization capability and inference accuracy of the learned model. We hence craft GarVerseLOD as a hierarchical dataset with levels of details (LOD), spanning from detail-free stylized shape to pose-blended garment with pixel-aligned details. This allows us to make this highly under-constrained problem tractable by factorizing the inference into easier tasks, each narrowed down with smaller searching space. To ensure GarVerseLOD can generalize well to in-the-wild images, we propose a novel labeling paradigm based on conditional diffusion models to generate extensive paired images for each garment model with high photorealism. We evaluate our method on a massive amount of in-the-wild images. Experimental results demonstrate that GarVerseLOD can generate standalone garment pieces with significantly better quality than prior approaches. Project page: https://garverselod.github.io/

- **Summary**: We investigate the construction of gradient-guided conditional diffusion models for reconstructing private images, focusing on the adversarial interplay between differential privacy noise and the denoising capabilities of diffusion models. While current gradient-based reconstruction methods struggle with high-resolution images due to computational complexity and prior knowledge requirements, we propose two novel methods that require minimal modifications to the diffusion model's generation process and eliminate the need for prior knowledge. Our approach leverages the strong image generation capabilities of diffusion models to reconstruct private images starting from randomly generated noise, even when a small amount of differentially private noise has been added to the gradients. We also conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the impact of differential privacy noise on the quality of reconstructed images, revealing the relationship among noise magnitude, the architecture of attacked models, and the attacker's reconstruction capability. Additionally, extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods and the accuracy of our theoretical findings, suggesting new directions for privacy risk auditing using conditional diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Model merging has recently emerged as a cost-efficient paradigm for multi-task learning. Among current approaches, task arithmetic stands out for its simplicity and effectiveness. In this paper, we motivate the effectiveness of task vectors by linking them to multi-task gradients. We show that in a single-epoch scenario, task vectors are mathematically equivalent to the gradients obtained via gradient descent in a multi-task setting, and still approximate these gradients in subsequent epochs. Furthermore, we show that task vectors perform optimally when equality is maintained, and their effectiveness is largely driven by the first epoch's gradient. Building on this insight, we propose viewing model merging as a single step in an iterative process that Alternates between Tuning and Merging (ATM). This method acts as a bridge between model merging and multi-task gradient descent, achieving state-of-the-art results with the same data and computational requirements. We extensively evaluate ATM across diverse settings, achieving up to 20% higher accuracy in computer vision and NLP tasks, compared to the best baselines. Finally, we provide both empirical and theoretical support for its effectiveness, demonstrating increased orthogonality between task vectors and proving that ATM minimizes an upper bound on the loss obtained by jointly finetuning all tasks.

- **Summary**: Segment Anything Model (SAM), a new AI model from Meta AI released in April 2023, is an ambitious tool designed to identify and separate individual objects within a given image through semantic interpretation. The advanced capabilities of SAM are the result of its training with millions of images and masks, and a few days after its release, several researchers began testing the model on medical images to evaluate its performance in this domain. With this perspective in focus -- i.e., optimizing work in the healthcare field -- this work proposes the use of this new technology to evaluate and study chest X-ray images. The approach adopted for this work, with the aim of improving the model's performance for lung segmentation, involved a transfer learning process, specifically the fine-tuning technique. After applying this adjustment, a substantial improvement was observed in the evaluation metrics used to assess SAM's performance compared to the masks provided by the datasets. The results obtained by the model after the adjustments were satisfactory and similar to cutting-edge neural networks, such as U-Net.

- **Summary**: This paper shows how an uncertainty-aware, deep neural network can be trained to detect, recognise and localise objects in 2D RGB images, in applications lacking annotated train-ng datasets. We propose a self-supervising teacher-student pipeline, in which a relatively simple teacher classifier, trained with only a few labelled 2D thumbnails, automatically processes a larger body of unlabelled RGB-D data to teach a student network based on a modified YOLOv3 architecture. Firstly, 3D object detection with back projection is used to automatically extract and teach 2D detection and localisation information to the student network. Secondly, a weakly supervised 2D thumbnail classifier, with minimal training on a small number of hand-labelled images, is used to teach object category recognition. Thirdly, we use a Gaussian Process GP to encode and teach a robust uncertainty estimation functionality, so that the student can output confidence scores with each categorization. The resulting student significantly outperforms the same YOLO architecture trained directly on the same amount of labelled data. Our GP-based approach yields robust and meaningful uncertainty estimations for complex industrial object classifications. The end-to-end network is also capable of real-time processing, needed for robotics applications. Our method can be applied to many important industrial tasks, where labelled datasets are typically unavailable. In this paper, we demonstrate an example of detection, localisation, and object category recognition of nuclear mixed-waste materials in highly cluttered and unstructured scenes. This is critical for robotic sorting and handling of legacy nuclear waste, which poses complex environmental remediation challenges in many nuclearised nations.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in radiance field rendering show promising results in 3D scene representation, where Gaussian splatting-based techniques emerge as state-of-the-art due to their quality and efficiency. Gaussian splatting is widely used for various applications, including 3D human representation. However, previous 3D Gaussian splatting methods either use parametric body models as additional information or fail to provide any underlying structure, like human biomechanical features, which are essential for different applications. In this paper, we present a novel approach called HFGaussian that can estimate novel views and human features, such as the 3D skeleton, 3D key points, and dense pose, from sparse input images in real time at 25 FPS. The proposed method leverages generalizable Gaussian splatting technique to represent the human subject and its associated features, enabling efficient and generalizable reconstruction. By incorporating a pose regression network and the feature splatting technique with Gaussian splatting, HFGaussian demonstrates improved capabilities over existing 3D human methods, showcasing the potential of 3D human representations with integrated biomechanics. We thoroughly evaluate our HFGaussian method against the latest state-of-the-art techniques in human Gaussian splatting and pose estimation, demonstrating its real-time, state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Limited medical imaging datasets challenge deep learning models by increasing risks of overfitting and reduced generalization, particularly in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), where discriminators may overfit, leading to training divergence. This constraint also impairs classification models trained on small datasets. Generative Data Augmentation (GDA) addresses this by expanding training datasets with synthetic data, although it requires training a generative model. We propose and evaluate two local lesion generation approaches to address the challenge of augmenting small medical image datasets. The first approach employs the Poisson Image Editing algorithm, a classical image processing technique, to create realistic image composites that outperform current state-of-the-art methods. The second approach introduces a novel generative method, leveraging a fine-tuned Image Inpainting GAN to synthesize realistic lesions within specified regions of real training images. A comprehensive comparison of the two proposed methods demonstrates that effective local lesion generation in a data-constrained setting allows for reaching new state-of-the-art results in capsule endoscopy lesion classification. Combination of our techniques achieves a macro F1-score of 33.07%, surpassing the previous best result by 7.84 percentage points (p.p.) on the highly imbalanced Kvasir Capsule Dataset, a benchmark for capsule endoscopy. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply a fine-tuned Image Inpainting GAN for GDA in medical imaging, demonstrating that an image-conditional GAN can be adapted effectively to limited datasets to generate high-quality examples, facilitating effective data augmentation. Additionally, we show that combining this GAN-based approach with classical image processing techniques further enhances the results.

- **Summary**: In this paper, a recently developed snapshot hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system based on Computed Tomography Imaging Spectroscopy (CTIS) is utilized to determine Brix and pH values in Sheegene 20 table grapes through Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) modeling. The performance of the CTIS system is compared with that of a state-of-the-art line scan HSI system by imaging 100 grapes across both platforms. Reference measurements of Brix and pH values are obtained directly using a refractometer and a pH meter, as these parameters are essential for assessing the quality of table and wine grapes. The findings indicate that the spectra captured by the CTIS camera correlate well with the reference measurements, despite the system's narrower spectral range. The CTIS camera's advantages, including its lower cost, portability, and reduced susceptibility to motion errors, highlight its potential for promising in-field applications in grape quality assessment.

- **Summary**: Ground reaction force (GRF) is the force exerted by the ground on a body in contact with it. GRF-based automatic disease detection (ADD) has become an emerging medical diagnosis method, which aims to learn and identify disease patterns corresponding to different gait pressures based on deep learning methods. Although existing ADD methods can save doctors time in making diagnoses, training deep models still struggles with the cost caused by the labeling engineering for a large number of gait diagnostic data for subjects. On the other hand, the accuracy of the deep model under the unified benchmark GRF dataset and the generalization ability on scalable gait datasets need to be further improved. To address these issues, we propose MA2, a GRF-based self-supervised and motion augmenting auto-encoder, which models the ADD task as an encoder-decoder paradigm. In the encoder, we introduce an embedding block including the 3-layer 1D convolution for extracting the token and a mask generator to randomly mask out the sequence of tokens to maximize the model's potential to capture high-level, discriminative, intrinsic representations. whereafter, the decoder utilizes this information to reconstruct the pixel sequence of the origin input and calculate the reconstruction loss to optimize the network. Moreover, the backbone of an auto-encoder is multi-head self-attention that can consider the global information of the token from the input, not just the local neighborhood. This allows the model to capture generalized contextual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate MA2 has SOTA performance of 90.91% accuracy on 1% limited pathological GRF samples with labels, and good generalization ability of 78.57% accuracy on scalable Parkinson disease dataset.

- **Summary**: Pre-training for Reinforcement Learning (RL) with purely video data is a valuable yet challenging problem. Although in-the-wild videos are readily available and inhere a vast amount of prior world knowledge, the absence of action annotations and the common domain gap with downstream tasks hinder utilizing videos for RL pre-training. To address the challenge of pre-training with videos, we propose Pre-trained Visual Dynamics Representations (PVDR) to bridge the domain gap between videos and downstream tasks for efficient policy learning. By adopting video prediction as a pre-training task, we use a Transformer-based Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to learn visual dynamics representations. The pre-trained visual dynamics representations capture the visual dynamics prior knowledge in the videos. This abstract prior knowledge can be readily adapted to downstream tasks and aligned with executable actions through online adaptation. We conduct experiments on a series of robotics visual control tasks and verify that PVDR is an effective form for pre-training with videos to promote policy learning.

- **Summary**: Large-scale training of latent diffusion models (LDMs) has enabled unprecedented quality in image generation. However, the key components of the best performing LDM training recipes are oftentimes not available to the research community, preventing apple-to-apple comparisons and hindering the validation of progress in the field. In this work, we perform an in-depth study of LDM training recipes focusing on the performance of models and their training efficiency. To ensure apple-to-apple comparisons, we re-implement five previously published models with their corresponding recipes. Through our study, we explore the effects of (i)~the mechanisms used to condition the generative model on semantic information (e.g., text prompt) and control metadata (e.g., crop size, random flip flag, etc.) on the model performance, and (ii)~the transfer of the representations learned on smaller and lower-resolution datasets to larger ones on the training efficiency and model performance. We then propose a novel conditioning mechanism that disentangles semantic and control metadata conditionings and sets a new state-of-the-art in class-conditional generation on the ImageNet-1k dataset -- with FID improvements of 7% on 256 and 8% on 512 resolutions -- as well as text-to-image generation on the CC12M dataset -- with FID improvements of 8% on 256 and 23% on 512 resolution.

- **Summary**: Earth Observation (EO) data analysis has been significantly revolutionized by deep learning (DL), with applications typically limited to grid-like data structures. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) emerge as an important innovation, propelling DL into the non-Euclidean domain. Naturally, GNNs can effectively tackle the challenges posed by diverse modalities, multiple sensors, and the heterogeneous nature of EO data. To introduce GNNs in the related domains, our review begins by offering fundamental knowledge on GNNs. Then, we summarize the generic problems in EO, to which GNNs can offer potential solutions. Following this, we explore a broad spectrum of GNNs' applications to scientific problems in Earth systems, covering areas such as weather and climate analysis, disaster management, air quality monitoring, agriculture, land cover classification, hydrological process modeling, and urban modeling. The rationale behind adopting GNNs in these fields is explained, alongside methodologies for organizing graphs and designing favorable architectures for various tasks. Furthermore, we highlight methodological challenges of implementing GNNs in these domains and possible solutions that could guide future research. While acknowledging that GNNs are not a universal solution, we conclude the paper by comparing them with other popular architectures like transformers and analyzing their potential synergies.

- **Summary**: In the era of Generative AI, Neurosymbolic AI is emerging as a powerful approach for tasks spanning from perception to cognition. The use of Neurosymbolic AI has been shown to achieve enhanced capabilities, including improved grounding, alignment, explainability, and reliability. However, due to its nascent stage, there is a lack of widely available real-world benchmark datasets tailored to Neurosymbolic AI tasks. To address this gap and support the evaluation of current and future methods, we introduce DSceneKG -- a suite of knowledge graphs of driving scenes built from real-world, high-quality scenes from multiple open autonomous driving datasets. In this article, we detail the construction process of DSceneKG and highlight its application in seven different tasks. DSceneKG is publicly accessible at: https://github.com/ruwantw/DSceneKG

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been heavily used in Deep Learning due to their success in various tasks. Nonetheless, it has been observed that CNNs suffer from redundancy in feature maps, leading to inefficient capacity utilization. Efforts to mitigate and solve this problem led to the emergence of multiple methods, amongst which is kernel orthogonality through variant means. In this work, we challenge the common belief that kernel orthogonality leads to a decrease in feature map redundancy, which is, supposedly, the ultimate objective behind kernel orthogonality. We prove, theoretically and empirically, that kernel orthogonality has an unpredictable effect on feature map similarity and does not necessarily decrease it. Based on our theoretical result, we propose an effective method to reduce feature map similarity independently of the input of the CNN. This is done by minimizing a novel loss function we call Convolutional Similarity. Empirical results show that minimizing the Convolutional Similarity increases the performance of classification models and can accelerate their convergence. Furthermore, using our proposed method pushes towards a more efficient use of the capacity of models, allowing the use of significantly smaller models to achieve the same levels of performance.

- **Summary**: Topological correctness plays a critical role in many image segmentation tasks, yet most networks are trained using pixel-wise loss functions, such as Dice, neglecting topological accuracy. Existing topology-aware methods often lack robust topological guarantees, are limited to specific use cases, or impose high computational costs. In this work, we propose a novel, graph-based framework for topologically accurate image segmentation that is both computationally efficient and generally applicable. Our method constructs a component graph that fully encodes the topological information of both the prediction and ground truth, allowing us to efficiently identify topologically critical regions and aggregate a loss based on local neighborhood information. Furthermore, we introduce a strict topological metric capturing the homotopy equivalence between the union and intersection of prediction-label pairs. We formally prove the topological guarantees of our approach and empirically validate its effectiveness on binary and multi-class datasets. Our loss demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with up to fivefold faster loss computation compared to persistent homology methods.

- **Summary**: Recovering high-quality depth maps from compressed sources has gained significant attention due to the limitations of consumer-grade depth cameras and the bandwidth restrictions during data transmission. However, current methods still suffer from two challenges. First, bit-depth compression produces a uniform depth representation in regions with subtle variations, hindering the recovery of detailed information. Second, densely distributed random noise reduces the accuracy of estimating the global geometric structure of the scene. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, termed geometry-decoupled network (GDNet), for compressed depth map super-resolution that decouples the high-quality depth map reconstruction process by handling global and detailed geometric features separately. To be specific, we propose the fine geometry detail encoder (FGDE), which is designed to aggregate fine geometry details in high-resolution low-level image features while simultaneously enriching them with complementary information from low-resolution context-level image features. In addition, we develop the global geometry encoder (GGE) that aims at suppressing noise and extracting global geometric information effectively via constructing compact feature representation in a low-rank space. We conduct experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our GDNet significantly outperforms current methods in terms of geometric consistency and detail recovery. In the ECCV 2024 AIM Compressed Depth Upsampling Challenge, our solution won the 1st place award. Our codes will be available.

- **Summary**: Image shadow removal is a typical low-level vision problem, where the presence of shadows leads to abrupt changes in brightness in certain regions, affecting the accuracy of upstream tasks. Current shadow removal methods still face challenges such as residual boundary artifacts, and capturing feature information at shadow boundaries is crucial for removing shadows and eliminating residual boundary artifacts. Recently, Mamba has achieved remarkable success in computer vision by globally modeling long-sequence information with linear complexity. However, when applied to image shadow removal, the original Mamba scanning method overlooks the semantic continuity of shadow boundaries as well as the continuity of semantics within the same region. Based on the unique characteristics of shadow images, this paper proposes a novel selective scanning method called boundary-region selective scanning. This method scans boundary regions, shadow regions, and non-shadow regions independently, bringing pixels of the same region type closer together in the long sequence, especially focusing on the local information at the boundaries, which is crucial for shadow removal. This method combines with global scanning and channel scanning to jointly accomplish the shadow removal. We name our model ShadowMamba, the first Mamba-based model for shadow removal. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art models across most metrics on multiple datasets. The code for ShadowMamba is available at (Code will be released upon acceptance).

- **Summary**: Despite recent advances in UNet-based image editing, methods for shape-aware object editing in high-resolution images are still lacking. Compared to UNet, Diffusion Transformers (DiT) demonstrate superior capabilities to effectively capture the long-range dependencies among patches, leading to higher-quality image generation. In this paper, we propose DiT4Edit, the first Diffusion Transformer-based image editing framework. Specifically, DiT4Edit uses the DPM-Solver inversion algorithm to obtain the inverted latents, reducing the number of steps compared to the DDIM inversion algorithm commonly used in UNet-based frameworks. Additionally, we design unified attention control and patches merging, tailored for transformer computation streams. This integration allows our framework to generate higher-quality edited images faster. Our design leverages the advantages of DiT, enabling it to surpass UNet structures in image editing, especially in high-resolution and arbitrary-size images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong performance of DiT4Edit across various editing scenarios, highlighting the potential of Diffusion Transformers in supporting image editing.

- **Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across various visual understanding and reasoning tasks. However, their real-world deployment is often constrained by high latency during inference due to substantial compute required to process the large number of input tokens (predominantly from the image) by the LLM. To reduce inference costs, one can either downsize the LLM or reduce the number of input image-tokens, the latter of which has been the focus of many recent works around token compression. However, it is unclear what the optimal trade-off is, as both the factors directly affect the VLM performance. We first characterize this optimal trade-off between the number of visual tokens and LLM parameters by establishing scaling laws that capture variations in performance with these two factors. Our results reveal a surprising trend: for visual reasoning tasks, the inference-optimal behavior in VLMs, i.e., minimum downstream error at any given fixed inference compute, is achieved when using the largest LLM that fits within the inference budget while minimizing visual token count - often to a single token. While the token reduction literature has mainly focused on maintaining base model performance by modestly reducing the token count (e.g., $5-10\times$), our results indicate that the compute-optimal inference regime requires operating under even higher token compression ratios. Based on these insights, we take some initial steps towards building approaches tailored for high token compression settings.

- **Summary**: We introduce SuperClass, a super simple classification method for vision-language pre-training on image-text data. Unlike its contrastive counterpart CLIP who contrast with a text encoder, SuperClass directly utilizes tokenized raw text as supervised classification labels, without the need for additional text filtering or selection. Due to the absence of the text encoding as contrastive target, SuperClass does not require a text encoder and does not need to maintain a large batch size as CLIP does. SuperClass demonstrated superior performance on various downstream tasks, including classic computer vision benchmarks and vision language downstream tasks. We further explored the scaling behavior of SuperClass on model size, training length, or data size, and reported encouraging results and comparisons to CLIP. https://github.com/x-cls/superclass

- **Summary**: In recent years, multimodal benchmarks for general domains have guided the rapid development of multimodal models on general tasks. However, the financial field has its peculiarities. It features unique graphical images (e.g., candlestick charts, technical indicator charts) and possesses a wealth of specialized financial knowledge (e.g., futures, turnover rate). Therefore, benchmarks from general fields often fail to measure the performance of multimodal models in the financial domain, and thus cannot effectively guide the rapid development of large financial models. To promote the development of large financial multimodal models, we propose MME-Finance, an bilingual open-ended and practical usage-oriented Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark. The characteristics of our benchmark are finance and expertise, which include constructing charts that reflect the actual usage needs of users (e.g., computer screenshots and mobile photography), creating questions according to the preferences in financial domain inquiries, and annotating questions by experts with 10+ years of experience in the financial industry. Additionally, we have developed a custom-designed financial evaluation system in which visual information is first introduced in the multi-modal evaluation process. Extensive experimental evaluations of 19 mainstream MLLMs are conducted to test their perception, reasoning, and cognition capabilities. The results indicate that models performing well on general benchmarks cannot do well on MME-Finance; for instance, the top-performing open-source and closed-source models obtain 65.69 (Qwen2VL-72B) and 63.18 (GPT-4o), respectively. Their performance is particularly poor in categories most relevant to finance, such as candlestick charts and technical indicator charts. In addition, we propose a Chinese version, which helps compare performance of MLLMs under a Chinese context.
