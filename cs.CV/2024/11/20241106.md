- **Summary**: Language models for American Sign Language (ASL) could make language technologies substantially more accessible to those who sign. To train models on tasks such as isolated sign recognition (ISR) and ASL-to-English translation, datasets provide annotated video examples of ASL signs. To facilitate the generalizability and explainability of these models, we introduce the American Sign Language Knowledge Graph (ASLKG), compiled from twelve sources of expert linguistic knowledge. We use the ASLKG to train neuro-symbolic models for 3 ASL understanding tasks, achieving accuracies of 91% on ISR, 14% for predicting the semantic features of unseen signs, and 36% for classifying the topic of Youtube-ASL videos.

- **Summary**: Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm designed to protect data privacy. However, data heterogeneity across various clients results in catastrophic forgetting, where the model rapidly forgets previous knowledge while acquiring new knowledge. To address this challenge, personalized federated learning has emerged to customize a personalized model for each client. However, the inherent limitation of this mechanism is its excessive focus on personalization, potentially hindering the generalization of those models. In this paper, we present a novel personalized federated learning method that uses global and historical models as teachers and the local model as the student to facilitate comprehensive knowledge distillation. The historical model represents the local model from the last round of client training, containing historical personalized knowledge, while the global model represents the aggregated model from the last round of server aggregation, containing global generalized knowledge. By applying knowledge distillation, we effectively transfer global generalized knowledge and historical personalized knowledge to the local model, thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting and enhancing the general performance of personalized models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages of our method.

- **Summary**: Multispectral pedestrian detection has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in autonomous driving applications. To address the challenges posed by adversarial illumination conditions, the combination of thermal and visible images has demonstrated its advantages. However, existing fusion methods rely on the critical assumption that the RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) image pairs are fully overlapping. These assumptions often do not hold in real-world applications, where only partial overlap between images can occur due to sensors configuration. Moreover, sensor failure can cause loss of information in one modality. In this paper, we propose a novel module called the Hybrid Attention (HA) mechanism as our main contribution to mitigate performance degradation caused by partial overlap and sensor failure, i.e. when at least part of the scene is acquired by only one sensor. We propose an improved RGB-T fusion algorithm, robust against partial overlap and sensor failure encountered during inference in real-world applications. We also leverage a mobile-friendly backbone to cope with resource constraints in embedded systems. We conducted experiments by simulating various partial overlap and sensor failure scenarios to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its superiority in handling real-world challenges.

- **Summary**: Recently the dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) based on neural implicit representation has shown impressive progress in hole filling and high-fidelity mapping. Nevertheless, existing methods either heavily rely on known scene bounds or suffer inconsistent reconstruction due to drift in potential loop-closure regions, or both, which can be attributed to the inflexible representation and lack of local constraints. In this paper, we present LCP-Fusion, a neural implicit SLAM system with enhanced local constraints and computable prior, which takes the sparse voxel octree structure containing feature grids and SDF priors as hybrid scene representation, enabling the scalability and robustness during mapping and tracking. To enhance the local constraints, we propose a novel sliding window selection strategy based on visual overlap to address the loop-closure, and a practical warping loss to constrain relative poses. Moreover, we estimate SDF priors as coarse initialization for implicit features, which brings additional explicit constraints and robustness, especially when a light but efficient adaptive early ending is adopted. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieve better localization accuracy and reconstruction consistency than existing RGB-D implicit SLAM, especially in challenging real scenes (ScanNet) as well as self-captured scenes with unknown scene bounds.

  8353, Infrared Technology and Applications XXXVIII; 83531O, April 2012
- **Summary**: We propose a new way to correct for the non-uniformity (NU) and the noise in uncooled infrared-type images. This method works on static images, needs no registration, no camera motion and no model for the non uniformity. The proposed method uses an hybrid scheme including an automatic locally-adaptive contrast adjustment and a state-of-the-art image denoising method. It permits to correct for a fully non-linear NU and the noise efficiently using only one image. We compared it with total variation on real raw and simulated NU infrared images. The strength of this approach lies in its simplicity, low computational cost. It needs no test-pattern or calibration and produces no "ghost-artefact".

- **Summary**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been successfully used to align large language models (LLMs) according to human preferences, and more recently it has also been applied to improving the quality of text-to-image diffusion models. However, DPO-based methods such as SPO, Diffusion-DPO, and D3PO are highly susceptible to overfitting and reward hacking, especially when the generative model is optimized to fit out-of-distribution during prolonged training. To overcome these challenges and stabilize the training of diffusion models, we introduce a self-entropy regularization mechanism in reinforcement learning from human feedback. This enhancement improves DPO training by encouraging broader exploration and greater robustness. Our regularization technique effectively mitigates reward hacking, leading to improved stability and enhanced image quality across the latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating human feedback with self-entropy regularization can significantly boost image diversity and specificity, achieving state-of-the-art results on key image generation metrics.

- **Summary**: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a primary cause of blindness, necessitating early detection and diagnosis. This paper focuses on referable DR classification to enhance the applicability of the proposed method in clinical practice. We develop an advanced cross-learning DR classification method leveraging transfer learning and cross-attention mechanisms. The proposed method employs the Swin U-Net architecture to segment lesion maps from DR fundus images. The Swin U-Net segmentation model, enriched with DR lesion insights, is transferred to generate a lesion map. Both the fundus image and its segmented lesion map are used as complementary inputs for the classification model. A cross-attention mechanism is deployed to improve the model's ability to capture fine-grained details from the input pairs. Our experiments, utilizing two public datasets, FGADR and EyePACS, demonstrate a superior accuracy of 94.6%, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods by 4.4%. To this end, we aim for the proposed method to be seamlessly integrated into clinical workflows, enhancing accuracy and efficiency in identifying referable DR.

- **Summary**: The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded their capabilities from image comprehension to video understanding. However, most of these MLLMs focus primarily on offline video comprehension, necessitating extensive processing of all video frames before any queries can be made. This presents a significant gap compared to the human ability to watch, listen, think, and respond to streaming inputs in real time, highlighting the limitations of current MLLMs. In this paper, we introduce StreamingBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the streaming video understanding capabilities of MLLMs. StreamingBench assesses three core aspects of streaming video understanding: (1) real-time visual understanding, (2) omni-source understanding, and (3) contextual understanding. The benchmark consists of 18 tasks, featuring 900 videos and 4,500 human-curated QA pairs. Each video features five questions presented at different time points to simulate a continuous streaming scenario. We conduct experiments on StreamingBench with 13 open-source and proprietary MLLMs and find that even the most advanced proprietary MLLMs like Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4o perform significantly below human-level streaming video understanding capabilities. We hope our work can facilitate further advancements for MLLMs, empowering them to approach human-level video comprehension and interaction in more realistic scenarios.

- **Summary**: Despite the substantial progress of novel view synthesis, existing methods, either based on the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or more recently 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), suffer significant degradation when the input becomes sparse. Numerous efforts have been introduced to alleviate this problem, but they still struggle to synthesize satisfactory results efficiently, especially in the large scene. In this paper, we propose SCGaussian, a Structure Consistent Gaussian Splatting method using matching priors to learn 3D consistent scene structure. Considering the high interdependence of Gaussian attributes, we optimize the scene structure in two folds: rendering geometry and, more importantly, the position of Gaussian primitives, which is hard to be directly constrained in the vanilla 3DGS due to the non-structure property. To achieve this, we present a hybrid Gaussian representation. Besides the ordinary non-structure Gaussian primitives, our model also consists of ray-based Gaussian primitives that are bound to matching rays and whose optimization of their positions is restricted along the ray. Thus, we can utilize the matching correspondence to directly enforce the position of these Gaussian primitives to converge to the surface points where rays intersect. Extensive experiments on forward-facing, surrounding, and complex large scenes show the effectiveness of our approach with state-of-the-art performance and high efficiency.

- **Summary**: Depth estimation under adverse conditions remains a significant challenge. Recently, multi-spectral depth estimation, which integrates both visible light and thermal images, has shown promise in addressing this issue. However, existing algorithms struggle with precise pixel-level feature matching, limiting their ability to fully exploit geometric constraints across different spectra. To address this, we propose a novel framework incorporating stereo depth estimation to enforce accurate geometric constraints. In particular, we treat the visible light and thermal images as a stereo pair and utilize a Cross-modal Feature Matching (CFM) Module to construct a cost volume for pixel-level matching. To mitigate the effects of poor lighting on stereo matching, we introduce Degradation Masking, which leverages robust monocular thermal depth estimation in degraded regions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the Multi-Spectral Stereo (MS2) dataset, with qualitative evaluations demonstrating high-quality depth maps under varying lighting conditions.

- **Summary**: High-quality training triplets (instruction, original image, edited image) are essential for instruction-based image editing. Predominant training datasets (e.g., InsPix2Pix) are created using text-to-image generative models (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL-E) which are not trained for image editing. Accordingly, these datasets suffer from inaccurate instruction following, poor detail preserving, and generation artifacts. In this paper, we propose to address the training data quality issue with multi-perspective reward data instead of refining the ground-truth image quality. 1) we first design a quantitative metric system based on best-in-class LVLM (Large Vision Language Model), i.e., GPT-4o in our case, to evaluate the generation quality from 3 perspectives, namely, instruction following, detail preserving, and generation quality. For each perspective, we collected quantitative score in $0\sim 5$ and text descriptive feedback on the specific failure points in ground-truth edited images, resulting in a high-quality editing reward dataset, i.e., RewardEdit20K. 2) We further proposed a novel training framework to seamlessly integrate the metric output, regarded as multi-reward, into editing models to learn from the imperfect training triplets. During training, the reward scores and text descriptions are encoded as embeddings and fed into both the latent space and the U-Net of the editing models as auxiliary conditions. During inference, we set these additional conditions to the highest score with no text description for failure points, to aim at the best generation outcome. Experiments indicate that our multi-reward conditioned model outperforms its no-reward counterpart on two popular editing pipelines, i.e., InsPix2Pix and SmartEdit. The code and dataset will be released.

- **Summary**: How can we test AI performance? This question seems trivial, but it isn't. Standard benchmarks often have problems such as in-distribution and small-size test sets, oversimplified metrics, unfair comparisons, and short-term outcome pressure. As a consequence, good performance on standard benchmarks does not guarantee success in real-world scenarios. To address these problems, we present Touchstone, a large-scale collaborative segmentation benchmark of 9 types of abdominal organs. This benchmark is based on 5,195 training CT scans from 76 hospitals around the world and 5,903 testing CT scans from 11 additional hospitals. This diverse test set enhances the statistical significance of benchmark results and rigorously evaluates AI algorithms across various out-of-distribution scenarios. We invited 14 inventors of 19 AI algorithms to train their algorithms, while our team, as a third party, independently evaluated these algorithms on three test sets. In addition, we also evaluated pre-existing AI frameworks--which, differing from algorithms, are more flexible and can support different algorithms--including MONAI from NVIDIA, nnU-Net from DKFZ, and numerous other open-source frameworks. We are committed to expanding this benchmark to encourage more innovation of AI algorithms for the medical domain.

- **Summary**: Semantic scene completion (SSC) is essential for achieving comprehensive perception in autonomous driving systems. However, existing SSC methods often overlook the high deployment costs in real-world applications. Traditional architectures, such as 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) and self-attention mechanisms, face challenges in efficiently capturing long-range dependencies within 3D voxel grids, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce MetaSSC, a novel meta-learning-based framework for SSC that leverages deformable convolution, large-kernel attention, and the Mamba (D-LKA-M) model. Our approach begins with a voxel-based semantic segmentation (SS) pretraining task, aimed at exploring the semantics and geometry of incomplete regions while acquiring transferable meta-knowledge. Using simulated cooperative perception datasets, we supervise the perception training of a single vehicle using aggregated sensor data from multiple nearby connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), generating richer and more comprehensive labels. This meta-knowledge is then adapted to the target domain through a dual-phase training strategy that does not add extra model parameters, enabling efficient deployment. To further enhance the model's capability in capturing long-sequence relationships within 3D voxel grids, we integrate Mamba blocks with deformable convolution and large-kernel attention into the backbone network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming competing models while also reducing deployment costs.

- **Summary**: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a paradigm in knowledge representation, offering exceptional flexibility and performance across a diverse range of applications. INRs leverage multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to model data as continuous implicit functions, providing critical advantages such as resolution independence, memory efficiency, and generalisation beyond discretised data structures. Their ability to solve complex inverse problems makes them particularly effective for tasks including audio reconstruction, image representation, 3D object reconstruction, and high-dimensional data synthesis. This survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art INR methods, introducing a clear taxonomy that categorises them into four key areas: activation functions, position encoding, combined strategies, and network structure optimisation. We rigorously analyse their critical properties, such as full differentiability, smoothness, compactness, and adaptability to varying resolutions while also examining their strengths and limitations in addressing locality biases and capturing fine details. Our experimental comparison offers new insights into the trade-offs between different approaches, showcasing the capabilities and challenges of the latest INR techniques across various tasks. In addition to identifying areas where current methods excel, we highlight key limitations and potential avenues for improvement, such as developing more expressive activation functions, enhancing positional encoding mechanisms, and improving scalability for complex, high-dimensional data. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers, offering practical guidance for future exploration in the field of INRs. We aim to foster new methodologies by outlining promising research directions for INRs and applications.

- **Summary**: Surgical instrument segmentation (SIS) is pivotal for robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery, assisting surgeons by identifying surgical instruments in endoscopic video frames. Recent unsupervised surgical instrument segmentation (USIS) methods primarily rely on pseudo-labels derived from low-level features such as color and optical flow, but these methods show limited effectiveness and generalizability in complex and unseen endoscopic scenarios. In this work, we propose a label-free unsupervised model featuring a novel module named Multi-View Normalized Cutter (m-NCutter). Different from previous USIS works, our model is trained using a graph-cutting loss function that leverages patch affinities for supervision, eliminating the need for pseudo-labels. The framework adaptively determines which affinities from which levels should be prioritized. Therefore, the low- and high-level features and their affinities are effectively integrated to train a label-free unsupervised model, showing superior effectiveness and generalization ability. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple SIS datasets to validate our approach's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, robustness, and exceptional potential as a pre-trained model. Our code is released at https://github.com/MingyuShengSMY/AMNCutter.

- **Summary**: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is crucial for finely representing the surrounding environment, which is essential for ensuring the safety in autonomous driving. Existing fusion-based occupancy methods typically involve performing a 2D-to-3D view transformation on image features, followed by computationally intensive 3D operations to fuse these with LiDAR features, leading to high computational costs and reduced accuracy. Moreover, current research on occupancy prediction predominantly focuses on designing specific network architectures, often tailored to particular models, with limited attention given to the more fundamental aspect of semantic feature learning. This gap hinders the development of more transferable methods that could enhance the performance of various occupancy models. To address these challenges, we propose OccLoff, a framework that Learns to Optimize Feature Fusion for 3D occupancy prediction. Specifically, we introduce a sparse fusion encoder with entropy masks that directly fuses 3D and 2D features, improving model accuracy while reducing computational overhead. Additionally, we propose a transferable proxy-based loss function and an adaptive hard sample weighting algorithm, which enhance the performance of several state-of-the-art methods. Extensive evaluations on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each proposed module.

- **Summary**: The growing demand for robust scene understanding in mobile robotics and autonomous driving has highlighted the importance of integrating multiple sensing modalities. By combining data from diverse sensors like cameras and LIDARs, fusion techniques can overcome the limitations of individual sensors, enabling a more complete and accurate perception of the environment. We introduce a novel approach to multi-modal sensor fusion, focusing on developing a graph-based state representation that supports critical decision-making processes in autonomous driving. We present a Sensor-Agnostic Graph-Aware Kalman Filter [3], the first online state estimation technique designed to fuse multi-modal graphs derived from noisy multi-sensor data. The estimated graph-based state representations serve as a foundation for advanced applications like Multi-Object Tracking (MOT), offering a comprehensive framework for enhancing the situational awareness and safety of autonomous systems. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework through extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world driving datasets (nuScenes). Our results showcase an improvement in MOTA and a reduction in estimated position errors (MOTP) and identity switches (IDS) for tracked objects using the SAGA-KF. Furthermore, we highlight the capability of such a framework to develop methods that can leverage heterogeneous information (like semantic objects and geometric structures) from various sensing modalities, enabling a more holistic approach to scene understanding and enhancing the safety and effectiveness of autonomous systems.

- **Summary**: We present 3DGS-CD, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based method for detecting physical object rearrangements in 3D scenes. Our approach estimates 3D object-level changes by comparing two sets of unaligned images taken at different times. Leveraging 3DGS's novel view rendering and EfficientSAM's zero-shot segmentation capabilities, we detect 2D object-level changes, which are then associated and fused across views to estimate 3D changes. Our method can detect changes in cluttered environments using sparse post-change images within as little as 18s, using as few as a single new image. It does not rely on depth input, user instructions, object classes, or object models -- An object is recognized simply if it has been re-arranged. Our approach is evaluated on both public and self-collected real-world datasets, achieving up to 14% higher accuracy and three orders of magnitude faster performance compared to the state-of-the-art radiance-field-based change detection method. This significant performance boost enables a broad range of downstream applications, where we highlight three key use cases: object reconstruction, robot workspace reset, and 3DGS model update. Our code and data will be made available at https://github.com/520xyxyzq/3DGS-CD.

- **Summary**: Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) plays a critical role in manufacturing by defining acceptable variations in part features to ensure component quality and functionality. However, extracting GD&T information from 2D engineering drawings is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task, often relying on manual efforts or semi-automated tools. To address these challenges, this study proposes an automated and computationally efficient GD&T extraction method by fine-tuning Florence-2, an open-source vision-language model (VLM). The model is trained on a dataset of 400 drawings with ground truth annotations provided by domain experts. For comparison, two state-of-the-art closed-source VLMs, GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet, are evaluated on the same dataset. All models are assessed using precision, recall, F1-score, and hallucination metrics. Due to the computational cost and impracticality of fine-tuning large closed-source VLMs for domain-specific tasks, GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet are evaluated in a zero-shot setting. In contrast, Florence-2, a smaller model with 0.23 billion parameters, is optimized through full-parameter fine-tuning across three distinct experiments, each utilizing datasets augmented to different levels. The results show that Florence-2 achieves a 29.95% increase in precision, a 37.75% increase in recall, a 52.40% improvement in F1-score, and a 43.15% reduction in hallucination rate compared to the best-performing closed-source model. These findings highlight the effectiveness of fine-tuning smaller, open-source VLMs like Florence-2, offering a practical and efficient solution for automated GD&T extraction to support downstream manufacturing tasks.

- **Summary**: In Human Activity Recognition (HAR), understanding the intricacy of body movements within high-risk applications is essential. This study uses SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to explain the decision-making process of Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) when classifying activities with skeleton data. We employ SHAP to explain two real-world datasets: one for cerebral palsy (CP) classification and the widely used NTU RGB+D 60 action recognition dataset. To test the explanation, we introduce a novel perturbation approach that modifies the model's edge importance matrix, allowing us to evaluate the impact of specific body key points on prediction outcomes. To assess the fidelity of our explanations, we employ informed perturbation, targeting body key points identified as important by SHAP and comparing them against random perturbation as a control condition. This perturbation enables a judgment on whether the body key points are truly influential or non-influential based on the SHAP values. Results on both datasets show that body key points identified as important through SHAP have the largest influence on the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity metrics. Our findings highlight that SHAP can provide granular insights into the input feature contribution to the prediction outcome of GCNs in HAR tasks. This demonstrates the potential for more interpretable and trustworthy models in high-stakes applications like healthcare or rehabilitation.

- **Summary**: Stereo matching has emerged as a cost-effective solution for road surface 3D reconstruction, garnering significant attention towards improving both computational efficiency and accuracy. This article introduces decisive disparity diffusion (D3Stereo), marking the first exploration of dense deep feature matching that adapts pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to previously unseen road scenarios. A pyramid of cost volumes is initially created using various levels of learned representations. Subsequently, a novel recursive bilateral filtering algorithm is employed to aggregate these costs. A key innovation of D3Stereo lies in its alternating decisive disparity diffusion strategy, wherein intra-scale diffusion is employed to complete sparse disparity images, while inter-scale inheritance provides valuable prior information for higher resolutions. Extensive experiments conducted on our created UDTIRI-Stereo and Stereo-Road datasets underscore the effectiveness of D3Stereo strategy in adapting pre-trained DCNNs and its superior performance compared to all other explicit programming-based algorithms designed specifically for road surface 3D reconstruction. Additional experiments conducted on the Middlebury dataset with backbone DCNNs pre-trained on the ImageNet database further validate the versatility of D3Stereo strategy in tackling general stereo matching problems.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have recently demonstrated considerable advancement in the generation and reconstruction of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. These models exhibit great potential in handling unsampled data and reducing noise, highlighting their promise as generative models. However, their application in dynamic MRI remains relatively underexplored. This is primarily due to the substantial amount of fully-sampled data typically required for training, which is difficult to obtain in dynamic MRI due to its spatio-temporal complexity and high acquisition costs. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic MRI reconstruction method based on a time-interleaved acquisition scheme, termed the Glob-al-to-local Diffusion Model. Specifically, fully encoded full-resolution reference data are constructed by merging under-sampled k-space data from adjacent time frames, generating two distinct bulk training datasets for global and local models. The global-to-local diffusion framework alternately optimizes global information and local image details, enabling zero-shot reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in terms of noise reduction and detail preservation, achieving reconstruction quality comparable to that of supervised approaches.

- **Summary**: This paper examines the use of computer vision algorithms to estimate aspects of the psychosocial work environment using CCTV footage. We present a proof of concept for a methodology that detects and tracks people in video footage and estimates interactions between customers and employees by estimating their poses and calculating the duration of their encounters. We propose a pipeline that combines existing object detection and tracking algorithms (YOLOv8 and DeepSORT) with pose estimation algorithms (BlazePose) to estimate the number of customers and employees in the footage as well as the duration of their encounters. We use a simple rule-based approach to classify the interactions as positive, neutral or negative based on three different criteria: distance, duration and pose. The proposed methodology is tested on a small dataset of CCTV footage. While the data is quite limited in particular with respect to the quality of the footage, we have chosen this case as it represents a typical setting where the method could be applied. The results show that the object detection and tracking part of the pipeline has a reasonable performance on the dataset with a high degree of recall and reasonable accuracy. At this stage, the pose estimation is still limited to fully detect the type of interactions due to difficulties in tracking employees in the footage. We conclude that the method is a promising alternative to self-reported measures of the psychosocial work environment and could be used in future studies to obtain external observations of the work environment.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing the 3D anatomical structures of the oral cavity, which originally reside in the cone-beam CT (CBCT), from a single 2D Panoramic X-ray(PX) remains a critical yet challenging task, as it can effectively reduce radiation risks and treatment costs during the diagnostic in digital dentistry. However, current methods are either error-prone or only trained/evaluated on small-scale datasets (less than 50 cases), resulting in compromised trustworthiness. In this paper, we propose PX2Tooth, a novel approach to reconstruct 3D teeth using a single PX image with a two-stage framework. First, we design the PXSegNet to segment the permanent teeth from the PX images, providing clear positional, morphological, and categorical information for each tooth. Subsequently, we design a novel tooth generation network (TGNet) that learns to transform random point clouds into 3D teeth. TGNet integrates the segmented patch information and introduces a Prior Fusion Module (PFM) to enhance the generation quality, especially in the root apex region. Moreover, we construct a dataset comprising 499 pairs of CBCT and Panoramic X-rays. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PX2Tooth can achieve an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.793, significantly surpassing previous methods, underscoring the great potential of artificial intelligence in digital dentistry.

- **Summary**: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based bi-modal salient object detection (BSOD) aims to segment salient objects in a scene utilizing complementary cues in unaligned RGB and thermal image pairs. However, the high computational expense of existing UAV-based BSOD models limits their applicability to real-world UAV devices. To address this problem, we propose an efficient Fourier filter network with contrastive learning that achieves both real-time and accurate performance. Specifically, we first design a semantic contrastive alignment loss to align the two modalities at the semantic level, which facilitates mutual refinement in a parameter-free way. Second, inspired by the fast Fourier transform that obtains global relevance in linear complexity, we propose synchronized alignment fusion, which aligns and fuses bi-modal features in the channel and spatial dimensions by a hierarchical filtering mechanism. Our proposed model, AlignSal, reduces the number of parameters by 70.0%, decreases the floating point operations by 49.4%, and increases the inference speed by 152.5% compared to the cutting-edge BSOD model (i.e., MROS). Extensive experiments on the UAV RGB-T 2400 and three weakly aligned datasets demonstrate that AlignSal achieves both real-time inference speed and better performance and generalizability compared to sixteen state-of-the-art BSOD models across most evaluation metrics. In addition, our ablation studies further verify AlignSal's potential in boosting the performance of existing aligned BSOD models on UAV-based unaligned data.

- **Summary**: Multi-person motion prediction is an emerging and intricate task with broad real-world applications. Unlike single person motion prediction, it considers not just the skeleton structures or human trajectories but also the interactions between others. Previous methods use various networks to achieve impressive predictions but often overlook that the joints relations within an individual (intra-relation) and interactions among groups (inter-relation) are distinct types of representations. These methods often lack explicit representation of inter&intra-relations, and inevitably introduce undesired dependencies. To address this issue, we introduce a new collaborative framework for multi-person motion prediction that explicitly modeling these relations:a GCN-based network for intra-relations and a novel reasoning network for inter-relations.Moreover, we propose a novel plug-and-play aggregation module called the Interaction Aggregation Module (IAM), which employs an aggregate-attention mechanism to seamlessly integrate these relations. Experiments indicate that the module can also be applied to other dual-path models. Extensive experiments on the 3DPW, 3DPW-RC, CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D, as well as synthesized datasets Mix1 & Mix2 (9 to 15 persons), demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: The Privacy Preserving Federated Learning Document VQA (PFL-DocVQA) competition challenged the community to develop provably private and communication-efficient solutions in a federated setting for a real-life use case: invoice processing. The competition introduced a dataset of real invoice documents, along with associated questions and answers requiring information extraction and reasoning over the document images. Thereby, it brings together researchers and expertise from the document analysis, privacy, and federated learning communities. Participants fine-tuned a pre-trained, state-of-the-art Document Visual Question Answering model provided by the organizers for this new domain, mimicking a typical federated invoice processing setup. The base model is a multi-modal generative language model, and sensitive information could be exposed through either the visual or textual input modality. Participants proposed elegant solutions to reduce communication costs while maintaining a minimum utility threshold in track 1 and to protect all information from each document provider using differential privacy in track 2. The competition served as a new testbed for developing and testing private federated learning methods, simultaneously raising awareness about privacy within the document image analysis and recognition community. Ultimately, the competition analysis provides best practices and recommendations for successfully running privacy-focused federated learning challenges in the future.

- **Summary**: Multi-person motion prediction is a complex and emerging field with significant real-world applications. Current state-of-the-art methods typically adopt dual-path networks to separately modeling spatial features and temporal features. However, the uncertain compatibility of the two networks brings a challenge for spatio-temporal features fusion and violate the spatio-temporal coherence and coupling of human motions by nature. To address this issue, we propose a novel graph structure, UnityGraph, which treats spatio-temporal features as a whole, enhancing model coherence and coupling.spatio-temporal features as a whole, enhancing model coherence and coupling. Specifically, UnityGraph is a hypervariate graph based network. The flexibility of the hypergraph allows us to consider the observed motions as graph nodes. We then leverage hyperedges to bridge these nodes for exploring spatio-temporal features. This perspective considers spatio-temporal dynamics unitedly and reformulates multi-person motion prediction into a problem on a single graph. Leveraging the dynamic message passing based on this hypergraph, our model dynamically learns from both types of relations to generate targeted messages that reflect the relevance among nodes. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming its effectiveness and innovative design.

- **Summary**: While automatically generated polynomial elimination templates have sparked great progress in the field of 3D computer vision, there remain many problems for which the degree of the constraints or the number of unknowns leads to intractability. In recent years, homotopy continuation has been introduced as a plausible alternative. However, the method currently depends on expensive parallel tracking of all possible solutions in the complex domain, or a classification network for starting problem-solution pairs trained over a limited set of real-world examples. Our innovation consists of employing a regression network trained in simulation to directly predict a solution from input correspondences, followed by an online simulator that invents a consistent problem-solution pair. Subsequently, homotopy continuation is applied to track that single solution back to the original problem. We apply this elegant combination to generalized camera resectioning, and also introduce a new solution to the challenging generalized relative pose and scale problem. As demonstrated, the proposed method successfully compensates the raw error committed by the regressor alone, and leads to state-of-the-art efficiency and success rates while running on CPU resources, only.

- **Summary**: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are very vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Many defense methods have been proposed to address this issue. However, traditional poisoning attacks are not as threatening as commonly believed. This is because they often cause differences in how the model performs on the training set compared to the validation set. Such inconsistency can alert defenders that their data has been poisoned, allowing them to take the necessary defensive actions. In this paper, we introduce a more threatening type of poisoning attack called the Deferred Poisoning Attack. This new attack allows the model to function normally during the training and validation phases but makes it very sensitive to evasion attacks or even natural noise. We achieve this by ensuring the poisoned model's loss function has a similar value as a normally trained model at each input sample but with a large local curvature. A similar model loss ensures that there is no obvious inconsistency between the training and validation accuracy, demonstrating high stealthiness. On the other hand, the large curvature implies that a small perturbation may cause a significant increase in model loss, leading to substantial performance degradation, which reflects a worse robustness. We fulfill this purpose by making the model have singular Hessian information at the optimal point via our proposed Singularization Regularization term. We have conducted both theoretical and empirical analyses of the proposed method and validated its effectiveness through experiments on image classification tasks. Furthermore, we have confirmed the hazards of this form of poisoning attack under more general scenarios using natural noise, offering a new perspective for research in the field of security.

- **Summary**: Diffusion model-based approaches recently achieved re-markable success in MRI reconstruction, but integration into clinical routine remains challenging due to its time-consuming convergence. This phenomenon is partic-ularly notable when directly apply conventional diffusion process to k-space data without considering the inherent properties of k-space sampling, limiting k-space learning efficiency and image reconstruction quality. To tackle these challenges, we introduce subspace diffusion model with orthogonal decomposition, a method (referred to as Sub-DM) that restrict the diffusion process via projections onto subspace as the k-space data distribution evolves toward noise. Particularly, the subspace diffusion model circumvents the inference challenges posed by the com-plex and high-dimensional characteristics of k-space data, so the highly compact subspace ensures that diffusion process requires only a few simple iterations to produce accurate prior information. Furthermore, the orthogonal decomposition strategy based on wavelet transform hin-ders the information loss during the migration of the vanilla diffusion process to the subspace. Considering the strate-gy is approximately reversible, such that the entire pro-cess can be reversed. As a result, it allows the diffusion processes in different spaces to refine models through a mutual feedback mechanism, enabling the learning of ac-curate prior even when dealing with complex k-space data. Comprehensive experiments on different datasets clearly demonstrate that the superiority of Sub-DM against state of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction speed and quality.

- **Summary**: In this study, we propose a high-performance disparity (depth) estimation method using dual-pixel (DP) images with few parameters. Conventional end-to-end deep-learning methods have many parameters but do not fully exploit disparity constraints, which limits their performance. Therefore, we propose a lightweight disparity estimation method based on a completion-based network that explicitly constrains disparity and learns the physical and systemic disparity properties of DP. By modeling the DP-specific disparity error parametrically and using it for sampling during training, the network acquires the unique properties of DP and enhances robustness. This learning also allows us to use a common RGB-D dataset for training without a DP dataset, which is labor-intensive to acquire. Furthermore, we propose a non-learning-based refinement framework that efficiently handles inherent disparity expansion errors by appropriately refining the confidence map of the network output. As a result, the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results while reducing the overall system size to 1/5 of that of the conventional method, even without using the DP dataset for training, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness. The code and dataset are available on our project site.

- **Summary**: Understanding the extent of urban flooding is crucial for assessing building damage, casualties and economic losses. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology offers significant advantages for mapping flooded urban areas due to its ability to collect data regardless weather and solar illumination conditions. However, the wide range of existing methods makes it difficult to choose the best approach for a specific situation and to identify future research directions. Therefore, this study provides a comprehensive review of current research on urban flood mapping using SAR data, summarizing key characteristics of floodwater in SAR images and outlining various approaches from scientific articles. Additionally, we provide a brief overview of the advantages and disadvantages of each method category, along with guidance on selecting the most suitable approach for different scenarios. This study focuses on the challenges and advancements in SAR-based urban flood mapping. It specifically addresses the limitations of spatial and temporal resolution in SAR data and discusses the essential pre-processing steps. Moreover, the article explores the potential benefits of Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) techniques and uncertainty analysis for future research. Furthermore, it highlights a lack of open-access SAR datasets for urban flood mapping, hindering development in advanced deep learning-based methods. Besides, we evaluated the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) of urban flood mapping techniques to identify challenges and future research areas. Finally, the study explores the practical applications of SAR-based urban flood mapping in both the private and public sectors and provides a comprehensive overview of the benefits and potential impact of these methods.

- **Summary**: CNNs exhibit inherent equivariance to image translation, leading to efficient parameter and data usage, faster learning, and improved robustness. The concept of translation equivariant networks has been successfully extended to rotation transformation using group convolution for discrete rotation groups and harmonic functions for the continuous rotation group encompassing $360^\circ$. We explore the compatibility of the SA mechanism with full rotation equivariance, in contrast to previous studies that focused on discrete rotation. We introduce the Harmformer, a harmonic transformer with a convolutional stem that achieves equivariance for both translation and continuous rotation. Accompanied by an end-to-end equivariance proof, the Harmformer not only outperforms previous equivariant transformers, but also demonstrates inherent stability under any continuous rotation, even without seeing rotated samples during training.

- **Summary**: The advent and proliferation of large multi-modal models (LMMs) have introduced a new paradigm to video-related computer vision fields, including training and inference methods based on visual question answering (VQA). These methods enable models to handle multiple downstream tasks robustly. Video Quality Assessment (VQA), a classic field in low-level visual quality evaluation, originally focused on quantitative video quality scoring. However, driven by advances in LMMs, it is now evolving towards more comprehensive visual quality understanding tasks. Visual question answering has significantly improved low-level visual evaluation within the image domain recently. However, related work is almost nonexistent in the video domain, leaving substantial room for improvement. To address this gap, we introduce the VQA2 Instruction Dataset the first visual question answering instruction dataset entirely focuses on video quality assessment, and based on it, we propose the VQA2 series models The VQA2 Instruction Dataset consists of three stages and covers various video types, containing 157,735 instruction question-answer pairs, including both manually annotated and synthetic data. We conduct extensive experiments on both video quality scoring and video quality understanding tasks. Results demonstrate that the VQA2 series models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in quality scoring tasks, and their performance in visual quality question answering surpasses the renowned GPT-4o. Additionally, our final model, the VQA2-Assistant, performs well across both scoring and question-answering tasks, validating its versatility.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a new method for accurate and robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects, named GS2Pose. By introducing 3D Gaussian splatting, GS2Pose can utilize the reconstruction results without requiring a high-quality CAD model, which means it only requires segmented RGBD images as input. Specifically, GS2Pose employs a two-stage structure consisting of coarse estimation followed by refined estimation. In the coarse stage, a lightweight U-Net network with a polarization attention mechanism, called Pose-Net, is designed. By using the 3DGS model for supervised training, Pose-Net can generate NOCS images to compute a coarse pose. In the refinement stage, GS2Pose formulates a pose regression algorithm following the idea of reprojection or Bundle Adjustment (BA), referred to as GS-Refiner. By leveraging Lie algebra to extend 3DGS, GS-Refiner obtains a pose-differentiable rendering pipeline that refines the coarse pose by comparing the input images with the rendered images. GS-Refiner also selectively updates parameters in the 3DGS model to achieve environmental adaptation, thereby enhancing the algorithm's robustness and flexibility to illuminative variation, occlusion, and other challenging disruptive factors. GS2Pose was evaluated through experiments conducted on the LineMod dataset, where it was compared with similar algorithms, yielding highly competitive results. The code for GS2Pose will soon be released on GitHub.

- **Summary**: In the complex realm of cognitive disorders, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are the two most prevalent dementia types, presenting entangled symptoms yet requiring distinct treatment approaches. The crux of effective treatment in slowing neurodegeneration lies in early, accurate diagnosis, as this significantly assists doctors in determining the appropriate course of action. However, current diagnostic practices often delay VaD diagnosis, impeding timely intervention and adversely affecting patient prognosis. This paper presents an innovative multi-omics approach to accurately differentiate AD from VaD, achieving a diagnostic accuracy of 89.25%. The proposed method segments the longitudinal MRI scans and extracts advanced radiomics features. Subsequently, it synergistically integrates the radiomics features with an ensemble of clinical, cognitive, and genetic data to provide state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy, setting a new benchmark in classification accuracy on a large public dataset. The paper's primary contribution is proposing a comprehensive methodology utilizing multi-omics data to provide a nuanced understanding of dementia subtypes. Additionally, the paper introduces an interpretable model to enhance clinical decision-making coupled with a novel model architecture for evaluating treatment efficacy. These advancements lay the groundwork for future work not only aimed at improving differential diagnosis but also mitigating and preventing the progression of dementia.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of 2D foundation models has sparked research into adapting them for open-world 3D instance segmentation. Recent methods introduce a paradigm that leverages superpoints as geometric primitives and incorporates 2D multi-view masks from Segment Anything model (SAM) as merging guidance, achieving outstanding zero-shot instance segmentation results. However, the limited use of 3D priors restricts the segmentation performance. Previous methods calculate the 3D superpoints solely based on estimated normal from spatial coordinates, resulting in under-segmentation for instances with similar geometry. Besides, the heavy reliance on SAM and hand-crafted algorithms in 2D space suffers from over-segmentation due to SAM's inherent part-level segmentation tendency. To address these issues, we propose SA3DIP, a novel method for Segmenting Any 3D Instances via exploiting potential 3D Priors. Specifically, on one hand, we generate complementary 3D primitives based on both geometric and textural priors, which reduces the initial errors that accumulate in subsequent procedures. On the other hand, we introduce supplemental constraints from the 3D space by using a 3D detector to guide a further merging process. Furthermore, we notice a considerable portion of low-quality ground truth annotations in ScanNetV2 benchmark, which affect the fair evaluations. Thus, we present ScanNetV2-INS with complete ground truth labels and supplement additional instances for 3D class-agnostic instance segmentation. Experimental evaluations on various 2D-3D datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. Our code and proposed ScanNetV2-INS dataset are available HERE.

- **Summary**: The rapid progression of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated superior performance on various multimodal benchmarks. However, the issue of data contamination during training creates challenges in performance evaluation and comparison. While numerous methods exist for detecting dataset contamination in large language models (LLMs), they are less effective for MLLMs due to their various modalities and multiple training phases. In this study, we introduce a multimodal data contamination detection framework, MM-Detect, designed for MLLMs. Our experimental results indicate that MM-Detect is sensitive to varying degrees of contamination and can highlight significant performance improvements due to leakage of the training set of multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, We also explore the possibility of contamination originating from the pre-training phase of LLMs used by MLLMs and the fine-tuning phase of MLLMs, offering new insights into the stages at which contamination may be introduced.

- **Summary**: In open-world scenarios, where both novel classes and domains may exist, an ideal segmentation model should detect anomaly classes for safety and generalize to new domains. However, existing methods often struggle to distinguish between domain-level and semantic-level distribution shifts, leading to poor out-of-distribution (OOD) detection or domain generalization performance. In this work, we aim to equip the model to generalize effectively to covariate-shift regions while precisely identifying semantic-shift regions. To achieve this, we design a novel generative augmentation method to produce coherent images that incorporate both anomaly (or novel) objects and various covariate shifts at both image and object levels. Furthermore, we introduce a training strategy that recalibrates uncertainty specifically for semantic shifts and enhances the feature extractor to align features associated with domain shifts. We validate the effectiveness of our method across benchmarks featuring both semantic and domain shifts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all benchmarks for both OOD detection and domain generalization. Code is available at https://github.com/gaozhitong/MultiShiftSeg.

- **Summary**: This study is focused on enhancing the Haar Cascade Algorithm to decrease the false positive and false negative rate in face matching and face detection to increase the accuracy rate even under challenging conditions. The face recognition library was implemented with Haar Cascade Algorithm in which the 128-dimensional vectors representing the unique features of a face are encoded. A subprocess was applied where the grayscale image from Haar Cascade was converted to RGB to improve the face encoding. Logical process and face filtering are also used to decrease non-face detection. The Enhanced Haar Cascade Algorithm produced a 98.39% accuracy rate (21.39% increase), 63.59% precision rate, 98.30% recall rate, and 72.23% in F1 Score. In comparison, the Haar Cascade Algorithm achieved a 46.70% to 77.00% accuracy rate, 44.15% precision rate, 98.61% recall rate, and 47.01% in F1 Score. Both algorithms used the Confusion Matrix Test with 301,950 comparisons using the same dataset of 550 images. The 98.39% accuracy rate shows a significant decrease in false positive and false negative rates in facial recognition. Face matching and face detection are more accurate in images with complex backgrounds, lighting variations, and occlusions, or even those with similar attributes.

- **Summary**: An ecosystem of Transformer-based models has been established by building large models with extensive data. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a crucial technology for deploying these models to downstream tasks with minimal cost while achieving effective performance. Recently, Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM)-based model, has attracted attention as a potential alternative to Transformers. While many large-scale Mamba-based models have been proposed, efficiently adapting pre-trained Mamba-based models to downstream tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory analysis of PEFT methods for Mamba. We investigate the effectiveness of existing PEFT methods for Transformers when applied to Mamba. We also modify these methods to better align with the Mamba architecture. Additionally, we propose new Mamba-specific PEFT methods that leverage the distinctive structure of Mamba. Our experiments indicate that PEFT performs more effectively for Mamba than Transformers. Lastly, we demonstrate how to effectively combine multiple PEFT methods and provide a framework that outperforms previous works. To ensure reproducibility, we will release the code after publication.

- **Summary**: One of the most common defense strategies against model poisoning in federated learning is to employ a robust aggregator mechanism that makes the training more resilient. Many of the existing Byzantine robust aggregators provide theoretical guarantees and are empirically effective against certain categories of attacks. However, we observe that certain high-strength attacks can subvert the aggregator and collapse the training. In addition, most aggregators require identifying tolerant settings to converge. Impact of attacks becomes more pronounced when the number of Byzantines is near-majority, and becomes harder to evade if the attacker is omniscient with access to data, honest updates and aggregation methods. Motivated by these observations, we develop a robust aggregator called FedRISE for cross-silo FL that is consistent and less susceptible to poisoning updates by an omniscient attacker. The proposed method explicitly determines the optimal direction of each gradient through a sign-voting strategy that uses variance-reduced sparse gradients. We argue that vote weighting based on the cosine similarity of raw gradients is misleading, and we introduce a sign-based gradient valuation function that ignores the gradient magnitude. We compare our method against 8 robust aggregators under 6 poisoning attacks on 3 datasets and architectures. Our results show that existing robust aggregators collapse for at least some attacks under severe settings, while FedRISE demonstrates better robustness because of a stringent gradient inclusion formulation.

- **Summary**: Watermarking generative content serves as a vital tool for authentication, ownership protection, and mitigation of potential misuse. Existing watermarking methods face the challenge of balancing robustness and concealment. They empirically inject a watermark that is both invisible and robust and passively achieve concealment by limiting the strength of the watermark, thus reducing the robustness. In this paper, we propose to explicitly introduce a watermark hiding process to actively achieve concealment, thus allowing the embedding of stronger watermarks. To be specific, we implant a robust watermark in an intermediate diffusion state and then guide the model to hide the watermark in the final generated image. We employ an adversarial optimization algorithm to produce the optimal hiding prompt guiding signal for each watermark. The prompt embedding is optimized to minimize artifacts in the generated image, while the watermark is optimized to achieve maximum strength. The watermark can be verified by reversing the generation process. Experiments on various diffusion models demonstrate the watermark remains verifiable even under significant image tampering and shows superior invisibility compared to other state-of-the-art robust watermarking methods.

- **Summary**: The spatio-temporal nature of live-cell microscopy data poses challenges in the analysis of cell states which is fundamental in bioimaging. Deep-learning based segmentation or tracking methods rely on large amount of high quality annotations to work effectively. In this work, we explore an alternative solution: using feature maps obtained from self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) on time arrow prediction (TAP) for the downstream supervised task of cell event recognition. We demonstrate through extensive experiments and analysis that this approach can achieve better performance with limited annotation compared to models trained from end to end using fully supervised approach. Our analysis also provides insight into applications of the SSRL using TAP in live-cell microscopy.

- **Summary**: Federated learning, a novel paradigm designed to protect data privacy, is vulnerable to backdoor attacks due to its distributed nature. Current research often designs attacks based on a single attacker with a single backdoor, overlooking more realistic and complex threats in federated learning. We propose a more practical threat model for federated learning: the distributed multi-target backdoor. In this model, multiple attackers control different clients, embedding various triggers and targeting different classes, collaboratively implanting backdoors into the global model via central aggregation. Empirical validation shows that existing methods struggle to maintain the effectiveness of multiple backdoors in the global model. Our key insight is that similar backdoor triggers cause parameter conflicts and injecting new backdoors disrupts gradient directions, significantly weakening some backdoors performance. To solve this, we propose a Distributed Multi-Target Backdoor Attack (DMBA), ensuring efficiency and persistence of backdoors from different malicious clients. To avoid parameter conflicts, we design a multi-channel dispersed frequency trigger strategy to maximize trigger differences. To mitigate gradient interference, we introduce backdoor replay in local training to neutralize conflicting gradients. Extensive validation shows that 30 rounds after the attack, Attack Success Rates of three different backdoors from various clients remain above 93%. The code will be made publicly available after the review period.

- **Summary**: Automatic target recognition (ATR) is an important use case for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image interpretation. Recent years have seen significant advancements in SAR ATR technology based on semi-supervised learning. However, existing semi-supervised SAR ATR algorithms show low recognition accuracy in the case of class imbalance. This work offers a non-balanced semi-supervised SAR target recognition approach using dynamic energy scores and adaptive loss. First, an energy score-based method is developed to dynamically select unlabeled samples near to the training distribution as pseudo-labels during training, assuring pseudo-label reliability in long-tailed distribution circumstances. Secondly, loss functions suitable for class imbalances are proposed, including adaptive margin perception loss and adaptive hard triplet loss, the former offsets inter-class confusion of classifiers, alleviating the imbalance issue inherent in pseudo-label generation. The latter effectively tackles the model's preference for the majority class by focusing on complex difficult samples during training. Experimental results on extremely imbalanced SAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs well under the dual constraints of scarce labels and data imbalance, effectively overcoming the model bias caused by data imbalance and achieving high-precision target recognition.

- **Summary**: Face recognition systems extract embedding vectors from face images and use these embeddings to verify or identify individuals. Face reconstruction attack (also known as template inversion) refers to reconstructing face images from face embeddings and using the reconstructed face image to enter a face recognition system. In this paper, we propose to use a face foundation model to reconstruct face images from the embeddings of a blackbox face recognition model. The foundation model is trained with 42M images to generate face images from the facial embeddings of a fixed face recognition model. We propose to use an adapter to translate target embeddings into the embedding space of the foundation model. The generated images are evaluated on different face recognition models and different datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method to translate embeddings of different face recognition models. We also evaluate the transferability of reconstructed face images when attacking different face recognition models. Our experimental results show that our reconstructed face images outperform previous reconstruction attacks against face recognition models.

- **Summary**: High resolution is crucial for precise segmentation in fundus images, yet handling high-resolution inputs incurs considerable GPU memory costs, with diminishing performance gains as overhead increases. To address this issue while tackling the challenge of segmenting tiny objects, recent studies have explored local-global fusion methods. These methods preserve fine details using local regions and capture long-range context information from downscaled global images. However, the necessity of multiple forward passes inevitably incurs significant computational overhead, adversely affecting inference speed. In this paper, we propose HRDecoder, a simple High-Resolution Decoder network for fundus lesion segmentation. It integrates a high-resolution representation learning module to capture fine-grained local features and a high-resolution fusion module to fuse multi-scale predictions. Our method effectively improves the overall segmentation accuracy of fundus lesions while consuming reasonable memory and computational overhead, and maintaining satisfying inference speed. Experimental results on the IDRID and DDR datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code is available at https://github.com/CVIU-CSU/HRDecoder.

- **Summary**: Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) Diffusion models have revolutionized image editing by enabling the generation of high-quality photorealistic images. While the de facto method for performing edits with T2I models is through text instructions, this approach non-trivial due to the complex many-to-many mapping between natural language and images. In this work, we address exemplar-based image editing -- the task of transferring an edit from an exemplar pair to a content image(s). We propose ReEdit, a modular and efficient end-to-end framework that captures edits in both text and image modalities while ensuring the fidelity of the edited image. We validate the effectiveness of ReEdit through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines and sensitivity analyses of key design choices. Our results demonstrate that ReEdit consistently outperforms contemporary approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively. Additionally, ReEdit boasts high practical applicability, as it does not require any task-specific optimization and is four times faster than the next best baseline.

- **Summary**: Imitation learning, e.g., diffusion policy, has been proven effective in various robotic manipulation tasks. However, extensive demonstrations are required for policy robustness and generalization. To reduce the demonstration reliance, we leverage spatial symmetry and propose ET-SEED, an efficient trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion model for generating action sequences in complex robot manipulation tasks. Further, previous equivariant diffusion models require the per-step equivariance in the Markov process, making it difficult to learn policy under such strong constraints. We theoretically extend equivariant Markov kernels and simplify the condition of equivariant diffusion process, thereby significantly improving training efficiency for trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate ET-SEED on representative robotic manipulation tasks, involving rigid body, articulated and deformable object. Experiments demonstrate superior data efficiency and manipulation proficiency of our proposed method, as well as its ability to generalize to unseen configurations with only a few demonstrations.

- **Summary**: Much of the research on the interpretability of deep neural networks has focused on studying the visual features that maximally activate individual neurons. However, recent work has cast doubts on the usefulness of such local representations for understanding the behavior of deep neural networks because individual neurons tend to respond to multiple unrelated visual patterns, a phenomenon referred to as "superposition". A promising alternative to disentangle these complex patterns is learning sparsely distributed vector representations from entire network layers, as the resulting basis vectors seemingly encode single identifiable visual patterns consistently. Thus, one would expect the resulting code to align better with human perceivable visual patterns, but supporting evidence remains, at best, anecdotal. To fill this gap, we conducted three large-scale psychophysics experiments collected from a pool of 560 participants. Our findings provide (i) strong evidence that features obtained from sparse distributed representations are easier to interpret by human observers and (ii) that this effect is more pronounced in the deepest layers of a neural network. Complementary analyses also reveal that (iii) features derived from sparse distributed representations contribute more to the model's decision. Overall, our results highlight that distributed representations constitute a superior basis for interpretability, underscoring a need for the field to move beyond the interpretation of local neural codes in favor of sparsely distributed ones.

- **Summary**: Ultrasound (US) imaging is widely used in routine clinical practice due to its advantages of being radiation-free, cost-effective, and portable. However, the low reproducibility and quality of US images, combined with the scarcity of expert-level annotation, make the training of fully supervised segmentation models challenging. To address these issues, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework based on a diffusion model that incorporates a synthetic anomaly (Synomaly) noise function and a multi-stage diffusion process. Synomaly noise introduces synthetic anomalies into healthy images during training, allowing the model to effectively learn anomaly removal. The multi-stage diffusion process is introduced to progressively denoise images, preserving fine details while improving the quality of anomaly-free reconstructions. The generated high-fidelity counterfactual healthy images can further enhance the interpretability of the segmentation models, as well as provide a reliable baseline for evaluating the extent of anomalies and supporting clinical decision-making. Notably, the unsupervised anomaly detection model is trained purely on healthy images, eliminating the need for anomalous training samples and pixel-level annotations. We validate the proposed approach on carotid US, brain MRI, and liver CT datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection methods, achieving performance comparable to fully supervised segmentation models in the US dataset. Additionally, ablation studies underline the importance of hyperparameter selection for Synomaly noise and the effectiveness of the multi-stage diffusion process in enhancing model performance.

- **Summary**: Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a critical area in machine learning, enabling neural networks to learn from evolving data distributions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. However, recent research has identified the stability gap -- a phenomenon where models initially lose performance on previously learned tasks before partially recovering during training. Such learning dynamics are contradictory to the intuitive understanding of stability in continual learning where one would expect the performance to degrade gradually instead of rapidly decreasing and then partially recovering later. To better understand and alleviate the stability gap, we investigate it at different levels of the neural network architecture, particularly focusing on the role of the classification head. We introduce the nearest-mean classifier (NMC) as a tool to attribute the influence of the backbone and the classification head on the stability gap. Our experiments demonstrate that NMC not only improves final performance, but also significantly enhances training stability across various continual learning benchmarks, including CIFAR100, ImageNet100, CUB-200, and FGVC Aircrafts. Moreover, we find that NMC also reduces task-recency bias. Our analysis provides new insights into the stability gap and suggests that the primary contributor to this phenomenon is the linear head, rather than the insufficient representation learning.

- **Summary**: In mission-critical domains such as law enforcement and medical diagnosis, the ability to explain and interpret the outputs of deep learning models is crucial for ensuring user trust and supporting informed decision-making. Despite advancements in explainability, existing methods often fall short in providing explanations that mirror the depth and clarity of those given by human experts. Such expert-level explanations are essential for the dependable application of deep learning models in law enforcement and medical contexts. Additionally, we recognize that most explanations in real-world scenarios are communicated primarily through natural language. Addressing these needs, we propose a novel approach that utilizes characteristic descriptors to explain model decisions by identifying their presence in images, thereby generating expert-like explanations. Our method incorporates a concept bottleneck layer within the model architecture, which calculates the similarity between image and descriptor encodings to deliver inherent and faithful explanations. Through experiments in face recognition and chest X-ray diagnosis, we demonstrate that our approach offers a significant contrast over existing techniques, which are often limited to the use of saliency maps. We believe our approach represents a significant step toward making deep learning systems more accountable, transparent, and trustworthy in the critical domains of face recognition and medical diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) power state-of-the-art high-resolution generative image models. LDMs learn the data distribution in the latent space of an autoencoder (AE) and produce images by mapping the generated latents into RGB image space using the AE decoder. While this approach allows for efficient model training and sampling, it induces a disconnect between the training of the diffusion model and the decoder, resulting in a loss of detail in the generated images. To remediate this disconnect, we propose to leverage the internal features of the decoder to define a latent perceptual loss (LPL). This loss encourages the models to create sharper and more realistic images. Our loss can be seamlessly integrated with common autoencoders used in latent diffusion models, and can be applied to different generative modeling paradigms such as DDPM with epsilon and velocity prediction, as well as flow matching. Extensive experiments with models trained on three datasets at 256 and 512 resolution show improved quantitative -- with boosts between 6% and 20% in FID -- and qualitative results when using our perceptual loss.

- **Summary**: Understanding spatio-temporal patterns in polar ice layers is essential for tracking changes in ice sheet balance and assessing ice dynamics. While convolutional neural networks are widely used in learning ice layer patterns from raw echogram images captured by airborne snow radar sensors, noise in the echogram images prevents researchers from getting high-quality results. Instead, we focus on geometric deep learning using graph neural networks, aiming to build a spatio-temporal graph neural network that learns from thickness information of the top ice layers and predicts for deeper layers. In this paper, we developed a novel multi-branch spatio-temporal graph neural network that used the GraphSAGE framework for spatio features learning and a temporal convolution operation to capture temporal changes, enabling different branches of the network to be more specialized and focusing on a single learning task. We found that our proposed multi-branch network can consistently outperform the current fused spatio-temporal graph neural network in both accuracy and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Video captioning generate a sentence that describes the video content. Existing methods always require a number of captions (\eg, 10 or 20) per video to train the model, which is quite costly. In this work, we explore the possibility of using only one or very few ground-truth sentences, and introduce a new task named few-supervised video captioning. Specifically, we propose a few-supervised video captioning framework that consists of lexically constrained pseudo-labeling module and keyword-refined captioning module. Unlike the random sampling in natural language processing that may cause invalid modifications (\ie, edit words), the former module guides the model to edit words using some actions (\eg, copy, replace, insert, and delete) by a pretrained token-level classifier, and then fine-tunes candidate sentences by a pretrained language model. Meanwhile, the former employs the repetition penalized sampling to encourage the model to yield concise pseudo-labeled sentences with less repetition, and selects the most relevant sentences upon a pretrained video-text model. Moreover, to keep semantic consistency between pseudo-labeled sentences and video content, we develop the transformer-based keyword refiner with the video-keyword gated fusion strategy to emphasize more on relevant words. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach in both few-supervised and fully-supervised scenarios.

- **Summary**: By leveraging both texts and images, large vision language models (LVLMs) have shown significant progress in various multi-modal tasks. Nevertheless, these models often suffer from hallucinations, e.g., they exhibit inconsistencies between the visual input and the textual output. To address this, we propose H-POPE, a coarse-to-fine-grained benchmark that systematically assesses hallucination in object existence and attributes. Our evaluation shows that models are prone to hallucinations on object existence, and even more so on fine-grained attributes. We further investigate whether these models rely on visual input to formulate the output texts.

- **Summary**: Text-to-motion generation is a crucial task in computer vision, which generates the target 3D motion by the given text. The existing annotated datasets are limited in scale, resulting in most existing methods overfitting to the small datasets and unable to generalize to the motions of the open domain. Some methods attempt to solve the open-vocabulary motion generation problem by aligning to the CLIP space or using the Pretrain-then-Finetuning paradigm. However, the current annotated dataset's limited scale only allows them to achieve mapping from sub-text-space to sub-motion-space, instead of mapping between full-text-space and full-motion-space (full mapping), which is the key to attaining open-vocabulary motion generation. To this end, this paper proposes to leverage the atomic motion (simple body part motions over a short time period) as an intermediate representation, and leverage two orderly coupled steps, i.e., Textual Decomposition and Sub-motion-space Scattering, to address the full mapping problem. For Textual Decomposition, we design a fine-grained description conversion algorithm, and combine it with the generalization ability of a large language model to convert any given motion text into atomic texts. Sub-motion-space Scattering learns the compositional process from atomic motions to the target motions, to make the learned sub-motion-space scattered to form the full-motion-space. For a given motion of the open domain, it transforms the extrapolation into interpolation and thereby significantly improves generalization. Our network, $DSO$-Net, combines textual $d$ecomposition and sub-motion-space $s$cattering to solve the $o$pen-vocabulary motion generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DSO-Net achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary motion generation.

- **Summary**: Fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs) often capture spurious correlations between image features and textual attributes, resulting in degraded zero-shot performance at test time. Existing approaches for addressing spurious correlations (i) primarily operate at the global image-level rather than intervening directly on fine-grained image features and (ii) are predominantly designed for unimodal settings. In this work, we present RaVL, which takes a fine-grained perspective on VLM robustness by discovering and mitigating spurious correlations using local image features rather than operating at the global image level. Given a fine-tuned VLM, RaVL first discovers spurious correlations by leveraging a region-level clustering approach to identify precise image features contributing to zero-shot classification errors. Then, RaVL mitigates the identified spurious correlation with a novel region-aware loss function that enables the VLM to focus on relevant regions and ignore spurious relationships during fine-tuning. We evaluate RaVL on 654 VLMs with various model architectures, data domains, and learned spurious correlations. Our results show that RaVL accurately discovers (191% improvement over the closest baseline) and mitigates (8.2% improvement on worst-group image classification accuracy) spurious correlations. Qualitative evaluations on general-domain and medical-domain VLMs confirm our findings.

- **Summary**: Centralized learning requires data to be aggregated at a central server, which poses significant challenges in terms of data privacy and bandwidth consumption. Federated learning presents a compelling alternative, however, vanilla federated learning methods deployed in robotics aim to learn a single global model across robots that works ideally for all. But in practice one model may not be well suited for robots deployed in various environments. This paper proposes Federated-EmbedCluster (Fed-EC), a clustering-based federated learning framework that is deployed with vision based autonomous robot navigation in diverse outdoor environments. The framework addresses the key federated learning challenge of deteriorating model performance of a single global model due to the presence of non-IID data across real-world robots. Extensive real-world experiments validate that Fed-EC reduces the communication size by 23x for each robot while matching the performance of centralized learning for goal-oriented navigation and outperforms local learning. Fed-EC can transfer previously learnt models to new robots that join the cluster.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel state-space architecture for diffusion models, effectively harnessing spatial and frequency information to enhance the inductive bias towards local features in input images for image generation tasks. While state-space networks, including Mamba, a revolutionary advancement in recurrent neural networks, typically scan input sequences from left to right, they face difficulties in designing effective scanning strategies, especially in the processing of image data. Our method demonstrates that integrating wavelet transformation into Mamba enhances the local structure awareness of visual inputs and better captures long-range relations of frequencies by disentangling them into wavelet subbands, representing both low- and high-frequency components. These wavelet-based outputs are then processed and seamlessly fused with the original Mamba outputs through a cross-attention fusion layer, combining both spatial and frequency information to optimize the order awareness of state-space models which is essential for the details and overall quality of image generation. Besides, we introduce a globally-shared transformer to supercharge the performance of Mamba, harnessing its exceptional power to capture global relationships. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, our method demonstrates superior results compared to DiT and DIFFUSSM, achieving faster training convergence and delivering high-quality outputs.

- **Summary**: One of the key challenges of detecting AI-generated images is spotting images that have been created by previously unseen generative models. We argue that the limited diversity of the training data is a major obstacle to addressing this problem, and we propose a new dataset that is significantly larger and more diverse than prior work. As part of creating this dataset, we systematically download thousands of text-to-image latent diffusion models and sample images from them. We also collect images from dozens of popular open source and commercial models. The resulting dataset contains 2.7M images that have been sampled from 4803 different models. These images collectively capture a wide range of scene content, generator architectures, and image processing settings. Using this dataset, we study the generalization abilities of fake image detectors. Our experiments suggest that detection performance improves as the number of models in the training set increases, even when these models have similar architectures. We also find that detection performance improves as the diversity of the models increases, and that our trained detectors generalize better than those trained on other datasets.

We benchmark WiFlexFormer against state-of-the-art vision and specialized architectures for processing radio frequency data and demonstrate that it achieves comparable Human Activity Recognition (HAR) performance while offering a significantly lower parameter count and faster inference times. With an inference time of just 10 ms on an Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano, WiFlexFormer is optimized for real-time inference. Additionally, its low parameter count contributes to improved cross-domain generalization, where it often outperforms larger models. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that WiFlexFormer is a potential solution for efficient, scalable WiFi-based sensing applications. The PyTorch implementation of WiFlexFormer is publicly available at: https://github.com/StrohmayerJ/WiFlexFormer.

- **Summary**: Modeling a human avatar that can plausibly deform to articulations is an active area of research. We present PocoLoco -- the first template-free, point-based, pose-conditioned generative model for 3D humans in loose clothing. We motivate our work by noting that most methods require a parametric model of the human body to ground pose-dependent deformations. Consequently, they are restricted to modeling clothing that is topologically similar to the naked body and do not extend well to loose clothing. The few methods that attempt to model loose clothing typically require either canonicalization or a UV-parameterization and need to address the challenging problem of explicitly estimating correspondences for the deforming clothes. In this work, we formulate avatar clothing deformation as a conditional point-cloud generation task within the denoising diffusion framework. Crucially, our framework operates directly on unordered point clouds, eliminating the need for a parametric model or a clothing template. This also enables a variety of practical applications, such as point-cloud completion and pose-based editing -- important features for virtual human animation. As current datasets for human avatars in loose clothing are far too small for training diffusion models, we release a dataset of two subjects performing various poses in loose clothing with a total of 75K point clouds. By contributing towards tackling the challenging task of effectively modeling loose clothing and expanding the available data for training these models, we aim to set the stage for further innovation in digital humans.

- **Summary**: Person re-identification (re-ID) aims to tackle the problem of matching identities across non-overlapping cameras. Supervised approaches require identity information that may be difficult to obtain and are inherently biased towards the dataset they are trained on, making them unscalable across domains. To overcome these challenges, we propose an unsupervised approach to the person re-ID setup. Having zero knowledge of true labels, our proposed method enhances the discriminating ability of the learned features via a novel two-stage training strategy. The first stage involves training a deep network on an expertly designed pose-transformed dataset obtained by generating multiple perturbations for each original image in the pose space. Next, the network learns to map similar features closer in the feature space using the proposed discriminative clustering algorithm. We introduce a novel radial distance loss, that attends to the fundamental aspects of feature learning - compact clusters with low intra-cluster and high inter-cluster variation. Extensive experiments on several large-scale re-ID datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Event cameras are becoming increasingly popular as an alternative to traditional frame-based vision sensors, especially in mobile robotics. Taking full advantage of their high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, low power consumption and sparsity of event data, which only reflects changes in the observed scene, requires both an efficient algorithm and a specialised hardware platform. A recent trend involves using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs) implemented on a heterogeneous SoC FPGA. In this paper we focus on optimising hardware modules for graph convolution to allow flexible selection of the FPGA resource (BlockRAM, DSP and LUT) for their implementation. We propose a ''two-step convolution'' approach that utilises additional BRAM buffers in order to reduce up to 94% of LUT usage for multiplications. This method significantly improves the scalability of GCNNs, enabling the deployment of models with more layers, larger graphs sizes and their application for more dynamic scenarios.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) have improved significantly in multi-modal tasks, but their more complex architecture makes their safety alignment more challenging than the alignment of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we reveal an unfair distribution of safety across the layers of VLM's vision encoder, with earlier and middle layers being disproportionately vulnerable to malicious inputs compared to the more robust final layers. This 'cross-layer' vulnerability stems from the model's inability to generalize its safety training from the default architectural settings used during training to unseen or out-of-distribution scenarios, leaving certain layers exposed. We conduct a comprehensive analysis by projecting activations from various intermediate layers and demonstrate that these layers are more likely to generate harmful outputs when exposed to malicious inputs. Our experiments with LLaVA-1.5 and Llama 3.2 show discrepancies in attack success rates and toxicity scores across layers, indicating that current safety alignment strategies focused on a single default layer are insufficient.
