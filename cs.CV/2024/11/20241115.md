- **Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful foundation model for visual generation. With an appropriate sampling process, it can effectively serve as a generative prior to solve general inverse problems. Current posterior sampling based methods take the measurement (i.e., degraded image sample) into the posterior sampling to infer the distribution of the target data (i.e., clean image sample). However, in this manner, we show that high-frequency information can be prematurely introduced during the early stages, which could induce larger posterior estimate errors during the restoration sampling. To address this issue, we first reveal that forming the log posterior gradient with the noisy measurement ( i.e., samples from a diffusion forward process) instead of the clean one can benefit the reverse process. Consequently, we propose a novel diffusion posterior sampling method DPS-CM, which incorporates a Crafted Measurement (i.e., samples generated by a reverse denoising process, compared to random sampling with noise in standard methods) to form the posterior estimate. This integration aims to mitigate the misalignment with the diffusion prior caused by cumulative posterior estimate errors. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the overall capacity to solve general and noisy inverse problems, such as Gaussian deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, nonlinear deblurring, and tasks with Poisson noise, relative to existing approaches.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a scalable and straightforward pre-training paradigm for efficient visual conceptual representation called masked image contrastive learning (MiCL). Our MiCL approach is simple: we randomly mask patches to generate different views within an image and contrast them among a mini-batch of images. The core idea behind MiCL consists of two designs. First, masked tokens have the potential to significantly diminish the conceptual redundancy inherent in images, and create distinct views with substantial fine-grained differences on the semantic concept level instead of the instance level. Second, contrastive learning is adept at extracting high-level semantic conceptual features during the pre-training, circumventing the high-frequency interference and additional costs associated with image reconstruction. Importantly, MiCL learns highly semantic conceptual representations efficiently without relying on hand-crafted data augmentations or additional auxiliary modules. Empirically, MiCL demonstrates high scalability with Vision Transformers, as the ViT-L/16 can complete pre-training in 133 hours using only 4 A100 GPUs, achieving 85.8% accuracy in downstream fine-tuning tasks.

- **Summary**: The widespread use of image acquisition technologies, along with advances in facial recognition, has raised serious privacy concerns. Face de-identification usually refers to the process of concealing or replacing personal identifiers, which is regarded as an effective means to protect the privacy of facial images. A significant number of methods for face de-identification have been proposed in recent years. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art face de-identification methods, categorized into three levels: pixel-level, representation-level, and semantic-level techniques. We systematically evaluate these methods based on two key criteria, the effectiveness of privacy protection and preservation of image utility, highlighting their advantages and limitations. Our analysis includes qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the main algorithms, demonstrating that deep learning-based approaches, particularly those using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models, have achieved significant advancements in balancing privacy and utility. Experimental results reveal that while recent methods demonstrate strong privacy protection, trade-offs remain in visual fidelity and computational complexity. This survey not only summarizes the current landscape but also identifies key challenges and future research directions in face de-identification.

- **Summary**: Remarkable progress has been achieved in image generation with the introduction of generative models. However, precisely controlling the content in generated images remains a challenging task due to their fundamental training objective. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a novel image generation framework explicitly designed to incorporate desired content in output images. The framework utilizes advanced encoding techniques, integrating subnetworks called content fusion and frequency encoding modules. The frequency encoding module first captures features and structures of reference images by exclusively focusing on selected frequency components. Subsequently, the content fusion module generates a content-guiding vector that encapsulates desired content features. During the image generation process, content-guiding vectors from real images are fused with projected noise vectors. This ensures the production of generated images that not only maintain consistent content from guiding images but also exhibit diverse stylistic variations. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in preserving content attributes, extensive experiments are conducted on widely used benchmark datasets, including Flickr-Faces-High Quality, Animal Faces High Quality, and Large-scale Scene Understanding datasets.

- **Summary**: Visual navigation takes inspiration from humans, who navigate in previously unseen environments using vision without detailed environment maps. Inspired by this, we introduce a novel no-RL, no-graph, no-odometry approach to visual navigation using feudal learning to build a three tiered agent. Key to our approach is a memory proxy map (MPM), an intermediate representation of the environment learned in a self-supervised manner by the high-level manager agent that serves as a simplified memory, approximating what the agent has seen. We demonstrate that recording observations in this learned latent space is an effective and efficient memory proxy that can remove the need for graphs and odometry in visual navigation tasks. For the mid-level manager agent, we develop a waypoint network (WayNet) that outputs intermediate subgoals, or waypoints, imitating human waypoint selection during local navigation. For the low-level worker agent, we learn a classifier over a discrete action space that avoids local obstacles and moves the agent towards the WayNet waypoint. The resulting feudal navigation network offers a novel approach with no RL, no graph, no odometry, and no metric map; all while achieving SOTA results on the image goal navigation task.

- **Summary**: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis is gaining prominence within the medical imaging field. Recent advances in pathology foundation models have shown the potential to extract powerful feature representations from WSIs for downstream tasks. However, these foundation models are usually designed for general-purpose pathology image analysis and may not be optimal for specific downstream tasks or cancer types. In this work, we present Concept Anchor-guided Task-specific Feature Enhancement (CATE), an adaptable paradigm that can boost the expressivity and discriminativeness of pathology foundation models for specific downstream tasks. Based on a set of task-specific concepts derived from the pathology vision-language model with expert-designed prompts, we introduce two interconnected modules to dynamically calibrate the generic image features extracted by foundation models for certain tasks or cancer types. Specifically, we design a Concept-guided Information Bottleneck module to enhance task-relevant characteristics by maximizing the mutual information between image features and concept anchors while suppressing superfluous information. Moreover, a Concept-Feature Interference module is proposed to utilize the similarity between calibrated features and concept anchors to further generate discriminative task-specific features. The extensive experiments on public WSI datasets demonstrate that CATE significantly enhances the performance and generalizability of MIL models. Additionally, heatmap and umap visualization results also reveal the effectiveness and interpretability of CATE. The source code is available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/CATE.

- **Summary**: We introduce DiffFNO, a novel diffusion framework for arbitrary-scale super-resolution strengthened by a Weighted Fourier Neural Operator (WFNO). Mode Re-balancing in WFNO effectively captures critical frequency components, significantly improving the reconstruction of high-frequency image details that are crucial for super-resolution tasks. Gated Fusion Mechanism (GFM) adaptively complements WFNO's spectral features with spatial features from an Attention-based Neural Operator (AttnNO). This enhances the network's capability to capture both global structures and local details. Adaptive Time-Step (ATS) ODE solver, a deterministic sampling strategy, accelerates inference without sacrificing output quality by dynamically adjusting integration step sizes ATS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffFNO achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, outperforming existing methods across various scaling factors by a margin of 2 to 4 dB in PSNR, including those beyond the training distribution. It also achieves this at lower inference time. Our approach sets a new standard in super-resolution, delivering both superior accuracy and computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: Virtual reality (VR), while enhancing user experiences, introduces significant privacy risks. This paper reveals a novel vulnerability in VR systems that allows attackers to capture VR privacy through obstacles utilizing millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals without physical intrusion and virtual connection with the VR devices. We propose mmSpyVR, a novel attack on VR user's privacy via mmWave radar. The mmSpyVR framework encompasses two main parts: (i) A transfer learning-based feature extraction model to achieve VR feature extraction from mmWave signal. (ii) An attention-based VR privacy spying module to spy VR privacy information from the extracted feature. The mmSpyVR demonstrates the capability to extract critical VR privacy from the mmWave signals that have penetrated through obstacles. We evaluate mmSpyVR through IRB-approved user studies. Across 22 participants engaged in four experimental scenes utilizing VR devices from three different manufacturers, our system achieves an application recognition accuracy of 98.5\% and keystroke recognition accuracy of 92.6\%. This newly discovered vulnerability has implications across various domains, such as cybersecurity, privacy protection, and VR technology development. We also engage with VR manufacturer Meta to discuss and explore potential mitigation strategies. Data and code are publicly available for scrutiny and research at https://github.com/luoyumei1-a/mmSpyVR/

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce Motion-Grounded Video Reasoning, a new motion understanding task that requires generating visual answers (video segmentation masks) according to the input question, and hence needs implicit spatiotemporal reasoning and grounding. This task extends existing spatiotemporal grounding work focusing on explicit action/motion grounding, to a more general format by enabling implicit reasoning via questions. To facilitate the development of the new task, we collect a large-scale dataset called GROUNDMORE, which comprises 1,715 video clips, 249K object masks that are deliberately designed with 4 question types (Causal, Sequential, Counterfactual, and Descriptive) for benchmarking deep and comprehensive motion reasoning abilities. GROUNDMORE uniquely requires models to generate visual answers, providing a more concrete and visually interpretable response than plain texts. It evaluates models on both spatiotemporal grounding and reasoning, fostering to address complex challenges in motion-related video reasoning, temporal perception, and pixel-level understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a novel baseline model named Motion-Grounded Video Reasoning Assistant (MORA). MORA incorporates the multimodal reasoning ability from the Multimodal LLM, the pixel-level perception capability from the grounding model (SAM), and the temporal perception ability from a lightweight localization head. MORA achieves respectable performance on GROUNDMORE outperforming the best existing visual grounding baseline model by an average of 21.5% relatively. We hope this novel and challenging task will pave the way for future advancements in robust and general motion understanding via video reasoning segmentation

- **Summary**: Computer vision is increasingly used in areas such as unmanned vehicles, surveillance systems and remote sensing. However, in foggy scenarios, image degradation leads to loss of target details, which seriously affects the accuracy and effectiveness of these vision tasks. Polarized light, due to the fact that its electromagnetic waves vibrate in a specific direction, is able to resist scattering and refraction effects in complex media more effectively compared to unpolarized light. As a result, polarized light has a greater ability to maintain its polarization characteristics in complex transmission media and under long-distance imaging conditions. This property makes polarized imaging especially suitable for complex scenes such as outdoor and underwater, especially in foggy environments, where higher quality images can be obtained. Based on this advantage, we propose an innovative semi-physical polarization dehazing method that does not rely on an external light source. The method simulates the diffusion process of fog and designs a diffusion kernel that corresponds to the image blurriness caused by this diffusion. By employing spatiotemporal Fourier transforms and deconvolution operations, the method recovers the state of fog droplets prior to diffusion and the light inversion distribution of objects. This approach effectively achieves dehazing and detail enhancement of the scene.

  Foundation Models: Explainability, Robustness, Security, and Beyond
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), foundational models (FMs) have seen significant advancements. Healthcare is one of the most crucial application areas for these FMs, given the significant time and effort required for physicians to analyze large volumes of patient data. Recent efforts have focused on adapting multimodal FMs to the medical domain through techniques like instruction-tuning, leading to the development of medical foundation models (MFMs). However, these approaches typically require large amounts of training data to effectively adapt models to the medical field. Moreover, most existing models are trained on English datasets, limiting their practicality in non-English-speaking regions where healthcare professionals and patients are not always fluent in English. The need for translation introduces additional costs and inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we propose a \textbf{J}apanese \textbf{Radi}ology report generation model enhanced by \textbf{Evo}lutionary optimization of model merging (JRadiEvo). This is the first attempt to extend a non-medical vision-language foundation model to the medical domain through evolutionary optimization of model merging. We successfully created a model that generates accurate Japanese reports from X-ray images using only 50 translated samples from publicly available data. This model, developed with highly efficient use of limited data, outperformed leading models from recent research trained on much larger datasets. Additionally, with only 8 billion parameters, this relatively compact foundation model can be deployed locally within hospitals, making it a practical solution for environments where APIs and other external services cannot be used due to strict privacy and security requirements.

- **Summary**: Avatar modelling has broad applications in human animation and virtual try-ons. Recent advancements in this field have focused on high-quality and comprehensive human reconstruction but often overlook the separation of clothing from the body. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces GGAvatar (Garment-separated 3D Gaussian Splatting Avatar), which relies on monocular videos. Through advanced parameterized templates and unique phased training, this model effectively achieves decoupled, editable, and realistic reconstruction of clothed humans. Comparative evaluations with other costly models confirm GGAvatar's superior quality and efficiency in modelling both clothed humans and separable garments. The paper also showcases applications in clothing editing, as illustrated in Figure 1, highlighting the model's benefits and the advantages of effective disentanglement.

- **Summary**: The hallucination problem in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains a common issue. Although image tokens occupy a majority of the input sequence of MLLMs, there is limited research to explore the relationship between image tokens and hallucinations. In this paper, we analyze the distribution of attention scores for image tokens across each layer and head of the model, revealing an intriguing and common phenomenon: most hallucinations are closely linked to the pattern of attention sinks in the self-attention matrix of image tokens, where shallow layers exhibit dense attention sinks and deeper layers show sparse attention sinks. We further analyze the attention heads of different layers and find that heads with high-density attention sink in the image part play a positive role in alleviating hallucinations. In this paper, we propose a training-free method named \textcolor{red}{\textbf{E}}nhancing \textcolor{red}{\textbf{A}}ttention \textcolor{red}{\textbf{H}}eads (EAH), an approach designed to enhance the convergence of image tokens attention sinks in the shallow layers. EAH identifies the attention head that shows the vision sink in a shallow layer and extracts its attention matrix. This attention map is then broadcast to other heads in the layer, thereby strengthening the layer to pay more attention to the image itself. With extensive experiments, EAH shows significant hallucination-mitigating performance on different MLLMs and metrics, proving its effectiveness and generality.

- **Summary**: End-to-end style autonomous driving models have been developed recently. These models lack interpretability of decision-making process from perception to control of the ego vehicle, resulting in anxiety for passengers. To alleviate it, it is effective to build a model which outputs captions describing future behaviors of the ego vehicle and their reason. However, the existing approaches generate reasoning text that inadequately reflects the future plans of the ego vehicle, because they train models to output captions using momentary control signals as inputs. In this study, we propose a reasoning model that takes future planning trajectories of the ego vehicle as inputs to solve this limitation with the dataset newly collected.

- **Summary**: Few-Shot Open-Set Recognition (FSOSR) targets a critical real-world challenge, aiming to categorize inputs into known categories, termed closed-set classes, while identifying open-set inputs that fall outside these classes. Although transfer learning where a model is tuned to a given few-shot task has become a prominent paradigm in closed-world, we observe that it fails to expand to open-world. To unlock this challenge, we propose a two-stage method which consists of open-set aware meta-learning with open-set free transfer learning. In the open-set aware meta-learning stage, a model is trained to establish a metric space that serves as a beneficial starting point for the subsequent stage. During the open-set free transfer learning stage, the model is further adapted to a specific target task through transfer learning. Additionally, we introduce a strategy to simulate open-set examples by modifying the training dataset or generating pseudo open-set examples. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely recognized benchmarks, miniImageNet and tieredImageNet, with only a 1.5\% increase in training effort. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in FSOSR.

- **Summary**: As a highly expressive generative model, diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional success across various domains, including image generation, natural language processing, and combinatorial optimization. However, as data distributions grow more complex, training these models to convergence becomes increasingly computationally intensive. While diffusion models are typically trained using uniform timestep sampling, our research shows that the variance in stochastic gradients varies significantly across timesteps, with high-variance timesteps becoming bottlenecks that hinder faster convergence. To address this issue, we introduce a non-uniform timestep sampling method that prioritizes these more critical timesteps. Our method tracks the impact of gradient updates on the objective for each timestep, adaptively selecting those most likely to minimize the objective effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only accelerates the training process, but also leads to improved performance at convergence. Furthermore, our method shows robust performance across various datasets, scheduling strategies, and diffusion architectures, outperforming previously proposed timestep sampling and weighting heuristics that lack this degree of robustness.

- **Summary**: The rising prevalence of vision-threatening retinal diseases poses a significant burden on the global healthcare systems. Deep learning (DL) offers a promising solution for automatic disease screening but demands substantial data. Collecting and labeling large volumes of ophthalmic images across various modalities encounters several real-world challenges, especially for rare diseases. Here, we introduce EyeDiff, a text-to-image model designed to generate multimodal ophthalmic images from natural language prompts and evaluate its applicability in diagnosing common and rare diseases. EyeDiff is trained on eight large-scale datasets using the advanced latent diffusion model, covering 14 ophthalmic image modalities and over 80 ocular diseases, and is adapted to ten multi-country external datasets. The generated images accurately capture essential lesional characteristics, achieving high alignment with text prompts as evaluated by objective metrics and human experts. Furthermore, integrating generated images significantly enhances the accuracy of detecting minority classes and rare eye diseases, surpassing traditional oversampling methods in addressing data imbalance. EyeDiff effectively tackles the issue of data imbalance and insufficiency typically encountered in rare diseases and addresses the challenges of collecting large-scale annotated images, offering a transformative solution to enhance the development of expert-level diseases diagnosis models in ophthalmic field.

- **Summary**: Stereo depth estimation is a fundamental component in augmented reality (AR) applications. Although AR applications require very low latency for their real-time applications, traditional depth estimation models often rely on time-consuming preprocessing steps such as rectification to achieve high accuracy. Also, non standard ML operator based algorithms such as cost volume also require significant latency, which is aggravated on compute resource-constrained mobile platforms. Therefore, we develop hardware-friendly alternatives to the costly cost volume and preprocessing and design two new models based on them, MultiHeadDepth and HomoDepth. Our approaches for cost volume is replacing it with a new group-pointwise convolution-based operator and approximation of consine similarity based on layernorm and dot product. For online stereo rectification (preprocessing), we introduce homograhy matrix prediction network with a rectification positional encoding (RPE), which delivers both low latency and robustness to unrectified images, which eliminates the needs for preprocessing. Our MultiHeadDepth, which includes optimized cost volume, provides 11.8-30.3% improvements in accuracy and 22.9-25.2% reduction in latency compared to a state-of-the-art depth estimation model for AR glasses from industry. Our HomoDepth, which includes optimized preprocessing (Homograhpy + RPE) upon MultiHeadDepth, can process unrectified images and reduce the end-to-end latency by 44.5%. We adopt a multi-task learning framework to handle misaligned stereo inputs on HomoDepth, which reduces theAbsRel error by 10.0-24.3%. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our approaches in achieving both high model performance with low latency, which makes a step forward toward practical depth estimation on future AR devices.

- **Summary**: Micro Crack detection using deep neural networks (DNNs) through an automated pipeline using wave fields interacting with the damaged areas is highly sought after. These high-dimensional spatio-temporal crack data are limited, and these datasets have large dimensions in the temporal domain. The dataset presents a substantial class imbalance, with crack pixels constituting an average of only 5% of the total pixels per sample. This extreme class imbalance poses a challenge for deep learning models with the different micro-scale cracks, as the network can be biased toward predicting the majority class, generally leading to poor detection accuracy. This study builds upon the previous benchmark SpAsE-Net, an asymmetric encoder-decoder network for micro-crack detection. The impact of various activation and loss functions were examined through feature space visualization using the manifold discovery and analysis (MDA) algorithm. The optimized architecture and training methodology achieved an accuracy of 86.85%.

- **Summary**: Recent efforts to understand intermediate representations in deep neural networks have commonly attempted to label individual neurons and combinations of neurons that make up linear directions in the latent space by examining extremal neuron activations and the highest direction projections. In this paper, we show that this approach, although yielding a good approximation for many purposes, fails to capture valuable information about the behaviour of a representation. Neural network activations are generally dense, and so a more complex, but realistic scenario is that linear directions encode information at various levels of stimulation. We hypothesise that non-extremal level activations contain complex information worth investigating, such as statistical associations, and thus may be used to locate confounding human interpretable concepts. We explore the value of studying a range of neuron activations by taking the case of mid-level output neuron activations and demonstrate on a synthetic dataset how they can inform us about aspects of representations in the penultimate layer not evident through analysing maximal activations alone. We use our findings to develop a method to curate data from mid-range logit samples for retraining to mitigate spurious correlations, or confounding concepts in the penultimate layer, on real benchmark datasets. The success of our method exemplifies the utility of inspecting non-maximal activations to extract complex relationships learned by models.

- **Summary**: The goal of multi-object tracking (MOT) is to detect and track all objects in a scene across frames, while maintaining a unique identity for each object. Most existing methods rely on the spatial motion features and appearance embedding features of the detected objects in consecutive frames. Effectively and robustly representing the spatial and appearance features of long trajectories has become a critical factor affecting the performance of MOT. We propose a novel approach for appearance and spatial feature representation, improving upon the clustering association method MOT\_FCG. For spatial motion features, we propose Diagonal Modulated GIoU, which more accurately represents the relationship between the position and shape of the objects. For appearance features, we utilize a dynamic appearance representation that incorporates confidence information, enabling the trajectory appearance features to be more robust and global. Based on the baseline model MOT\_FCG, we achieved 76.1 HOTA, 80.4 MOTA and 81.3 IDF1 on the MOT17 validation set, and also achieved competitive performance on the MOT20 and DanceTrack validation sets.

- **Summary**: Adversarial camouflage is a widely used physical attack against vehicle detectors for its superiority in multi-view attack performance. One promising approach involves using differentiable neural renderers to facilitate adversarial camouflage optimization through gradient back-propagation. However, existing methods often struggle to capture environmental characteristics during the rendering process or produce adversarial textures that can precisely map to the target vehicle. Moreover, these approaches neglect diverse weather conditions, reducing the efficacy of generated camouflage across varying weather scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose a robust and accurate camouflage generation method, namely RAUCA. The core of RAUCA is a novel neural rendering component, End-to-End Neural Renderer Plus (E2E-NRP), which can accurately optimize and project vehicle textures and render images with environmental characteristics such as lighting and weather. In addition, we integrate a multi-weather dataset for camouflage generation, leveraging the E2E-NRP to enhance the attack robustness. Experimental results on six popular object detectors show that RAUCA-final outperforms existing methods in both simulation and real-world settings.

- **Summary**: Short video platforms have become important channels for news dissemination, offering a highly engaging and immediate way for users to access current events and share information. However, these platforms have also emerged as significant conduits for the rapid spread of misinformation, as fake news and rumors can leverage the visual appeal and wide reach of short videos to circulate extensively among audiences. Existing fake news detection methods mainly rely on single-modal information, such as text or images, or apply only basic fusion techniques, limiting their ability to handle the complex, multi-layered information inherent in short videos. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel fake news detection method based on multimodal information, designed to identify misinformation through a multi-level analysis of video content. This approach effectively utilizes different modal representations to generate a unified textual description, which is then fed into a large language model for comprehensive evaluation. The proposed framework successfully integrates multimodal features within videos, significantly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of fake news detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy, robustness, and utilization of multimodal information, achieving an accuracy of 90.93%, which is significantly higher than the best baseline model (SV-FEND) at 81.05%. Furthermore, case studies provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of the approach in accurately distinguishing between fake news, debunking content, and real incidents, highlighting its reliability and robustness in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: With the emergence of large-scale Text-to-Image(T2I) models and implicit 3D representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), many text-driven generative editing methods based on NeRF have appeared. However, the implicit encoding of geometric and textural information poses challenges in accurately locating and controlling objects during editing. Recently, significant advancements have been made in the editing methods of 3D Gaussian Splatting, a real-time rendering technology that relies on explicit representation. However, these methods still suffer from issues including inaccurate localization and limited manipulation over editing. To tackle these challenges, we propose GSEditPro, a novel 3D scene editing framework which allows users to perform various creative and precise editing using text prompts only. Leveraging the explicit nature of the 3D Gaussian distribution, we introduce an attention-based progressive localization module to add semantic labels to each Gaussian during rendering. This enables precise localization on editing areas by classifying Gaussians based on their relevance to the editing prompts derived from cross-attention layers of the T2I model. Furthermore, we present an innovative editing optimization method based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, obtaining stable and refined editing results through the guidance of Score Distillation Sampling and pseudo ground truth. We prove the efficacy of our method through extensive experiments.

- **Summary**: Multimodal image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate information from different modalities to obtain a comprehensive image, aiding downstream tasks. However, existing methods tend to prioritize natural image fusion and focus on information complementary and network training strategies. They ignore the essential distinction between natural and medical image fusion and the influence of underlying components. This paper dissects the significant differences between the two tasks regarding fusion goals, statistical properties, and data distribution. Based on this, we rethink the suitability of the normalization strategy and convolutional kernels for end-to-end MMIF.Specifically, this paper proposes a mixture of instance normalization and group normalization to preserve sample independence and reinforce intrinsic feature correlation.This strategy promotes the potential of enriching feature maps, thus boosting fusion performance. To this end, we further introduce the large kernel convolution, effectively expanding receptive fields and enhancing the preservation of image detail. Moreover, the proposed multipath adaptive fusion module recalibrates the decoder input with features of various scales and receptive fields, ensuring the transmission of crucial information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits state-of-the-art performance in multiple fusion tasks and significantly improves downstream applications.

- **Summary**: Recent work on human animation usually involves audio, pose, or movement maps conditions, thereby achieves vivid animation quality. However, these methods often face practical challenges due to extra control conditions, cumbersome condition injection modules, or limitation to head region driving. Hence, we ask if it is possible to achieve striking half-body human animation while simplifying unnecessary conditions. To this end, we propose a half-body human animation method, dubbed EchoMimicV2, that leverages a novel Audio-Pose Dynamic Harmonization strategy, including Pose Sampling and Audio Diffusion, to enhance half-body details, facial and gestural expressiveness, and meanwhile reduce conditions redundancy. To compensate for the scarcity of half-body data, we utilize Head Partial Attention to seamlessly accommodate headshot data into our training framework, which can be omitted during inference, providing a free lunch for animation. Furthermore, we design the Phase-specific Denoising Loss to guide motion, detail, and low-level quality for animation in specific phases, respectively. Besides, we also present a novel benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of half-body human animation. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that EchoMimicV2 surpasses existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

- **Summary**: Federated domain generalization (FedDG) aims to improve the global model generalization in unseen domains by addressing data heterogeneity under privacy-preserving constraints. A common strategy in existing FedDG studies involves sharing domain-specific knowledge among clients, such as spectrum information, class prototypes, and data styles. However, this knowledge is extracted directly from local client samples, and sharing such sensitive information poses a potential risk of data leakage, which might not fully meet the requirements of FedDG. In this paper, we introduce prompt learning to adapt pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) in the FedDG scenario, and leverage locally learned prompts as a more secure bridge to facilitate knowledge transfer among clients. Specifically, we propose a novel FedDG framework through Prompt Learning and AggregatioN (PLAN), which comprises two training stages to collaboratively generate local prompts and global prompts at each federated round. First, each client performs both text and visual prompt learning using their own data, with local prompts indirectly synchronized by regarding the global prompts as a common reference. Second, all domain-specific local prompts are exchanged among clients and selectively aggregated into the global prompts using lightweight attention-based aggregators. The global prompts are finally applied to adapt VLMs to unseen target domains. As our PLAN framework requires training only a limited number of prompts and lightweight aggregators, it offers notable advantages in computational and communication efficiency for FedDG. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalization ability of PLAN across four benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: We present a novel, open-access dataset designed for semantic layout analysis, built to support document recreation workflows through mapping with the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standard. This dataset includes 7,254 annotated pages spanning a large temporal range (1600-2024) of digitised and born-digital materials across diverse document types (magazines, papers from sciences and humanities, PhD theses, monographs, plays, administrative reports, etc.) sorted into modular subsets. By incorporating content from different periods and genres, it addresses varying layout complexities and historical changes in document structure. The modular design allows domain-specific configurations. We evaluate object detection models on this dataset, examining the impact of input size and subset-based training. Results show that a 1280-pixel input size for YOLO is optimal and that training on subsets generally benefits from incorporating them into a generic model rather than fine-tuning pre-trained weights.

- **Summary**: Existing cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) methods, which develop source-domain training strategies to enhance model transferability, face challenges with large-scale pre-trained models (LMs) due to inaccessible source data and training strategies. Moreover, fine-tuning LMs for CDFSL demands substantial computational resources, limiting practicality. This paper addresses the source-free CDFSL (SF-CDFSL) problem, tackling few-shot learning (FSL) in the target domain using only pre-trained models and a few target samples without source data or strategies. To overcome the challenge of inaccessible source data, this paper introduces Step-wise Distribution Alignment Guided Style Prompt Tuning (StepSPT), which implicitly narrows domain gaps through prediction distribution optimization. StepSPT proposes a style prompt to align target samples with the desired distribution and adopts a dual-phase optimization process. In the external process, a step-wise distribution alignment strategy factorizes prediction distribution optimization into a multi-step alignment problem to tune the style prompt. In the internal process, the classifier is updated using standard cross-entropy loss. Evaluations on five datasets demonstrate that StepSPT outperforms existing prompt tuning-based methods and SOTAs. Ablation studies further verify its effectiveness. Code will be made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/xuhuali-mxj/StepSPT}.

- **Summary**: We introduce FedEvPrompt, a federated learning approach that integrates principles of evidential deep learning, prompt tuning, and knowledge distillation for distributed skin lesion classification. FedEvPrompt leverages two sets of prompts: b-prompts (for low-level basic visual knowledge) and t-prompts (for task-specific knowledge) prepended to frozen pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) models trained in an evidential learning framework to maximize class evidences. Crucially, knowledge sharing across federation clients is achieved only through knowledge distillation on attention maps generated by the local ViT models, ensuring enhanced privacy preservation compared to traditional parameter or synthetic image sharing methodologies. FedEvPrompt is optimized within a round-based learning paradigm, where each round involves training local models followed by attention maps sharing with all federation clients. Experimental validation conducted in a real distributed setting, on the ISIC2019 dataset, demonstrates the superior performance of FedEvPrompt against baseline federated learning algorithms and knowledge distillation methods, without sharing model parameters. In conclusion, FedEvPrompt offers a promising approach for federated learning, effectively addressing challenges such as data heterogeneity, imbalance, privacy preservation, and knowledge sharing.

- **Summary**: Accurate people counting in smart buildings and intelligent transportation systems is crucial for energy management, safety protocols, and resource allocation. This is especially critical during emergencies, where precise occupant counts are vital for safe evacuation. Existing methods struggle with large crowds, often losing accuracy with even a few additional people. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel approach combining a new object tracking algorithm, a novel counting algorithm, and a fine-tuned object detection model. This method achieves 97% accuracy in real-time people counting with a frame rate of 20-27 FPS on a low-power edge computer.

- **Summary**: The digitization of natural history collections over the past three decades has unlocked a treasure trove of specimen imagery and metadata. There is great interest in making this data more useful by further labeling it with additional trait data, and modern deep learning machine learning techniques utilizing convolutional neural nets (CNNs) and similar networks show particular promise to reduce the amount of required manual labeling by human experts, making the process much faster and less expensive. However, in most cases, the accuracy of these approaches is too low for reliable utilization of the automatic labeling, typically in the range of 80-85% accuracy. In this paper, we present and validate an approach that can greatly improve this accuracy, essentially by examining the confidence that the network has in the generated label as well as utilizing a user-defined threshold to reject labels that fall below a chosen level. We demonstrate that a naive model that produced 86% initial accuracy can achieve improved performance - over 95% accuracy (rejecting about 40% of the labels) or over 99% accuracy (rejecting about 65%) by selecting higher confidence thresholds. This gives flexibility to adapt existing models to the statistical requirements of various types of research and has the potential to move these automatic labeling approaches from being unusably inaccurate to being an invaluable new tool. After validating the approach in a number of ways, we annotate the reproductive state of a large dataset of over 600,000 herbarium specimens. The analysis of the results points at under-investigated correlations as well as general alignment with known trends. By sharing this new dataset alongside this work, we want to allow ecologists to gather insights for their own research questions, at their chosen point of accuracy/coverage trade-off.

- **Summary**: Multi-view learning often faces challenges in effectively leveraging images captured from different angles and locations. This challenge is particularly pronounced when addressing inconsistencies and uncertainties between views. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-View Uncertainty-Weighted Mutual Distillation (MV-UWMD) method. Our method enhances prediction consistency by performing hierarchical mutual distillation across all possible view combinations, including single-view, partial multi-view, and full multi-view predictions. This introduces an uncertainty-based weighting mechanism through mutual distillation, allowing effective exploitation of unique information from each view while mitigating the impact of uncertain predictions. We extend a CNN-Transformer hybrid architecture to facilitate robust feature learning and integration across multiple view combinations. We conducted extensive experiments using a large, unstructured dataset captured from diverse, non-fixed viewpoints. The results demonstrate that MV-UWMD improves prediction accuracy and consistency compared to existing multi-view learning approaches.

Plenty approaches exist to extract vital signs in a controlled setting, but in order to apply them more flexibly for example in multi-camera settings, a simulated environment is needed to generate enough data for training and testing of new algorithms. We show first results of a 3D-rendering simulation pipeline that focuses on different noise models in order to generate realistic, depth-camera based respiratory signals using both synthetic and real respiratory signals as a baseline. While most noise can be accurately modelled as Gaussian in this context, we can show that as soon as the available image resolution is too low, the differences between different noise models surface.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to each pixel without relying on a predefined set of categories. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) demonstrates outstanding zero-shot classification capabilities but struggles with the pixel-wise segmentation task as the captured inter-patch correlations correspond to no specific visual concepts. Despite previous CLIP-based works improving inter-patch correlations by self-self attention, they still face the inherent limitation that image patches tend to have high similarity to outlier ones. In this work, we introduce CorrCLIP, a training-free approach for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which reconstructs significantly coherent inter-patch correlations utilizing foundation models. Specifically, it employs the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to define the scope of patch interactions, ensuring that patches interact only with semantically similar ones. Furthermore, CorrCLIP obtains an understanding of an image's semantic layout via self-supervised models to determine concrete similarity values between image patches, which addresses the similarity irregularity problem caused by the aforementioned restricted patch interaction regime. Finally, CorrCLIP reuses the region masks produced by SAM to update the segmentation map. As a training-free method, CorrCLIP achieves a notable improvement across eight challenging benchmarks regarding the averaged mean Intersection over Union, boosting it from 44.4% to 51.0%.

- **Summary**: Despite advances in deep learning for estimating brain age from structural MRI data, incorporating functional MRI data is challenging due to its complex structure and the noisy nature of functional connectivity measurements. To address this, we present the Multitask Adversarial Variational Autoencoder, a custom deep learning framework designed to improve brain age predictions through multimodal MRI data integration. This model separates latent variables into generic and unique codes, isolating shared and modality-specific features. By integrating multitask learning with sex classification as an additional task, the model captures sex-specific aging patterns. Evaluated on the OpenBHB dataset, a large multisite brain MRI collection, the model achieves a mean absolute error of 2.77 years, outperforming traditional methods. This success positions M-AVAE as a powerful tool for metaverse-based healthcare applications in brain age estimation.

- **Summary**: The stylization of 3D scenes is an increasingly attractive topic in 3D vision. Although image style transfer has been extensively researched with promising results, directly applying 2D style transfer methods to 3D scenes often fails to preserve the structural and multi-view properties of 3D environments, resulting in unpleasant distortions in images from different viewpoints. To address these issues, we leverage the remarkable generative prior of diffusion-based models and propose a novel style transfer method, OSDiffST, based on a pre-trained one-step diffusion model (i.e., SD-Turbo) for rendering diverse styles in multi-view images of 3D scenes. To efficiently adapt the pre-trained model for multi-view style transfer on small datasets, we introduce a vision condition module to extract style information from the reference style image to serve as conditional input for the diffusion model and employ LoRA in diffusion model for adaptation. Additionally, we consider color distribution alignment and structural similarity between the stylized and content images using two specific loss functions. As a result, our method effectively preserves the structural information and multi-view consistency in stylized images without any 3D information. Experiments show that our method surpasses other promising style transfer methods in synthesizing various styles for multi-view images of 3D scenes. Stylized images from different viewpoints generated by our method achieve superior visual quality, with better structural integrity and less distortion.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels in novel view synthesis, balancing advanced rendering quality with real-time performance. However, in trained scenes, a large number of Gaussians with low opacity significantly increase rendering costs. This issue arises due to flaws in the split and clone operations during the densification process, which lead to extensive Gaussian overlap and subsequent opacity reduction. To enhance the efficiency of Gaussian utilization, we improve the adaptive density control of 3DGS. First, we introduce a more efficient long-axis split operation to replace the original clone and split, which mitigates Gaussian overlap and improves densification efficiency.Second, we propose a simple adaptive pruning technique to reduce the number of low-opacity Gaussians. Finally, by dynamically lowering the splitting threshold and applying importance weighting, the efficiency of Gaussian utilization is further improved.We evaluate our proposed method on various challenging real-world datasets. Experimental results show that our Efficient Density Control (EDC) can enhance both the rendering speed and quality.

- **Summary**: Medical images often exhibit distribution shifts due to variations in imaging protocols and scanners across different medical centers. Domain Generalization (DG) methods aim to train models on source domains that can generalize to unseen target domains. Recently, the segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated strong generalization capabilities due to its prompt-based design, and has gained significant attention in image segmentation tasks. Existing SAM-based approaches attempt to address the need for manual prompts by introducing prompt generators that automatically generate these prompts. However, we argue that auto-generated prompts may not be sufficiently accurate under distribution shifts, potentially leading to incorrect predictions that still require manual verification and correction by clinicians. To address this challenge, we propose a method for 2D medical image segmentation called Self-Correcting SAM (CoSAM). Our approach begins by generating coarse masks using SAM in a prompt-free manner, providing prior prompts for the subsequent stages, and eliminating the need for prompt generators. To automatically refine these coarse masks, we introduce a generalized error decoder that simulates the correction process typically performed by clinicians. Furthermore, we generate diverse prompts as feedback based on the corrected masks, which are used to iteratively refine the predictions within a self-correcting loop, enhancing the generalization performance of our model. Extensive experiments on two medical image segmentation benchmarks across multiple scenarios demonstrate the superiority of CoSAM over state-of-the-art SAM-based methods.

- **Summary**: Mathematical morphology is a part of image processing that uses a window that moves across the image to change certain pixels according to certain operations. The concepts of supremum and infimum play a crucial role here, but it proves challenging to define them generally for higher-dimensional data, such as colour representations. Numerous approaches have therefore been taken to solve this problem with certain compromises. In this paper we will analyse the construction of a new approach, which we have already presented experimentally in paper [Kahra, M., Breu{\ss}, M., Kleefeld, A., Welk, M., DGMM 2024, pp. 325-337]. This is based on a method by Burgeth and Kleefeld [Burgeth, B., Kleefeld, A., ISMM 2013, pp. 243-254], who regard the colours as symmetric $2\times2$ matrices and compare them by means of the Loewner order in a bi-cone through different suprema. However, we will replace the supremum with the LogExp approximation for the maximum instead. This allows us to transfer the associativity of the dilation from the one-dimensional case to the higher-dimensional case. In addition, we will investigate the minimality property and specify a relaxation to ensure that our approach is continuously dependent on the input data.

- **Summary**: Various technologies, including computer vision models, are employed for the automatic monitoring of manual assembly processes in production. These models detect and classify events such as the presence of components in an assembly area or the connection of components. A major challenge with detection and classification algorithms is their susceptibility to variations in environmental conditions and unpredictable behavior when processing objects that are not included in the training dataset. As it is impractical to add all possible subjects in the training sample, an alternative solution is necessary. This study proposes a model that simultaneously performs classification and anomaly detection, employing metric learning to generate vector representations of images in a multidimensional space, followed by classification using cross-entropy. For experimentation, a dataset of over 327,000 images was prepared. Experiments were conducted with various computer vision model architectures, and the outcomes of each approach were compared.

- **Summary**: Existing Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods achieve remarkable success in analyzing quality for overall image, but few works explore quality analysis for Regions of Interest (ROIs). The quality analysis of ROIs can provide fine-grained guidance for image quality improvement and is crucial for scenarios focusing on region-level quality. This paper proposes a novel network, SEAGULL, which can SEe and Assess ROIs quality with GUidance from a Large vision-Language model. SEAGULL incorporates a vision-language model (VLM), masks generated by Segment Anything Model (SAM) to specify ROIs, and a meticulously designed Mask-based Feature Extractor (MFE) to extract global and local tokens for specified ROIs, enabling accurate fine-grained IQA for ROIs. Moreover, this paper constructs two ROI-based IQA datasets, SEAGULL-100w and SEAGULL-3k, for training and evaluating ROI-based IQA. SEAGULL-100w comprises about 100w synthetic distortion images with 33 million ROIs for pre-training to improve the model's ability of regional quality perception, and SEAGULL-3k contains about 3k authentic distortion ROIs to enhance the model's ability to perceive real world distortions. After pre-training on SEAGULL-100w and fine-tuning on SEAGULL-3k, SEAGULL shows remarkable performance on fine-grained ROI quality assessment.

- **Summary**: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods often require extensive amounts of data. As opposed to model-free RL, model-based RL (MBRL) offers a potential solution with efficient data utilization through planning. Additionally, RL lacks generalization capabilities for real-world tasks. Prior work has shown that incorporating pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) enhances sample efficiency and generalization. While PVRs have been extensively studied in the context of model-free RL, their potential in MBRL remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we benchmark a set of PVRs on challenging control tasks in a model-based RL setting. We investigate the data efficiency, generalization capabilities, and the impact of different properties of PVRs on the performance of model-based agents. Our results, perhaps surprisingly, reveal that for MBRL current PVRs are not more sample efficient than learning representations from scratch, and that they do not generalize better to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To explain this, we analyze the quality of the trained dynamics model. Furthermore, we show that data diversity and network architecture are the most important contributors to OOD generalization performance.

- **Summary**: In recent years, image synthesis has achieved remarkable advancements, enabling diverse applications in content creation, virtual reality, and beyond. We introduce a novel approach to image generation using Auto-Regressive (AR) modeling, which leverages a next-detail prediction strategy for enhanced fidelity and scalability. While AR models have achieved transformative success in language modeling, replicating this success in vision tasks has presented unique challenges due to the inherent spatial dependencies in images. Our proposed method addresses these challenges by iteratively adding finer details to an image compositionally, constructing it as a hierarchical combination of base and detail image factors. This strategy is shown to be more effective than the conventional next-token prediction and even surpasses the state-of-the-art next-scale prediction approaches. A key advantage of this method is its scalability to higher resolutions without requiring full model retraining, making it a versatile solution for high-resolution image generation.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image generation and text-guided image manipulation have received considerable attention in the field of image generation tasks. However, the mainstream evaluation methods for these tasks have difficulty in evaluating whether all the information from the input text is accurately reflected in the generated images, and they mainly focus on evaluating the overall alignment between the input text and the generated images. This paper proposes new evaluation metrics that assess the alignment between input text and generated images for every individual object. Firstly, according to the input text, chatGPT is utilized to produce questions for the generated images. After that, we use Visual Question Answering(VQA) to measure the relevance of the generated images to the input text, which allows for a more detailed evaluation of the alignment compared to existing methods. In addition, we use Non-Reference Image Quality Assessment(NR-IQA) to evaluate not only the text-image alignment but also the quality of the generated images. Experimental results show that our proposed evaluation approach is the superior metric that can simultaneously assess finer text-image alignment and image quality while allowing for the adjustment of these ratios.

- **Summary**: Learned progressive image compression is gaining momentum as it allows improved image reconstruction as more bits are decoded at the receiver. We propose a progressive image compression method in which an image is first represented as a pair of base-quality and top-quality latent representations. Next, a residual latent representation is encoded as the element-wise difference between the top and base representations. Our scheme enables progressive image compression with element-wise granularity by introducing a masking system that ranks each element of the residual latent representation from most to least important, dividing it into complementary components, which can be transmitted separately to the decoder in order to obtain different reconstruction quality. The masking system does not add further parameters nor complexity. At the receiver, any elements of the top latent representation excluded from the transmitted components can be independently replaced with the mean predicted by the hyperprior architecture, ensuring reliable reconstructions at any intermediate quality level. We also introduced Rate Enhancement Modules (REMs), which refine the estimation of entropy parameters using already decoded components. We obtain results competitive with state-of-the-art competitors, while significantly reducing computational complexity, decoding time, and number of parameters.

- **Summary**: Image-based virtual try-on, widely used in online shopping, aims to generate images of a naturally dressed person conditioned on certain garments, providing significant research and commercial potential. A key challenge of try-on is to generate realistic images of the model wearing the garments while preserving the details of the garments. Previous methods focus on masking certain parts of the original model's standing image, and then inpainting on masked areas to generate realistic images of the model wearing corresponding reference garments, which treat the try-on task as an inpainting task. However, such implements require the user to provide a complete, high-quality standing image, which is user-unfriendly in practical applications. In this paper, we propose Try-On-Adapter (TOA), an outpainting paradigm that differs from the existing inpainting paradigm. Our TOA can preserve the given face and garment, naturally imagine the rest parts of the image, and provide flexible control ability with various conditions, e.g., garment properties and human pose. In the experiments, TOA shows excellent performance on the virtual try-on task even given relatively low-quality face and garment images in qualitative comparisons. Additionally, TOA achieves the state-of-the-art performance of FID scores 5.56 and 7.23 for paired and unpaired on the VITON-HD dataset in quantitative comparisons.

- **Summary**: Recent inverse rendering methods have greatly improved shape, material, and illumination reconstruction by utilizing polarization cues. However, existing methods only support dielectrics, ignoring conductors that are found everywhere in life. Since conductors and dielectrics have different reflection properties, using previous conductor methods will lead to obvious errors. In addition, conductors are glossy, which may cause strong specular reflection and is hard to reconstruct. To solve the above issues, we propose NeISF++, an inverse rendering pipeline that supports conductors and dielectrics. The key ingredient for our proposal is a general pBRDF that describes both conductors and dielectrics. As for the strong specular reflection problem, we propose a novel geometry initialization method using DoLP images. This physical cue is invariant to intensities and thus robust to strong specular reflections. Experimental results on our synthetic and real datasets show that our method surpasses the existing polarized inverse rendering methods for geometry and material decomposition as well as downstream tasks like relighting.

- **Summary**: Deepfake technology has rapidly advanced, posing significant threats to information integrity and societal trust. While significant progress has been made in detecting deepfakes, the simultaneous manipulation of audio and visual modalities, sometimes at small parts but still altering the meaning, presents a more challenging detection scenario. We present a novel audio-visual deepfake detection framework that leverages the inter-modality differences in machine perception of speech, based on the assumption that in real samples - in contrast to deepfakes - visual and audio signals coincide in terms of information. Our framework leverages features from deep networks that specialize in video and audio speech recognition to spot frame-level cross-modal incongruities, and in that way to temporally localize the deepfake forgery. To this end, DiMoDif employs a Transformer encoder-based architecture with a feature pyramid scheme and local attention, and optimizes the detection model through a composite loss function accounting for frame-level detections and fake intervals localization. DiMoDif outperforms the state-of-the-art on the Temporal Forgery Localization task by +47.88% AP@0.75 on AV-Deepfake1M, and performs on-par on LAV-DF. On the Deepfake Detection task, it outperforms the state-of-the-art by +30.5% AUC on AV-Deepfake1M, +2.8% AUC on FakeAVCeleb, and performs on-par on LAV-DF.

- **Summary**: Spatio-Temporal predictive Learning is a self-supervised learning paradigm that enables models to identify spatial and temporal patterns by predicting future frames based on past frames. Traditional methods, which use recurrent neural networks to capture temporal patterns, have proven their effectiveness but come with high system complexity and computational demand. Convolutions could offer a more efficient alternative but are limited by their characteristic of treating all previous frames equally, resulting in poor temporal characterization, and by their local receptive field, limiting the capacity to capture distant correlations among frames. In this paper, we propose STLight, a novel method for spatio-temporal learning that relies solely on channel-wise and depth-wise convolutions as learnable layers. STLight overcomes the limitations of traditional convolutional approaches by rearranging spatial and temporal dimensions together, using a single convolution to mix both types of features into a comprehensive spatio-temporal patch representation. This representation is then processed in a purely convolutional framework, capable of focusing simultaneously on the interaction among near and distant patches, and subsequently allowing for efficient reconstruction of the predicted frames. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on STL benchmarks across different datasets and settings, while significantly improving computational efficiency in terms of parameters and computational FLOPs.

- **Summary**: Compressive sensing (CS), acquiring and reconstructing signals below the Nyquist rate, has great potential in image and video acquisition to exploit data redundancy and greatly reduce the amount of sampled data. To further reduce the sampled data while keeping the video quality, this paper explores the temporal redundancy in video CS and proposes a block based adaptive compressive sensing framework with a sampling rate (SR) control strategy. To avoid redundant compression of non-moving regions, we first incorporate moving block detection between consecutive frames, and only transmit the measurements of moving blocks. The non-moving regions are reconstructed from the previous frame. In addition, we propose a block storage system and a dynamic threshold to achieve adaptive SR allocation to each frame based on the area of moving regions and target SR for controlling the average SR within the target SR. Finally, to reduce blocking artifacts and improve reconstruction quality, we adopt a cooperative reconstruction of the moving and non-moving blocks by referring to the measurements of the non-moving blocks from the previous frame. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that this work is able to control SR and obtain better performance than existing works.

- **Summary**: Learning robust and generalizable manipulation skills from demonstrations remains a key challenge in robotics, with broad applications in industrial automation and service robotics. While recent imitation learning methods have achieved impressive results, they often require large amounts of demonstration data and struggle to generalize across different spatial variants. In this work, we present a novel framework that learns manipulation skills from as few as 10 demonstrations, yet still generalizes to spatial variants such as different initial object positions and camera viewpoints. Our framework consists of two key modules: Semantic Guided Perception (SGP), which constructs task-focused, spatially aware 3D point cloud representations from RGB-D inputs; and Spatial Generalized Decision (SGD), an efficient diffusion-based decision-making module that generates actions via denoising. To effectively learn generalization ability from limited data, we introduce a critical spatially equivariant training strategy that captures the spatial knowledge embedded in expert demonstrations. We validate our framework through extensive experiments on both simulation benchmarks and real-world robotic systems. Our method demonstrates a 60 percent improvement in success rates over state-of-the-art approaches on a series of challenging tasks, even with substantial variations in object poses and camera viewpoints. This work shows significant potential for advancing efficient, generalizable manipulation skill learning in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Radiology reports are crucial for planning treatment strategies and enhancing doctor-patient communication, yet manually writing these reports is burdensome for radiologists. While automatic report generation offers a solution, existing methods often rely on single-view radiographs, limiting diagnostic accuracy. To address this problem, we propose MCL, a Multi-view enhanced Contrastive Learning method for chest X-ray report generation. Specifically, we first introduce multi-view enhanced contrastive learning for visual representation by maximizing agreements between multi-view radiographs and their corresponding report. Subsequently, to fully exploit patient-specific indications (e.g., patient's symptoms) for report generation, we add a transitional ``bridge" for missing indications to reduce embedding space discrepancies caused by their presence or absence. Additionally, we construct Multi-view CXR and Two-view CXR datasets from public sources to support research on multi-view report generation. Our proposed MCL surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, achieving a 5.0% F1 RadGraph improvement on MIMIC-CXR, a 7.3% BLEU-1 improvement on MIMIC-ABN, a 3.1% BLEU-4 improvement on Multi-view CXR, and an 8.2% F1 CheXbert improvement on Two-view CXR.

- **Summary**: Transformer-based Super-Resolution (SR) models have recently advanced image reconstruction quality, yet challenges remain due to computational complexity and an over-reliance on large patch sizes, which constrain fine-grained detail enhancement. In this work, we propose TaylorIR to address these limitations by utilizing a patch size of 1x1, enabling pixel-level processing in any transformer-based SR model. To address the significant computational demands under the traditional self-attention mechanism, we employ the TaylorShift attention mechanism, a memory-efficient alternative based on Taylor series expansion, achieving full token-to-token interactions with linear complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art SR performance while reducing memory consumption by up to 60% compared to traditional self-attention-based transformers.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, with their impressive generative capabilities, have been adopted for image editing tasks, demonstrating remarkable efficacy. However, due to attention leakage and collision between the cross-attention map of the object and the new color attribute from the text prompt, text-guided image editing methods may fail to change the color of an object, resulting in a misalignment between the resulting image and the text prompt. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis on the process of text-guided image synthesizing and what semantic information different cross-attention blocks have learned. We observe that the visual representation of an object is determined in the up-block of the diffusion model in the early stage of the denoising process, and color adjustment can be achieved through value matrices alignment in the cross-attention layer. Based on our findings, we propose a straightforward, yet stable, and effective image-guided method to modify the color of an object without requiring any additional fine-tuning or training. Lastly, we present a benchmark dataset called COLORBENCH, the first benchmark to evaluate the performance of color change methods. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in object-level color editing and surpass the performance of popular text-guided image editing approaches in both synthesized and real images.

- **Summary**: In clinical medicine, precise image segmentation can provide substantial support to clinicians. However, achieving such precision often requires a large amount of finely annotated data, which can be costly. Scribble annotation presents a more efficient alternative, boosting labeling efficiency. However, utilizing such minimal supervision for medical image segmentation training, especially with scribble annotations, poses significant challenges. To address these challenges, we introduce ScribbleVS, a novel framework that leverages scribble annotations. We introduce a Regional Pseudo Labels Diffusion Module to expand the scope of supervision and reduce the impact of noise present in pseudo labels. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Competitive Selection module for enhanced refinement in selecting pseudo labels. Experiments conducted on the ACDC and MSCMRseg datasets have demonstrated promising results, achieving performance levels that even exceed those of fully supervised methodologies.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) face inherent challenges in image matting, particularly in preserving fine structural details. ViTs, with their global receptive field enabled by the self-attention mechanism, often lose local details such as hair strands. Conversely, CNNs, constrained by their local receptive field, rely on deeper layers to approximate global context but struggle to retain fine structures at greater depths.   To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Morpho-Aware Global Attention (MAGA) mechanism, designed to effectively capture the morphology of fine structures. MAGA employs Tetris-like convolutional patterns to align the local shapes of fine structures, ensuring optimal local correspondence while maintaining sensitivity to morphological details. The extracted local morphology information is used as query embeddings, which are projected onto global key embeddings to emphasize local details in a broader context. Subsequently, by projecting onto value embeddings, MAGA seamlessly integrates these emphasized morphological details into a unified global structure.   This approach enables MAGA to simultaneously focus on local morphology and unify these details into a coherent whole, effectively preserving fine structures. Extensive experiments show that our MAGA-based ViT achieves significant performance gains, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across two benchmarks with average improvements of 4.3% in SAD and 39.5% in MSE.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at descriptive tasks within images but often struggle with precise object localization, a critical element for reliable visual interpretation. In contrast, traditional object detection models provide high localization accuracy but frequently generate detections lacking contextual coherence due to limited modeling of inter-object relationships. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the \textbf{Visual-Linguistic Agent (VLA), a collaborative framework that combines the relational reasoning strengths of MLLMs with the precise localization capabilities of traditional object detectors. In the VLA paradigm, the MLLM serves as a central Linguistic Agent, working collaboratively with specialized Vision Agents for object detection and classification. The Linguistic Agent evaluates and refines detections by reasoning over spatial and contextual relationships among objects, while the classification Vision Agent offers corrective feedback to improve classification accuracy. This collaborative approach enables VLA to significantly enhance both spatial reasoning and object localization, addressing key challenges in multimodal understanding. Extensive evaluations on the COCO dataset demonstrate substantial performance improvements across multiple detection models, highlighting VLA's potential to set a new benchmark in accurate and contextually coherent object detection.

- **Summary**: Guidance is an error-correcting technique used to improve the perceptual quality of images generated by diffusion models. Typically, the correction is achieved by linear extrapolation, using an auxiliary diffusion model that has lower performance than the primary model. Using a 2D toy example, we show that it is highly beneficial when the auxiliary model exhibits similar errors as the primary one but stronger. We verify this finding in higher dimensions, where we show that competitive generative performance to state-of-the-art guidance methods can be achieved when the auxiliary model differs from the primary one only by having stronger weight regularization. As an independent contribution, we investigate whether upweighting long-range spatial dependencies improves visual fidelity. The result is a novel guidance method, which we call sliding window guidance (SWG), that guides the primary model with itself by constraining its receptive field. Intriguingly, SWG aligns better with human preferences than state-of-the-art guidance methods while requiring neither training, architectural modifications, nor class conditioning. The code will be released.

- **Summary**: The task of partial scene text retrieval involves localizing and searching for text instances that are the same or similar to a given query text from an image gallery. However, existing methods can only handle text-line instances, leaving the problem of searching for partial patches within these text-line instances unsolved due to a lack of patch annotations in the training data. To address this issue, we propose a network that can simultaneously retrieve both text-line instances and their partial patches. Our method embeds the two types of data (query text and scene text instances) into a shared feature space and measures their cross-modal similarities. To handle partial patches, our proposed approach adopts a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach to learn their similarities with query text, without requiring extra annotations. However, constructing bags, which is a standard step of conventional MIL approaches, can introduce numerous noisy samples for training, and lower inference speed. To address this issue, we propose a Ranking MIL (RankMIL) approach to adaptively filter those noisy samples. Additionally, we present a Dynamic Partial Match Algorithm (DPMA) that can directly search for the target partial patch from a text-line instance during the inference stage, without requiring bags. This greatly improves the search efficiency and the performance of retrieving partial patches. The source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/lanfeng4659/PSTR.

- **Summary**: Model interpretability is a key challenge that has yet to align with the advancements observed in contemporary state-of-the-art deep learning models. In particular, deep learning aided vision tasks require interpretability, in order for their adoption in more specialized domains such as medical imaging. Although the field of explainable AI (XAI) developed methods for interpreting vision models along with early convolutional neural networks, recent XAI research has mainly focused on assigning attributes via saliency maps. As such, these methods are restricted to providing explanations at a sample level, and many explainability methods suffer from low adaptability across a wide range of vision models. In our work, we re-think vision-model explainability from a novel perspective, to probe the general input structure that a model has learnt during its training. To this end, we ask the question: "How would a vision model fill-in a masked-image". Experiments on standard vision datasets and pre-trained models reveal consistent patterns, and could be intergrated as an additional model-agnostic explainability tool in modern machine-learning platforms.

- **Summary**: We present a coarse-to-fine neural deformation model to simultaneously recover the camera pose and the 4D reconstruction of an unknown object from multiple RGB sequences in the wild. To that end, our approach does not consider any pre-built 3D template nor 3D training data as well as controlled illumination conditions, and can sort out the problem in a self-supervised manner. Our model exploits canonical and image-variant spaces where both coarse and fine components are considered. We introduce a neural local quadratic model with spatio-temporal consistency to encode fine details that is combined with canonical embeddings in order to establish correspondences across sequences. We thoroughly validate the method on challenging scenarios with complex and real-world deformations, providing both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, an ablation study and a comparison with respect to competing approaches.

- **Summary**: In language processing, transformers benefit greatly from text being condensed. This is achieved through a larger vocabulary that captures word fragments instead of plain characters. This is often done with Byte Pair Encoding. In the context of images, tokenisation of visual data is usually limited to regular grids obtained from quantisation methods, without global content awareness. Our work improves tokenisation of visual data by bringing Byte Pair Encoding from 1D to multiple dimensions, as a complementary add-on to existing compression. We achieve this through counting constellations of token pairs and replacing the most frequent token pair with a newly introduced token. The multidimensionality only increases the computation time by a factor of 2 for images, making it applicable even to large datasets like ImageNet within minutes on consumer hardware. This is a lossless preprocessing step. Our evaluation shows improved training and inference performance of transformers on visual data achieved by compressing frequent constellations of tokens: The resulting sequences are shorter, with more uniformly distributed information content, e.g. condensing empty regions in an image into single tokens. As our experiments show, these condensed sequences are easier to process. We additionally introduce a strategy to amplify this compression further by clustering the vocabulary.

- **Summary**: Indoor radar perception has seen rising interest due to affordable costs driven by emerging automotive imaging radar developments and the benefits of reduced privacy concerns and reliability under hazardous conditions (e.g., fire and smoke). However, existing radar perception pipelines fail to account for distinctive characteristics of the multi-view radar setting. In this paper, we propose Radar dEtection TRansformer (RETR), an extension of the popular DETR architecture, tailored for multi-view radar perception. RETR inherits the advantages of DETR, eliminating the need for hand-crafted components for object detection and segmentation in the image plane. More importantly, RETR incorporates carefully designed modifications such as 1) depth-prioritized feature similarity via a tunable positional encoding (TPE); 2) a tri-plane loss from both radar and camera coordinates; and 3) a learnable radar-to-camera transformation via reparameterization, to account for the unique multi-view radar setting. Evaluated on two indoor radar perception datasets, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 15.38+ AP for object detection and 11.77+ IoU for instance segmentation, respectively.

- **Summary**: Collimator detection remains a challenging task in X-ray systems with unreliable or non-available information about the detectors position relative to the source. This paper presents a physically motivated image processing pipeline for simulating the characteristics of collimator shadows in X-ray images. By generating randomized labels for collimator shapes and locations, incorporating scattered radiation simulation, and including Poisson noise, the pipeline enables the expansion of limited datasets for training deep neural networks. We validate the proposed pipeline by a qualitative and quantitative comparison against real collimator shadows. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that utilizing simulated data within our deep learning framework not only serves as a suitable substitute for actual collimators but also enhances the generalization performance when applied to real-world data.

- **Summary**: Current image stitching methods often produce noticeable seams in challenging scenarios such as uneven hue and large parallax. To tackle this problem, we propose the Reference-Driven Inpainting Stitcher (RDIStitcher), which reformulates the image fusion and rectangling as a reference-based inpainting model, incorporating a larger modification fusion area and stronger modification intensity than previous methods. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised model training method, which enables the implementation of RDIStitcher without requiring labeled data by fine-tuning a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model. Recognizing difficulties in assessing the quality of stitched images, we present the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)-based metrics, offering a new perspective on evaluating stitched image quality. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances content coherence and seamless transitions in the stitched images. Especially in the zero-shot experiments, our method exhibits strong generalization capabilities. Code: https://github.com/yayoyo66/RDIStitcher

- **Summary**: Autonomous vehicles require road information for their operation, usually in form of HD maps. Since offline maps eventually become outdated or may only be partially available, online HD map construction methods have been proposed to infer map information from live sensor data. A key issue remains how to exploit such partial or outdated map information as a prior. We introduce M3TR (Multi-Masking Map Transformer), a generalist approach for HD map construction both with and without map priors. We address shortcomings in ground truth generation for Argoverse 2 and nuScenes and propose the first realistic scenarios with semantically diverse map priors. Examining various query designs, we use an improved method for integrating prior map elements into a HD map construction model, increasing performance by +4.3 mAP. Finally, we show that training across all prior scenarios yields a single Generalist model, whose performance is on par with previous Expert models that can handle only one specific type of map prior. M3TR thus is the first model capable of leveraging variable map priors, making it suitable for real-world deployment. Code is available at https://github.com/immel-f/m3tr

- **Summary**: Atmospheric turbulence introduces severe spatial and geometric distortions, challenging traditional image restoration methods. We propose the Probabilistic Prior Turbulence Removal Network (PPTRN), which combines probabilistic diffusion-based prior modeling with Transformer-driven feature extraction to address this issue. PPTRN employs a two-stage approach: first, a latent encoder and Transformer are jointly trained on clear images to establish robust feature representations. Then, a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) models prior distributions over latent vectors, guiding the Transformer in capturing diverse feature variations essential for restoration. A key innovation in PPTRN is the Probabilistic Prior Driven Cross Attention mechanism, which integrates the DDPM-generated prior with feature embeddings to reduce artifacts and enhance spatial coherence. Extensive experiments validate that PPTRN significantly improves restoration quality on turbulence-degraded images, setting a new benchmark in clarity and structural fidelity.

- **Summary**: Early detection of melanoma is crucial for improving survival rates. Current detection tools often utilize data-driven machine learning methods but often overlook the full integration of multiple datasets. We combine publicly available datasets to enhance data diversity, allowing numerous experiments to train and evaluate various classifiers. We then calibrate them to minimize misdiagnoses by incorporating uncertainty quantification. Our experiments on benchmark datasets show accuracies of up to 93.2% before and 97.8% after applying uncertainty-based rejection, leading to a reduction in misdiagnoses by over 40.5%. Our code and data are publicly available, and a web-based interface for quick melanoma detection of user-supplied images is also provided.

- **Summary**: Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) have made remarkable advancements in comprehending video content for QA dialogue. However, they struggle to extend this visual understanding to tasks requiring precise temporal localization, known as Video Temporal Grounding (VTG). To address this gap, we introduce Number-Prompt (NumPro), a novel method that empowers Vid-LLMs to bridge visual comprehension with temporal grounding by adding unique numerical identifiers to each video frame. Treating a video as a sequence of numbered frame images, NumPro transforms VTG into an intuitive process: flipping through manga panels in sequence. This allows Vid-LLMs to "read" event timelines, accurately linking visual content with corresponding temporal information. Our experiments demonstrate that NumPro significantly boosts VTG performance of top-tier Vid-LLMs without additional computational cost. Furthermore, fine-tuning on a NumPro-enhanced dataset defines a new state-of-the-art for VTG, surpassing previous top-performing methods by up to 6.9\% in mIoU for moment retrieval and 8.5\% in mAP for highlight detection. The code will be available at https://github.com/yongliang-wu/NumPro.

- **Summary**: Radiologists and doctors make use of X-ray images of the non-dominant hands of children and infants to assess the possibility of genetic conditions and growth abnormalities. This is done by assessing the difference between the actual extent of growth found using the X-rays and the chronological age of the subject. The assessment was done conventionally using The Greulich Pyle (GP) or Tanner Whitehouse (TW) approach. These approaches require a high level of expertise and may often lead to observer bias. Hence, to automate the process of assessing the X-rays, and to increase its accuracy and efficiency, several machine learning models have been developed. These machine-learning models have several differences in their accuracy and efficiencies, leading to an unclear choice for the suitable model depending on their needs and available resources. Methods: In this study, we have analyzed the 3 most widely used models for the automation of bone age prediction, which are the Xception model, VGG model and CNN model. These models were trained on the preprocessed dataset and the accuracy was measured using the MAE in terms of months for each model. Using this, the comparison between the models was done. Results: The 3 models, Xception, VGG, and CNN models have been tested for accuracy and other relevant factors.

- **Summary**: Dense prediction is a critical task in computer vision. However, previous methods often require extensive computational resources, which hinders their real-world application. In this paper, we propose BiDense, a generalized binary neural network (BNN) designed for efficient and accurate dense prediction tasks. BiDense incorporates two key techniques: the Distribution-adaptive Binarizer (DAB) and the Channel-adaptive Full-precision Bypass (CFB). The DAB adaptively calculates thresholds and scaling factors for binarization, effectively retaining more information within BNNs. Meanwhile, the CFB facilitates full-precision bypassing for binary convolutional layers undergoing various channel size transformations, which enhances the propagation of real-valued signals and minimizes information loss. By leveraging these techniques, BiDense preserves more real-valued information, enabling more accurate and detailed dense predictions in BNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves performance levels comparable to full-precision models while significantly reducing memory usage and computational costs.

- **Summary**: The current vision-based aphid counting methods in water traps suffer from undercounts caused by occlusions and low visibility arising from dense aggregation of insects and other objects. To address this problem, we propose a novel aphid counting method through interactive stirring actions. We use interactive stirring to alter the distribution of aphids in the yellow water trap and capture a sequence of images which are then used for aphid detection and counting through an optimized small object detection network based on Yolov5. We also propose a counting confidence evaluation system to evaluate the confidence of count-ing results. The final counting result is a weighted sum of the counting results from all sequence images based on the counting confidence. Experimental results show that our proposed aphid detection network significantly outperforms the original Yolov5, with improvements of 33.9% in AP@0.5 and 26.9% in AP@[0.5:0.95] on the aphid test set. In addition, the aphid counting test results using our proposed counting confidence evaluation system show significant improvements over the static counting method, closely aligning with manual counting results.

- **Summary**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of neural networks that have been widely used in the field of image-to-image translation. In this paper, we propose a streamlined image-to-image translation network with a simpler architecture compared to existing models. We investigate the relationship between GANs and autoencoders and provide an explanation for the efficacy of employing only the GAN component for tasks involving image translation. We show that adversarial for GAN models yields results comparable to those of existing methods without additional complex loss penalties. Subsequently, we elucidate the rationale behind this phenomenon. We also incorporate experimental results to demonstrate the validity of our findings.

- **Summary**: Recent diffusion-based Single-image 3D portrait generation methods typically employ 2D diffusion models to provide multi-view knowledge, which is then distilled into 3D representations. However, these methods usually struggle to produce high-fidelity 3D models, frequently yielding excessively blurred textures. We attribute this issue to the insufficient consideration of cross-view consistency during the diffusion process, resulting in significant disparities between different views and ultimately leading to blurred 3D representations. In this paper, we address this issue by comprehensively exploiting multi-view priors in both the conditioning and diffusion procedures to produce consistent, detail-rich portraits. From the conditioning standpoint, we propose a Hybrid Priors Diffsion model, which explicitly and implicitly incorporates multi-view priors as conditions to enhance the status consistency of the generated multi-view portraits. From the diffusion perspective, considering the significant impact of the diffusion noise distribution on detailed texture generation, we propose a Multi-View Noise Resamplig Strategy integrated within the optimization process leveraging cross-view priors to enhance representation consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can produce 3D portraits with accurate geometry and rich details from a single image.

- **Summary**: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the leading cause of severe non-traumatic disability in young adults and its incidence is increasing worldwide. The variability of gait impairment in MS necessitates the development of a non-invasive, sensitive, and cost-effective tool for quantitative gait evaluation. The eGait movement sensor, designed to characterize human gait through unit quaternion time series (QTS) representing hip rotations, is a promising approach. However, the small sample sizes typical of clinical studies pose challenges for the stability of gait data analysis tools. To address these challenges, this article presents two key scientific contributions. First, a comprehensive framework is proposed for transforming QTS data into a form that preserves the essential geometric properties of gait while enabling the use of any tabular synthetic data generation method. Second, a synthetic data generation method is introduced, based on nearest neighbors weighting, which produces high-fidelity synthetic QTS data suitable for small datasets and private data environments. The effectiveness of the proposed method, is demonstrated through its application to MS gait data, showing very good fidelity and respect of the initial geometry of the data. Thanks to this work, we are able to produce synthetic data sets and work on the stability of clustering methods.

- **Summary**: Internal crack detection has been a subject of focus in structural health monitoring. By focusing on crack detection in structural datasets, it is demonstrated that deep learning (DL) methods can effectively analyze seismic wave fields interacting with micro-scale cracks, which are beyond the resolution of conventional visual inspection. This work explores a novel application of DL-based key point detection technique, where cracks are localized by predicting the coordinates of four key points that define a bounding region of the crack. The study not only opens new research directions for non-visual applications but also effectively mitigates the impact of imbalanced data which poses a challenge for previous DL models, as it can be biased toward predicting the majority class (non-crack regions). Popular DL techniques, such as the Inception blocks, are used and investigated. The model shows an overall reduction in loss when applied to micro-scale crack detection and is reflected in the lower average deviation between the location of actual and predicted cracks, with an average Intersection over Union (IoU) being 0.511 for all micro cracks (greater than 0.00 micrometers) and 0.631 for larger micro cracks (greater than 4 micrometers).

- **Summary**: In recent years, machine learning (ML) based reconstruction has been widely investigated and employed in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. ML-based reconstructions can deliver clinically acceptable image quality under substantially accelerated scans. ML-based reconstruction, however, also requires substantial data and computational time to train the neural network, which is often optimized for a fixed acceleration rate or image contrast. In practice, imaging parameters are often tuned to best suit the diagnosis, which may differ from the training data. This can result in degraded image quality, and multiple trained networks are needed to fulfill the clinical demands. In this study, we propose a foundation model that uses adaptive unrolling, channel-shifting, and Pattern and Contrast-Prompt-UNet (PCP-UNet) to tackle the problem. In particular, the undersampled data goes through a different number of unrolled iterations according to its acceleration rate. Channel-shifting improves reconstructed data quality. The PCP-UNet is equipped with an image contrast and sampling pattern prompt. In vivo CMR experiments were performed using mixed combinations of image contrasts, acceleration rates, and (under)sampling patterns. The proposed foundation model has significantly improved image quality for a wide range of CMR protocols and outperforms the conventional ML-based method.

- **Summary**: Recent progress in interactive point prompt based Image Segmentation allows to significantly reduce the manual effort to obtain high quality semantic labels. State-of-the-art unsupervised methods use self-supervised pre-trained models to obtain pseudo-labels which are used in training a prompt-based segmentation model. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised and training-free approach based solely on the self-attention of Stable Diffusion. We interpret the self-attention tensor as a Markov transition operator, which enables us to iteratively construct a Markov chain. Pixel-wise counting of the required number of iterations along the Markov-chain to reach a relative probability threshold yields a Markov-iteration-map, which we simply call a Markov-map. Compared to the raw attention maps, we show that our proposed Markov-map has less noise, sharper semantic boundaries and more uniform values within semantically similar regions. We integrate the Markov-map in a simple yet effective truncated nearest neighbor framework to obtain interactive point prompt based segmentation. Despite being training-free, we experimentally show that our approach yields excellent results in terms of Number of Clicks (NoC), even outperforming state-of-the-art training based unsupervised methods in most of the datasets.

- **Summary**: We introduce Llama Guard 3 Vision, a multimodal LLM-based safeguard for human-AI conversations that involves image understanding: it can be used to safeguard content for both multimodal LLM inputs (prompt classification) and outputs (response classification). Unlike the previous text-only Llama Guard versions (Inan et al., 2023; Llama Team, 2024b,a), it is specifically designed to support image reasoning use cases and is optimized to detect harmful multimodal (text and image) prompts and text responses to these prompts. Llama Guard 3 Vision is fine-tuned on Llama 3.2-Vision and demonstrates strong performance on the internal benchmarks using the MLCommons taxonomy. We also test its robustness against adversarial attacks. We believe that Llama Guard 3 Vision serves as a good starting point to build more capable and robust content moderation tools for human-AI conversation with multimodal capabilities.

- **Summary**: There exists recent work in computer vision, named VAR, that proposes a new autoregressive paradigm for image generation. Diverging from the vanilla next-token prediction, VAR structurally reformulates the image generation into a coarse to fine next-scale prediction. In this paper, we show that this scale-wise autoregressive framework can be effectively decoupled into \textit{intra-scale modeling}, which captures local spatial dependencies within each scale, and \textit{inter-scale modeling}, which models cross-scale relationships progressively from coarse-to-fine scales. This decoupling structure allows to rebuild VAR in a more computationally efficient manner. Specifically, for intra-scale modeling -- crucial for generating high-fidelity images -- we retain the original bidirectional self-attention design to ensure comprehensive modeling; for inter-scale modeling, which semantically connects different scales but is computationally intensive, we apply linear-complexity mechanisms like Mamba to substantially reduce computational overhead. We term this new framework M-VAR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models in both image quality and generation speed. For example, our 1.5B model, with fewer parameters and faster inference speed, outperforms the largest VAR-d30-2B. Moreover, our largest model M-VAR-d32 impressively registers 1.78 FID on ImageNet 256$\times$256 and outperforms the prior-art autoregressive models LlamaGen/VAR by 0.4/0.19 and popular diffusion models LDM/DiT by 1.82/0.49, respectively.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are known to hallucinate, which limits their practical applications. Recent works have attempted to apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance the performance of MLLMs, but have shown inconsistent improvements in mitigating hallucinations. To address this issue more effectively, we introduce Hallucination-targeted Direct Preference Optimization (HDPO) to reduce hallucinations in MLLMs. Unlike previous approaches, our method tackles hallucinations from their diverse forms and causes. Specifically, we develop three types of preference pair data targeting the following causes of MLLM hallucinations: (1) insufficient visual capabilities, (2) long context generation, and (3) multimodal conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple hallucination evaluation datasets, surpassing most state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and highlighting the potential of our approach. Ablation studies and in-depth analyses further confirm the effectiveness of our method and suggest the potential for further improvements through scaling up.

- **Summary**: Large language models have demonstrated substantial advancements in reasoning capabilities, particularly through inference-time scaling, as illustrated by models such as OpenAI's o1. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-o1, a novel VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-o1 independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-o1 to achieve marked improvements in precision on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we compile the LLaVA-o1-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose an inference-time stage-level beam search method, which enables effective inference-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and a simple yet effective inference time scaling method, LLaVA-o1 not only outperforms its base model by 8.9% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct.

- **Summary**: Existing open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generally follow a training process involving pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. However, these models suffer from distribution shifts, which limit their multimodal reasoning, particularly in the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) performance. To address this, we introduce a preference optimization (PO) process to enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Specifically, (1) on the data side, we design an automated preference data construction pipeline to create MMPR, a high-quality, large-scale multimodal reasoning preference dataset. and (2) on the model side, we explore integrating PO with MLLMs, developing a simple yet effective method, termed Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO), which boosts multimodal CoT performance. Our approach demonstrates improved performance across multiple benchmarks, particularly in multimodal reasoning tasks. Notably, our model, InternVL2-8B-MPO, achieves an accuracy of 67.0 on MathVista, outperforming InternVL2-8B by 8.7 points and achieving performance comparable to the 10x larger InternVL2-76B. We hope this study could inspire further advancements in MLLMs. Code, data, and model shall be publicly released.
