- **Summary**: Our work tackles the fundamental challenge of image segmentation in computer vision, which is crucial for diverse applications. While supervised methods demonstrate proficiency, their reliance on extensive pixel-level annotations limits scalability. In response to this challenge, we present an enhanced unsupervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based algorithm called DynaSeg. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on a fixed weight factor to balance feature similarity and spatial continuity, requiring manual adjustments, our novel, dynamic weighting scheme automates parameter tuning, adapting flexibly to image details. We also introduce the novel concept of a Silhouette Score Phase that addresses the challenge of dynamic clustering during iterations. Additionally, our methodology integrates both CNN-based and pre-trained ResNet feature extraction, offering a comprehensive and adaptable approach. We achieve state-of-the-art results on diverse datasets, with a notable 12.2% and 14.12% mIOU improvement compared to the current benchmarks on COCO-All and COCO-Stuff, respectively. The proposed approach unlocks the potential for unsupervised image segmentation and addresses scalability concerns in real-world scenarios by obviating the need for meticulous parameter tuning.

- **Summary**: A comprehensive and reliable survival prediction model is of great importance to assist in the personalized management of Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) patients treated with curative Radiation Therapy (RT). In this work, we propose IMLSP, an Interpretable Multi-Label multi-modal deep Survival Prediction framework for predicting multiple HNC survival outcomes simultaneously and provide time-event specific visual explanation of the deep prediction process. We adopt Multi-Task Logistic Regression (MTLR) layers to convert survival prediction from a regression problem to a multi-time point classification task, and to enable predicting of multiple relevant survival outcomes at the same time. We also present Grad-TEAM, a Gradient-weighted Time-Event Activation Mapping approach specifically developed for deep survival model visual explanation, to generate patient-specific time-to-event activation maps. We evaluate our method with the publicly available RADCURE HNC dataset, where it outperforms the corresponding single-modal models and single-label models on all survival outcomes. The generated activation maps show that the model focuses primarily on the tumor and nodal volumes when making the decision and the volume of interest varies for high- and low-risk patients. We demonstrate that the multi-label learning strategy can improve the learning efficiency and prognostic performance, while the interpretable survival prediction model is promising to help understand the decision-making process of AI and facilitate personalized treatment.

- **Summary**: Stereo image super-resolution utilizes the cross-view complementary information brought by the disparity effect of left and right perspective images to reconstruct higher-quality images. Cascading feature extraction modules and cross-view feature interaction modules to make use of the information from stereo images is the focus of numerous methods. However, this adds a great deal of network parameters and structural redundancy. To facilitate the application of stereo image super-resolution in downstream tasks, we propose an efficient Multi-Level Feature Fusion Network for Lightweight Stereo Image Super-Resolution (MFFSSR). Specifically, MFFSSR utilizes the Hybrid Attention Feature Extraction Block (HAFEB) to extract multi-level intra-view features. Using the channel separation strategy, HAFEB can efficiently interact with the embedded cross-view interaction module. This structural configuration can efficiently mine features inside the view while improving the efficiency of cross-view information sharing. Hence, reconstruct image details and textures more accurately. Abundant experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MFFSSR. We achieve superior performance with fewer parameters.

- **Summary**: To defend deep neural networks from adversarial attacks, adversarial training has been drawing increasing attention for its effectiveness. However, the accuracy and robustness resulting from the adversarial training are limited by the architecture, because adversarial training improves accuracy and robustness by adjusting the weight connection affiliated to the architecture. In this work, we propose ARNAS to search for accurate and robust architectures for adversarial training. First we design an accurate and robust search space, in which the placement of the cells and the proportional relationship of the filter numbers are carefully determined. With the design, the architectures can obtain both accuracy and robustness by deploying accurate and robust structures to their sensitive positions, respectively. Then we propose a differentiable multi-objective search strategy, performing gradient descent towards directions that are beneficial for both natural loss and adversarial loss, thus the accuracy and robustness can be guaranteed at the same time. We conduct comprehensive experiments in terms of white-box attacks, black-box attacks, and transferability. Experimental results show that the searched architecture has the strongest robustness with the competitive accuracy, and breaks the traditional idea that NAS-based architectures cannot transfer well to complex tasks in robustness scenarios. By analyzing outstanding architectures searched, we also conclude that accurate and robust neural architectures tend to deploy different structures near the input and output, which has great practical significance on both hand-crafting and automatically designing of accurate and robust architectures.

- **Summary**: Temporal information plays a pivotal role in Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) driving scene understanding, which can alleviate the visual information sparsity. However, the indiscriminate temporal fusion method will cause the barrier of feature redundancy when constructing vectorized High-Definition (HD) maps. In this paper, we revisit the temporal fusion of vectorized HD maps, focusing on temporal instance consistency and temporal map consistency learning. To improve the representation of instances in single-frame maps, we introduce a novel method, DTCLMapper. This approach uses a dual-stream temporal consistency learning module that combines instance embedding with geometry maps. In the instance embedding component, our approach integrates temporal Instance Consistency Learning (ICL), ensuring consistency from vector points and instance features aggregated from points. A vectorized points pre-selection module is employed to enhance the regression efficiency of vector points from each instance. Then aggregated instance features obtained from the vectorized points preselection module are grounded in contrastive learning to realize temporal consistency, where positive and negative samples are selected based on position and semantic information. The geometry mapping component introduces Map Consistency Learning (MCL) designed with self-supervised learning. The MCL enhances the generalization capability of our consistent learning approach by concentrating on the global location and distribution constraints of the instances. Extensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks indicate that the proposed DTCLMapper achieves state-of-the-art performance in vectorized mapping tasks, reaching 61.9% and 65.1% mAP scores on the nuScenes and Argoverse datasets, respectively. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/lynn-yu/DTCLMapper.

- **Summary**: Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) left ventricular assessment protocols are important for detecting ischemia in high-risk patients. To quantitatively measure myocardial function, clinicians depend on commercially available solutions to segment and reorient the left ventricle (LV) for evaluation. Based on large normal datasets, the segmentation performance and the high price of these solutions can hinder the availability of reliable and precise localization of the LV delineation. To overcome the aforementioned shortcomings this paper aims to give a recipe for diagnostic centers as well as for clinics to automatically segment the myocardium based on small and low-quality labels on reconstructed SPECT, complete field-of-view (FOV) volumes. A combination of Continuous Max-Flow (CMF) with prior shape information is developed to augment the 3D U-Net self-supervised learning (SSL) approach on various geometries of SPECT apparatus. Experimental results on the acquired dataset have shown a 5-10\% increase in quantitative metrics based on the previous State-of-the-Art (SOTA) solutions, suggesting a good plausible way to tackle the few-shot SSL problem on high-noise SPECT cardiac datasets.

- **Summary**: Temporal grounding is crucial in multimodal learning, but it poses challenges when applied to animal behavior data due to the sparsity and uniform distribution of moments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Positional Recovery Training framework (Port), which prompts the model with the start and end times of specific animal behaviors during training. Specifically, Port enhances the baseline model with a Recovering part to predict flipped label sequences and align distributions with a Dual-alignment method. This allows the model to focus on specific temporal regions prompted by ground-truth information. Extensive experiments on the Animal Kingdom dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of Port, achieving an IoU@0.3 of 38.52. It emerges as one of the top performers in the sub-track of MMVRAC in ICME 2024 Grand Challenges.

- **Summary**: Vision-language pre-trained (VLP) models have been the foundation of numerous vision-language tasks. Given their prevalence, it becomes imperative to assess their adversarial robustness, especially when deploying them in security-crucial real-world applications. Traditionally, adversarial perturbations generated for this assessment target specific VLP models, datasets, and/or downstream tasks. This practice suffers from low transferability and additional computation costs when transitioning to new scenarios.   In this work, we thoroughly investigate whether VLP models are commonly sensitive to imperceptible perturbations of a specific pattern for the image modality. To this end, we propose a novel black-box method to generate Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), which is so called the Effective and T ransferable Universal Adversarial Attack (ETU), aiming to mislead a variety of existing VLP models in a range of downstream tasks. The ETU comprehensively takes into account the characteristics of UAPs and the intrinsic cross-modal interactions to generate effective UAPs. Under this regime, the ETU encourages both global and local utilities of UAPs. This benefits the overall utility while reducing interactions between UAP units, improving the transferability. To further enhance the effectiveness and transferability of UAPs, we also design a novel data augmentation method named ScMix. ScMix consists of self-mix and cross-mix data transformations, which can effectively increase the multi-modal data diversity while preserving the semantics of the original data. Through comprehensive experiments on various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method is able to achieve effective and transferrable universal adversarial attacks.

- **Summary**: Malnutrition among newborns is a top public health concern in developing countries. Identification and subsequent growth monitoring are key to successful interventions. However, this is challenging in rural communities where health systems tend to be inaccessible and under-equipped, with poor adherence to protocol. Our goal is to equip health workers and public health systems with a solution for contactless newborn anthropometry in the community.   We propose NurtureNet, a multi-task model that fuses visual information (a video taken with a low-cost smartphone) with tabular inputs to regress multiple anthropometry estimates including weight, length, head circumference, and chest circumference. We show that visual proxy tasks of segmentation and keypoint prediction further improve performance. We establish the efficacy of the model through several experiments and achieve a relative error of 3.9% and mean absolute error of 114.3 g for weight estimation. Model compression to 15 MB also allows offline deployment to low-cost smartphones.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in generative models have significantly impacted content creation, leading to the emergence of Personalized Content Synthesis (PCS). With a small set of user-provided examples, PCS aims to customize the subject of interest to specific user-defined prompts. Over the past two years, more than 150 methods have been proposed. However, existing surveys mainly focus on text-to-image generation, with few providing up-to-date summaries on PCS. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of PCS, with a particular focus on the diffusion models. Specifically, we introduce the generic frameworks of PCS research, which can be broadly classified into optimization-based and learning-based approaches. We further categorize and analyze these methodologies, discussing their strengths, limitations, and key techniques. Additionally, we delve into specialized tasks within the field, such as personalized object generation, face synthesis, and style personalization, highlighting their unique challenges and innovations. Despite encouraging progress, we also present an analysis of the challenges such as overfitting and the trade-off between subject fidelity and text alignment. Through this detailed overview and analysis, we propose future directions to advance the development of PCS.

- **Summary**: Object detection plays an important role in various fields. Developing detection models for 2D objects that experience rotation and texture variations is a challenge. In this research, the initial stage of the proposed model integrates the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and local binary patterns (LBP) texture feature extraction to obtain feature vectors. The next stage is classifying features using k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and random forest (RF), as well as voting ensemble (VE). System testing used a dataset of 4,437 2D images, the results for KNN accuracy were 92.7% and F1-score 92.5%, while RF performance was lower. Although GLCM features improve performance on both algorithms, KNN is more consistent. The VE approach provides the best performance with an accuracy of 93.9% and an F1 score of 93.8%, this shows the effectiveness of the ensemble technique in increasing object detection accuracy. This study contributes to the field of object detection with a new approach combining GLCM and LBP as feature vectors as well as VE for classification

- **Summary**: Interaction intention anticipation aims to jointly predict future hand trajectories and interaction hotspots. Existing research often treated trajectory forecasting and interaction hotspots prediction as separate tasks or solely considered the impact of trajectories on interaction hotspots, which led to the accumulation of prediction errors over time. However, a deeper inherent connection exists between hand trajectories and interaction hotspots, which allows for continuous mutual correction between them. Building upon this relationship, a novel Bidirectional prOgressive Transformer (BOT), which introduces a Bidirectional Progressive mechanism into the anticipation of interaction intention is established. Initially, BOT maximizes the utilization of spatial information from the last observation frame through the Spatial-Temporal Reconstruction Module, mitigating conflicts arising from changes of view in first-person videos. Subsequently, based on two independent prediction branches, a Bidirectional Progressive Enhancement Module is introduced to mutually improve the prediction of hand trajectories and interaction hotspots over time to minimize error accumulation. Finally, acknowledging the intrinsic randomness in human natural behavior, we employ a Trajectory Stochastic Unit and a C-VAE to introduce appropriate uncertainty to trajectories and interaction hotspots, respectively. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets Epic-Kitchens-100, EGO4D, and EGTEA Gaze+, demonstrating superior in complex scenarios.



### Towards Robust Physical-world Backdoor Attacks on Lane Detection

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based lane detection (LD) plays a critical role in autonomous driving systems, such as adaptive cruise control. However, it is vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attack methods on LD exhibit limited effectiveness in dynamic real-world scenarios, primarily because they fail to consider dynamic scene factors, including changes in driving perspectives (e.g., viewpoint transformations) and environmental conditions (e.g., weather or lighting changes). To tackle this issue, this paper introduces BadLANE, a dynamic scene adaptation backdoor attack for LD designed to withstand changes in real-world dynamic scene factors. To address the challenges posed by changing driving perspectives, we propose an amorphous trigger pattern composed of shapeless pixels. This trigger design allows the backdoor to be activated by various forms or shapes of mud spots or pollution on the road or lens, enabling adaptation to changes in vehicle observation viewpoints during driving. To mitigate the effects of environmental changes, we design a meta-learning framework to train meta-generators tailored to different environmental conditions. These generators produce meta-triggers that incorporate diverse environmental information, such as weather or lighting conditions, as the initialization of the trigger patterns for backdoor implantation, thus enabling adaptation to dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on various commonly used LD models in both digital and physical domains validate the effectiveness of our attacks, outperforming other baselines significantly (+25.15\% on average in Attack Success Rate). Our codes will be available upon paper publication.

- **Summary**: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a widely used imaging technique, however it has the limitation of long scanning time. Though previous model-based and learning-based MRI reconstruction methods have shown promising performance, most of them have not fully utilized the edge prior of MR images, and there is still much room for improvement. In this paper, we build a joint edge optimization model that not only incorporates individual regularizers specific to both the MR image and the edges, but also enforces a co-regularizer to effectively establish a stronger correlation between them. Specifically, the edge information is defined through a non-edge probability map to guide the image reconstruction during the optimization process. Meanwhile, the regularizers pertaining to images and edges are incorporated into a deep unfolding network to automatically learn their respective inherent a-priori information.Numerical experiments, consisting of multi-coil and single-coil MRI data with different sampling schemes at a variety of sampling factors, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other compared methods.

- **Summary**: Poisoning-based backdoor attacks expose vulnerabilities in the data preparation stage of deep neural network (DNN) training. The DNNs trained on the poisoned dataset will be embedded with a backdoor, making them behave well on clean data while outputting malicious predictions whenever a trigger is applied. To exploit the abundant information contained in the input data to output label mapping, our scheme utilizes the network trained from the clean dataset as a trigger generator to produce poisons that significantly raise the success rate of backdoor attacks versus conventional approaches. Specifically, we provide a new categorization of triggers inspired by the adversarial technique and develop a multi-label and multi-payload Poisoning-based backdoor attack with Positive Triggers (PPT), which effectively moves the input closer to the target label on benign classifiers. After the classifier is trained on the poisoned dataset, we can generate an input-label-aware trigger to make the infected classifier predict any given input to any target label with a high possibility. Under both dirty- and clean-label settings, we show empirically that the proposed attack achieves a high attack success rate without sacrificing accuracy across various datasets, including SVHN, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and Tiny ImageNet. Furthermore, the PPT attack can elude a variety of classical backdoor defenses, proving its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: The intrinsic capability to perceive depth of field and extract salient information by the Human Vision System (HVS) stimulates a pilot to perform manual landing over an autoland approach. However, harsh weather creates visibility hindrances, and a pilot must have a clear view of runway elements before the minimum decision altitude. To help a pilot in manual landing, a vision-based system tailored to localize runway elements likewise gets affected, especially during crosswind due to the projective distortion of aircraft camera images. To combat this, we propose to integrate a prompt-based climatic diffusion network with a weather distillation model using a novel diffusion-distillation loss. Precisely, the diffusion model synthesizes climatic-conditioned landing images, and the weather distillation model learns inverse mapping by clearing those visual degradations. Then, to tackle the crosswind landing scenario, a novel Regularized Spatial Transformer Networks (RuSTaN) learns to accurately calibrate for projective distortion using self-supervised learning, which minimizes localization error by the downstream runway object detector. Finally, we have simulated a clear-day landing scenario at the busiest airport globally to curate an image-based Aircraft Landing Dataset (AIRLAD) and experimentally validated our contributions using this dataset to benchmark the performance.

- **Summary**: Action recognition is a key technology in building interactive metaverses. With the rapid development of deep learning, methods in action recognition have also achieved great advancement. Researchers design and implement the backbones referring to multiple standpoints, which leads to the diversity of methods and encountering new challenges. This paper reviews several action recognition methods based on deep neural networks. We introduce these methods in three parts: 1) Two-Streams networks and their variants, which, specifically in this paper, use RGB video frame and optical flow modality as input; 2) 3D convolutional networks, which make efforts in taking advantage of RGB modality directly while extracting different motion information is no longer necessary; 3) Transformer-based methods, which introduce the model from natural language processing into computer vision and video understanding.

- **Summary**: Recent studies have noted an intriguing phenomenon termed Neural Collapse, that is, when the neural networks establish the right correlation between feature spaces and the training targets, their last-layer features, together with the classifier weights, will collapse into a stable and symmetric structure. In this paper, we extend the investigation of Neural Collapse to the biased datasets with imbalanced attributes. We observe that models will easily fall into the pitfall of shortcut learning and form a biased, non-collapsed feature space at the early period of training, which is hard to reverse and limits the generalization capability. To tackle the root cause of biased classification, we follow the recent inspiration of prime training, and propose an avoid-shortcut learning framework without additional training complexity. With well-designed shortcut primes based on Neural Collapse structure, the models are encouraged to skip the pursuit of simple shortcuts and naturally capture the intrinsic correlations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method induces better convergence properties during training, and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on both synthetic and real-world biased datasets.

- **Summary**: Model Inversion (MI) attacks aim to reconstruct private training data by abusing access to machine learning models. Contemporary MI attacks have achieved impressive attack performance, posing serious threats to privacy. Meanwhile, all existing MI defense methods rely on regularization that is in direct conflict with the training objective, resulting in noticeable degradation in model utility. In this work, we take a different perspective, and propose a novel and simple Transfer Learning-based Defense against Model Inversion (TL-DMI) to render MI-robust models. Particularly, by leveraging TL, we limit the number of layers encoding sensitive information from private training dataset, thereby degrading the performance of MI attack. We conduct an analysis using Fisher Information to justify our method. Our defense is remarkably simple to implement. Without bells and whistles, we show in extensive experiments that TL-DMI achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) MI robustness.

- **Summary**: We introduce a new family of minimal problems for reconstruction from multiple views. Our primary focus is a novel approach to autocalibration, a long-standing problem in computer vision. Traditional approaches to this problem, such as those based on Kruppa's equations or the modulus constraint, rely explicitly on the knowledge of multiple fundamental matrices or a projective reconstruction. In contrast, we consider a novel formulation involving constraints on image points, the unknown depths of 3D points, and a partially specified calibration matrix $K$. For $2$ and $3$ views, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of minimal autocalibration problems obtained by relaxing some of these constraints. These problems are organized into classes according to the number of views and any assumed prior knowledge of $K$. Within each class, we determine problems with the fewest -- or a relatively small number of -- solutions. From this zoo of problems, we devise three practical solvers. Experiments with synthetic and real data and interfacing our solvers with COLMAP demonstrate that we achieve superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art calibration methods.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification (USVI-ReID) presents a formidable challenge, which aims to match pedestrian images across visible and infrared modalities without any annotations. Recently, clustered pseudo-label methods have become predominant in USVI-ReID, although the inherent noise in pseudo-labels presents a significant obstacle. Most existing works primarily focus on shielding the model from the harmful effects of noise, neglecting to calibrate noisy pseudo-labels usually associated with hard samples, which will compromise the robustness of the model. To address this issue, we design a Robust Pseudo-label Learning with Neighbor Relation (RPNR) framework for USVI-ReID. To be specific, we first introduce a straightforward yet potent Noisy Pseudo-label Calibration module to correct noisy pseudo-labels. Due to the high intra-class variations, noisy pseudo-labels are difficult to calibrate completely. Therefore, we introduce a Neighbor Relation Learning module to reduce high intra-class variations by modeling potential interactions between all samples. Subsequently, we devise an Optimal Transport Prototype Matching module to establish reliable cross-modality correspondences. On that basis, we design a Memory Hybrid Learning module to jointly learn modality-specific and modality-invariant information. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two widely recognized benchmarks, SYSU-MM01 and RegDB, demonstrate that RPNR outperforms the current state-of-the-art GUR with an average Rank-1 improvement of 10.3%. The source codes will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Camouflaged object detection (COD) presents a persistent challenge in accurately identifying objects that seamlessly blend into their surroundings. However, most existing COD models overlook the fact that visual systems operate within a genuine 3D environment. The scene depth inherent in a single 2D image provides rich spatial clues that can assist in the detection of camouflaged objects. Therefore, we propose a novel depth-perception attention fusion network that leverages the depth map as an auxiliary input to enhance the network's ability to perceive 3D information, which is typically challenging for the human eye to discern from 2D images. The network uses a trident-branch encoder to extract chromatic and depth information and their communications. Recognizing that certain regions of a depth map may not effectively highlight the camouflaged object, we introduce a depth-weighted cross-attention fusion module to dynamically adjust the fusion weights on depth and RGB feature maps. To keep the model simple without compromising effectiveness, we design a straightforward feature aggregation decoder that adaptively fuses the enhanced aggregated features. Experiments demonstrate the significant superiority of our proposed method over other states of the arts, which further validates the contribution of depth information in camouflaged object detection. The code will be available at https://github.com/xinran-liu00/DAF-Net.

- **Summary**: Current solutions for efficiently constructing large vision-language (VL) models follow a two-step paradigm: projecting the output of pre-trained vision encoders to the input space of pre-trained language models as visual prompts; and then transferring the models to downstream VL tasks via end-to-end parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, this paradigm still exhibits inefficiency since it significantly increases the input length of the language models. In this paper, in contrast to integrating visual prompts into inputs, we regard visual prompts as additional knowledge that facilitates language models in addressing tasks associated with visual information. Motivated by the finding that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of language models acts as "key-value memory", we introduce a novel approach termed memory-space visual prompting (MemVP), wherein visual prompts are concatenated with the weights of FFN for visual knowledge injection. Experimental results across various VL tasks and language models reveal that MemVP significantly reduces the training time and inference latency of the finetuned VL models and surpasses the performance of previous PEFT methods.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we show two new variants of multi-view k-means (MVKM) algorithms to address multi-view data. The general idea is to outline the distance between $h$-th view data points $x_i^h$ and $h$-th view cluster centers $a_k^h$ in a different manner of centroid-based approach. Unlike other methods, our proposed methods learn the multi-view data by calculating the similarity using Euclidean norm in the space of Gaussian-kernel, namely as multi-view k-means with exponent distance (MVKM-ED). By simultaneously aligning the stabilizer parameter $p$ and kernel coefficients $\beta^h$, the compression of Gaussian-kernel based weighted distance in Euclidean norm reduce the sensitivity of MVKM-ED. To this end, this paper designated as Gaussian-kernel multi-view k-means (GKMVKM) clustering algorithm. Numerical evaluation of five real-world multi-view data demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of our proposed MVKM-ED and GKMVKM approaches.

- **Summary**: Combining face swapping with lip synchronization technology offers a cost-effective solution for customized talking face generation. However, directly cascading existing models together tends to introduce significant interference between tasks and reduce video clarity because the interaction space is limited to the low-level semantic RGB space. To address this issue, we propose an innovative unified framework, SwapTalk, which accomplishes both face swapping and lip synchronization tasks in the same latent space. Referring to recent work on face generation, we choose the VQ-embedding space due to its excellent editability and fidelity performance. To enhance the framework's generalization capabilities for unseen identities, we incorporate identity loss during the training of the face swapping module. Additionally, we introduce expert discriminator supervision within the latent space during the training of the lip synchronization module to elevate synchronization quality. In the evaluation phase, previous studies primarily focused on the self-reconstruction of lip movements in synchronous audio-visual videos. To better approximate real-world applications, we expand the evaluation scope to asynchronous audio-video scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a novel identity consistency metric to more comprehensively assess the identity consistency over time series in generated facial videos. Experimental results on the HDTF demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses existing techniques in video quality, lip synchronization accuracy, face swapping fidelity, and identity consistency. Our demo is available at http://swaptalk.cc.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we tackle the problem of grasping transparent and specular objects. This issue holds importance, yet it remains unsolved within the field of robotics due to failure of recover their accurate geometry by depth cameras. For the first time, we propose ASGrasp, a 6-DoF grasp detection network that uses an RGB-D active stereo camera. ASGrasp utilizes a two-layer learning-based stereo network for the purpose of transparent object reconstruction, enabling material-agnostic object grasping in cluttered environments. In contrast to existing RGB-D based grasp detection methods, which heavily depend on depth restoration networks and the quality of depth maps generated by depth cameras, our system distinguishes itself by its ability to directly utilize raw IR and RGB images for transparent object geometry reconstruction. We create an extensive synthetic dataset through domain randomization, which is based on GraspNet-1Billion. Our experiments demonstrate that ASGrasp can achieve over 90% success rate for generalizable transparent object grasping in both simulation and the real via seamless sim-to-real transfer. Our method significantly outperforms SOTA networks and even surpasses the performance upper bound set by perfect visible point cloud inputs.Project page: https://pku-epic.github.io/ASGrasp

- **Summary**: Purpose: Most studies evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) models that detect abnormalities in neuroimaging are either tested on unrepresentative patient cohorts or are insufficiently well-validated, leading to poor generalisability to real-world tasks. The aim was to determine the diagnostic test accuracy and summarise the evidence supporting the use of AI models performing first-line, high-volume neuroimaging tasks.   Methods: Medline, Embase, Cochrane library and Web of Science were searched until September 2021 for studies that temporally or externally validated AI capable of detecting abnormalities in first-line CT or MR neuroimaging. A bivariate random-effects model was used for meta-analysis where appropriate. PROSPERO: CRD42021269563.   Results: Only 16 studies were eligible for inclusion. Included studies were not compromised by unrepresentative datasets or inadequate validation methodology. Direct comparison with radiologists was available in 4/16 studies. 15/16 had a high risk of bias. Meta-analysis was only suitable for intracranial haemorrhage detection in CT imaging (10/16 studies), where AI systems had a pooled sensitivity and specificity 0.90 (95% CI 0.85 - 0.94) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.83 - 0.95) respectively. Other AI studies using CT and MRI detected target conditions other than haemorrhage (2/16), or multiple target conditions (4/16). Only 3/16 studies implemented AI in clinical pathways, either for pre-read triage or as post-read discrepancy identifiers.   Conclusion: The paucity of eligible studies reflects that most abnormality detection AI studies were not adequately validated in representative clinical cohorts. The few studies describing how abnormality detection AI could impact patients and clinicians did not explore the full ramifications of clinical implementation.

- **Summary**: Point-based representations have recently gained popularity in novel view synthesis, for their unique advantages, e.g., intuitive geometric representation, simple manipulation, and faster convergence. However, based on our observation, these point-based neural re-rendering methods are only expected to perform well under ideal conditions and suffer from noisy, patchy points and unbounded scenes, which are challenging to handle but defacto common in real applications. To this end, we revisit one such influential method, known as Neural Point-based Graphics (NPBG), as our baseline, and propose Robust Point-based Graphics (RPBG). We in-depth analyze the factors that prevent NPBG from achieving satisfactory renderings on generic datasets, and accordingly reform the pipeline to make it more robust to varying datasets in-the-wild. Inspired by the practices in image restoration, we greatly enhance the neural renderer to enable the attention-based correction of point visibility and the inpainting of incomplete rasterization, with only acceptable overheads. We also seek for a simple and lightweight alternative for environment modeling and an iterative method to alleviate the problem of poor geometry. By thorough evaluation on a wide range of datasets with different shooting conditions and camera trajectories, RPBG stably outperforms the baseline by a large margin, and exhibits its great robustness over state-of-the-art NeRF-based variants.

- **Summary**: In the realm of smart healthcare, researchers enhance the scale and diversity of medical datasets through medical image synthesis. However, existing methods are limited by CNN local perception and Transformer quadratic complexity, making it difficult to balance structural texture consistency. To this end, we propose the Vision Mamba DDPM (VM-DDPM) based on State Space Model (SSM), fully combining CNN local perception and SSM global modeling capabilities, while maintaining linear computational complexity. Specifically, we designed a multi-level feature extraction module called Multi-level State Space Block (MSSBlock), and a basic unit of encoder-decoder structure called State Space Layer (SSLayer) for medical pathological images. Besides, we designed a simple, Plug-and-Play, zero-parameter Sequence Regeneration strategy for the Cross-Scan Module (CSM), which enabled the S6 module to fully perceive the spatial features of the 2D image and stimulate the generalization potential of the model. To our best knowledge, this is the first medical image synthesis model based on the SSM-CNN hybrid architecture. Our experimental evaluation on three datasets of different scales, i.e., ACDC, BraTS2018, and ChestXRay, as well as qualitative evaluation by radiologists, demonstrate that VM-DDPM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Sign language serves as a non-vocal means of communication, transmitting information and significance through gestures, facial expressions, and bodily movements. The majority of current approaches for sign language recognition (SLR) and translation rely on RGB video inputs, which are vulnerable to fluctuations in the background. Employing a keypoint-based strategy not only mitigates the effects of background alterations but also substantially diminishes the computational demands of the model. Nevertheless, contemporary keypoint-based methodologies fail to fully harness the implicit knowledge embedded in keypoint sequences. To tackle this challenge, our inspiration is derived from the human cognition mechanism, which discerns sign language by analyzing the interplay between gesture configurations and supplementary elements. We propose a multi-stream keypoint attention network to depict a sequence of keypoints produced by a readily available keypoint estimator. In order to facilitate interaction across multiple streams, we investigate diverse methodologies such as keypoint fusion strategies, head fusion, and self-distillation. The resulting framework is denoted as MSKA-SLR, which is expanded into a sign language translation (SLT) model through the straightforward addition of an extra translation network. We carry out comprehensive experiments on well-known benchmarks like Phoenix-2014, Phoenix-2014T, and CSL-Daily to showcase the efficacy of our methodology. Notably, we have attained a novel state-of-the-art performance in the sign language translation task of Phoenix-2014T. The code and models can be accessed at: https://github.com/sutwangyan/MSKA.

- **Summary**: Early identification of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients who would experience significant anatomical change during radiotherapy (RT) is important to optimize patient clinical benefit and treatment resources. This study aims to assess the feasibility of using a vision-transformer (ViT) based neural network to predict RT-induced anatomic change in HNC patients. We retrospectively included 121 HNC patients treated with definitive RT/CRT. We collected the planning CT (pCT), planned dose, CBCTs acquired at the initial treatment (CBCT01) and fraction 21 (CBCT21), and primary tumor volume (GTVp) and involved nodal volume (GTVn) delineated on both pCT and CBCTs for model construction and evaluation. A UNet-style ViT network was designed to learn spatial correspondence and contextual information from embedded CT, dose, CBCT01, GTVp, and GTVn image patches. The model estimated the deformation vector field between CBCT01 and CBCT21 as the prediction of anatomic change, and deformed CBCT01 was used as the prediction of CBCT21. We also generated binary masks of GTVp, GTVn, and patient body for volumetric change evaluation. The predicted image from the proposed method yielded the best similarity to the real image (CBCT21) over pCT, CBCT01, and predicted CBCTs from other comparison models. The average MSE and SSIM between the normalized predicted CBCT to CBCT21 are 0.009 and 0.933, while the average dice coefficient between body mask, GTVp mask, and GTVn mask are 0.972, 0.792, and 0.821 respectively. The proposed method showed promising performance for predicting radiotherapy-induced anatomic change, which has the potential to assist in the decision-making of HNC Adaptive RT.

- **Summary**: Thanks to the powerful generative capacity of diffusion models, recent years have witnessed rapid progress in human motion generation. Existing diffusion-based methods employ disparate network architectures and training strategies. The effect of the design of each component is still unclear. In addition, the iterative denoising process consumes considerable computational overhead, which is prohibitive for real-time scenarios such as virtual characters and humanoid robots. For this reason, we first conduct a comprehensive investigation into network architectures, training strategies, and inference processs. Based on the profound analysis, we tailor each component for efficient high-quality human motion generation. Despite the promising performance, the tailored model still suffers from foot skating which is an ubiquitous issue in diffusion-based solutions. To eliminate footskate, we identify foot-ground contact and correct foot motions along the denoising process. By organically combining these well-designed components together, we present StableMoFusion, a robust and efficient framework for human motion generation. Extensive experimental results show that our StableMoFusion performs favorably against current state-of-the-art methods. Project page: https://h-y1heng.github.io/StableMoFusion-page/

While most existing auxiliary learning methods are optimization-based relying on loss weights/gradients manipulation, our method is architecture-based with a flexible asymmetric structure for the primary and auxiliary tasks, which produces different networks for training and inference. Specifically, starting from two single task networks/branches (each representing a task), we propose a novel method with evolving networks where only primary-to-auxiliary links exist as the cross-task connections after convergence. These connections can be removed during the primary task inference, resulting in a single-task inference cost. We achieve this by formulating a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) problem, where we initialize bi-directional connections in the search space and guide the NAS optimization converging to an architecture with only the single-side primary-to-auxiliary connections. Moreover, our method can be incorporated with optimization-based auxiliary learning approaches. Extensive experiments with six tasks on NYU v2, CityScapes, and Taskonomy datasets using VGG, ResNet, and ViT backbones validate the promising performance.

- **Summary**: While current research predominantly focuses on image-based colorization, the domain of video-based colorization remains relatively unexplored. Most existing video colorization techniques operate on a frame-by-frame basis, often overlooking the critical aspect of temporal coherence between successive frames. This approach can result in inconsistencies across frames, leading to undesirable effects like flickering or abrupt color transitions between frames. To address these challenges, we harness the generative capabilities of a fine-tuned latent diffusion model designed specifically for video colorization, introducing a novel solution for achieving temporal consistency in video colorization, as well as demonstrating strong improvements on established image quality metrics compared to other existing methods. Furthermore, we perform a subjective study, where users preferred our approach to the existing state of the art. Our dataset encompasses a combination of conventional datasets and videos from television/movies. In short, by leveraging the power of a fine-tuned latent diffusion-based colorization system with a temporal consistency mechanism, we can improve the performance of automatic video colorization by addressing the challenges of temporal inconsistency. A short demonstration of our results can be seen in some example videos available at https://youtu.be/vDbzsZdFuxM.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NRIQA) guided cut-off point selection (CPS) strategy to enhance the performance of a fine-grained classification system. Scores given by existing NRIQA methods on the same image may vary and not be as independent of natural image augmentations as expected, which weakens their connection and explainability to fine-grained image classification. Taking the three most commonly adopted image augmentation configurations -- cropping, rotating, and blurring -- as the entry point, we formulate a two-step mechanism for selecting the most discriminative subset from a given image dataset by considering both the confidence of model predictions and the density distribution of image qualities over several NRIQA methods. Concretely, the cut-off points yielded by those methods are aggregated via majority voting to inform the process of image subset selection. The efficacy and efficiency of such a mechanism have been confirmed by comparing the models being trained on high-quality images against a combination of high- and low-quality ones, with a range of 0.7% to 4.2% improvement on a commercial product dataset in terms of mean accuracy through four deep neural classifiers. The robustness of the mechanism has been proven by the observations that all the selected high-quality images can work jointly with 70% low-quality images with 1.3% of classification precision sacrificed when using ResNet34 in an ablation study.

- **Summary**: Element segmentation is a key step in nondestructive testing of Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) based on Computed Tomography (CT) technology. In recent years, the rapid development of self-supervised pretraining technology can obtain general image features without labeled samples, and then use a small amount of labeled samples to solve downstream tasks, which has a good potential in PCB element segmentation. At present, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) pretraining model has been initially applied in PCB CT image element segmentation. However, due to the small and regular size of PCB elements such as vias, wires, and pads, the global visual field has redundancy for a single element reconstruction, which may damage the performance of the model. Based on this issue, we propose an efficient pretraining model based on multi-scale local visual field feature reconstruction for PCB CT image element segmentation (EMLR-seg). In this model, the teacher-guided MIM pretraining model is introduced into PCB CT image element segmentation for the first time, and a multi-scale local visual field extraction (MVE) module is proposed to reduce redundancy by focusing on local visual fields. At the same time, a simple 4-Transformer-blocks decoder is used. Experiments show that EMLR-seg can achieve 88.6% mIoU on the PCB CT image dataset we proposed, which exceeds 1.2% by the baseline model, and the training time is reduced by 29.6 hours, a reduction of 17.4% under the same experimental condition, which reflects the advantage of EMLR-seg in terms of performance and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Audio-driven talking head generation is advancing from 2D to 3D content. Notably, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is in the spotlight as a means to synthesize high-quality 3D talking head outputs. Unfortunately, this NeRF-based approach typically requires a large number of paired audio-visual data for each identity, thereby limiting the scalability of the method. Although there have been attempts to generate audio-driven 3D talking head animations with a single image, the results are often unsatisfactory due to insufficient information on obscured regions in the image. In this paper, we mainly focus on addressing the overlooked aspect of 3D consistency in the one-shot, audio-driven domain, where facial animations are synthesized primarily in front-facing perspectives. We propose a novel method, NeRFFaceSpeech, which enables to produce high-quality 3D-aware talking head. Using prior knowledge of generative models combined with NeRF, our method can craft a 3D-consistent facial feature space corresponding to a single image. Our spatial synchronization method employs audio-correlated vertex dynamics of a parametric face model to transform static image features into dynamic visuals through ray deformation, ensuring realistic 3D facial motion. Moreover, we introduce LipaintNet that can replenish the lacking information in the inner-mouth area, which can not be obtained from a given single image. The network is trained in a self-supervised manner by utilizing the generative capabilities without additional data. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in generating audio-driven talking heads from a single image with enhanced 3D consistency compared to previous approaches. In addition, we introduce a quantitative way of measuring the robustness of a model against pose changes for the first time, which has been possible only qualitatively.

- **Summary**: In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with channel-wise feature refining mechanisms have brought noticeable benefits to modelling channel dependencies. However, current attention paradigms fail to infer an optimal channel descriptor capable of simultaneously exploiting statistical and spatial relationships among feature maps. In this paper, to overcome this shortcoming, we present a novel channel-wise spatially autocorrelated (CSA) attention mechanism. Inspired by geographical analysis, the proposed CSA exploits the spatial relationships between channels of feature maps to produce an effective channel descriptor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the f irst time that the concept of geographical spatial analysis is utilized in deep CNNs. The proposed CSA imposes negligible learning parameters and light computational overhead to the deep model, making it a powerful yet efficient attention module of choice. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed CSA networks (CSA-Nets) through extensive experiments and analysis on ImageNet, and MS COCO benchmark datasets for image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate that CSA-Nets are able to consistently achieve competitive performance and superior generalization than several state-of-the-art attention-based CNNs over different benchmark tasks and datasets.

- **Summary**: The purpose of semantic location prediction is to extract relevant semantic location information from multimodal social media posts, offering a more contextual understanding of daily activities compared to GPS coordinates. However, this task becomes challenging due to the presence of noise and irrelevant information in "text-image" pairs. Existing methods suffer from insufficient feature representations and fail to consider the comprehensive integration of similarity at different granularities, making it difficult to filter out noise and irrelevant information. To address these challenges, we propose a Similarity-Guided Multimodal Fusion Transformer (SG-MFT) for predicting social users' semantic locations. First, we utilize a pre-trained large-scale vision-language model to extract high-quality feature representations from social media posts. Then, we introduce a Similarity-Guided Interaction Module (SIM) to alleviate modality heterogeneity and noise interference by incorporating coarse-grained and fine-grained similarity guidance for modality interactions. Specifically, we propose a novel similarity-aware feature interpolation attention mechanism at the coarse level, leveraging modality-wise similarity to mitigate heterogeneity and reduce noise within each modality. Meanwhile, we employ a similarity-aware feed-forward block at the fine level, utilizing element-wise similarity to further mitigate the impact of modality heterogeneity. Building upon pre-processed features with minimal noise and modal interference, we propose a Similarity-aware Feature Fusion Module (SFM) to fuse two modalities with cross-attention mechanism. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method in handling modality imbalance while maintaining efficient fusion effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Detail features of magnetic resonance images play a cru-cial role in accurate medical diagnosis and treatment, as they capture subtle changes that pose challenges for doc-tors when performing precise judgments. However, the widely utilized naive diffusion model has limitations, as it fails to accurately capture more intricate details. To en-hance the quality of MRI reconstruction, we propose a comprehensive detail-preserving reconstruction method using multiple diffusion models to extract structure and detail features in k-space domain instead of image do-main. Moreover, virtual binary modal masks are utilized to refine the range of values in k-space data through highly adaptive center windows, which allows the model to focus its attention more efficiently. Last but not least, an inverted pyramid structure is employed, where the top-down image information gradually decreases, ena-bling a cascade representation. The framework effective-ly represents multi-scale sampled data, taking into ac-count the sparsity of the inverted pyramid architecture, and utilizes cascade training data distribution to repre-sent multi-scale data. Through a step-by-step refinement approach, the method refines the approximation of de-tails. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated by con-ducting experiments on clinical and public datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outper-forms other methods.

- **Summary**: The increasing reliance on Deep Learning models, combined with their inherent lack of transparency, has spurred the development of a novel field of study known as eXplainable AI (XAI) methods. These methods seek to enhance the trust of end-users in automated systems by providing insights into the rationale behind their decisions. This paper presents a novel approach for measuring user trust in XAI systems, allowing their refinement. Our proposed metric combines both performance metrics and trust indicators from an objective perspective. To validate this novel methodology, we conducted a case study in a realistic medical scenario: the usage of XAI system for the detection of pneumonia from x-ray images.

- **Summary**: Text-driven 3D indoor scene generation holds broad applications, ranging from gaming and smart homes to AR/VR applications. Fast and high-fidelity scene generation is paramount for ensuring user-friendly experiences. However, existing methods are characterized by lengthy generation processes or necessitate the intricate manual specification of motion parameters, which introduces inconvenience for users. Furthermore, these methods often rely on narrow-field viewpoint iterative generations, compromising global consistency and overall scene quality. To address these issues, we propose FastScene, a framework for fast and higher-quality 3D scene generation, while maintaining the scene consistency. Specifically, given a text prompt, we generate a panorama and estimate its depth, since the panorama encompasses information about the entire scene and exhibits explicit geometric constraints. To obtain high-quality novel views, we introduce the Coarse View Synthesis (CVS) and Progressive Novel View Inpainting (PNVI) strategies, ensuring both scene consistency and view quality. Subsequently, we utilize Multi-View Projection (MVP) to form perspective views, and apply 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for scene reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate FastScene surpasses other methods in both generation speed and quality with better scene consistency. Notably, guided only by a text prompt, FastScene can generate a 3D scene within a mere 15 minutes, which is at least one hour faster than state-of-the-art methods, making it a paradigm for user-friendly scene generation.

- **Summary**: Artificial Intelligence Generative Content (AIGC) technologies have significantly influenced the remote sensing domain, particularly in the realm of image generation. However, remote sensing image editing, an equally vital research area, has not garnered sufficient attention. Different from text-guided editing in natural images, which relies on extensive text-image paired data for semantic correlation, the application scenarios of remote sensing image editing are often extreme, such as forest on fire, so it is difficult to obtain sufficient paired samples. At the same time, the lack of remote sensing semantics and the ambiguity of text also restrict the further application of image editing in remote sensing field. To solve above problems, this letter proposes a diffusion based method to fulfill stable and controllable remote sensing image editing with text guidance. Our method avoids the use of a large number of paired image, and can achieve good image editing results using only a single image. The quantitative evaluation system including CLIP score and subjective evaluation metrics shows that our method has better editing effect on remote sensing images than the existing image editing model.

- **Summary**: The paper introduces a novel autonomous robot ultrasound (US) system targeting liver follow-up scans for outpatients in local communities. Given a computed tomography (CT) image with specific target regions of interest, the proposed system carries out the autonomous follow-up scan in three steps: (i) initial robot contact to surface, (ii) coordinate mapping between CT image and robot, and (iii) target US scan. Utilizing 3D US-CT registration and deep learning-based segmentation networks, we can achieve precise imaging of 3D hepatic veins, facilitating accurate coordinate mapping between CT and the robot. This enables the automatic localization of follow-up targets within the CT image, allowing the robot to navigate precisely to the target's surface. Evaluation of the ultrasound phantom confirms the quality of the US-CT registration and shows the robot reliably locates the targets in repeated trials. The proposed framework holds the potential to significantly reduce time and costs for healthcare providers, clinicians, and follow-up patients, thereby addressing the increasing healthcare burden associated with chronic disease in local communities.

- **Summary**: To fully understand the 3D context of a single image, a visual system must be able to segment both the visible and occluded regions of objects, while discerning their occlusion order. Ideally, the system should be able to handle any object and not be restricted to segmenting a limited set of object classes, especially in robotic applications. Addressing this need, we introduce a diffusion model with cumulative occlusion learning designed for sequential amodal segmentation of objects with uncertain categories. This model iteratively refines the prediction using the cumulative mask strategy during diffusion, effectively capturing the uncertainty of invisible regions and adeptly reproducing the complex distribution of shapes and occlusion orders of occluded objects. It is akin to the human capability for amodal perception, i.e., to decipher the spatial ordering among objects and accurately predict complete contours for occluded objects in densely layered visual scenes. Experimental results across three amodal datasets show that our method outperforms established baselines.

- **Summary**: Mapping is crucial for spatial reasoning, planning and robot navigation. Existing approaches range from metric, which require precise geometry-based optimization, to purely topological, where image-as-node based graphs lack explicit object-level reasoning and interconnectivity. In this paper, we propose a novel topological representation of an environment based on "image segments", which are semantically meaningful and open-vocabulary queryable, conferring several advantages over previous works based on pixel-level features. Unlike 3D scene graphs, we create a purely topological graph with segments as nodes, where edges are formed by a) associating segment-level descriptors between pairs of consecutive images and b) connecting neighboring segments within an image using their pixel centroids. This unveils a "continuous sense of a place", defined by inter-image persistence of segments along with their intra-image neighbours. It further enables us to represent and update segment-level descriptors through neighborhood aggregation using graph convolution layers, which improves robot localization based on segment-level retrieval. Using real-world data, we show how our proposed map representation can be used to i) generate navigation plans in the form of "hops over segments" and ii) search for target objects using natural language queries describing spatial relations of objects. Furthermore, we quantitatively analyze data association at the segment level, which underpins inter-image connectivity during mapping and segment-level localization when revisiting the same place. Finally, we show preliminary trials on segment-level `hopping' based zero-shot real-world navigation. Project page with supplementary details: oravus.github.io/RoboHop/

- **Summary**: User-friendly 3D object editing is a challenging task that has attracted significant attention recently. The limitations of direct 3D object editing without 2D prior knowledge have prompted increased attention towards utilizing 2D generative models for 3D editing. While existing methods like Instruct NeRF-to-NeRF offer a solution, they often lack user-friendliness, particularly due to semantic guided editing. In the realm of 3D representation, 3D Gaussian Splatting emerges as a promising approach for its efficiency and natural explicit property, facilitating precise editing tasks. Building upon these insights, we propose DragGaussian, a 3D object drag-editing framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging diffusion models for interactive image editing with open-vocabulary input. This framework enables users to perform drag-based editing on pre-trained 3D Gaussian object models, producing modified 2D images through multi-view consistent editing. Our contributions include the introduction of a new task, the development of DragGaussian for interactive point-based 3D editing, and comprehensive validation of its effectiveness through qualitative and quantitative experiments.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demand considerable computations for inference due to the extensive parameters and the additional input tokens needed for visual information representation. Herein, we introduce Visual Tokens Withdrawal (VTW), a plug-and-play module to boost MLLMs for rapid inference. Our approach is inspired by two intriguing phenomena we have observed: (1) the attention sink phenomenon that is prevalent in LLMs also persists in MLLMs, suggesting that initial tokens and nearest tokens receive the majority of attention, while middle vision tokens garner minimal attention in deep layers; (2) the presence of information migration, which implies that visual information is transferred to subsequent text tokens within the first few layers of MLLMs. As per our findings, we conclude that vision tokens are not necessary in the deep layers of MLLMs. Thus, we strategically withdraw them at a certain layer, enabling only text tokens to engage in subsequent layers. To pinpoint the ideal layer for vision tokens withdrawal, we initially analyze a limited set of tiny datasets and choose the first layer that meets the Kullback-Leibler divergence criterion. Our VTW approach can cut computational overhead by over 40\% across diverse multimodal tasks while maintaining performance. Our code is released at https://github.com/lzhxmu/VTW.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown significant success in personalized text-to-image generation, which aims to generate novel images with human identities indicated by the reference images. Despite promising identity fidelity has been achieved by several tuning-free methods, they usually suffer from overfitting issues. The learned identity tends to entangle with irrelevant information, resulting in unsatisfied text controllability, especially on faces. In this work, we present MasterWeaver, a test-time tuning-free method designed to generate personalized images with both faithful identity fidelity and flexible editability. Specifically, MasterWeaver adopts an encoder to extract identity features and steers the image generation through additional introduced cross attention. To improve editability while maintaining identity fidelity, we propose an editing direction loss for training, which aligns the editing directions of our MasterWeaver with those of the original T2I model. Additionally, a face-augmented dataset is constructed to facilitate disentangled identity learning, and further improve the editability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MasterWeaver can not only generate personalized images with faithful identity, but also exhibit superiority in text controllability. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/csyxwei/MasterWeaver.

- **Summary**: Neural network sparsity has attracted many research interests due to its similarity to biological schemes and high energy efficiency. However, existing methods depend on long-time training or fine-tuning, which prevents large-scale applications. Recently, some works focusing on post-training sparsity (PTS) have emerged. They get rid of the high training cost but usually suffer from distinct accuracy degradation due to neglect of the reasonable sparsity rate at each layer. Previous methods for finding sparsity rates mainly focus on the training-aware scenario, which usually fails to converge stably under the PTS setting with limited data and much less training cost. In this paper, we propose a fast and controllable post-training sparsity (FCPTS) framework. By incorporating a differentiable bridge function and a controllable optimization objective, our method allows for rapid and accurate sparsity allocation learning in minutes, with the added assurance of convergence to a predetermined global sparsity rate. Equipped with these techniques, we can surpass the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, e.g., over 30\% improvement for ResNet-50 on ImageNet under the sparsity rate of 80\%.

- **Summary**: The objective of single image dehazing is to restore hazy images and produce clear, high-quality visuals. Traditional convolutional models struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited receptive field size. While Transformers excel at capturing such dependencies, their quadratic computational complexity in relation to feature map resolution makes them less suitable for pixel-to-pixel dense prediction tasks. Moreover, fixed kernels or tokens in most models do not adapt well to varying blur sizes, resulting in suboptimal dehazing performance. In this study, we introduce a novel dehazing network based on Parallel Stripe Cross Attention (PCSA) with a multi-scale strategy. PCSA efficiently integrates long-range dependencies by simultaneously capturing horizontal and vertical relationships, allowing each pixel to capture contextual cues from an expanded spatial domain. To handle different sizes and shapes of blurs flexibly, We employs a channel-wise design with varying convolutional kernel sizes and strip lengths in each PCSA to capture context information at different scales.Additionally, we incorporate a softmax-based adaptive weighting mechanism within PCSA to prioritize and leverage more critical features.

- **Summary**: Computed Tomography (CT) technology reduces radiation haz-ards to the human body through sparse sampling, but fewer sampling angles pose challenges for image reconstruction. Score-based generative models are widely used in sparse-view CT re-construction, performance diminishes significantly with a sharp reduction in projection angles. Therefore, we propose an ultra-sparse view CT reconstruction method utilizing multi-scale dif-fusion models (MSDiff), designed to concentrate on the global distribution of information and facilitate the reconstruction of sparse views with local image characteristics. Specifically, the proposed model ingeniously integrates information from both comprehensive sampling and selectively sparse sampling tech-niques. Through precise adjustments in diffusion model, it is capable of extracting diverse noise distribution, furthering the understanding of the overall structure of images, and aiding the fully sampled model in recovering image information more effec-tively. By leveraging the inherent correlations within the projec-tion data, we have designed an equidistant mask, enabling the model to focus its attention more effectively. Experimental re-sults demonstrated that the multi-scale model approach signifi-cantly improved the quality of image reconstruction under ultra-sparse angles, with good generalization across various datasets.

- **Summary**: LiDAR odometry is the task of estimating the ego-motion of the sensor from sequential laser scans. This problem has been addressed by the community for more than two decades, and many effective solutions are available nowadays. Most of these systems implicitly rely on assumptions about the operating environment, the sensor used, and motion pattern. When these assumptions are violated, several well-known systems tend to perform poorly. This paper presents a LiDAR odometry system that can overcome these limitations and operate well under different operating conditions while achieving performance comparable with domain-specific methods. Our algorithm follows the well-known ICP paradigm that leverages a PCA-based kd-tree implementation that is used to extract structural information about the clouds being registered and to compute the minimization metric for the alignment. The drift is bound by managing the local map based on the estimated uncertainty of the tracked pose. To benefit the community, we release an open-source C++ anytime real-time implementation.

- **Summary**: Lots of popular calibration methods in medical images focus on classification, but there are few comparable studies on semantic segmentation. In polyp segmentation of medical images, we find most diseased area occupies only a small portion of the entire image, resulting in previous models being not well-calibrated for lesion regions but well-calibrated for background, despite their seemingly better Expected Calibration Error (ECE) scores overall. Therefore, we proposed four-branches calibration network with Mask-Loss and Mask-TS strategies to more focus on the scaling of logits within potential lesion regions, which serves to mitigate the influence of background interference. In the experiments, we compare the existing calibration methods with the proposed Mask Temperature Scaling (Mask-TS). The results indicate that the proposed calibration network outperforms other methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Machine learning-based techniques open up many opportunities and improvements to derive deeper and more practical insights from data that can help businesses make informed decisions. However, the majority of these techniques focus on the conventional closed-set scenario, in which the label spaces for the training and test sets are identical. Open set recognition (OSR) aims to bring classification tasks in a situation that is more like reality, which focuses on classifying the known classes as well as handling unknown classes effectively. In such an open-set problem the gathered samples in the training set cannot encompass all the classes and the system needs to identify unknown samples at test time. On the other hand, building an accurate and comprehensive model in a real dynamic environment presents a number of obstacles, because it is prohibitively expensive to train for every possible example of unknown items, and the model may fail when tested in testbeds. This study provides an algorithm exploring a new representation of feature space to improve classification in OSR tasks. The efficacy and efficiency of business processes and decision-making can be improved by integrating OSR, which offers more precise and insightful predictions of outcomes. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on three established datasets. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the baseline methods in accuracy and F1-score.

- **Summary**: In text recognition, self-supervised pre-training emerges as a good solution to reduce dependence on expansive annotated real data. Previous studies primarily focus on local visual representation by leveraging mask image modeling or sequence contrastive learning. However, they omit modeling the linguistic information in text images, which is crucial for recognizing text. To simultaneously capture local character features and linguistic information in visual space, we propose Symmetric Superimposition Modeling (SSM). The objective of SSM is to reconstruct the direction-specific pixel and feature signals from the symmetrically superimposed input. Specifically, we add the original image with its inverted views to create the symmetrically superimposed inputs. At the pixel level, we reconstruct the original and inverted images to capture character shapes and texture-level linguistic context. At the feature level, we reconstruct the feature of the same original image and inverted image with different augmentations to model the semantic-level linguistic context and the local character discrimination. In our design, we disrupt the character shape and linguistic rules. Consequently, the dual-level reconstruction facilitates understanding character shapes and linguistic information from the perspective of visual texture and feature semantics. Experiments on various text recognition benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of SSM, with 4.1% average performance gains and 86.6% new state-of-the-art average word accuracy on Union14M benchmarks.

- **Summary**: The past few years have witnessed substantial advancement in text-guided image generation powered by diffusion models. However, it was shown that text-to-image diffusion models are vulnerable to training image memorization, raising concerns on copyright infringement and privacy invasion. In this work, we perform practical analysis of memorization in text-to-image diffusion models. Targeting a set of images to protect, we conduct quantitive analysis on them without need to collect any prompts. Specifically, we first formally define the memorization of image and identify three necessary conditions of memorization, respectively similarity, existence and probability. We then reveal the correlation between the model's prediction error and image replication. Based on the correlation, we propose to utilize inversion techniques to verify the safety of target images against memorization and measure the extent to which they are memorized. Model developers can utilize our analysis method to discover memorized images or reliably claim safety against memorization. Extensive experiments on the Stable Diffusion, a popular open-source text-to-image diffusion model, demonstrate the effectiveness of our analysis method.

- **Summary**: Representation learning, and interpreting learned representations, are key areas of focus in machine learning and neuroscience. Both fields generally use representations as a means to understand or improve a system's computations. In this work, however, we explore surprising dissociations between representation and computation that may pose challenges for such efforts. We create datasets in which we attempt to match the computational role that different features play, while manipulating other properties of the features or the data. We train various deep learning architectures to compute these multiple abstract features about their inputs. We find that their learned feature representations are systematically biased towards representing some features more strongly than others, depending upon extraneous properties such as feature complexity, the order in which features are learned, and the distribution of features over the inputs. For example, features that are simpler to compute or learned first tend to be represented more strongly and densely than features that are more complex or learned later, even if all features are learned equally well. We also explore how these biases are affected by architectures, optimizers, and training regimes (e.g., in transformers, features decoded earlier in the output sequence also tend to be represented more strongly). Our results help to characterize the inductive biases of gradient-based representation learning. These results also highlight a key challenge for interpretability $-$ or for comparing the representations of models and brains $-$ disentangling extraneous biases from the computationally important aspects of a system's internal representations.

- **Summary**: Embodied AI agents require a fine-grained understanding of the physical world mediated through visual and language inputs. Such capabilities are difficult to learn solely from task-specific data. This has led to the emergence of pre-trained vision-language models as a tool for transferring representations learned from internet-scale data to downstream tasks and new domains. However, commonly used contrastively trained representations such as in CLIP have been shown to fail at enabling embodied agents to gain a sufficiently fine-grained scene understanding -- a capability vital for control. To address this shortcoming, we consider representations from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, which are explicitly optimized to generate images from text prompts and as such, contain text-conditioned representations that reflect highly fine-grained visuo-spatial information. Using pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, we construct Stable Control Representations which allow learning downstream control policies that generalize to complex, open-ended environments. We show that policies learned using Stable Control Representations are competitive with state-of-the-art representation learning approaches across a broad range of simulated control settings, encompassing challenging manipulation and navigation tasks. Most notably, we show that Stable Control Representations enable learning policies that exhibit state-of-the-art performance on OVMM, a difficult open-vocabulary navigation benchmark.



### Robust and Explainable Fine-Grained Visual Classification with Transfer Learning: A Dual-Carriageway Framework

- **Summary**: In the realm of practical fine-grained visual classification applications rooted in deep learning, a common scenario involves training a model using a pre-existing dataset. Subsequently, a new dataset becomes available, prompting the desire to make a pivotal decision for achieving enhanced and leveraged inference performance on both sides: Should one opt to train datasets from scratch or fine-tune the model trained on the initial dataset using the newly released dataset? The existing literature reveals a lack of methods to systematically determine the optimal training strategy, necessitating explainability. To this end, we present an automatic best-suit training solution searching framework, the Dual-Carriageway Framework (DCF), to fill this gap. DCF benefits from the design of a dual-direction search (starting from the pre-existing or the newly released dataset) where five different training settings are enforced. In addition, DCF is not only capable of figuring out the optimal training strategy with the capability of avoiding overfitting but also yields built-in quantitative and visual explanations derived from the actual input and weights of the trained model. We validated DCF's effectiveness through experiments with three convolutional neural networks (ResNet18, ResNet34 and Inception-v3) on two temporally continued commercial product datasets. Results showed fine-tuning pathways outperformed training-from-scratch ones by up to 2.13% and 1.23% on the pre-existing and new datasets, respectively, in terms of mean accuracy. Furthermore, DCF identified reflection padding as the superior padding method, enhancing testing accuracy by 3.72% on average. This framework stands out for its potential to guide the development of robust and explainable AI solutions in fine-grained visual classification tasks.

- **Summary**: We propose an approach for reconstructing free-moving object from a monocular RGB video. Most existing methods either assume scene prior, hand pose prior, object category pose prior, or rely on local optimization with multiple sequence segments. We propose a method that allows free interaction with the object in front of a moving camera without relying on any prior, and optimizes the sequence globally without any segments. We progressively optimize the object shape and pose simultaneously based on an implicit neural representation. A key aspect of our method is a virtual camera system that reduces the search space of the optimization significantly. We evaluate our method on the standard HO3D dataset and a collection of egocentric RGB sequences captured with a head-mounted device. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms most methods significantly, and is on par with recent techniques that assume prior information.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose composable part-based manipulation (CPM), a novel approach that leverages object-part decomposition and part-part correspondences to improve learning and generalization of robotic manipulation skills. By considering the functional correspondences between object parts, we conceptualize functional actions, such as pouring and constrained placing, as combinations of different correspondence constraints. CPM comprises a collection of composable diffusion models, where each model captures a different inter-object correspondence. These diffusion models can generate parameters for manipulation skills based on the specific object parts. Leveraging part-based correspondences coupled with the task decomposition into distinct constraints enables strong generalization to novel objects and object categories. We validate our approach in both simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving robust and generalized manipulation capabilities.

- **Summary**: Due to the rare occurrence of anomalous events, a typical approach to anomaly detection is to train an autoencoder (AE) with normal data only so that it learns the patterns or representations of the normal training data. At test time, the trained AE is expected to well reconstruct normal but to poorly reconstruct anomalous data. However, contrary to the expectation, anomalous data is often well reconstructed as well. In order to further separate the reconstruction quality between normal and anomalous data, we propose creating pseudo anomalies from learned adaptive noise by exploiting the aforementioned weakness of AE, i.e., reconstructing anomalies too well. The generated noise is added to the normal data to create pseudo anomalies. Extensive experiments on Ped2, Avenue, ShanghaiTech, CIFAR-10, and KDDCUP datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generic applicability of our approach in improving the discriminative capability of AEs for anomaly detection.

- **Summary**: Masked face recognition (MFR) has emerged as a critical domain in biometric identification, especially by the global COVID-19 pandemic, which introduced widespread face masks. This survey paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and advancements in recognising and detecting individuals with masked faces, which has seen innovative shifts due to the necessity of adapting to new societal norms. Advanced through deep learning techniques, MFR, along with Face Mask Recognition (FMR) and Face Unmasking (FU), represent significant areas of focus. These methods address unique challenges posed by obscured facial features, from fully to partially covered faces. Our comprehensive review delves into the various deep learning-based methodologies developed for MFR, FMR, and FU, highlighting their distinctive challenges and the solutions proposed to overcome them. Additionally, we explore benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics specifically tailored for assessing performance in MFR research. The survey also discusses the substantial obstacles still facing researchers in this field and proposes future directions for the ongoing development of more robust and effective masked face recognition systems. This paper serves as an invaluable resource for researchers and practitioners, offering insights into the evolving landscape of face recognition technologies in the face of global health crises and beyond.

- **Summary**: Ensuring fair predictions across many distinct subpopulations in the training data can be prohibitive for large models. Recently, simple linear last layer retraining strategies, in combination with data augmentation methods such as upweighting, downsampling and mixup, have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance for worst-group accuracy, which quantifies accuracy for the least prevalent subpopulation. For linear last layer retraining and the abovementioned augmentations, we present the optimal worst-group accuracy when modeling the distribution of the latent representations (input to the last layer) as Gaussian for each subpopulation. We evaluate and verify our results for both synthetic and large publicly available datasets.

- **Summary**: The field of robotics has made significant advances towards generalist robot manipulation policies. However, real-world evaluation of such policies is not scalable and faces reproducibility challenges, which are likely to worsen as policies broaden the spectrum of tasks they can perform. We identify control and visual disparities between real and simulated environments as key challenges for reliable simulated evaluation and propose approaches for mitigating these gaps without needing to craft full-fidelity digital twins of real-world environments. We then employ these approaches to create SIMPLER, a collection of simulated environments for manipulation policy evaluation on common real robot setups. Through paired sim-and-real evaluations of manipulation policies, we demonstrate strong correlation between policy performance in SIMPLER environments and in the real world. Additionally, we find that SIMPLER evaluations accurately reflect real-world policy behavior modes such as sensitivity to various distribution shifts. We open-source all SIMPLER environments along with our workflow for creating new environments at https://simpler-env.github.io to facilitate research on general-purpose manipulation policies and simulated evaluation frameworks.

- **Summary**: Background: Segmentation of organs and structures in abdominal MRI is useful for many clinical applications, such as disease diagnosis and radiotherapy. Current approaches have focused on delineating a limited set of abdominal structures (13 types). To date, there is no publicly available abdominal MRI dataset with voxel-level annotations of multiple organs and structures. Consequently, a segmentation tool for multi-structure segmentation is also unavailable. Methods: We curated a T1-weighted abdominal MRI dataset consisting of 195 patients who underwent imaging at National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center. The dataset comprises of axial pre-contrast T1, arterial, venous, and delayed phases for each patient, thereby amounting to a total of 780 series (69,248 2D slices). Each series contains voxel-level annotations of 62 abdominal organs and structures. A 3D nnUNet model, dubbed as MRISegmentator-Abdomen (MRISegmentator in short), was trained on this dataset, and evaluation was conducted on an internal test set and two large external datasets: AMOS22 and Duke Liver. The predicted segmentations were compared against the ground-truth using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Normalized Surface Distance (NSD). Findings: MRISegmentator achieved an average DSC of 0.861$\pm$0.170 and a NSD of 0.924$\pm$0.163 in the internal test set. On the AMOS22 dataset, MRISegmentator attained an average DSC of 0.829$\pm$0.133 and a NSD of 0.908$\pm$0.067. For the Duke Liver dataset, an average DSC of 0.933$\pm$0.015 and a NSD of 0.929$\pm$0.021 was obtained. Interpretation: The proposed MRISegmentator provides automatic, accurate, and robust segmentations of 62 organs and structures in T1-weighted abdominal MRI sequences. The tool has the potential to accelerate research on various clinical topics, such as abnormality detection, radiotherapy, disease classification among others.

- **Summary**: Sora unveils the potential of scaling Diffusion Transformer for generating photorealistic images and videos at arbitrary resolutions, aspect ratios, and durations, yet it still lacks sufficient implementation details. In this technical report, we introduce the Lumina-T2X family - a series of Flow-based Large Diffusion Transformers (Flag-DiT) equipped with zero-initialized attention, as a unified framework designed to transform noise into images, videos, multi-view 3D objects, and audio clips conditioned on text instructions. By tokenizing the latent spatial-temporal space and incorporating learnable placeholders such as [nextline] and [nextframe] tokens, Lumina-T2X seamlessly unifies the representations of different modalities across various spatial-temporal resolutions. This unified approach enables training within a single framework for different modalities and allows for flexible generation of multimodal data at any resolution, aspect ratio, and length during inference. Advanced techniques like RoPE, RMSNorm, and flow matching enhance the stability, flexibility, and scalability of Flag-DiT, enabling models of Lumina-T2X to scale up to 7 billion parameters and extend the context window to 128K tokens. This is particularly beneficial for creating ultra-high-definition images with our Lumina-T2I model and long 720p videos with our Lumina-T2V model. Remarkably, Lumina-T2I, powered by a 5-billion-parameter Flag-DiT, requires only 35% of the training computational costs of a 600-million-parameter naive DiT. Our further comprehensive analysis underscores Lumina-T2X's preliminary capability in resolution extrapolation, high-resolution editing, generating consistent 3D views, and synthesizing videos with seamless transitions. We expect that the open-sourcing of Lumina-T2X will further foster creativity, transparency, and diversity in the generative AI community.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) have focused primarily on scaling by increasing text-image pair data and enhancing LLMs to improve performance on multimodal tasks. However, these scaling approaches are computationally expensive and overlook the significance of improving model capabilities from the vision side. Inspired by the successful applications of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in LLMs, which improves model scalability during training while keeping inference costs similar to those of smaller models, we propose CuMo. CuMo incorporates Co-upcycled Top-K sparsely-gated Mixture-of-experts blocks into both the vision encoder and the MLP connector, thereby enhancing the multimodal LLMs with minimal additional activated parameters during inference. CuMo first pre-trains the MLP blocks and then initializes each expert in the MoE block from the pre-trained MLP block during the visual instruction tuning stage. Auxiliary losses are used to ensure a balanced loading of experts. CuMo outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs across various VQA and visual-instruction-following benchmarks using models within each model size group, all while training exclusively on open-sourced datasets. The code and model weights for CuMo are open-sourced at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/CuMo.

- **Summary**: Recent work in Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) tries to formulate VFI as a diffusion-based conditional image generation problem, synthesizing the intermediate frame given a random noise and neighboring frames. Due to the relatively high resolution of videos, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are employed as the conditional generation model, where the autoencoder compresses images into latent representations for diffusion and then reconstructs images from these latent representations. Such a formulation poses a crucial challenge: VFI expects that the output is deterministically equal to the ground truth intermediate frame, but LDMs randomly generate a diverse set of different images when the model runs multiple times. The reason for the diverse generation is that the cumulative variance (variance accumulated at each step of generation) of generated latent representations in LDMs is large. This makes the sampling trajectory random, resulting in diverse rather than deterministic generations. To address this problem, we propose our unique solution: Frame Interpolation with Consecutive Brownian Bridge Diffusion. Specifically, we propose consecutive Brownian Bridge diffusion that takes a deterministic initial value as input, resulting in a much smaller cumulative variance of generated latent representations. Our experiments suggest that our method can improve together with the improvement of the autoencoder and achieve state-of-the-art performance in VFI, leaving strong potential for further enhancement.

- **Summary**: We provide a sober look at the application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) within the domain of autonomous driving and challenge/verify some common assumptions, focusing on their ability to reason and interpret dynamic driving scenarios through sequences of images/frames in a closed-loop control environment. Despite the significant advancements in MLLMs like GPT-4V, their performance in complex, dynamic driving environments remains largely untested and presents a wide area of exploration. We conduct a comprehensive experimental study to evaluate the capability of various MLLMs as world models for driving from the perspective of a fixed in-car camera. Our findings reveal that, while these models proficiently interpret individual images, they struggle significantly with synthesizing coherent narratives or logical sequences across frames depicting dynamic behavior. The experiments demonstrate considerable inaccuracies in predicting (i) basic vehicle dynamics (forward/backward, acceleration/deceleration, turning right or left), (ii) interactions with other road actors (e.g., identifying speeding cars or heavy traffic), (iii) trajectory planning, and (iv) open-set dynamic scene reasoning, suggesting biases in the models' training data. To enable this experimental study we introduce a specialized simulator, DriveSim, designed to generate diverse driving scenarios, providing a platform for evaluating MLLMs in the realms of driving. Additionally, we contribute the full open-source code and a new dataset, "Eval-LLM-Drive", for evaluating MLLMs in driving. Our results highlight a critical gap in the current capabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs, underscoring the need for enhanced foundation models to improve their applicability in real-world dynamic environments.

- **Summary**: We propose a method to distill a complex multistep diffusion model into a single-step conditional GAN student model, dramatically accelerating inference, while preserving image quality. Our approach interprets diffusion distillation as a paired image-to-image translation task, using noise-to-image pairs of the diffusion model's ODE trajectory. For efficient regression loss computation, we propose E-LatentLPIPS, a perceptual loss operating directly in diffusion model's latent space, utilizing an ensemble of augmentations. Furthermore, we adapt a diffusion model to construct a multi-scale discriminator with a text alignment loss to build an effective conditional GAN-based formulation. E-LatentLPIPS converges more efficiently than many existing distillation methods, even accounting for dataset construction costs. We demonstrate that our one-step generator outperforms cutting-edge one-step diffusion distillation models - DMD, SDXL-Turbo, and SDXL-Lightning - on the zero-shot COCO benchmark.
