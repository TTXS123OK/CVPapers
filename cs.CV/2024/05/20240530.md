- **Summary**: Acquiring a multi-task imitation policy in 3D manipulation poses challenges in terms of scene understanding and action prediction. Current methods employ both 3D representation and multi-view 2D representation to predict the poses of the robot's end-effector. However, they still require a considerable amount of high-quality robot trajectories, and suffer from limited generalization in unseen tasks and inefficient execution in long-horizon reasoning. In this paper, we propose SAM-E, a novel architecture for robot manipulation by leveraging a vision-foundation model for generalizable scene understanding and sequence imitation for long-term action reasoning. Specifically, we adopt Segment Anything (SAM) pre-trained on a huge number of images and promptable masks as the foundation model for extracting task-relevant features, and employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning on robot data for a better understanding of embodied scenarios. To address long-horizon reasoning, we develop a novel multi-channel heatmap that enables the prediction of the action sequence in a single pass, notably enhancing execution efficiency. Experimental results from various instruction-following tasks demonstrate that SAM-E achieves superior performance with higher execution efficiency compared to the baselines, and also significantly improves generalization in few-shot adaptation to new tasks.

- **Summary**: The RSNA Abdominal Traumatic Injury CT (RATIC) dataset is the largest publicly available collection of adult abdominal CT studies annotated for traumatic injuries. This dataset includes 4,274 studies from 23 institutions across 14 countries. The dataset is freely available for non-commercial use via Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-2023-abdominal-trauma-detection. Created for the RSNA 2023 Abdominal Trauma Detection competition, the dataset encourages the development of advanced machine learning models for detecting abdominal injuries on CT scans. The dataset encompasses detection and classification of traumatic injuries across multiple organs, including the liver, spleen, kidneys, bowel, and mesentery. Annotations were created by expert radiologists from the American Society of Emergency Radiology (ASER) and Society of Abdominal Radiology (SAR). The dataset is annotated at multiple levels, including the presence of injuries in three solid organs with injury grading, image-level annotations for active extravasations and bowel injury, and voxelwise segmentations of each of the potentially injured organs. With the release of this dataset, we hope to facilitate research and development in machine learning and abdominal trauma that can lead to improved patient care and outcomes.

- **Summary**: Recovering photorealistic and drivable full-body avatars is crucial for numerous applications, including virtual reality, 3D games, and tele-presence. Most methods, whether reconstruction or generation, require large numbers of human motion sequences and corresponding textured meshes. To easily learn a drivable avatar, a reasonable parametric body model with unified topology is paramount. However, existing human body datasets either have images or textured models and lack parametric models which fit clothes well. We propose a new parametric model SMPLX-Lite-D, which can fit detailed geometry of the scanned mesh while maintaining stable geometry in the face, hand and foot regions. We present SMPLX-Lite dataset, the most comprehensive clothing avatar dataset with multi-view RGB sequences, keypoints annotations, textured scanned meshes, and textured SMPLX-Lite-D models. With the SMPLX-Lite dataset, we train a conditional variational autoencoder model that takes human pose and facial keypoints as input, and generates a photorealistic drivable human avatar.



### SparseDrive: End-to-End Autonomous Driving via Sparse Scene Representation

- **Summary**: The well-established modular autonomous driving system is decoupled into different standalone tasks, e.g. perception, prediction and planning, suffering from information loss and error accumulation across modules. In contrast, end-to-end paradigms unify multi-tasks into a fully differentiable framework, allowing for optimization in a planning-oriented spirit. Despite the great potential of end-to-end paradigms, both the performance and efficiency of existing methods are not satisfactory, particularly in terms of planning safety. We attribute this to the computationally expensive BEV (bird's eye view) features and the straightforward design for prediction and planning. To this end, we explore the sparse representation and review the task design for end-to-end autonomous driving, proposing a new paradigm named SparseDrive. Concretely, SparseDrive consists of a symmetric sparse perception module and a parallel motion planner. The sparse perception module unifies detection, tracking and online mapping with a symmetric model architecture, learning a fully sparse representation of the driving scene. For motion prediction and planning, we review the great similarity between these two tasks, leading to a parallel design for motion planner. Based on this parallel design, which models planning as a multi-modal problem, we propose a hierarchical planning selection strategy , which incorporates a collision-aware rescore module, to select a rational and safe trajectory as the final planning output. With such effective designs, SparseDrive surpasses previous state-of-the-arts by a large margin in performance of all tasks, while achieving much higher training and inference efficiency. Code will be avaliable at https://github.com/swc-17/SparseDrive for facilitating future research.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces YotoR (You Only Transform One Representation), a novel deep learning model for object detection that combines Swin Transformers and YoloR architectures. Transformers, a revolutionary technology in natural language processing, have also significantly impacted computer vision, offering the potential to enhance accuracy and computational efficiency. YotoR combines the robust Swin Transformer backbone with the YoloR neck and head. In our experiments, YotoR models TP5 and BP4 consistently outperform YoloR P6 and Swin Transformers in various evaluations, delivering improved object detection performance and faster inference speeds than Swin Transformer models. These results highlight the potential for further model combinations and improvements in real-time object detection with Transformers. The paper concludes by emphasizing the broader implications of YotoR, including its potential to enhance transformer-based models for image-related tasks.



### Learning Robust Correlation with Foundation Model for Weakly-Supervised Few-Shot Segmentation

- **Summary**: Existing few-shot segmentation (FSS) only considers learning support-query correlation and segmenting unseen categories under the precise pixel masks. However, the cost of a large number of pixel masks during training is expensive. This paper considers a more challenging scenario, weakly-supervised few-shot segmentation (WS-FSS), which only provides category ($i.e.$ image-level) labels. It requires the model to learn robust support-query information when the generated mask is inaccurate. In this work, we design a Correlation Enhancement Network (CORENet) with foundation model, which utilizes multi-information guidance to learn robust correlation. Specifically, correlation-guided transformer (CGT) utilizes self-supervised ViT tokens to learn robust correlation from both local and global perspectives. From the perspective of semantic categories, the class-guided module (CGM) guides the model to locate valuable correlations through the pre-trained CLIP. Finally, the embedding-guided module (EGM) implicitly guides the model to supplement the inevitable information loss during the correlation learning by the original appearance embedding and finally generates the query mask. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ have shown that CORENet exhibits excellent performance compared to existing methods.



### EgoSurgery-Phase: A Dataset of Surgical Phase Recognition from Egocentric Open Surgery Videos

- **Summary**: Surgical phase recognition has gained significant attention due to its potential to offer solutions to numerous demands of the modern operating room. However, most existing methods concentrate on minimally invasive surgery (MIS), leaving surgical phase recognition for open surgery understudied. This discrepancy is primarily attributed to the scarcity of publicly available open surgery video datasets for surgical phase recognition. To address this issue, we introduce a new egocentric open surgery video dataset for phase recognition, named EgoSurgery-Phase. This dataset comprises 15 hours of real open surgery videos spanning 9 distinct surgical phases all captured using an egocentric camera attached to the surgeon's head. In addition to video, the EgoSurgery-Phase offers eye gaze. As far as we know, it is the first real open surgery video dataset for surgical phase recognition publicly available. Furthermore, inspired by the notable success of masked autoencoders (MAEs) in video understanding tasks (e.g., action recognition), we propose a gaze-guided masked autoencoder (GGMAE). Considering the regions where surgeons' gaze focuses are often critical for surgical phase recognition (e.g., surgical field), in our GGMAE, the gaze information acts as an empirical semantic richness prior to guiding the masking process, promoting better attention to semantically rich spatial regions. GGMAE significantly improves the previous state-of-the-art recognition method (6.4% in Jaccard) and the masked autoencoder-based method (3.1% in Jaccard) on EgoSurgery-Phase. The dataset will be released at https://github.com/Fujiry0/EgoSurgery.



### FaceLift: Semi-supervised 3D Facial Landmark Localization

- **Summary**: 3D facial landmark localization has proven to be of particular use for applications, such as face tracking, 3D face modeling, and image-based 3D face reconstruction. In the supervised learning case, such methods usually rely on 3D landmark datasets derived from 3DMM-based registration that often lack spatial definition alignment, as compared with that chosen by hand-labeled human consensus, e.g., how are eyebrow landmarks defined? This creates a gap between landmark datasets generated via high-quality 2D human labels and 3DMMs, and it ultimately limits their effectiveness. To address this issue, we introduce a novel semi-supervised learning approach that learns 3D landmarks by directly lifting (visible) hand-labeled 2D landmarks and ensures better definition alignment, without the need for 3D landmark datasets. To lift 2D landmarks to 3D, we leverage 3D-aware GANs for better multi-view consistency learning and in-the-wild multi-frame videos for robust cross-generalization. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves better definition alignment between 2D-3D landmarks but also outperforms other supervised learning 3D landmark localization methods on both 3DMM labeled and photogrammetric ground truth evaluation datasets.

- **Summary**: Although deep convolutional neural networks have achieved rapid development, it is challenging to widely promote and apply these models on low-power devices, due to computational and storage limitations. To address this issue, researchers have proposed techniques such as model compression, activation sparsity induction, and hardware accelerators. This paper presents a method to induce the sparsity of activation maps based on Transformed $\ell1$ regularization, so as to improve the research in the field of activation sparsity induction. Further, the method is innovatively combined with traditional pruning, constituting a dual sparse training framework. Compared to previous methods, Transformed $\ell1$ can achieve higher sparsity and better adapt to different network structures. Experimental results show that the method achieves improvements by more than 20\% in activation map sparsity on most models and corresponding datasets without compromising the accuracy. Specifically, it achieves a 27.52\% improvement for ResNet18 on the ImageNet dataset, and a 44.04\% improvement for LeNet5 on the MNIST dataset. In addition, the dual sparse training framework can greatly reduce the computational load and provide potential for reducing the required storage during runtime. Specifically, the ResNet18 and ResNet50 models obtained by the dual sparse training framework respectively reduce 81.7\% and 84.13\% of multiplicative floating-point operations, while maintaining accuracy and a low pruning rate.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian splatting has demonstrated impressive performance in real-time novel view synthesis. However, achieving successful reconstruction from RGB images generally requires multiple input views captured under static conditions. To address the challenge of sparse input views, previous approaches have incorporated depth supervision into the training of 3D Gaussians to mitigate overfitting, using dense predictions from pretrained depth networks as pseudo-ground truth. Nevertheless, depth predictions from monocular depth estimation models inherently exhibit significant uncertainty in specific areas. Relying solely on pixel-wise L2 loss may inadvertently incorporate detrimental noise from these uncertain areas. In this work, we introduce a novel method to supervise the depth distribution of 3D Gaussians, utilizing depth priors with integrated uncertainty estimates. To address these localized errors in depth predictions, we integrate a patch-wise optimal transport strategy to complement traditional L2 loss in depth supervision. Extensive experiments conducted on the LLFF, DTU, and Blender datasets demonstrate that our approach, UGOT, achieves superior novel view synthesis and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Our project proposes an end-to-end 3D face alignment and reconstruction network. The backbone of our model is built by Bottle-Neck structure via Depth-wise Separable Convolution. We integrate Coordinate Attention mechanism and Spatial Group-wise Enhancement to extract more representative features. For more stable training process and better convergence, we jointly use Wing loss and the Weighted Parameter Distance Cost to learn parameters for 3D Morphable model and 3D vertices. Our proposed model outperforms all baseline models both quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: Despite the widespread application of large language models (LLMs) across various tasks, recent studies indicate that they are susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which can render their defense mechanisms ineffective. However, previous jailbreak research has frequently been constrained by limited universality, suboptimal efficiency, and a reliance on manual crafting. In response, we rethink the approach to jailbreaking LLMs and formally define three essential properties from the attacker' s perspective, which contributes to guiding the design of jailbreak methods. We further introduce AutoBreach, a novel method for jailbreaking LLMs that requires only black-box access. Inspired by the versatility of wordplay, AutoBreach employs a wordplay-guided mapping rule sampling strategy to generate a variety of universal mapping rules for creating adversarial prompts. This generation process leverages LLMs' automatic summarization and reasoning capabilities, thus alleviating the manual burden. To boost jailbreak success rates, we further suggest sentence compression and chain-of-thought-based mapping rules to correct errors and wordplay misinterpretations in target LLMs. Additionally, we propose a two-stage mapping rule optimization strategy that initially optimizes mapping rules before querying target LLMs to enhance the efficiency of AutoBreach. AutoBreach can efficiently identify security vulnerabilities across various LLMs, including three proprietary models: Claude-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4 Turbo, and two LLMs' web platforms: Bingchat, GPT-4 Web, achieving an average success rate of over 80% with fewer than 10 queries

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of machine vision technology in recent years, many researchers have begun to focus on feature compression that is better suited for machine vision tasks. The target of feature compression is deep features, which arise from convolution in the middle layer of a pre-trained convolutional neural network. However, due to the large volume of data and high level of abstraction of deep features, their application is primarily limited to machine-centric scenarios, which poses significant constraints in situations requiring human-computer interaction. This paper investigates features and textures and proposes a texture-guided feature compression strategy based on their characteristics. Specifically, the strategy comprises feature layers and texture layers. The feature layers serve the machine, including a feature selection module and a feature reconstruction network. With the assistance of texture images, they selectively compress and transmit channels relevant to visual tasks, reducing feature data while providing high-quality features for the machine. The texture layers primarily serve humans and consist of an image reconstruction network. This image reconstruction network leverages features and texture images to reconstruct preview images for humans. Our method fully exploits the characteristics of texture and features. It eliminates feature redundancy, reconstructs high-quality preview images for humans, and supports decision-making. The experimental results demonstrate excellent performance when employing our proposed method to compress the deep features.

- **Summary**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting(3DGS) has revolutionized neural rendering with its high-quality rendering and real-time speed. However, when it comes to indoor scenes with a significant number of textureless areas, 3DGS yields incomplete and noisy reconstruction results due to the poor initialization of the point cloud and under-constrained optimization. Inspired by the continuity of signed distance field (SDF), which naturally has advantages in modeling surfaces, we present a unified optimizing framework integrating neural SDF with 3DGS. This framework incorporates a learnable neural SDF field to guide the densification and pruning of Gaussians, enabling Gaussians to accurately model scenes even with poor initialized point clouds. At the same time, the geometry represented by Gaussians improves the efficiency of the SDF field by piloting its point sampling. Additionally, we regularize the optimization with normal and edge priors to eliminate geometry ambiguity in textureless areas and improve the details. Extensive experiments in ScanNet and ScanNet++ show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

- **Summary**: Accurate detection of colorectal cancer and early prevention heavily rely on precise polyp identification during gastrointestinal colonoscopy. Due to limited data, many current state-of-the-art deep learning methods for polyp segmentation often rely on post-processing of masks to reduce noise and enhance results. In this study, we propose an approach that integrates mask refinement and binary semantic segmentation, leveraging a novel collaborative training strategy that surpasses current widely-used refinement strategies. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach through comprehensive evaluation on established benchmark datasets and its successful application across various medical image segmentation architectures.

- **Summary**: A visual-language model (VLM) pre-trained on natural images and text pairs poses a significant barrier when applied to medical contexts due to domain shift. Yet, adapting or fine-tuning these VLMs for medical use presents considerable hurdles, including domain misalignment, limited access to extensive datasets, and high-class imbalances. Hence, there is a pressing need for strategies to effectively adapt these VLMs to the medical domain, as such adaptations would prove immensely valuable in healthcare applications. In this study, we propose a framework designed to adeptly tailor VLMs to the medical domain, employing selective sampling and hard-negative mining techniques for enhanced performance in retrieval tasks. We validate the efficacy of our proposed approach by implementing it across two distinct VLMs: the in-domain VLM (MedCLIP) and out-of-domain VLMs (ALBEF). We assess the performance of these models both in their original off-the-shelf state and after undergoing our proposed training strategies, using two extensive datasets containing mammograms and their corresponding reports. Our evaluation spans zero-shot, few-shot, and supervised scenarios. Through our approach, we observe a notable enhancement in Recall@K performance for the image-text retrieval task.

- **Summary**: Large-scale vision foundation models such as Segment Anything (SAM) demonstrate impressive performance in zero-shot image segmentation at multiple levels of granularity. However, these zero-shot predictions are rarely 3D-consistent. As the camera viewpoint changes in a scene, so do the segmentation predictions, as well as the characterizations of ``coarse" or ``fine" granularity. In this work, we address the challenging task of lifting multi-granular and view-inconsistent image segmentations into a hierarchical and 3D-consistent representation. We learn a novel feature field within a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) representing a 3D scene, whose segmentation structure can be revealed at different scales by simply using different thresholds on feature distance. Our key idea is to learn an ultrametric feature space, which unlike a Euclidean space, exhibits transitivity in distance-based grouping, naturally leading to a hierarchical clustering. Put together, our method takes view-inconsistent multi-granularity 2D segmentations as input and produces a hierarchy of 3D-consistent segmentations as output. We evaluate our method and several baselines on synthetic datasets with multi-view images and multi-granular segmentation, showcasing improved accuracy and viewpoint-consistency. We additionally provide qualitative examples of our model's 3D hierarchical segmentations in real world scenes.\footnote{The code and dataset are available at:

- **Summary**: Monocular 3D object detection (Mono 3Det) aims to identify 3D objects from a single RGB image. However, existing methods often assume training and test data follow the same distribution, which may not hold in real-world test scenarios. To address the out-of-distribution (OOD) problems, we explore a new adaptation paradigm for Mono 3Det, termed Fully Test-time Adaptation. It aims to adapt a well-trained model to unlabeled test data by handling potential data distribution shifts at test time without access to training data and test labels. However, applying this paradigm in Mono 3Det poses significant challenges due to OOD test data causing a remarkable decline in object detection scores. This decline conflicts with the pre-defined score thresholds of existing detection methods, leading to severe object omissions (i.e., rare positive detections and many false negatives). Consequently, the limited positive detection and plenty of noisy predictions cause test-time adaptation to fail in Mono 3Det. To handle this problem, we propose a novel Monocular Test-Time Adaptation (MonoTTA) method, based on two new strategies. 1) Reliability-driven adaptation: we empirically find that high-score objects are still reliable and the optimization of high-score objects can enhance confidence across all detections. Thus, we devise a self-adaptive strategy to identify reliable objects for model adaptation, which discovers potential objects and alleviates omissions. 2) Noise-guard adaptation: since high-score objects may be scarce, we develop a negative regularization term to exploit the numerous low-score objects via negative learning, preventing overfitting to noise and trivial solutions. Experimental results show that MonoTTA brings significant performance gains for Mono 3Det models in OOD test scenarios, approximately 190% gains by average on KITTI and 198% gains on nuScenes.

- **Summary**: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) is a challenging research task in the field of computer vision. Although hundreds of UIE algorithms have been proposed, a comprehensive and systematic review is still lacking. To promote future research, we summarize the UIE task from multiple perspectives. First, the physical models, data construction processes, evaluation metrics, and loss functions are introduced. Second, according to the contributions brought by different literatures, recent proposed algorithms are discussed and classified from six perspectives, namely network architecture, learning strategy, learning stage, assistance task, domain perspective and disentanglement fusion, respectively. Third, considering the inconsistencies in experimental settings in different literatures, a comprehensive and fair comparison does not yet exist. To this end, we quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate state-of-the-art algorithms on multiple benchmark datasets. Finally, issues worthy of further research in the UIE task are raised. A collection of useful materials is available at https://github.com/YuZhao1999/UIE.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving demands an integrated approach that encompasses perception, prediction, and planning, all while operating under strict energy constraints to enhance scalability and environmental sustainability. We present Spiking Autonomous Driving (\name{}), the first unified Spiking Neural Network (SNN) to address the energy challenges faced by autonomous driving systems through its event-driven and energy-efficient nature. SAD is trained end-to-end and consists of three main modules: perception, which processes inputs from multi-view cameras to construct a spatiotemporal bird's eye view; prediction, which utilizes a novel dual-pathway with spiking neurons to forecast future states; and planning, which generates safe trajectories considering predicted occupancy, traffic rules, and ride comfort. Evaluated on the nuScenes dataset, SAD achieves competitive performance in perception, prediction, and planning tasks, while drawing upon the energy efficiency of SNNs. This work highlights the potential of neuromorphic computing to be applied to energy-efficient autonomous driving, a critical step toward sustainable and safety-critical automotive technology.

- **Summary**: Parametric 3D models have enabled a wide variety of computer vision and graphics tasks, such as modeling human faces, bodies and hands. In 3D face modeling, 3DMM is the most widely used parametric model, but can't generate fine geometric details solely from identity and expression inputs. To tackle this limitation, we propose a neural parametric model named DNPM for the facial geometric details, which utilizes deep neural network to extract latent codes from facial displacement maps encoding details and wrinkles. Built upon DNPM, a novel 3DMM named Detailed3DMM is proposed, which augments traditional 3DMMs by including the synthesis of facial details only from the identity and expression inputs. Moreover, we show that DNPM and Detailed3DMM can facilitate two downstream applications: speech-driven detailed 3D facial animation and 3D face reconstruction from a degraded image. Extensive experiments have shown the usefulness of DNPM and Detailed3DMM, and the progressiveness of two proposed applications.

- **Summary**: Sign language video retrieval plays a key role in facilitating information access for the deaf community. Despite significant advances in video-text retrieval, the complexity and inherent uncertainty of sign language preclude the direct application of these techniques. Previous methods achieve the mapping between sign language video and text through fine-grained modal alignment. However, due to the scarcity of fine-grained annotation, the uncertainty inherent in sign language video is underestimated, limiting the further development of sign language retrieval tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Uncertainty-aware Probability Distribution Retrieval (UPRet), that conceptualizes the mapping process of sign language video and text in terms of probability distributions, explores their potential interrelationships, and enables flexible mappings. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves state-of-the-art results on How2Sign (59.1%), PHOENIX-2014T (72.0%), and CSL-Daily (78.4%).

- **Summary**: In real-world scenarios, person Re-IDentification (Re-ID) systems need to be adaptable to changes in space and time. Therefore, the adaptation of Re-ID models to new domains while preserving previously acquired knowledge is crucial, known as Lifelong person Re-IDentification (LReID). Advanced LReID methods rely on replaying exemplars from old domains and applying knowledge distillation in logits with old models. However, due to privacy concerns, retaining previous data is inappropriate. Additionally, the fine-grained and open-set characteristics of Re-ID limit the effectiveness of the distillation paradigm for accumulating knowledge. We argue that a Re-ID model trained on diverse and challenging pedestrian images at a large scale can acquire robust and general human semantic knowledge. These semantics can be readily utilized as shared knowledge for lifelong applications. In this paper, we identify the challenges and discrepancies associated with adapting a pre-trained model to each application domain, and introduce the Distribution Aligned Semantics Adaption (DASA) framework. It efficiently adjusts Batch Normalization (BN) to mitigate interference from data distribution discrepancy and freezes the pre-trained convolutional layers to preserve shared knowledge. Additionally, we propose the lightweight Semantics Adaption (SA) module, which effectively adapts learned semantics to enhance pedestrian representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable superiority of our proposed framework over advanced LReID methods, and it exhibits significantly reduced storage consumption. DASA presents a novel and cost-effective perspective on effectively adapting pre-trained models for LReID.

- **Summary**: The objective of Domain Generalization (DG) is to devise algorithms and models capable of achieving high performance on previously unseen test distributions. In the pursuit of this objective, average measure has been employed as the prevalent measure for evaluating models and comparing algorithms in the existing DG studies. Despite its significance, a comprehensive exploration of the average measure has been lacking and its suitability in approximating the true domain generalization performance has been questionable. In this study, we carefully investigate the limitations inherent in the average measure and propose worst+gap measure as a robust alternative. We establish theoretical grounds of the proposed measure by deriving two theorems starting from two different assumptions. We conduct extensive experimental investigations to compare the proposed worst+gap measure with the conventional average measure. Given the indispensable need to access the true DG performance for studying measures, we modify five existing datasets to come up with SR-CMNIST, C-Cats&Dogs, L-CIFAR10, PACS-corrupted, and VLCS-corrupted datasets. The experiment results unveil an inferior performance of the average measure in approximating the true DG performance and confirm the robustness of the theoretically supported worst+gap measure.

- **Summary**: Recently, video generation techniques have advanced rapidly. Given the popularity of video content on social media platforms, these models intensify concerns about the spread of fake information. Therefore, there is a growing demand for detectors capable of distinguishing between fake AI-generated videos and mitigating the potential harm caused by fake information. However, the lack of large-scale datasets from the most advanced video generators poses a barrier to the development of such detectors. To address this gap, we introduce the first AI-generated video detection dataset, GenVideo. It features the following characteristics: (1) a large volume of videos, including over one million AI-generated and real videos collected; (2) a rich diversity of generated content and methodologies, covering a broad spectrum of video categories and generation techniques. We conducted extensive studies of the dataset and proposed two evaluation methods tailored for real-world-like scenarios to assess the detectors' performance: the cross-generator video classification task assesses the generalizability of trained detectors on generators; the degraded video classification task evaluates the robustness of detectors to handle videos that have degraded in quality during dissemination. Moreover, we introduced a plug-and-play module, named Detail Mamba (DeMamba), designed to enhance the detectors by identifying AI-generated videos through the analysis of inconsistencies in temporal and spatial dimensions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate DeMamba's superior generalizability and robustness on GenVideo compared to existing detectors. We believe that the GenVideo dataset and the DeMamba module will significantly advance the field of AI-generated video detection. Our code and dataset will be aviliable at \url{https://github.com/chenhaoxing/DeMamba}.

- **Summary**: With the advancement of image-to-image diffusion models guided by text, significant progress has been made in image editing. However, a persistent challenge remains in seamlessly incorporating objects into images based on textual instructions, without relying on extra user-provided guidance. Text and images are inherently distinct modalities, bringing out difficulties in fully capturing the semantic intent conveyed through language and accurately translating that into the desired visual modifications. Therefore, text-guided image editing models often produce generations with residual object attributes that do not fully align with human expectations. To address this challenge, the models should comprehend the image content effectively away from a disconnect between the provided textual editing prompts and the actual modifications made to the image. In our paper, we propose a novel method called Locate and Forget (LaF), which effectively locates potential target concepts in the image for modification by comparing the syntactic trees of the target prompt and scene descriptions in the input image, intending to forget their existence clues in the generated image. Compared to the baselines, our method demonstrates its superiority in text-guided image editing tasks both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: No augmented application is possible without animated humanoid avatars. At the same time, generating human replicas from real-world monocular hand-held or robotic sensor setups is challenging due to the limited availability of views. Previous work showed the feasibility of virtual avatars but required the presence of 360 degree views of the targeted subject. To address this issue, we propose HINT, a NeRF-based algorithm able to learn a detailed and complete human model from limited viewing angles. We achieve this by introducing a symmetry prior, regularization constraints, and training cues from large human datasets. In particular, we introduce a sagittal plane symmetry prior to the appearance of the human, directly supervise the density function of the human model using explicit 3D body modeling, and leverage a co-learned human digitization network as additional supervision for the unseen angles. As a result, our method can reconstruct complete humans even from a few viewing angles, increasing performance by more than 15% PSNR compared to previous state-of-the-art algorithms.

- **Summary**: Large vision language models (LVLMs) integrate large language models (LLMs) with pre-trained vision encoders, thereby activating the perception capability of the model to understand image inputs for different queries and conduct subsequent reasoning. Improving this capability requires high-quality vision-language data, which is costly and labor-intensive to acquire. Self-training approaches have been effective in single-modal settings to alleviate the need for labeled data by leveraging model's own generation. However, effective self-training remains a challenge regarding the unique visual perception and reasoning capability of LVLMs. To address this, we introduce Self-Training on Image Comprehension (STIC), which emphasizes a self-training approach specifically for image comprehension. First, the model self-constructs a preference dataset for image descriptions using unlabeled images. Preferred responses are generated through a step-by-step prompt, while dis-preferred responses are generated from either corrupted images or misleading prompts. To further self-improve reasoning on the extracted visual information, we let the model reuse a small portion of existing instruction-tuning data and append its self-generated image descriptions to the prompts. We validate the effectiveness of STIC across seven different benchmarks, demonstrating substantial performance gains of 4.0% on average while using 70% less supervised fine-tuning data than the current method. Further studies investigate various components of STIC and highlight its potential to leverage vast quantities of unlabeled images for self-training. Code and data are made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Event camera has significant advantages in capturing dynamic scene information while being prone to noise interference, particularly in challenging conditions like low threshold and low illumination. However, most existing research focuses on gentle situations, hindering event camera applications in realistic complex scenarios. To tackle this limitation and advance the field, we construct a new paired real-world event denoising dataset (LED), including 3K sequences with 18K seconds of high-resolution (1200*680) event streams and showing three notable distinctions compared to others: diverse noise levels and scenes, larger-scale with high-resolution, and high-quality GT. Specifically, it contains stepped parameters and varying illumination with diverse scenarios. Moreover, based on the property of noise events inconsistency and signal events consistency, we propose a novel effective denoising framework(DED) using homogeneous dual events to generate the GT with better separating noise from the raw. Furthermore, we design a bio-inspired baseline leveraging Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons with dynamic thresholds to realize accurate denoising. The experimental results demonstrate that the remarkable performance of the proposed approach on different datasets.The dataset and code are at https://github.com/Yee-Sing/led.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised vision clustering, a cornerstone in computer vision, has been studied for decades, yielding significant outcomes across numerous vision tasks. However, these algorithms involve substantial computational demands when confronted with vast amounts of unlabeled data. Conversely, Quantum computing holds promise in expediting unsupervised algorithms when handling large-scale databases. In this study, we introduce QClusformer, a pioneering Transformer-based framework leveraging Quantum machines to tackle unsupervised vision clustering challenges. Specifically, we design the Transformer architecture, including the self-attention module and transformer blocks, from a Quantum perspective to enable execution on Quantum hardware. In addition, we present QClusformer, a variant based on the Transformer architecture, tailored for unsupervised vision clustering tasks. By integrating these elements into an end-to-end framework, QClusformer consistently outperforms previous methods running on classical computers. Empirical evaluations across diverse benchmarks, including MS-Celeb-1M and DeepFashion, underscore the superior performance of QClusformer compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Seeking answers effectively for long videos is essential to build video question answering (videoQA) systems. Previous methods adaptively select frames and regions from long videos to save computations. However, this fails to reason over the whole sequence of video, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address this problem, we introduce a state space layer (SSL) into multi-modal Transformer to efficiently integrate global semantics of the video, which mitigates the video information loss caused by frame and region selection modules. Our SSL includes a gating unit to enable controllability over the flow of global semantics into visual representations. To further enhance the controllability, we introduce a cross-modal compositional congruence (C^3) objective to encourage global semantics aligned with the question. To rigorously evaluate long-form videoQA capacity, we construct two new benchmarks Ego-QA and MAD-QA featuring videos of considerably long length, i.e. 17.5 minutes and 1.9 hours, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework on these new as well as existing datasets.

- **Summary**: Although quantum machine learning has been introduced for a while, its applications in computer vision are still limited. This paper, therefore, revisits the quantum visual encoding strategies, the initial step in quantum machine learning. Investigating the root cause, we uncover that the existing quantum encoding design fails to ensure information preservation of the visual features after the encoding process, thus complicating the learning process of the quantum machine learning models. In particular, the problem, termed "Quantum Information Gap" (QIG), leads to a gap of information between classical and corresponding quantum features. We provide theoretical proof and practical demonstrations of that found and underscore the significance of QIG, as it directly impacts the performance of quantum machine learning algorithms. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a simple but efficient new loss function named Quantum Information Preserving (QIP) to minimize this gap, resulting in enhanced performance of quantum machine learning algorithms. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing superior performance compared to current methodologies and consistently achieving state-of-the-art results in quantum modeling.

- **Summary**: We present a novel task called online video editing, which is designed to edit \textbf{streaming} frames while maintaining temporal consistency. Unlike existing offline video editing assuming all frames are pre-established and accessible, online video editing is tailored to real-life applications such as live streaming and online chat, requiring (1) fast continual step inference, (2) long-term temporal modeling, and (3) zero-shot video editing capability. To solve these issues, we propose Streaming Video Diffusion (SVDiff), which incorporates the compact spatial-aware temporal recurrence into off-the-shelf Stable Diffusion and is trained with the segment-level scheme on large-scale long videos. This simple yet effective setup allows us to obtain a single model that is capable of executing a broad range of videos and editing each streaming frame with temporal coherence. Our experiments indicate that our model can edit long, high-quality videos with remarkable results, achieving a real-time inference speed of 15.2 FPS at a resolution of 512x512.

- **Summary**: Segmenting dance video into short movements is a popular way to easily understand dance choreography. However, it is currently done manually and requires a significant amount of effort by experts. That is, even if many dance videos are available on social media (e.g., TikTok and YouTube), it remains difficult for people, especially novices, to casually watch short video segments to practice dance choreography. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically segment a dance video into each movement. Given a dance video as input, we first extract visual and audio features: the former is computed from the keypoints of the dancer in the video, and the latter is computed from the Mel spectrogram of the music in the video. Next, these features are passed to a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), and segmentation points are estimated by picking peaks of the network output. To build our training dataset, we annotate segmentation points to dance videos in the AIST Dance Video Database, which is a shared database containing original street dance videos with copyright-cleared dance music. The evaluation study shows that the proposed method (i.e., combining the visual and audio features) can estimate segmentation points with high accuracy. In addition, we developed an application to help dancers practice choreography using the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Learning a skill generally relies on both practical experience by doer and insightful high-level guidance by instructor. Will this strategy also work well for solving complex non-convex optimization problems? Here, a common gradient-based optimizer acts like a disciplined doer, making locally optimal update at each step. Recent methods utilize large language models (LLMs) to optimize solutions for concrete problems by inferring from natural language instructions, akin to a high-level instructor. In this paper, we show that these two optimizers are complementary to each other, suggesting a collaborative optimization approach. The gradient-based optimizer and LLM-based optimizer are combined in an interleaved manner. We instruct LLMs using task descriptions and timely optimization trajectories recorded during gradient-based optimization. Inferred results from LLMs are used as restarting points for the next stage of gradient optimization. By leveraging both the locally rigorous gradient-based optimizer and the high-level deductive LLM-based optimizer, our combined optimization method consistently yields improvements over competitive baseline prompt tuning methods. Our results demonstrate the synergistic effect of conventional gradient-based optimization and the inference ability of LLMs. The code is released at https://github.com/guozix/LLM-catalyst.

- **Summary**: Thanks to the application of deep learning technology in point cloud processing of the remote sensing field, point cloud segmentation has become a research hotspot in recent years, which can be applied to real-world 3D, smart cities, and other fields. Although existing solutions have made unprecedented progress, they ignore the inherent characteristics of point clouds in remote sensing fields that are strictly arranged according to latitude, longitude, and altitude, which brings great convenience to the segmentation of point clouds in remote sensing fields. To consider this property cleverly, we propose novel convolution operators, termed Twin Deformable point Convolutions (TDConvs), which aim to achieve adaptive feature learning by learning deformable sampling points in the latitude-longitude plane and altitude direction, respectively. First, to model the characteristics of the latitude-longitude plane, we propose a Cylinder-wise Deformable point Convolution (CyDConv) operator, which generates a two-dimensional cylinder map by constructing a cylinder-like grid in the latitude-longitude direction. Furthermore, to better integrate the features of the latitude-longitude plane and the spatial geometric features, we perform a multi-scale fusion of the extracted latitude-longitude features and spatial geometric features, and realize it through the aggregation of adjacent point features of different scales. In addition, a Sphere-wise Deformable point Convolution (SpDConv) operator is introduced to adaptively offset the sampling points in three-dimensional space by constructing a sphere grid structure, aiming at modeling the characteristics in the altitude direction. Experiments on existing popular benchmarks conclude that our TDConvs achieve the best segmentation performance, surpassing the existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: We hypothesize dance as a motion that forms a visual rhythm from music, where the visual rhythm can be perceived from an optical flow. If an agent can recognize the relationship between visual rhythm and music, it will be able to dance by generating a motion to create a visual rhythm that matches the music. Based on this, we propose a framework for any kind of non-humanoid agents to learn how to dance from human videos. Our framework works in two processes: (1) training a reward model which perceives the relationship between optical flow (visual rhythm) and music from human dance videos, (2) training the non-humanoid dancer based on that reward model, and reinforcement learning. Our reward model consists of two feature encoders for optical flow and music. They are trained based on contrastive learning which makes the higher similarity between concurrent optical flow and music features. With this reward model, the agent learns dancing by getting a higher reward when its action creates an optical flow whose feature has a higher similarity with the given music feature. Experiment results show that generated dance motion can align with the music beat properly, and user study result indicates that our framework is more preferred by humans compared to the baselines. To the best of our knowledge, our work of non-humanoid agents which learn dance from human videos is unprecedented. An example video can be found at https://youtu.be/dOUPvo-O3QY.

- **Summary**: Forecasting future scenarios in dynamic environments is essential for intelligent decision-making and navigation, a challenge yet to be fully realized in computer vision and robotics. Traditional approaches like video prediction and novel-view synthesis either lack the ability to forecast from arbitrary viewpoints or to predict temporal dynamics. In this paper, we introduce GaussianPrediction, a novel framework that empowers 3D Gaussian representations with dynamic scene modeling and future scenario synthesis in dynamic environments. GaussianPrediction can forecast future states from any viewpoint, using video observations of dynamic scenes. To this end, we first propose a 3D Gaussian canonical space with deformation modeling to capture the appearance and geometry of dynamic scenes, and integrate the lifecycle property into Gaussians for irreversible deformations. To make the prediction feasible and efficient, a concentric motion distillation approach is developed by distilling the scene motion with key points. Finally, a Graph Convolutional Network is employed to predict the motions of key points, enabling the rendering of photorealistic images of future scenarios. Our framework shows outstanding performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its efficacy in predicting and rendering future environments.

- **Summary**: Purpose: Semantic segmentation and landmark detection are fundamental tasks of medical image processing, facilitating further analysis of anatomical objects. Although deep learning-based pixel-wise classification has set a new-state-of-the-art for segmentation, it falls short in landmark detection, a strength of shape-based approaches.   Methods: In this work, we propose a dense image-to-shape representation that enables the joint learning of landmarks and semantic segmentation by employing a fully convolutional architecture. Our method intuitively allows the extraction of arbitrary landmarks due to its representation of anatomical correspondences. We benchmark our method against the state-of-the-art for semantic segmentation (nnUNet), a shape-based approach employing geometric deep learning and a CNN-based method for landmark detection.   Results: We evaluate our method on two medical dataset: one common benchmark featuring the lungs, heart, and clavicle from thorax X-rays, and another with 17 different bones in the paediatric wrist. While our method is on pair with the landmark detection baseline in the thorax setting (error in mm of $2.6\pm0.9$ vs $2.7\pm0.9$), it substantially surpassed it in the more complex wrist setting ($1.1\pm0.6$ vs $1.9\pm0.5$).   Conclusion: We demonstrate that dense geometric shape representation is beneficial for challenging landmark detection tasks and outperforms previous state-of-the-art using heatmap regression. While it does not require explicit training on the landmarks themselves, allowing for the addition of new landmarks without necessitating retraining.}

- **Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently gained substantial attention in both industrial and academic fields for their superior visual generation capabilities, outperforming traditional diffusion models that use U-Net. However,the enhanced performance of DiTs also comes with high parameter counts and implementation costs, seriously restricting their use on resource-limited devices such as mobile phones. To address these challenges, we introduce the Hybrid Floating-point Quantization for DiT(HQ-DiT), an efficient post-training quantization method that utilizes 4-bit floating-point (FP) precision on both weights and activations for DiT inference. Compared to fixed-point quantization (e.g., INT8), FP quantization, complemented by our proposed clipping range selection mechanism, naturally aligns with the data distribution within DiT, resulting in a minimal quantization error. Furthermore, HQ-DiT also implements a universal identity mathematical transform to mitigate the serious quantization error caused by the outliers. The experimental results demonstrate that DiT can achieve extremely low-precision quantization (i.e., 4 bits) with negligible impact on performance. Our approach marks the first instance where both weights and activations in DiTs are quantized to just 4 bits, with only a 0.12 increase in sFID on ImageNet.

- **Summary**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a valuable tool for assisting radiologists in breast cancer detection and diagnosis. However, the success of AI applications in this domain is restricted by the quantity and quality of available data, posing challenges due to limited and costly data annotation procedures that often lead to annotation shifts. This study simulates, analyses and mitigates annotation shifts in cancer classification in the breast mammography domain. First, a high-accuracy cancer risk prediction model is developed, which effectively distinguishes benign from malignant lesions. Next, model performance is used to quantify the impact of annotation shift. We uncover a substantial impact of annotation shift on multiclass classification performance particularly for malignant lesions. We thus propose a training data augmentation approach based on single-image generative models for the affected class, requiring as few as four in-domain annotations to considerably mitigate annotation shift, while also addressing dataset imbalance. Lastly, we further increase performance by proposing and validating an ensemble architecture based on multiple models trained under different data augmentation regimes. Our study offers key insights into annotation shift in deep learning breast cancer classification and explores the potential of single-image generative models to overcome domain shift challenges.

- **Summary**: Existing OCR engines or document image analysis systems typically rely on training separate models for text detection in varying scenarios and granularities, leading to significant computational complexity and resource demands. In this paper, we introduce "Detect Any Text" (DAT), an advanced paradigm that seamlessly unifies scene text detection, layout analysis, and document page detection into a cohesive, end-to-end model. This design enables DAT to efficiently manage text instances at different granularities, including *word*, *line*, *paragraph* and *page*. A pivotal innovation in DAT is the across-granularity interactive attention module, which significantly enhances the representation learning of text instances at varying granularities by correlating structural information across different text queries. As a result, it enables the model to achieve mutually beneficial detection performances across multiple text granularities. Additionally, a prompt-based segmentation module refines detection outcomes for texts of arbitrary curvature and complex layouts, thereby improving DAT's accuracy and expanding its real-world applicability. Experimental results demonstrate that DAT achieves state-of-the-art performances across a variety of text-related benchmarks, including multi-oriented/arbitrarily-shaped scene text detection, document layout analysis and page detection tasks.

- **Summary**: Although single-task medical image restoration (MedIR) has witnessed remarkable success, the limited generalizability of these methods poses a substantial obstacle to wider application. In this paper, we focus on the task of all-in-one medical image restoration, aiming to address multiple distinct MedIR tasks with a single universal model. Nonetheless, due to significant differences between different MedIR tasks, training a universal model often encounters task interference issues, where different tasks with shared parameters may conflict with each other in the gradient update direction. This task interference leads to deviation of the model update direction from the optimal path, thereby affecting the model's performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a task-adaptive routing strategy, allowing conflicting tasks to select different network paths in spatial and channel dimensions, thereby mitigating task interference. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed \textbf{A}ll-in-one \textbf{M}edical \textbf{I}mage \textbf{R}estoration (\textbf{AMIR}) network achieves state-of-the-art performance in three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis, both in single-task and all-in-one settings.

- **Summary**: Large-language models and large-vision models are increasingly capable of solving compositional reasoning tasks, as measured by breakthroughs in visual-question answering benchmarks. However, state-of-the-art solutions often involve careful construction of large pre-training and fine-tuning datasets, which can be expensive. The use of external tools, whether other ML models, search engines, or APIs, can significantly improve performance by breaking down high-level reasoning questions into sub-questions that are answerable by individual tools, but this approach has similar dataset construction costs to teach fine-tuned models how to use the available tools. We propose a technique in which existing training sets can be directly used for constructing computational environments with task metrics as rewards. This enables a model to autonomously teach itself to use itself or another model as a tool. By doing so, we augment training sets by integrating external signals. The proposed method starts with zero-shot prompts and iteratively refines them by selecting few-shot examples that maximize the task metric on the training set. Our experiments showcase how Gemini learns how to use itself, or another smaller and specialized model such as ScreenAI, to iteratively improve performance on training sets. Our approach successfully generalizes and improves upon zeroshot performance on charts, infographics, and document visual question-answering datasets

- **Summary**: Style transfer aims to render an image with the artistic features of a style image, while maintaining the original structure. Various methods have been put forward for this task, but some challenges still exist. For instance, it is difficult for CNN-based methods to handle global information and long-range dependencies between input images, for which transformer-based methods have been proposed. Although transformers can better model the relationship between content and style images, they require high-cost hardware and time-consuming inference. To address these issues, we design a novel transformer model that includes only the encoder, thus significantly reducing the computational cost. In addition, we also find that existing style transfer methods may lead to images under-stylied or missing content. In order to achieve better stylization, we design a content feature extractor and a style feature extractor, based on which pure content and style images can be fed to the transformer. Finally, we propose a novel network termed Puff-Net, i.e., pure content and style feature fusion network. Through qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of our model compared to state-of-the-art ones in the literature.

- **Summary**: Instruction following is crucial in contemporary LLM. However, when extended to multimodal setting, it often suffers from misalignment between specific textual instruction and targeted local region of an image. To achieve more accurate and nuanced multimodal instruction following, we introduce Instruction-guided Visual Masking (IVM), a new versatile visual grounding model that is compatible with diverse multimodal models, such as LMM and robot model. By constructing visual masks for instruction-irrelevant regions, IVM-enhanced multimodal models can effectively focus on task-relevant image regions to better align with complex instructions. Specifically, we design a visual masking data generation pipeline and create an IVM-Mix-1M dataset with 1 million image-instruction pairs. We further introduce a new learning technique, Discriminator Weighted Supervised Learning (DWSL) for preferential IVM training that prioritizes high-quality data samples. Experimental results on generic multimodal tasks such as VQA and embodied robotic control demonstrate the versatility of IVM, which as a plug-and-play tool, significantly boosts the performance of diverse multimodal models, yielding new state-of-the-art results across challenging multimodal benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/2toinf/IVM.

To alleviate these challenges, we introduce a novel visual question answering dataset. Our dataset offers two significant advancements over previous datasets: Firstly, it features videos captured using a 360-degree egocentric wearable camera, enabling observation of the entire surroundings, departing from the static image-centric nature of prior datasets. Secondly, unlike datasets centered on singular challenges, ours addresses multiple real-life obstacles simultaneously through an innovative visual-question answering framework. We validate our dataset using various state-of-the-art VideoQA methods and diverse metrics. Results indicate that while progress has been made, satisfactory performance levels for AI-powered assistive services remain elusive for visually impaired individuals. Additionally, our evaluation highlights the distinctive features of the proposed dataset, featuring ego-motion in videos captured via 360-degree cameras across varied scenarios.

- **Summary**: Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) is a common dimensionality reduction approach for time-series data which has been employed in a variety of domains, including classification and anomaly detection in time-series data. Domains also include shape recognition where the shape outline is converted into time-series data forinstance epoch classification of archived arrowheads. In this paper we propose a dimensionality reduction and shape recognition approach based on the SAX algorithm, an application which requires responses on cost efficient, IoT-like, platforms. The challenge is largely dealing with the computational expense of the SAX algorithm in IoT-like applications, from simple time-series dimension reduction through shape recognition. The approach is based on lowering the dimensional space while capturing and preserving the most representative features of the shape. We present three scenarios of increasing computational complexity backing up our statements with measurement of performance characteristics

- **Summary**: Underwater object tracking (UOT) is a foundational task for identifying and tracing submerged entities in underwater video sequences. However, current UOT datasets suffer from limitations in scale, diversity of target categories and scenarios covered, hindering the training and evaluation of modern tracking algorithms. To bridge this gap, we take the first step and introduce WebUOT-1M, \ie, the largest public UOT benchmark to date, sourced from complex and realistic underwater environments. It comprises 1.1 million frames across 1,500 video clips filtered from 408 target categories, largely surpassing previous UOT datasets, \eg, UVOT400. Through meticulous manual annotation and verification, we provide high-quality bounding boxes for underwater targets. Additionally, WebUOT-1M includes language prompts for video sequences, expanding its application areas, \eg, underwater vision-language tracking. Most existing trackers are tailored for open-air environments, leading to performance degradation when applied to UOT due to domain gaps. Retraining and fine-tuning these trackers are challenging due to sample imbalances and limited real-world underwater datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel omni-knowledge distillation framework based on WebUOT-1M, incorporating various strategies to guide the learning of the student Transformer. To the best of our knowledge, this framework is the first to effectively transfer open-air domain knowledge to the UOT model through knowledge distillation, as demonstrated by results on both existing UOT datasets and the newly proposed WebUOT-1M. Furthermore, we comprehensively evaluate WebUOT-1M using 30 deep trackers, showcasing its value as a benchmark for UOT research by presenting new challenges and opportunities for future studies. The complete dataset, codes and tracking results, will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing outdoor 3D scenes from temporal observations is a challenge that recent work on neural fields has offered a new avenue for. However, existing methods that recover scene properties, such as geometry, appearance, or radiance, solely from RGB captures often fail when handling poorly-lit or texture-deficient regions. Similarly, recovering scenes with scanning LiDAR sensors is also difficult due to their low angular sampling rate which makes recovering expansive real-world scenes difficult. Tackling these gaps, we introduce Gated Fields - a neural scene reconstruction method that utilizes active gated video sequences. To this end, we propose a neural rendering approach that seamlessly incorporates time-gated capture and illumination. Our method exploits the intrinsic depth cues in the gated videos, achieving precise and dense geometry reconstruction irrespective of ambient illumination conditions. We validate the method across day and night scenarios and find that Gated Fields compares favorably to RGB and LiDAR reconstruction methods. Our code and datasets are available at https://light.princeton.edu/gatedfields/.

- **Summary**: Collecting and annotating real-world data for the development of object detection models is a time-consuming and expensive process. In the military domain in particular, data collection can also be dangerous or infeasible. Training models on synthetic data may provide a solution for cases where access to real-world training data is restricted. However, bridging the reality gap between synthetic and real data remains a challenge. Existing methods usually build on top of baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models that have been shown to perform well when trained on real data, but have limited ability to perform well when trained on synthetic data. For example, some architectures allow for fine-tuning with the expectation of large quantities of training data and are prone to overfitting on synthetic data. Related work usually ignores various best practices from object detection on real data, e.g. by training on synthetic data from a single environment with relatively little variation. In this paper we propose a methodology for improving the performance of a pre-trained object detector when training on synthetic data. Our approach focuses on extracting the salient information from synthetic data without forgetting useful features learned from pre-training on real images. Based on the state of the art, we incorporate data augmentation methods and a Transformer backbone. Besides reaching relatively strong performance without any specialized synthetic data transfer methods, we show that our methods improve the state of the art on synthetic data trained object detection for the RarePlanes and DGTA-VisDrone datasets, and reach near-perfect performance on an in-house vehicle detection dataset.

- **Summary**: 2D keypoints are commonly used as an additional cue to refine estimated 3D human meshes. Current methods optimize the pose and shape parameters with a reprojection loss on the provided 2D keypoints. Such an approach, while simple and intuitive, has limited effectiveness because the optimal solution is hard to find in ambiguous parameter space and may sacrifice depth. Additionally, divergent gradients from distal joints complicate and deviate the refinement of proximal joints in the kinematic chain. To address these, we introduce Kinematic-Tree Rotation (KITRO), a novel mesh refinement strategy that explicitly models depth and human kinematic-tree structure. KITRO treats refinement from a bone-wise perspective. Unlike previous methods which perform gradient-based optimizations, our method calculates bone directions in closed form. By accounting for the 2D pose, bone length, and parent joint's depth, the calculation results in two possible directions for each child joint. We then use a decision tree to trace binary choices for all bones along the human skeleton's kinematic-tree to select the most probable hypothesis. Our experiments across various datasets and baseline models demonstrate that KITRO significantly improves 3D joint estimation accuracy and achieves an ideal 2D fit simultaneously.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) requires solid modeling of the region-semantic relationship, which could be learned from massive region-text pairs. However, such data is limited in practice due to significant annotation costs. In this work, we propose RTGen to generate scalable open-vocabulary region-text pairs and demonstrate its capability to boost the performance of open-vocabulary object detection. RTGen includes both text-to-region and region-to-text generation processes on scalable image-caption data. The text-to-region generation is powered by image inpainting, directed by our proposed scene-aware inpainting guider for overall layout harmony. For region-to-text generation, we perform multiple region-level image captioning with various prompts and select the best matching text according to CLIP similarity. To facilitate detection training on region-text pairs, we also introduce a localization-aware region-text contrastive loss that learns object proposals tailored with different localization qualities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RTGen can serve as a scalable, semantically rich, and effective source for open-vocabulary object detection and continue to improve the model performance when more data is utilized, delivering superior performance compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Capsule networks (CapsNets) were introduced to address convolutional neural networks limitations, learning object-centric representations that are more robust, pose-aware, and interpretable. They organize neurons into groups called capsules, where each capsule encodes the instantiation parameters of an object or one of its parts. Moreover, a routing algorithm connects capsules in different layers, thereby capturing hierarchical part-whole relationships in the data.   This thesis investigates the intriguing aspects of CapsNets and focuses on three key questions to unlock their full potential. First, we explore the effectiveness of the routing algorithm, particularly in small-sized networks. We propose a novel method that anneals the number of routing iterations during training, enhancing performance in architectures with fewer parameters.   Secondly, we investigate methods to extract more effective first-layer capsules, also known as primary capsules. By exploiting pruned backbones, we aim to improve computational efficiency by reducing the number of capsules while achieving high generalization. This approach reduces CapsNets memory requirements and computational effort.   Third, we explore part-relationship learning in CapsNets. Through extensive research, we demonstrate that capsules with low entropy can extract more concise and discriminative part-whole relationships compared to traditional capsule networks, even with reasonable network sizes.   Lastly, we showcase how CapsNets can be utilized in real-world applications, including autonomous localization of unmanned aerial vehicles, quaternion-based rotations prediction in synthetic datasets, and lung nodule segmentation in biomedical imaging.   The findings presented in this thesis contribute to a deeper understanding of CapsNets and highlight their potential to address complex computer vision challenges.

- **Summary**: Advances in NERFs have allowed for 3D scene reconstructions and novel view synthesis. Yet, efficiently editing these representations while retaining photorealism is an emerging challenge. Recent methods face three primary limitations: they're slow for interactive use, lack precision at object boundaries, and struggle to ensure multi-view consistency. We introduce IReNe to address these limitations, enabling swift, near real-time color editing in NeRF. Leveraging a pre-trained NeRF model and a single training image with user-applied color edits, IReNe swiftly adjusts network parameters in seconds. This adjustment allows the model to generate new scene views, accurately representing the color changes from the training image while also controlling object boundaries and view-specific effects. Object boundary control is achieved by integrating a trainable segmentation module into the model. The process gains efficiency by retraining only the weights of the last network layer. We observed that neurons in this layer can be classified into those responsible for view-dependent appearance and those contributing to diffuse appearance. We introduce an automated classification approach to identify these neuron types and exclusively fine-tune the weights of the diffuse neurons. This further accelerates training and ensures consistent color edits across different views. A thorough validation on a new dataset, with edited object colors, shows significant quantitative and qualitative advancements over competitors, accelerating speeds by 5x to 500x.

- **Summary**: We propose a dense image prediction out-of-distribution detection algorithm, called PixOOD, which does not require training on samples of anomalous data and is not designed for a specific application which avoids traditional training biases. In order to model the complex intra-class variability of the in-distribution data at the pixel level, we propose an online data condensation algorithm which is more robust than standard K-means and is easily trainable through SGD. We evaluate PixOOD on a wide range of problems. It achieved state-of-the-art results on four out of seven datasets, while being competitive on the rest.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation aims to transfer the pixel-wise knowledge from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. However, current UDA methods typically assume a shared label space between source and target, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where novel categories may emerge in the target domain. In this paper, we introduce Open-Set Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (OSDA-SS) for the first time, where the target domain includes unknown classes. We identify two major problems in the OSDA-SS scenario as follows: 1) the existing UDA methods struggle to predict the exact boundary of the unknown classes, and 2) they fail to accurately predict the shape of the unknown classes. To address these issues, we propose Boundary and Unknown Shape-Aware open-set domain adaptation, coined BUS. Our BUS can accurately discern the boundaries between known and unknown classes in a contrastive manner using a novel dilation-erosion-based contrastive loss. In addition, we propose OpenReMix, a new domain mixing augmentation method that guides our model to effectively learn domain and size-invariant features for improving the shape detection of the known and unknown classes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed BUS effectively detects unknown classes in the challenging OSDA-SS scenario compared to the previous methods by a large margin.

- **Summary**: This paper focuses on the area of RGB(visible)-NIR(near-infrared) cross-modality image registration, which is crucial for many downstream vision tasks to fully leverage the complementary information present in visible and infrared images. In this field, researchers face two primary challenges - the absence of a correctly-annotated benchmark with viewpoint variations for evaluating RGB-NIR cross-modality registration methods and the problem of inconsistent local features caused by the appearance discrepancy between RGB-NIR cross-modality images. To address these challenges, we first present the RGB-NIR Image Registration (RGB-NIR-IRegis) benchmark, which, for the first time, enables fair and comprehensive evaluations for the task of RGB-NIR cross-modality image registration. Evaluations of previous methods highlight the significant challenges posed by our RGB-NIR-IRegis benchmark, especially on RGB-NIR image pairs with viewpoint variations. To analyze the causes of the unsatisfying performance, we then design several metrics to reveal the toxic impact of inconsistent local features between visible and infrared images on the model performance. This further motivates us to develop a baseline method named Semantic Guidance Transformer (SGFormer), which utilizes high-level semantic guidance to mitigate the negative impact of local inconsistent features. Despite the simplicity of our motivation, extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: We address a novel cross-domain few-shot learning task (CD-FSL) with multimodal input and unlabeled target data for egocentric action recognition. This paper simultaneously tackles two critical challenges associated with egocentric action recognition in CD-FSL settings: (1) the extreme domain gap in egocentric videos (\eg, daily life vs. industrial domain) and (2) the computational cost for real-world applications. We propose MM-CDFSL, a domain-adaptive and computationally efficient approach designed to enhance adaptability to the target domain and improve inference speed. To address the first challenge, we propose the incorporation of multimodal distillation into the student RGB model using teacher models. Each teacher model is trained independently on source and target data for its respective modality. Leveraging only unlabeled target data during multimodal distillation enhances the student model's adaptability to the target domain. We further introduce ensemble masked inference, a technique that reduces the number of input tokens through masking. In this approach, ensemble prediction mitigates the performance degradation caused by masking, effectively addressing the second issue. Our approach outperformed the state-of-the-art CD-FSL approaches with a substantial margin on multiple egocentric datasets, improving by an average of 6.12/6.10 points for 1-shot/5-shot settings while achieving $2.2$ times faster inference speed.

- **Summary**: Autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars, rely on reliable semantic environment perception for decision making. Despite great advances in video semantic segmentation, existing approaches ignore important inductive biases and lack structured and interpretable internal representations. In this work, we propose MCDS-VSS, a structured filter model that learns in a self-supervised manner to estimate scene geometry and ego-motion of the camera, while also estimating the motion of external objects. Our model leverages these representations to improve the temporal consistency of semantic segmentation without sacrificing segmentation accuracy. MCDS-VSS follows a prediction-fusion approach in which scene geometry and camera motion are first used to compensate for ego-motion, then residual flow is used to compensate motion of dynamic objects, and finally the predicted scene features are fused with the current features to obtain a temporally consistent scene segmentation. Our model parses automotive scenes into multiple decoupled interpretable representations such as scene geometry, ego-motion, and object motion. Quantitative evaluation shows that MCDS-VSS achieves superior temporal consistency on video sequences while retaining competitive segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: Few-shot fine-tuning of Diffusion Models (DMs) is a key advancement, significantly reducing training costs and enabling personalized AI applications. However, we explore the training dynamics of DMs and observe an unanticipated phenomenon: during the training process, image fidelity initially improves, then unexpectedly deteriorates with the emergence of noisy patterns, only to recover later with severe overfitting. We term the stage with generated noisy patterns as corruption stage. To understand this corruption stage, we begin by theoretically modeling the one-shot fine-tuning scenario, and then extend this modeling to more general cases. Through this modeling, we identify the primary cause of this corruption stage: a narrowed learning distribution inherent in the nature of few-shot fine-tuning. To tackle this, we apply Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) on DMs with variational inference to implicitly broaden the learned distribution, and present that the learning target of the BNNs can be naturally regarded as an expectation of the diffusion loss and a further regularization with the pretrained DMs. This approach is highly compatible with current few-shot fine-tuning methods in DMs and does not introduce any extra inference costs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly mitigates corruption, and improves the fidelity, quality and diversity of the generated images in both object-driven and subject-driven generation tasks.

- **Summary**: Recent deep learning-based multi-view people detection (MVD) methods have shown promising results on existing datasets. However, current methods are mainly trained and evaluated on small, single scenes with a limited number of multi-view frames and fixed camera views. As a result, these methods may not be practical for detecting people in larger, more complex scenes with severe occlusions and camera calibration errors. This paper focuses on improving multi-view people detection by developing a supervised view-wise contribution weighting approach that better fuses multi-camera information under large scenes. Besides, a large synthetic dataset is adopted to enhance the model's generalization ability and enable more practical evaluation and comparison. The model's performance on new testing scenes is further improved with a simple domain adaptation technique. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving promising cross-scene multi-view people detection performance. See code here: https://vcc.tech/research/2024/MVD.



### Hyper-Transformer for Amodal Completion

- **Summary**: Amodal object completion is a complex task that involves predicting the invisible parts of an object based on visible segments and background information. Learning shape priors is crucial for effective amodal completion, but traditional methods often rely on two-stage processes or additional information, leading to inefficiencies and potential error accumulation. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel framework named the Hyper-Transformer Amodal Network (H-TAN). This framework utilizes a hyper transformer equipped with a dynamic convolution head to directly learn shape priors and accurately predict amodal masks. Specifically, H-TAN uses a dual-branch structure to extract multi-scale features from both images and masks. The multi-scale features from the image branch guide the hyper transformer in learning shape priors and in generating the weights for dynamic convolution tailored to each instance. The dynamic convolution head then uses the features from the mask branch to predict precise amodal masks. We extensively evaluate our model on three benchmark datasets: KINS, COCOA-cls, and D2SA, where H-TAN demonstrated superior performance compared to existing methods. Additional experiments validate the effectiveness and stability of the novel hyper transformer in our framework.

- **Summary**: As text-conditioned diffusion models (DMs) achieve breakthroughs in image, video, and 3D generation, the research community's focus has shifted to the more challenging task of text-to-4D synthesis, which introduces a temporal dimension to generate dynamic 3D objects. In this context, we identify Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), a widely used technique for text-to-3D synthesis, as a significant hindrance to text-to-4D performance due to its Janus-faced and texture-unrealistic problems coupled with high computational costs. In this paper, we propose \textbf{P}ixel-\textbf{L}evel \textbf{A}lignments for Text-to-\textbf{4D} Gaussian Splatting (\textbf{PLA4D}), a novel method that utilizes text-to-video frames as explicit pixel alignment targets to generate static 3D objects and inject motion into them. Specifically, we introduce Focal Alignment to calibrate camera poses for rendering and GS-Mesh Contrastive Learning to distill geometry priors from rendered image contrasts at the pixel level. Additionally, we develop Motion Alignment using a deformation network to drive changes in Gaussians and implement Reference Refinement for smooth 4D object surfaces. These techniques enable 4D Gaussian Splatting to align geometry, texture, and motion with generated videos at the pixel level. Compared to previous methods, PLA4D produces synthesized outputs with better texture details in less time and effectively mitigates the Janus-faced problem. PLA4D is fully implemented using open-source models, offering an accessible, user-friendly, and promising direction for 4D digital content creation.

- **Summary**: Person Re-Identification (ReID) systems pose a significant security risk from backdoor attacks, allowing adversaries to evade tracking or impersonate others. Beyond recognizing this issue, we investigate how backdoor attacks can be deployed in real-world scenarios, where a ReID model is typically trained on data collected in the digital domain and then deployed in a physical environment. This attack scenario requires an attack flow that embeds backdoor triggers in the digital domain realistically enough to also activate the buried backdoor in person ReID models in the physical domain. This paper realizes this attack flow by leveraging a diffusion model to generate realistic accessories on pedestrian images (e.g., bags, hats, etc.) as backdoor triggers. However, the noticeable domain gap between the triggers generated by the off-the-shelf diffusion model and their physical counterparts results in a low attack success rate. Therefore, we introduce a novel diffusion-based physical backdoor attack (DiffPhysBA) method that adopts a training-free similarity-guided sampling process to enhance the resemblance between generated and physical triggers. Consequently, DiffPhysBA can generate realistic attributes as semantic-level triggers in the digital domain and provides higher physical ASR compared to the direct paste method by 25.6% on the real-world test set. Through evaluations on newly proposed real-world and synthetic ReID test sets, DiffPhysBA demonstrates an impressive success rate exceeding 90% in both the digital and physical domains. Notably, it excels in digital stealth metrics and can effectively evade state-of-the-art defense methods.

- **Summary**: Image quality assessment (IQA) plays a critical role in selecting high-quality images and guiding compression and enhancement methods in a series of applications. The blind IQA, which assesses the quality of in-the-wild images containing complex authentic distortions without reference images, poses greater challenges. Existing methods are limited to modeling a uniform distribution with local patches and are bothered by the gap between low and high-level visions (caused by widely adopted pre-trained classification networks). In this paper, we propose a novel IQA method called diffusion priors-based IQA (DP-IQA), which leverages the prior knowledge from the pre-trained diffusion model with its excellent powers to bridge semantic gaps in the perception of the visual quality of images. Specifically, we use pre-trained stable diffusion as the backbone, extract multi-level features from the denoising U-Net during the upsampling process at a specified timestep, and decode them to estimate the image quality score. The text and image adapters are adopted to mitigate the domain gap for downstream tasks and correct the information loss caused by the variational autoencoder bottleneck. Finally, we distill the knowledge in the above model into a CNN-based student model, significantly reducing the parameter to enhance applicability, with the student model performing similarly or even better than the teacher model surprisingly. Experimental results demonstrate that our DP-IQA achieves state-of-the-art results on various in-the-wild datasets with better generalization capability, which shows the superiority of our method in global modeling and utilizing the hierarchical feature clues of diffusion for evaluating image quality.

- **Summary**: Image Restoration (IR), a classic low-level vision task, has witnessed significant advancements through deep models that effectively model global information. Notably, the Vision Transformers (ViTs) emergence has further propelled these advancements. When computing, the self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of ViTs, tends to encompass all global cues, even those from semantically unrelated objects or regions. This inclusivity introduces computational inefficiencies, particularly noticeable with high input resolution, as it requires processing irrelevant information, thereby impeding efficiency. Additionally, for IR, it is commonly noted that small segments of a degraded image, particularly those closely aligned semantically, provide particularly relevant information to aid in the restoration process, as they contribute essential contextual cues crucial for accurate reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose boosting IR's performance by sharing the key semantics via Transformer for IR (i.e., SemanIR) in this paper. Specifically, SemanIR initially constructs a sparse yet comprehensive key-semantic dictionary within each transformer stage by establishing essential semantic connections for every degraded patch. Subsequently, this dictionary is shared across all subsequent transformer blocks within the same stage. This strategy optimizes attention calculation within each block by focusing exclusively on semantically related components stored in the key-semantic dictionary.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the significant challenge of recognizing behaviors in non-human primates, specifically focusing on chimpanzees. Automated behavior recognition is crucial for both conservation efforts and the advancement of behavioral research. However, it is significantly hindered by the labor-intensive process of manual video annotation. Despite the availability of large-scale animal behavior datasets, the effective application of machine learning models across varied environmental settings poses a critical challenge, primarily due to the variability in data collection contexts and the specificity of annotations.   In this paper, we introduce ChimpBehave, a novel dataset featuring over 2 hours of video (approximately 193,000 video frames) of zoo-housed chimpanzees, meticulously annotated with bounding boxes and behavior labels for action recognition. ChimpBehave uniquely aligns its behavior classes with existing datasets, allowing for the study of domain adaptation and cross-dataset generalization methods between different visual settings. Furthermore, we benchmark our dataset using a state-of-the-art CNN-based action recognition model, providing the first baseline results for both within and cross-dataset settings.

- **Summary**: Predicting future human behavior from egocentric videos is a challenging but critical task for human intention understanding. Existing methods for forecasting 2D hand positions rely on visual representations and mainly focus on hand-object interactions. In this paper, we investigate the hand forecasting task and tackle two significant issues that persist in the existing methods: (1) 2D hand positions in future frames are severely affected by ego-motions in egocentric videos; (2) prediction based on visual information tends to overfit to background or scene textures, posing a challenge for generalization on novel scenes or human behaviors. To solve the aforementioned problems, we propose EMAG, an ego-motion-aware and generalizable 2D hand forecasting method. In response to the first problem, we propose a method that considers ego-motion, represented by a sequence of homography matrices of two consecutive frames. We further leverage modalities such as optical flow, trajectories of hands and interacting objects, and ego-motions, thereby alleviating the second issue. Extensive experiments on two large-scale egocentric video datasets, Ego4D and EPIC-Kitchens 55, verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, our model outperforms prior methods by $7.0$\% on cross-dataset evaluations. Project page: https://masashi-hatano.github.io/EMAG/

- **Summary**: Gaussian SLAM systems have made significant advancements in improving the efficiency and fidelity of real-time reconstructions. However, these systems often encounter incomplete reconstructions in complex indoor environments, characterized by substantial holes due to unobserved geometry caused by obstacles or limited view angles. To address this challenge, we present Manhattan Gaussian SLAM (MG-SLAM), an RGB-D system that leverages the Manhattan World hypothesis to enhance geometric accuracy and completeness. By seamlessly integrating fused line segments derived from structured scenes, MG-SLAM ensures robust tracking in textureless indoor areas. Moreover, The extracted lines and planar surface assumption allow strategic interpolation of new Gaussians in regions of missing geometry, enabling efficient scene completion. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world scenes demonstrate that these advancements enable our method to achieve state-of-the-art performance, marking a substantial improvement in the capabilities of Gaussian SLAM systems.

- **Summary**: The lesion segmentation on endoscopic images is challenging due to its complex and ambiguous features. Fully-supervised deep learning segmentation methods can receive good performance based on entirely pixel-level labeled dataset but greatly increase experts' labeling burden. Semi-supervised and weakly supervised methods can ease labeling burden, but heavily strengthen the learning difficulty. To alleviate this difficulty, weakly semi-supervised segmentation adopts a new annotation protocol of adding a large number of point annotation samples into a few pixel-level annotation samples. However, existing methods only mine points' limited information while ignoring reliable prior surrounding the point annotations. In this paper, we propose a weakly semi-supervised method called Point-Neighborhood Learning (PNL) framework. To mine the prior of the pixels surrounding the annotated point, we transform a single-point annotation into a circular area named a point-neighborhood. We propose point-neighborhood supervision loss and pseudo-label scoring mechanism to enhance training supervision. Point-neighborhoods are also used to augment the data diversity. Our method greatly improves performance without changing the structure of segmentation network. Comprehensive experiments show the superiority of our method over the other existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in point-annotated medical images.

- **Summary**: Machine learning has revolutionized the field of agricultural science, particularly in the early detection and management of plant diseases, which are crucial for maintaining crop health and productivity. Leveraging advanced algorithms and imaging technologies, researchers are now able to identify and classify plant diseases with unprecedented accuracy and speed. Effective management of tomato diseases is crucial for enhancing agricultural productivity. The development and application of tomato disease classification methods are central to this objective. This paper introduces a cutting-edge technique for the detection and classification of tomato leaf diseases, utilizing insights from the latest pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. We propose a sophisticated approach within the domain of tensor subspace learning, known as Higher-Order Whitened Singular Value Decomposition (HOWSVD), designed to boost the discriminatory power of the system. Our approach to Tensor Subspace Learning is methodically executed in two phases, beginning with HOWSVD and culminating in Multilinear Discriminant Analysis (MDA). The efficacy of this innovative method was rigorously tested through comprehensive experiments on two distinct datasets, namely PlantVillage and the Taiwan dataset. The findings reveal that HOWSVD-MDA outperforms existing methods, underscoring its capability to markedly enhance the precision and dependability of diagnosing tomato leaf diseases. For instance, up to 98.36\% and 89.39\% accuracy scores have been achieved under PlantVillage and the Taiwan datasets, respectively.

- **Summary**: Appearance of a face can be greatly altered by growing a beard and mustache. The facial hairstyles in a pair of images can cause marked changes to the impostor distribution and the genuine distribution. Also, different distributions of facial hairstyle across demographics could cause a false impression of relative accuracy across demographics. We first show that, even though larger training sets boost the recognition accuracy on all facial hairstyles, accuracy variations caused by facial hairstyles persist regardless of the size of the training set. Then, we analyze the impact of having different fractions of the training data represent facial hairstyles. We created balanced training sets using a set of identities available in Webface42M that both have clean-shaven and facial hair images. We find that, even when a face recognition model is trained with a balanced clean-shaven / facial hair training set, accuracy variation on the test data does not diminish. Next, data augmentation is employed to further investigate the effect of facial hair distribution in training data by manipulating facial hair pixels with the help of facial landmark points and a facial hair segmentation model. Our results show facial hair causes an accuracy gap between clean-shaven and facial hair images, and this impact can be significantly different between African-Americans and Caucasians.

- **Summary**: In the wake of many new ML-inspired approaches for reconstructing and representing high-quality 3D content, recent hybrid and explicitly learned representations exhibit promising performance and quality characteristics. However, their scaling to higher dimensions is challenging, e.g. when accounting for dynamic content with respect to additional parameters such as material properties, illumination, or time. In this paper, we tackle these challenges for an explicit representations based on Gaussian mixture models. With our solutions, we arrive at efficient fitting of compact N-dimensional Gaussian mixtures and enable efficient evaluation at render time: For fast fitting and evaluation, we introduce a high-dimensional culling scheme that efficiently bounds N-D Gaussians, inspired by Locality Sensitive Hashing. For adaptive refinement yet compact representation, we introduce a loss-adaptive density control scheme that incrementally guides the use of additional capacity towards missing details. With these tools we can for the first time represent complex appearance that depends on many input dimensions beyond position or viewing angle within a compact, explicit representation optimized in minutes and rendered in milliseconds.

- **Summary**: Mood disorders, including depression and anxiety, often manifest through facial expressions. While previous research has explored the connection between facial features and emotions, machine learning algorithms for estimating mood disorder severity have been hindered by small datasets and limited real-world application. To address this gap, we analyzed facial videos of 11,427 participants, a dataset two orders of magnitude larger than previous studies. This comprehensive collection includes standardized facial expression videos from reading tasks, along with a detailed psychological scale that measures depression, anxiety, and stress. By examining the relationships among these emotional states and employing clustering analysis, we identified distinct subgroups embodying different emotional profiles. We then trained tree-based classifiers and deep learning models to estimate emotional states from facial features. Results indicate that models previously effective on small datasets experienced decreased performance when applied to our large dataset, highlighting the importance of data scale and mitigating overfitting in practical settings. Notably, our study identified subtle shifts in pupil dynamics and gaze orientation as potential markers of mood disorders, providing valuable information on the interaction between facial expressions and mental health. This research marks the first large-scale and comprehensive investigation of facial expressions in the context of mental health, laying the groundwork for future data-driven advancements in this field.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) contribute a powerful mechanism to understanding visual information building on large language models. However, MLLMs are notorious for suffering from hallucinations, especially when generating lengthy, detailed descriptions for images. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations stem from the inherent summarization mechanism of large language models, leading to excessive dependence on linguistic tokens while neglecting vision information. In this paper, we propose NoiseBoost, a broadly applicable and simple method for alleviating hallucinations for MLLMs through the integration of noise feature perturbations. Noise perturbation acts as a regularizer, facilitating a balanced distribution of attention weights among visual and linguistic tokens. Despite its simplicity, NoiseBoost consistently enhances the performance of MLLMs across common training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Further, NoiseBoost pioneerly enables semi-supervised learning for MLLMs, unleashing the power of unlabeled data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NoiseBoost improves dense caption accuracy by 8.1% with human evaluation and achieves comparable results with 50% of the data by mining unlabeled data.

- **Summary**: Human pose estimation is a key task in computer vision with various applications such as activity recognition and interactive systems. However, the lack of consistency in the annotated skeletons across different datasets poses challenges in developing universally applicable models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach integrating multi-teacher knowledge distillation with a unified skeleton representation. Our networks are jointly trained on the COCO and MPII datasets, containing 17 and 16 keypoints, respectively. We demonstrate enhanced adaptability by predicting an extended set of 21 keypoints, 4 (COCO) and 5 (MPII) more than original annotations, improving cross-dataset generalization. Our joint models achieved an average accuracy of 70.89 and 76.40, compared to 53.79 and 55.78 when trained on a single dataset and evaluated on both. Moreover, we also evaluate all 21 predicted points by our two models by reporting an AP of 66.84 and 72.75 on the Halpe dataset. This highlights the potential of our technique to address one of the most pressing challenges in pose estimation research and application - the inconsistency in skeletal annotations.

- **Summary**: Following the advent of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) era of large models, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with the ability to understand cross-modal interactions between vision and text have attracted wide attention. Adversarial examples with human-imperceptible perturbation are shown to possess a characteristic known as transferability, which means that a perturbation generated by one model could also mislead another different model. Augmenting the diversity in input data is one of the most significant methods for enhancing adversarial transferability. This method has been certified as a way to significantly enlarge the threat impact under black-box conditions. Research works also demonstrate that MLLMs can be exploited to generate adversarial examples in the white-box scenario. However, the adversarial transferability of such perturbations is quite limited, failing to achieve effective black-box attacks across different models. In this paper, we propose the Typographic-based Semantic Transfer Attack (TSTA), which is inspired by: (1) MLLMs tend to process semantic-level information; (2) Typographic Attack could effectively distract the visual information captured by MLLMs. In the scenarios of Harmful Word Insertion and Important Information Protection, our TSTA demonstrates superior performance.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present an approach in the Multimodal Learning Analytics field. Within this approach, we have developed a tool to visualize and analyze eye movement data collected during learning sessions in online courses. The tool is named VAAD (an acronym for Visual Attention Analysis Dashboard). These eye movement data have been gathered using an eye-tracker and subsequently processed and visualized for interpretation. The purpose of the tool is to conduct a descriptive analysis of the data by facilitating its visualization, enabling the identification of differences and learning patterns among various learner populations. Additionally, it integrates a predictive module capable of anticipating learner activities during a learning session. Consequently, VAAD holds the potential to offer valuable insights into online learning behaviors from both descriptive and predictive perspectives.

- **Summary**: Rapid detection and well-timed intervention are essential to mitigate the impacts of wildfires. Leveraging remote sensed data from satellite networks and advanced AI models to automatically detect hotspots (i.e., thermal anomalies caused by active fires) is an effective way to build wildfire monitoring systems. In this work, we propose a novel dataset containing time series of remotely sensed data related to European fire events and a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)-based model able to analyse multi-temporal data and identify hotspots in potentially near real time. We train and evaluate the performance of our model using our dataset and Thraws, a dataset of thermal anomalies including several fire events, obtaining an F1 score of 63.58.

- **Summary**: Very-High Resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery is increasingly accessible, but often lacks annotations for effective machine learning applications. Recent foundation models like GroundingDINO and Segment Anything (SAM) provide opportunities to automatically generate annotations. This study introduces FMARS (Foundation Model Annotations in Remote Sensing), a methodology leveraging VHR imagery and foundation models for fast and robust annotation. We focus on disaster management and provide a large-scale dataset with labels obtained from pre-event imagery over 19 disaster events, derived from the Maxar Open Data initiative. We train segmentation models on the generated labels, using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) techniques to increase transferability to real-world scenarios. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging foundation models to automatically annotate remote sensing data at scale, enabling robust downstream models for critical applications.

- **Summary**: The rapid advances in generative AI models have empowered the creation of highly realistic images with arbitrary content, raising concerns about potential misuse and harm, such as Deepfakes. Current research focuses on training detectors using large datasets of generated images. However, these training-based solutions are often computationally expensive and show limited generalization to unseen generated images. In this paper, we propose a training-free method to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. We first observe that real images are more robust to tiny noise perturbations than AI-generated images in the representation space of vision foundation models. Based on this observation, we propose RIGID, a training-free and model-agnostic method for robust AI-generated image detection. RIGID is a simple yet effective approach that identifies whether an image is AI-generated by comparing the representation similarity between the original and the noise-perturbed counterpart. Our evaluation on a diverse set of AI-generated images and benchmarks shows that RIGID significantly outperforms existing trainingbased and training-free detectors. In particular, the average performance of RIGID exceeds the current best training-free method by more than 25%. Importantly, RIGID exhibits strong generalization across different image generation methods and robustness to image corruptions.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we examine 3 important issues in the practical use of state-of-the-art facial landmark detectors and show how a combination of specific architectural modifications can directly improve their accuracy and temporal stability. First, many facial landmark detectors require face normalization as a preprocessing step, which is accomplished by a separately-trained neural network that crops and resizes the face in the input image. There is no guarantee that this pre-trained network performs the optimal face normalization for landmark detection. We instead analyze the use of a spatial transformer network that is trained alongside the landmark detector in an unsupervised manner, and jointly learn optimal face normalization and landmark detection. Second, we show that modifying the output head of the landmark predictor to infer landmarks in a canonical 3D space can further improve accuracy. To convert the predicted 3D landmarks into screen-space, we additionally predict the camera intrinsics and head pose from the input image. As a side benefit, this allows to predict the 3D face shape from a given image only using 2D landmarks as supervision, which is useful in determining landmark visibility among other things. Finally, when training a landmark detector on multiple datasets at the same time, annotation inconsistencies across datasets forces the network to produce a suboptimal average. We propose to add a semantic correction network to address this issue. This additional lightweight neural network is trained alongside the landmark detector, without requiring any additional supervision. While the insights of this paper can be applied to most common landmark detectors, we specifically target a recently-proposed continuous 2D landmark detector to demonstrate how each of our additions leads to meaningful improvements over the state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks.

- **Summary**: This review article discusses the roles of federated learning (FL) and transfer learning (TL) in cancer detection based on image analysis. These two strategies powered by machine learning have drawn a lot of attention due to their potential to increase the precision and effectiveness of cancer diagnosis in light of the growing importance of machine learning techniques in cancer detection. FL enables the training of machine learning models on data distributed across multiple sites without the need for centralized data sharing, while TL allows for the transfer of knowledge from one task to another. A comprehensive assessment of the two methods, including their strengths, and weaknesses is presented. Moving on, their applications in cancer detection are discussed, including potential directions for the future. Finally, this article offers a thorough description of the functions of TL and FL in image-based cancer detection. The authors also make insightful suggestions for additional study in this rapidly developing area.

This system comprises an anti-loss smart helmet, a cloud computing module, and an intelligent early warning application on the caregiver's mobile device. The smart helmet integrates a miniature camera module, a GPS module, and a 5G communication module to collect first-person images and location information of the elderly. Data is transmitted remotely via 5G, FTP, and TCP protocols. In the cloud computing module, our team has proposed for the first time a multimodal dangerous state recognition network based on scene and location information to accurately assess the risk of elderly individuals going missing. Finally, the application software interface designed for the caregiver's mobile device implements multi-level early warnings. The system developed by our team requires no operation or response from the elderly, achieving fully automatic environmental perception, risk assessment, and proactive alarming. This overcomes the limitations of traditional monitoring devices, which require active operation and response, thus avoiding the issue of the digital divide for the elderly. It effectively prevents accidental loss and potential dangers for elderly individuals with dementia.

- **Summary**: The advent of Vision Language Models (VLMs) transformed image understanding from closed-set classifications to dynamic image-language interactions, enabling open-vocabulary segmentation. Despite this flexibility, VLMs often fall behind closed-set classifiers in accuracy due to their reliance on ambiguous image captions and lack of domain-specific knowledge. We, therefore, introduce a new task domain adaptation for open-vocabulary segmentation, enhancing VLMs with domain-specific priors while preserving their open-vocabulary nature. Existing adaptation methods, when applied to segmentation tasks, improve performance on training queries but can reduce VLM performance on zero-shot text inputs. To address this shortcoming, we propose an approach that combines parameter-efficient prompt tuning with a triplet-loss-based training strategy. This strategy is designed to enhance open-vocabulary generalization while adapting to the visual domain. Our results outperform other parameter-efficient adaptation strategies in open-vocabulary segment classification tasks across indoor and outdoor datasets. Notably, our approach is the only one that consistently surpasses the original VLM on zero-shot queries. Our adapted VLMs can be plug-and-play integrated into existing open-vocabulary segmentation pipelines, improving OV-Seg by +6.0% mIoU on ADE20K, and OpenMask3D by +4.1% AP on ScanNet++ Offices without any changes to the methods.

- **Summary**: With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) possessing increasingly impressive capabilities, a number of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed to augment LLMs with visual inputs. Such models condition generated text on both an input image and a text prompt, enabling a variety of use cases such as visual question answering and multimodal chat. While prior studies have examined the social biases contained in text generated by LLMs, this topic has been relatively unexplored in LVLMs. Examining social biases in LVLMs is particularly challenging due to the confounding contributions of bias induced by information contained across the text and visual modalities. To address this challenging problem, we conduct a large-scale study of text generated by different LVLMs under counterfactual changes to input images. Specifically, we present LVLMs with identical open-ended text prompts while conditioning on images from different counterfactual sets, where each set contains images which are largely identical in their depiction of a common subject (e.g., a doctor), but vary only in terms of intersectional social attributes (e.g., race and gender). We comprehensively evaluate the text produced by different models under this counterfactual generation setting at scale, producing over 57 million responses from popular LVLMs. Our multi-dimensional analysis reveals that social attributes such as race, gender, and physical characteristics depicted in input images can significantly influence the generation of toxic content, competency-associated words, harmful stereotypes, and numerical ratings of depicted individuals. We additionally explore the relationship between social bias in LVLMs and their corresponding LLMs, as well as inference-time strategies to mitigate bias.

- **Summary**: Animation techniques bring digital 3D worlds and characters to life. However, manual animation is tedious and automated techniques are often specialized to narrow shape classes. In our work, we propose a technique for automatic re-animation of arbitrary 3D shapes based on a motion prior extracted from a video diffusion model. Unlike existing 4D generation methods, we focus solely on the motion, and we leverage an explicit mesh-based representation compatible with existing computer-graphics pipelines. Furthermore, our utilization of diffusion features enhances accuracy of our motion fitting. We analyze efficacy of these features for animation fitting and we experimentally validate our approach for two different diffusion models and four animation models. Finally, we demonstrate that our time-efficient zero-shot method achieves a superior performance re-animating a diverse set of 3D shapes when compared to existing techniques in a user study.

- **Summary**: Landslides are one of the most critical and destructive geohazards. Widespread development of human activities and settlements combined with the effects of climate change on weather are resulting in a high increase in the frequency and destructive power of landslides, making them a major threat to human life and the economy. In this paper, we explore methodologies to map newly-occurred landslides using Sentinel-2 imagery automatically. All approaches presented are framed as a bi-temporal change detection problem, requiring only a pair of Sentinel-2 images, taken respectively before and after a landslide-triggering event. Furthermore, we introduce a novel deep learning architecture for fusing Sentinel-2 bi-temporal image pairs with Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, showcasing its promising performances w.r.t. other change detection models in the literature. As a parallel task, we address limitations in existing datasets by creating a novel geodatabase, which includes manually validated open-access landslide inventories over heterogeneous ecoregions of the world. We release both code and dataset with an open-source license.

- **Summary**: World modelling, i.e. building a representation of the rules that govern the world so as to predict its evolution, is an essential ability for any agent interacting with the physical world. Recent applications of the Transformer architecture to the problem of world modelling from video input show notable improvements in sample efficiency. However, existing approaches tend to work only at the image level thus disregarding that the environment is composed of objects interacting with each other. In this paper, we propose an architecture combining Transformers for world modelling with the slot-attention paradigm, an approach for learning representations of objects appearing in a scene. We describe the resulting neural architecture and report experimental results showing an improvement over the existing solutions in terms of sample efficiency and a reduction of the variation of the performance over the training examples. The code for our architecture and experiments is available at https://github.com/torchipeppo/transformers-and-slot-encoding-for-wm

- **Summary**: Existing optimization-based methods for non-rigid registration typically minimize an alignment error metric based on the point-to-point or point-to-plane distance between corresponding point pairs on the source surface and target surface. However, these metrics can result in slow convergence or a loss of detail. In this paper, we propose SPARE, a novel formulation that utilizes a symmetrized point-to-plane distance for robust non-rigid registration. The symmetrized point-to-plane distance relies on both the positions and normals of the corresponding points, resulting in a more accurate approximation of the underlying geometry and can achieve higher accuracy than existing methods. To solve this optimization problem efficiently, we propose an alternating minimization solver using a majorization-minimization strategy. Moreover, for effective initialization of the solver, we incorporate a deformation graph-based coarse alignment that improves registration quality and efficiency. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method greatly improves the accuracy of non-rigid registration problems and maintains relatively high solution efficiency.

- **Summary**: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is widely used to train models to align images and texts in a common embedding space by mapping them to fixed-sized vectors. These models are key to multimodal information retrieval and related tasks. However, CLIP models generally underperform in text-only tasks compared to specialized text models. This creates inefficiencies for information retrieval systems that keep separate embeddings and models for text-only and multimodal tasks. We propose a novel, multi-task contrastive training method to address this issue, which we use to train the jina-clip-v1 model to achieve the state-of-the-art performance on both text-image and text-text retrieval tasks.

- **Summary**: The generation of high-quality human images through text-to-image (T2I) methods is a significant yet challenging task. Distinct from general image generation, human image synthesis must satisfy stringent criteria related to human pose, anatomy, and alignment with textual prompts, making it particularly difficult to achieve realistic results. Recent advancements in T2I generation based on diffusion models have shown promise, yet challenges remain in meeting human-specific preferences. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach tailored specifically for human image generation utilizing Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Specifically, we introduce an efficient method for constructing a specialized DPO dataset for training human image generation models without the need for costly human feedback. We also propose a modified loss function that enhances the DPO training process by minimizing artifacts and improving image fidelity. Our method demonstrates its versatility and effectiveness in generating human images, including personalized text-to-image generation. Through comprehensive evaluations, we show that our approach significantly advances the state of human image generation, achieving superior results in terms of natural anatomies, poses, and text-image alignment.

- **Summary**: We present MOFA-Video, an advanced controllable image animation method that generates video from the given image using various additional controllable signals (such as human landmarks reference, manual trajectories, and another even provided video) or their combinations. This is different from previous methods which only can work on a specific motion domain or show weak control abilities with diffusion prior. To achieve our goal, we design several domain-aware motion field adapters (\ie, MOFA-Adapters) to control the generated motions in the video generation pipeline. For MOFA-Adapters, we consider the temporal motion consistency of the video and generate the dense motion flow from the given sparse control conditions first, and then, the multi-scale features of the given image are wrapped as a guided feature for stable video diffusion generation. We naively train two motion adapters for the manual trajectories and the human landmarks individually since they both contain sparse information about the control. After training, the MOFA-Adapters in different domains can also work together for more controllable video generation.

- **Summary**: We present the Keras domain packages KerasCV and KerasNLP, extensions of the Keras API for Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing workflows, capable of running on either JAX, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. These domain packages are designed to enable fast experimentation, with a focus on ease-of-use and performance. We adopt a modular, layered design: at the library's lowest level of abstraction, we provide building blocks for creating models and data preprocessing pipelines, and at the library's highest level of abstraction, we provide pretrained ``task" models for popular architectures such as Stable Diffusion, YOLOv8, GPT2, BERT, Mistral, CLIP, Gemma, T5, etc. Task models have built-in preprocessing, pretrained weights, and can be fine-tuned on raw inputs. To enable efficient training, we support XLA compilation for all models, and run all preprocessing via a compiled graph of TensorFlow operations using the tf.data API. The libraries are fully open-source (Apache 2.0 license) and available on GitHub.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of deep learning solutions and the scarcity of large annotated datasets pose significant challenges in real-world applications. Various strategies have been explored to overcome this challenge, with data augmentation (DA) approaches emerging as prominent solutions. DA approaches involve generating additional examples by transforming existing labeled data, thereby enriching the dataset and helping deep learning models achieve improved generalization without succumbing to overfitting. In real applications, where solutions based on deep learning are widely used, there is facial expression recognition (FER), which plays an essential role in human communication, improving a range of knowledge areas (e.g., medicine, security, and marketing). In this paper, we propose a simple and comprehensive face data augmentation approach based on mixed face component regularization that outperforms the classical DA approaches from the literature, including the MixAugment which is a specific approach for the target task in two well-known FER datasets existing in the literature.

- **Summary**: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) has become ubiquitous to adapt foundation models to downstream task requirements while retaining their generalization ability. However, the amount of additionally introduced parameters and compute for successful adaptation and hyperparameter searches can explode quickly, especially when deployed at scale to serve numerous individual requests. To ensure effective, parameter-efficient, and hyperparameter-robust adaptation, we propose the ETHER transformation family, which performs Efficient fineTuning via HypErplane Reflections. By design, ETHER transformations require a minimal number of parameters, are less likely to deteriorate model performance, and exhibit robustness to hyperparameter and learning rate choices. In particular, we introduce ETHER and its relaxation ETHER+, which match or outperform existing PEFT methods with significantly fewer parameters ($\sim$$10$-$100$ times lower than LoRA or OFT) across multiple image synthesis and natural language tasks without exhaustive hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we investigate the recent emphasis on Hyperspherical Energy retention for adaptation and raise questions on its practical utility.

- **Summary**: Spatio-temporal compression of videos, utilizing networks such as Variational Autoencoders (VAE), plays a crucial role in OpenAI's SORA and numerous other video generative models. For instance, many LLM-like video models learn the distribution of discrete tokens derived from 3D VAEs within the VQVAE framework, while most diffusion-based video models capture the distribution of continuous latent extracted by 2D VAEs without quantization. The temporal compression is simply realized by uniform frame sampling which results in unsmooth motion between consecutive frames. Currently, there lacks of a commonly used continuous video (3D) VAE for latent diffusion-based video models in the research community. Moreover, since current diffusion-based approaches are often implemented using pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models, directly training a video VAE without considering the compatibility with existing T2I models will result in a latent space gap between them, which will take huge computational resources for training to bridge the gap even with the T2I models as initialization. To address this issue, we propose a method for training a video VAE of latent video models, namely CV-VAE, whose latent space is compatible with that of a given image VAE, e.g., image VAE of Stable Diffusion (SD). The compatibility is achieved by the proposed novel latent space regularization, which involves formulating a regularization loss using the image VAE. Benefiting from the latent space compatibility, video models can be trained seamlessly from pre-trained T2I or video models in a truly spatio-temporally compressed latent space, rather than simply sampling video frames at equal intervals. With our CV-VAE, existing video models can generate four times more frames with minimal finetuning. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed video VAE.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation and semantic image synthesis are two representative tasks in visual perception and generation. While existing methods consider them as two distinct tasks, we propose a unified diffusion-based framework (SemFlow) and model them as a pair of reverse problems. Specifically, motivated by rectified flow theory, we train an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model to transport between the distributions of real images and semantic masks. As the training object is symmetric, samples belonging to the two distributions, images and semantic masks, can be effortlessly transferred reversibly. For semantic segmentation, our approach solves the contradiction between the randomness of diffusion outputs and the uniqueness of segmentation results. For image synthesis, we propose a finite perturbation approach to enhance the diversity of generated results without changing the semantic categories. Experiments show that our SemFlow achieves competitive results on semantic segmentation and semantic image synthesis tasks. We hope this simple framework will motivate people to rethink the unification of low-level and high-level vision. Project page: https://github.com/wang-chaoyang/SemFlow.

- **Summary**: We present TetSphere splatting, an explicit, Lagrangian representation for reconstructing 3D shapes with high-quality geometry. In contrast to conventional object reconstruction methods which predominantly use Eulerian representations, including both neural implicit (e.g., NeRF, NeuS) and explicit representations (e.g., DMTet), and often struggle with high computational demands and suboptimal mesh quality, TetSphere splatting utilizes an underused but highly effective geometric primitive -- tetrahedral meshes. This approach directly yields superior mesh quality without relying on neural networks or post-processing. It deforms multiple initial tetrahedral spheres to accurately reconstruct the 3D shape through a combination of differentiable rendering and geometric energy optimization, resulting in significant computational efficiency. Serving as a robust and versatile geometry representation, Tet-Sphere splatting seamlessly integrates into diverse applications, including single-view 3D reconstruction, image-/text-to-3D content generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TetSphere splatting outperforms existing representations, delivering faster optimization speed, enhanced mesh quality, and reliable preservation of thin structures.

- **Summary**: The security threat of backdoor attacks is a central concern for deep neural networks (DNNs). Recently, without poisoned data, unlearning models with clean data and then learning a pruning mask have contributed to backdoor defense. Additionally, vanilla fine-tuning with those clean data can help recover the lost clean accuracy. However, the behavior of clean unlearning is still under-explored, and vanilla fine-tuning unintentionally induces back the backdoor effect. In this work, we first investigate model unlearning from the perspective of weight changes and gradient norms, and find two interesting observations in the backdoored model: 1) the weight changes between poison and clean unlearning are positively correlated, making it possible for us to identify the backdoored-related neurons without using poisoned data; 2) the neurons of the backdoored model are more active (i.e., larger changes in gradient norm) than those in the clean model, suggesting the need to suppress the gradient norm during fine-tuning. Then, we propose an effective two-stage defense method. In the first stage, an efficient Neuron Weight Change (NWC)-based Backdoor Reinitialization is proposed based on observation 1). In the second stage, based on observation 2), we design an Activeness-Aware Fine-Tuning to replace the vanilla fine-tuning. Extensive experiments, involving eight backdoor attacks on three benchmark datasets, demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to recent state-of-the-art backdoor defense approaches.

- **Summary**: CRATE, a white-box transformer architecture designed to learn compressed and sparse representations, offers an intriguing alternative to standard vision transformers (ViTs) due to its inherent mathematical interpretability. Despite extensive investigations into the scaling behaviors of language and vision transformers, the scalability of CRATE remains an open question which this paper aims to address. Specifically, we propose CRATE-$\alpha$, featuring strategic yet minimal modifications to the sparse coding block in the CRATE architecture design, and a light training recipe designed to improve the scalability of CRATE. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CRATE-$\alpha$ can effectively scale with larger model sizes and datasets. For example, our CRATE-$\alpha$-B substantially outperforms the prior best CRATE-B model accuracy on ImageNet classification by 3.7%, achieving an accuracy of 83.2%. Meanwhile, when scaling further, our CRATE-$\alpha$-L obtains an ImageNet classification accuracy of 85.1%. More notably, these model performance improvements are achieved while preserving, and potentially even enhancing the interpretability of learned CRATE models, as we demonstrate through showing that the learned token representations of increasingly larger trained CRATE-$\alpha$ models yield increasingly higher-quality unsupervised object segmentation of images.

- **Summary**: We introduce PlausiVL, a large video-language model for anticipating action sequences that are plausible in the real-world. While significant efforts have been made towards anticipating future actions, prior approaches do not take into account the aspect of plausibility in an action sequence. To address this limitation, we explore the generative capability of a large video-language model in our work and further, develop the understanding of plausibility in an action sequence by introducing two objective functions, a counterfactual-based plausible action sequence learning loss and a long-horizon action repetition loss. We utilize temporal logical constraints as well as verb-noun action pair logical constraints to create implausible/counterfactual action sequences and use them to train the model with plausible action sequence learning loss. This loss helps the model to differentiate between plausible and not plausible action sequences and also helps the model to learn implicit temporal cues crucial for the task of action anticipation. The long-horizon action repetition loss puts a higher penalty on the actions that are more prone to repetition over a longer temporal window. With this penalization, the model is able to generate diverse, plausible action sequences. We evaluate our approach on two large-scale datasets, Ego4D and EPIC-Kitchens-100, and show improvements on the task of action anticipation.

- **Summary**: Learning 3D scene representation from a single-view image is a long-standing fundamental problem in computer vision, with the inherent ambiguity in predicting contents unseen from the input view. Built on the recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), the Splatter Image method has made promising progress on fast single-image novel view synthesis via learning a single 3D Gaussian for each pixel based on the U-Net feature map of an input image. However, it has limited expressive power to represent occluded components that are not observable in the input view. To address this problem, this paper presents a Hierarchical Splatter Image method in which a pixel is worth more than one 3D Gaussians. Specifically,   each pixel is represented by a parent 3D Gaussian and a small number of child 3D Gaussians. Parent 3D Gaussians are learned as done in the vanilla Splatter Image. Child 3D Gaussians are learned via a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) which takes as input the projected image features of a parent 3D Gaussian and the embedding of a target camera view. Both parent and child 3D Gaussians are learned end-to-end in a stage-wise way. The joint condition of input image features from eyes of the parent Gaussians and the target camera position facilitates learning to allocate child Gaussians to ``see the unseen'', recovering the occluded details that are often missed by parent Gaussians.   In experiments, the proposed method is tested on the ShapeNet-SRN and CO3D datasets with state-of-the-art performance obtained, especially showing promising capabilities of reconstructing occluded contents in the input view.

- **Summary**: The ability to edit 3D assets from natural language presents a compelling paradigm to aid in the democratization of 3D content creation. However, while natural language is often effective at communicating general intent, it is poorly suited for specifying precise manipulation. To address this gap, we introduce ParSEL, a system that enables controllable editing of high-quality 3D assets from natural language. Given a segmented 3D mesh and an editing request, ParSEL produces a parameterized editing program. Adjusting the program parameters allows users to explore shape variations with a precise control over the magnitudes of edits. To infer editing programs which align with an input edit request, we leverage the abilities of large-language models (LLMs). However, while we find that LLMs excel at identifying initial edit operations, they often fail to infer complete editing programs, and produce outputs that violate shape semantics. To overcome this issue, we introduce Analytical Edit Propagation (AEP), an algorithm which extends a seed edit with additional operations until a complete editing program has been formed. Unlike prior methods, AEP searches for analytical editing operations compatible with a range of possible user edits through the integration of computer algebra systems for geometric analysis. Experimentally we demonstrate ParSEL's effectiveness in enabling controllable editing of 3D objects through natural language requests over alternative system designs.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have shown great promise for image and video generation, but sampling from state-of-the-art models requires expensive numerical integration of a generative ODE. One approach for tackling this problem is rectified flows, which iteratively learn smooth ODE paths that are less susceptible to truncation error. However, rectified flows still require a relatively large number of function evaluations (NFEs). In this work, we propose improved techniques for training rectified flows, allowing them to compete with knowledge distillation methods even in the low NFE setting. Our main insight is that under realistic settings, a single iteration of the Reflow algorithm for training rectified flows is sufficient to learn nearly straight trajectories; hence, the current practice of using multiple Reflow iterations is unnecessary. We thus propose techniques to improve one-round training of rectified flows, including a U-shaped timestep distribution and LPIPS-Huber premetric. With these techniques, we improve the FID of the previous 2-rectified flow by up to 72% in the 1 NFE setting on CIFAR-10. On ImageNet 64$\times$64, our improved rectified flow outperforms the state-of-the-art distillation methods such as consistency distillation and progressive distillation in both one-step and two-step settings and rivals the performance of improved consistency training (iCT) in FID.

- **Summary**: We present an object-centric approach to empower robots to learn vision-based manipulation skills from human videos. We investigate the problem of imitating robot manipulation from a single human video in the open-world setting, where a robot must learn to manipulate novel objects from one video demonstration. We introduce ORION, an algorithm that tackles the problem by extracting an object-centric manipulation plan from a single RGB-D video and deriving a policy that conditions on the extracted plan. Our method enables the robot to learn from videos captured by daily mobile devices such as an iPad and generalize the policies to deployment environments with varying visual backgrounds, camera angles, spatial layouts, and novel object instances. We systematically evaluate our method on both short-horizon and long-horizon tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of ORION in learning from a single human video in the open world.

- **Summary**: Photorealistic 3D reconstruction of street scenes is a critical technique for developing real-world simulators for autonomous driving. Despite the efficacy of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for driving scenes, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) emerges as a promising direction due to its faster speed and more explicit representation. However, most existing street 3DGS methods require tracked 3D vehicle bounding boxes to decompose the static and dynamic elements for effective reconstruction, limiting their applications for in-the-wild scenarios. To facilitate efficient 3D scene reconstruction without costly annotations, we propose a self-supervised street Gaussian ($\textit{S}^3$Gaussian) method to decompose dynamic and static elements from 4D consistency. We represent each scene with 3D Gaussians to preserve the explicitness and further accompany them with a spatial-temporal field network to compactly model the 4D dynamics. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging Waymo-Open dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Our $\textit{S}^3$Gaussian demonstrates the ability to decompose static and dynamic scenes and achieves the best performance without using 3D annotations.

- **Summary**: Conditional diffusion models are powerful generative models that can leverage various types of conditional information, such as class labels, segmentation masks, or text captions. However, in many real-world scenarios, conditional information may be noisy or unreliable due to human annotation errors or weak alignment. In this paper, we propose the Coherence-Aware Diffusion (CAD), a novel method that integrates coherence in conditional information into diffusion models, allowing them to learn from noisy annotations without discarding data. We assume that each data point has an associated coherence score that reflects the quality of the conditional information. We then condition the diffusion model on both the conditional information and the coherence score. In this way, the model learns to ignore or discount the conditioning when the coherence is low. We show that CAD is theoretically sound and empirically effective on various conditional generation tasks. Moreover, we show that leveraging coherence generates realistic and diverse samples that respect conditional information better than models trained on cleaned datasets where samples with low coherence have been discarded.

- **Summary**: Despite impressive advancements in diffusion-based video editing models in altering video attributes, there has been limited exploration into modifying motion information while preserving the original protagonist's appearance and background. In this paper, we propose MotionFollower, a lightweight score-guided diffusion model for video motion editing. To introduce conditional controls to the denoising process, MotionFollower leverages two of our proposed lightweight signal controllers, one for poses and the other for appearances, both of which consist of convolution blocks without involving heavy attention calculations. Further, we design a score guidance principle based on a two-branch architecture, including the reconstruction and editing branches, which significantly enhance the modeling capability of texture details and complicated backgrounds. Concretely, we enforce several consistency regularizers and losses during the score estimation. The resulting gradients thus inject appropriate guidance to the intermediate latents, forcing the model to preserve the original background details and protagonists' appearances without interfering with the motion modification. Experiments demonstrate the competitive motion editing ability of MotionFollower qualitatively and quantitatively. Compared with MotionEditor, the most advanced motion editing model, MotionFollower achieves an approximately 80% reduction in GPU memory while delivering superior motion editing performance and exclusively supporting large camera movements and actions.

- **Summary**: 3D generation has seen remarkable progress in recent years. Existing techniques, such as score distillation methods, produce notable results but require extensive per-scene optimization, impacting time efficiency. Alternatively, reconstruction-based approaches prioritize efficiency but compromise quality due to their limited handling of uncertainty. We introduce GECO, a novel method for high-quality 3D generative modeling that operates within a second. Our approach addresses the prevalent issues of uncertainty and inefficiency in current methods through a two-stage approach. In the initial stage, we train a single-step multi-view generative model with score distillation. Then, a second-stage distillation is applied to address the challenge of view inconsistency from the multi-view prediction. This two-stage process ensures a balanced approach to 3D generation, optimizing both quality and efficiency. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GECO achieves high-quality image-to-3D generation with an unprecedented level of efficiency.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce 4DHands, a robust approach to recovering interactive hand meshes and their relative movement from monocular inputs. Our approach addresses two major limitations of previous methods: lacking a unified solution for handling various hand image inputs and neglecting the positional relationship of two hands within images. To overcome these challenges, we develop a transformer-based architecture with novel tokenization and feature fusion strategies. Specifically, we propose a Relation-aware Two-Hand Tokenization (RAT) method to embed positional relation information into the hand tokens. In this way, our network can handle both single-hand and two-hand inputs and explicitly leverage relative hand positions, facilitating the reconstruction of intricate hand interactions in real-world scenarios. As such tokenization indicates the relative relationship of two hands, it also supports more effective feature fusion. To this end, we further develop a Spatio-temporal Interaction Reasoning (SIR) module to fuse hand tokens in 4D with attention and decode them into 3D hand meshes and relative temporal movements. The efficacy of our approach is validated on several benchmark datasets. The results on in-the-wild videos and real-world scenarios demonstrate the superior performances of our approach for interactive hand reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Accurate tool tracking is essential for the success of computer-assisted intervention. Previous efforts often modeled tool trajectories rigidly, overlooking the dynamic nature of surgical procedures, especially tracking scenarios like out-of-body and out-of-camera views. Addressing this limitation, the new CholecTrack20 dataset provides detailed labels that account for multiple tool trajectories in three perspectives: (1) intraoperative, (2) intracorporeal, and (3) visibility, representing the different types of temporal duration of tool tracks. These fine-grained labels enhance tracking flexibility but also increase the task complexity. Re-identifying tools after occlusion or re-insertion into the body remains challenging due to high visual similarity, especially among tools of the same category. This work recognizes the critical role of the tool operators in distinguishing tool track instances, especially those belonging to the same tool category. The operators' information are however not explicitly captured in surgical videos. We therefore propose SurgiTrack, a novel deep learning method that leverages YOLOv7 for precise tool detection and employs an attention mechanism to model the originating direction of the tools, as a proxy to their operators, for tool re-identification. To handle diverse tool trajectory perspectives, SurgiTrack employs a harmonizing bipartite matching graph, minimizing conflicts and ensuring accurate tool identity association. Experimental results on CholecTrack20 demonstrate SurgiTrack's effectiveness, outperforming baselines and state-of-the-art methods with real-time inference capability. This work sets a new standard in surgical tool tracking, providing dynamic trajectories for more adaptable and precise assistance in minimally invasive surgeries.

- **Summary**: We introduce VividDream, a method for generating explorable 4D scenes with ambient dynamics from a single input image or text prompt. VividDream first expands an input image into a static 3D point cloud through iterative inpainting and geometry merging. An ensemble of animated videos is then generated using video diffusion models with quality refinement techniques and conditioned on renderings of the static 3D scene from the sampled camera trajectories. We then optimize a canonical 4D scene representation using an animated video ensemble, with per-video motion embeddings and visibility masks to mitigate inconsistencies. The resulting 4D scene enables free-view exploration of a 3D scene with plausible ambient scene dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that VividDream can provide human viewers with compelling 4D experiences generated based on diverse real images and text prompts.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In this work, we introduce a challenging task for simultaneously generating 3D holistic body motions and singing vocals directly from textual lyrics inputs, advancing beyond existing works that typically address these two modalities in isolation. To facilitate this, we first collect the RapVerse dataset, a large dataset containing synchronous rapping vocals, lyrics, and high-quality 3D holistic body meshes. With the RapVerse dataset, we investigate the extent to which scaling autoregressive multimodal transformers across language, audio, and motion can enhance the coherent and realistic generation of vocals and whole-body human motions. For modality unification, a vector-quantized variational autoencoder is employed to encode whole-body motion sequences into discrete motion tokens, while a vocal-to-unit model is leveraged to obtain quantized audio tokens preserving content, prosodic information, and singer identity. By jointly performing transformer modeling on these three modalities in a unified way, our framework ensures a seamless and realistic blend of vocals and human motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our unified generation framework not only produces coherent and realistic singing vocals alongside human motions directly from textual inputs but also rivals the performance of specialized single-modality generation systems, establishing new benchmarks for joint vocal-motion generation.

- **Summary**: Understanding the evolution of 3D scenes is important for effective autonomous driving. While conventional methods mode scene development with the motion of individual instances, world models emerge as a generative framework to describe the general scene dynamics. However, most existing methods adopt an autoregressive framework to perform next-token prediction, which suffer from inefficiency in modeling long-term temporal evolutions. To address this, we propose a diffusion-based 4D occupancy generation model, OccSora, to simulate the development of the 3D world for autonomous driving. We employ a 4D scene tokenizer to obtain compact discrete spatial-temporal representations for 4D occupancy input and achieve high-quality reconstruction for long-sequence occupancy videos. We then learn a diffusion transformer on the spatial-temporal representations and generate 4D occupancy conditioned on a trajectory prompt. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely used nuScenes dataset with Occ3D occupancy annotations. OccSora can generate 16s-videos with authentic 3D layout and temporal consistency, demonstrating its ability to understand the spatial and temporal distributions of driving scenes. With trajectory-aware 4D generation, OccSora has the potential to serve as a world simulator for the decision-making of autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) follow the paradigm that perceives visual information by aligning visual features with the input space of Large Language Models (LLMs), and concatenating visual tokens with text tokens to form a unified sequence input for LLMs. These methods demonstrate promising results on various vision-language tasks but are limited by the high computational effort due to the extended input sequence resulting from the involvement of visual tokens. In this paper, instead of input space alignment, we propose a novel parameter space alignment paradigm that represents visual information as model weights. For each input image, we use a vision encoder to extract visual features, convert features into perceptual weights, and merge the perceptual weights with LLM's weights. In this way, the input of LLM does not require visual tokens, which reduces the length of the input sequence and greatly improves efficiency. Following this paradigm, we propose VLoRA with the perceptual weights generator. The perceptual weights generator is designed to convert visual features to perceptual weights with low-rank property, exhibiting a form similar to LoRA. The experimental results show that our VLoRA achieves comparable performance on various benchmarks for MLLMs, while significantly reducing the computational costs for both training and inference. The code and models will be made open-source.

- **Summary**: This study delves into the realm of multi-modality (i.e., video and motion modalities) human behavior understanding by leveraging the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Diverging from recent LLMs designed for video-only or motion-only understanding, we argue that understanding human behavior necessitates joint modeling from both videos and motion sequences (e.g., SMPL sequences) to capture nuanced body part dynamics and semantics effectively. In light of this, we present MotionLLM, a straightforward yet effective framework for human motion understanding, captioning, and reasoning. Specifically, MotionLLM adopts a unified video-motion training strategy that leverages the complementary advantages of existing coarse video-text data and fine-grained motion-text data to glean rich spatial-temporal insights. Furthermore, we collect a substantial dataset, MoVid, comprising diverse videos, motions, captions, and instructions. Additionally, we propose the MoVid-Bench, with carefully manual annotations, for better evaluation of human behavior understanding on video and motion. Extensive experiments show the superiority of MotionLLM in the caption, spatial-temporal comprehension, and reasoning ability.

- **Summary**: In this work, we introduce Unique3D, a novel image-to-3D framework for efficiently generating high-quality 3D meshes from single-view images, featuring state-of-the-art generation fidelity and strong generalizability. Previous methods based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) can produce diversified 3D results by distilling 3D knowledge from large 2D diffusion models, but they usually suffer from long per-case optimization time with inconsistent issues. Recent works address the problem and generate better 3D results either by finetuning a multi-view diffusion model or training a fast feed-forward model. However, they still lack intricate textures and complex geometries due to inconsistency and limited generated resolution. To simultaneously achieve high fidelity, consistency, and efficiency in single image-to-3D, we propose a novel framework Unique3D that includes a multi-view diffusion model with a corresponding normal diffusion model to generate multi-view images with their normal maps, a multi-level upscale process to progressively improve the resolution of generated orthographic multi-views, as well as an instant and consistent mesh reconstruction algorithm called ISOMER, which fully integrates the color and geometric priors into mesh results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Unique3D significantly outperforms other image-to-3D baselines in terms of geometric and textural details.
