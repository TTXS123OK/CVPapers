- **Summary**: Data augmentation plays a critical role in generating high-quality positive and negative pairs necessary for effective contrastive learning. However, common practices involve using a single augmentation policy repeatedly to generate multiple views, potentially leading to inefficient training pairs due to a lack of cooperation between views. Furthermore, to find the optimal set of augmentations, many existing methods require extensive supervised evaluation, overlooking the evolving nature of the model that may require different augmentations throughout the training. Other approaches train differentiable augmentation generators, thus limiting the use of non-differentiable transformation functions from the literature. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a framework for learning efficient adaptive data augmentation policies for contrastive learning with minimal computational overhead. Our approach continuously generates new data augmentation policies during training and produces effective positives/negatives without any supervision. Within this framework, we present two methods: \ac{IndepViews}, which generates augmentation policies used across all views, and \ac{CoViews}, which generates dependent augmentation policies for each view. This enables us to learn dependencies between the transformations applied to each view and ensures that the augmentation strategies applied to different views complement each other, leading to more meaningful and discriminative representations. Through extensive experimentation on multiple datasets and contrastive learning frameworks, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baseline solutions and that training with a view-dependent augmentation policy outperforms training with an independent policy shared across views, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing contrastive learning performance.

- **Summary**: Ellipse estimation is an important topic in food image processing because it can be leveraged to parameterize plates and bowls, which in turn can be used to estimate camera view angles and food portion sizes. Automatically detecting the elliptical rim of plates and bowls and estimating their ellipse parameters for data "in-the-wild" is challenging: diverse camera angles and plate shapes could have been used for capture, noisy background, multiple non-uniform plates and bowls in the image could be present. Recent advancements in foundational models offer promising capabilities for zero-shot semantic understanding and object segmentation. However, the output mask boundaries for plates and bowls generated by these models often lack consistency and precision compared to traditional ellipse fitting methods. In this paper, we combine ellipse fitting with semantic information extracted by zero-shot foundational models and propose WildEllipseFit, a method to detect and estimate the elliptical rim for plate and bowl. Evaluation on the proposed Yummly-ellipse dataset demonstrates its efficacy and zero-shot capability in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Watermark has been widely deployed by industry to detect AI-generated images. A recent watermarking framework called \emph{Stable Signature} (proposed by Meta) roots watermark into the parameters of a diffusion model's decoder such that its generated images are inherently watermarked. Stable Signature makes it possible to watermark images generated by \emph{open-source} diffusion models and was claimed to be robust against removal attacks. In this work, we propose a new attack to remove the watermark from a diffusion model by fine-tuning it. Our results show that our attack can effectively remove the watermark from a diffusion model such that its generated images are non-watermarked, while maintaining the visual quality of the generated images. Our results highlight that Stable Signature is not as stable as previously thought.

- **Summary**: In multi-modal learning, some modalities are more influential than others, and their absence can have a significant impact on classification/segmentation accuracy. Hence, an important research question is if it is possible for trained multi-modal models to have high accuracy even when influential modalities are absent from the input data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Meta-learned Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (MCKD) to address this research question. MCKD adaptively estimates the importance weight of each modality through a meta-learning process. These dynamically learned modality importance weights are used in a pairwise cross-modal knowledge distillation process to transfer the knowledge from the modalities with higher importance weight to the modalities with lower importance weight. This cross-modal knowledge distillation produces a highly accurate model even with the absence of influential modalities. Differently from previous methods in the field, our approach is designed to work in multiple tasks (e.g., segmentation and classification) with minimal adaptation. Experimental results on the Brain tumor Segmentation Dataset 2018 (BraTS2018) and the Audiovision-MNIST classification dataset demonstrate the superiority of MCKD over current state-of-the-art models. Particularly in BraTS2018, we achieve substantial improvements of 3.51\% for enhancing tumor, 2.19\% for tumor core, and 1.14\% for the whole tumor in terms of average segmentation Dice score.

- **Summary**: Precision agriculture involves the application of advanced technologies to improve agricultural productivity, efficiency, and profitability while minimizing waste and environmental impact. Deep learning approaches enable automated decision-making for many visual tasks. However, in the agricultural domain, variability in growth stages and environmental conditions, such as weather and lighting, presents significant challenges to developing deep learning-based techniques that generalize across different conditions. The resource-intensive nature of creating extensive annotated datasets that capture these variabilities further hinders the widespread adoption of these approaches. To tackle these issues, we introduce a semi-self-supervised domain adaptation technique based on deep convolutional neural networks with a probabilistic diffusion process, requiring minimal manual data annotation. Using only three manually annotated images and a selection of video clips from wheat fields, we generated a large-scale computationally annotated dataset of image-mask pairs and a large dataset of unannotated images extracted from video frames. We developed a two-branch convolutional encoder-decoder model architecture that uses both synthesized image-mask pairs and unannotated images, enabling effective adaptation to real images. The proposed model achieved a Dice score of 80.7\% on an internal test dataset and a Dice score of 64.8\% on an external test set, composed of images from five countries and spanning 18 domains, indicating its potential to develop generalizable solutions that could encourage the wider adoption of advanced technologies in agriculture.

- **Summary**: Pedestrian trajectory prediction plays a pivotal role in the realms of autonomous driving and smart cities. Despite extensive prior research employing sequence and generative models, the unpredictable nature of pedestrians, influenced by their social interactions and individual preferences, presents challenges marked by uncertainty and multimodality. In response, we propose the Energy Plan Denoising (EPD) model for stochastic trajectory prediction. EPD initially provides a coarse estimation of the distribution of future trajectories, termed the Plan, utilizing the Langevin Energy Model. Subsequently, it refines this estimation through denoising via the Probabilistic Diffusion Model. By initiating denoising with the Plan, EPD effectively reduces the need for iterative steps, thereby enhancing efficiency. Furthermore, EPD differs from conventional approaches by modeling the distribution of trajectories instead of individual trajectories. This allows for the explicit modeling of pedestrian intrinsic uncertainties and eliminates the need for multiple denoising operations. A single denoising operation produces a distribution from which multiple samples can be drawn, significantly enhancing efficiency. Moreover, EPD's fine-tuning of the Plan contributes to improved model performance. We validate EPD on two publicly available datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art results. Additionally, ablation experiments underscore the contributions of individual modules, affirming the efficacy of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Despite the rapid advancement in the field of image recognition, the processing of high-resolution imagery remains a computational challenge. However, this processing is pivotal for extracting detailed object insights in areas ranging from autonomous vehicle navigation to medical imaging analyses. Our study introduces a framework aimed at mitigating these challenges by leveraging memory efficient patch based processing for high resolution images. It incorporates a global context representation alongside local patch information, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the image content. In contrast to traditional training methods which are limited by memory constraints, our method enables training of ultra high resolution images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through superior performance on 7 different benchmarks across classification, object detection, and segmentation. Notably, the proposed method achieves strong performance even on resource-constrained devices like Jetson Nano.

- **Summary**: With the rapid advancement of technologies such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and gesture control, users expect interactions with computer interfaces to be more natural and intuitive. Existing visual algorithms often struggle to accomplish advanced human-computer interaction tasks, necessitating accurate and reliable absolute spatial prediction methods. Moreover, dealing with complex scenes and occlusions in monocular images poses entirely new challenges. This study proposes a network model that performs parallel processing of root-relative grids and root recovery tasks. The model enables the recovery of 3D hand meshes in camera space from monocular RGB images. To facilitate end-to-end training, we utilize an implicit learning approach for 2D heatmaps, enhancing the compatibility of 2D cues across different subtasks. Incorporate the Inception concept into spectral graph convolutional network to explore relative mesh of root, and integrate it with the locally detailed and globally attentive method designed for root recovery exploration. This approach improves the model's predictive performance in complex environments and self-occluded scenes. Through evaluation on the large-scale hand dataset FreiHAND, we have demonstrated that our proposed model is comparable with state-of-the-art models. This study contributes to the advancement of techniques for accurate and reliable absolute spatial prediction in various human-computer interaction applications.

- **Summary**: Online Test-Time Adaptation (OTTA) has emerged as an effective strategy to handle distributional shifts, allowing on-the-fly adaptation of pre-trained models to new target domains during inference, without the need for source data. We uncovered that the widely studied entropy minimization (EM) method for OTTA, suffers from noisy gradients due to ambiguity near decision boundaries and incorrect low-entropy predictions. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel cosine alignment optimization approach with a dual-objective loss function that refines the precision of class predictions and adaptability to novel domains. Specifically, our method optimizes the cosine similarity between feature vectors and class weight vectors, enhancing the precision of class predictions and the model's adaptability to novel domains. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and sets a new benchmark in multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, ImageNet-C, Office-Home, and DomainNet datasets, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness against diverse corruptions and domain shifts.

- **Summary**: In the ever-changing world of technology, continuous authentication and comprehensive access management are essential during user interactions with a device. Split Learning (SL) and Federated Learning (FL) have recently emerged as promising technologies for training a decentralized Machine Learning (ML) model. With the increasing use of smartphones and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, these distributed technologies enable users with limited resources to complete neural network model training with server assistance and collaboratively combine knowledge between different nodes. In this study, we propose combining these technologies to address the continuous authentication challenge while protecting user privacy and limiting device resource usage. However, the model's training is slowed due to SL sequential training and resource differences between IoT devices with different specifications. Therefore, we use a cluster-based approach to group devices with similar capabilities to mitigate the impact of slow devices while filtering out the devices incapable of training the model. In addition, we address the efficiency and robustness of training ML models by using SL and FL techniques to train the clients simultaneously while analyzing the overhead burden of the process. Following clustering, we select the best set of clients to participate in training through a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimized on a carefully designed list of objectives. The performance of our proposed framework is compared to baseline methods, and the advantages are demonstrated using a real-life UMDAA-02-FD face detection dataset. The results show that CRSFL, our proposed approach, maintains high accuracy and reduces the overhead burden in continuous authentication scenarios while preserving user privacy.

- **Summary**: Guided by the hologram technology of the infamous Star Wars franchise, I present an application that creates real-time holographic overlays using LiDAR augmented 3D reconstruction. Prior attempts involve SLAM or NeRFs which either require highly calibrated scenes, incur steep computation costs, or fail to render dynamic scenes. I propose 3 high-fidelity reconstruction tools that can run on a portable device, such as a iPhone 14 Pro, which can allow for metric accurate facial reconstructions. My systems enable interactive and immersive holographic experiences that can be used for a wide range of applications, including augmented reality, telepresence, and entertainment.

- **Summary**: Over the past few years, as large language models have ushered in an era of intelligence emergence, there has been an intensified focus on scaling networks. Currently, many network architectures are designed manually, often resulting in sub-optimal configurations. Although Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods have been proposed to automate this process, they suffer from low search efficiency. This study introduces Differentiable Model Scaling (DMS), increasing the efficiency for searching optimal width and depth in networks. DMS can model both width and depth in a direct and fully differentiable way, making it easy to optimize. We have evaluated our DMS across diverse tasks, ranging from vision tasks to NLP tasks and various network architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. Results consistently indicate that our DMS can find improved structures and outperforms state-of-the-art NAS methods. Specifically, for image classification on ImageNet, our DMS improves the top-1 accuracy of EfficientNet-B0 and Deit-Tiny by 1.4% and 0.6%, respectively, and outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot NAS method, ZiCo, by 1.3% while requiring only 0.4 GPU days for searching. For object detection on COCO, DMS improves the mAP of Yolo-v8-n by 2.0%. For language modeling, our pruned Llama-7B outperforms the prior method with lower perplexity and higher zero-shot classification accuracy. We will release our code in the future.

- **Summary**: An effective pre-training framework with universal 3D representations is extremely desired in perceiving large-scale dynamic scenes. However, establishing such an ideal framework that is both task-generic and label-efficient poses a challenge in unifying the representation of the same primitive across diverse scenes. The current contrastive 3D pre-training methods typically follow a frame-level consistency, which focuses on the 2D-3D relationships in each detached image. Such inconsiderate consistency greatly hampers the promising path of reaching an universal pre-training framework: (1) The cross-scene semantic self-conflict, i.e., the intense collision between primitive segments of the same semantics from different scenes; (2) Lacking a globally unified bond that pushes the cross-scene semantic consistency into 3D representation learning. To address above challenges, we propose a CSC framework that puts a scene-level semantic consistency in the heart, bridging the connection of the similar semantic segments across various scenes. To achieve this goal, we combine the coherent semantic cues provided by the vision foundation model and the knowledge-rich cross-scene prototypes derived from the complementary multi-modality information. These allow us to train a universal 3D pre-training model that facilitates various downstream tasks with less fine-tuning efforts. Empirically, we achieve consistent improvements over SOTA pre-training approaches in semantic segmentation (+1.4% mIoU), object detection (+1.0% mAP), and panoptic segmentation (+3.0% PQ) using their task-specific 3D network on nuScenes. Code is released at https://github.com/chenhaomingbob/CSC, hoping to inspire future research.

- **Summary**: Video-language pre-training is a typical and challenging problem that aims at learning visual and textual representations from large-scale data in a self-supervised way. Existing pre-training approaches either captured the correspondence of image-text pairs or utilized temporal ordering of frames. However, they do not explicitly explore the natural synchronization between audio and the other two modalities. In this work, we propose an enhanced framework for Video-Language pre-training with Synchronized Audio, termed as VLSA, that can learn tri-modal representations in a unified self-supervised transformer. Specifically, our VLSA jointly aggregates embeddings of local patches and global tokens for video, text, and audio. Furthermore, we utilize local-patch masked modeling to learn modality-aware features, and leverage global audio matching to capture audio-guided features for video and text. We conduct extensive experiments on retrieval across text, video, and audio. Our simple model pre-trained on only 0.9M data achieves improving results against state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, qualitative visualizations vividly showcase the superiority of our VLSA in learning discriminative visual-textual representations.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation has gained growing interest due to its ability to utilize unannotated data. The current state-of-the-art methods mostly rely on pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. These methods depend on a single pseudo-label for training, but these labels are not as accurate as the ground truth of labeled data. Relying solely on one pseudo-label often results in suboptimal results. To this end, we propose a novel approach where multiple pseudo-labels for the same unannotated image are used to learn from the unlabeled data: the conventional fixed pseudo-label and the newly introduced dynamic pseudo-label. By incorporating multiple pseudo-labels for the same unannotated image into the co-training framework, our approach provides a more robust training approach that improves model performance and generalization capabilities. We validate our novel approach on three semi-supervised medical benchmark segmentation datasets, the Left Atrium dataset, the Pancreas-CT dataset, and the Brats-2019 dataset. Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods over multiple medical benchmark segmentation datasets with different labeled data ratios. We also present several ablation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of various components used in our approach.

- **Summary**: Most earlier investigations on talking face generation have focused on the synchronization of lip motion and speech content. However, human head pose and facial emotions are equally important characteristics of natural human faces. While audio-driven talking face generation has seen notable advancements, existing methods either overlook facial emotions or are limited to specific individuals and cannot be applied to arbitrary subjects. In this paper, we propose a one-shot Talking Head Generation framework (SPEAK) that distinguishes itself from general Talking Face Generation by enabling emotional and postural control. Specifically, we introduce the Inter-Reconstructed Feature Disentanglement (IRFD) method to decouple human facial features into three latent spaces. We then design a face editing module that modifies speech content and facial latent codes into a single latent space. Subsequently, we present a novel generator that employs modified latent codes derived from the editing module to regulate emotional expression, head poses, and speech content in synthesizing facial animations. Extensive trials demonstrate that our method can generate realistic talking head with coordinated lip motions, authentic facial emotions, and smooth head movements.

- **Summary**: With the advancement of video analysis technology, the multi-object tracking (MOT) problem in complex scenes involving pedestrians is gaining increasing importance. This challenge primarily involves two key tasks: pedestrian detection and re-identification. While significant progress has been achieved in pedestrian detection tasks in recent years, enhancing the effectiveness of re-identification tasks remains a persistent challenge. This difficulty arises from the large total number of pedestrian samples in multi-object tracking datasets and the scarcity of individual instance samples. Motivated by recent rapid advancements in meta-learning techniques, we introduce MAML MOT, a meta-learning-based training approach for multi-object tracking. This approach leverages the rapid learning capability of meta-learning to tackle the issue of sample scarcity in pedestrian re-identification tasks, aiming to improve the model's generalization performance and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy on mainstream datasets in the MOT Challenge. This offers new perspectives and solutions for research in the field of pedestrian multi-object tracking.

- **Summary**: Global point clouds that correctly represent the static environment features can facilitate accurate localization and robust path planning. However, dynamic objects introduce undesired ghost tracks that are mixed up with the static environment. Existing dynamic removal methods normally fail to balance the performance in computational efficiency and accuracy. In response, we present BeautyMap to efficiently remove the dynamic points while retaining static features for high-fidelity global maps. Our approach utilizes a binary-encoded matrix to efficiently extract the environment features. With a bit-wise comparison between matrices of each frame and the corresponding map region, we can extract potential dynamic regions. Then we use coarse to fine hierarchical segmentation of the $z$-axis to handle terrain variations. The final static restoration module accounts for the range-visibility of each single scan and protects static points out of sight. Comparative experiments underscore BeautyMap's superior performance in both accuracy and efficiency against other dynamic points removal methods.

- **Summary**: We present SLIP (SAM+CLIP), an enhanced architecture for zero-shot object segmentation. SLIP combines the Segment Anything Model (SAM) \cite{kirillov2023segment} with the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) \cite{radford2021learning}. By incorporating text prompts into SAM using CLIP, SLIP enables object segmentation without prior training on specific classes or categories. We fine-tune CLIP on a Pokemon dataset, allowing it to learn meaningful image-text representations. SLIP demonstrates the ability to recognize and segment objects in images based on contextual information from text prompts, expanding the capabilities of SAM for versatile object segmentation. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the SLIP architecture in segmenting objects in images based on textual cues. The integration of CLIP's text-image understanding capabilities into SAM expands the capabilities of the original architecture and enables more versatile and context-aware object segmentation.

- **Summary**: Generating images from text has become easier because of the scaling of diffusion models and advancements in the field of vision and language. These models are trained using vast amounts of data from the Internet. Hence, they often contain undesirable content such as copyrighted material. As it is challenging to remove such data and retrain the models, methods for erasing specific concepts from pre-trained models have been investigated. We propose a novel concept-erasure method that updates the text encoder using few-shot unlearning in which a few real images are used. The discussion regarding the generated images after erasing a concept has been lacking. While there are methods for specifying the transition destination for concepts, the validity of the specified concepts is unclear. Our method implicitly achieves this by transitioning to the latent concepts inherent in the model or the images. Our method can erase a concept within 10 s, making concept erasure more accessible than ever before. Implicitly transitioning to related concepts leads to more natural concept erasure. We applied the proposed method to various concepts and confirmed that concept erasure can be achieved tens to hundreds of times faster than with current methods. By varying the parameters to be updated, we obtained results suggesting that, like previous research, knowledge is primarily accumulated in the feed-forward networks of the text encoder.

- **Summary**: In the field of transportation, it is of paramount importance to address and mitigate illegal actions committed by both motor and non-motor vehicles. Among those actions, wrong-way cycling (i.e., riding a bicycle or e-bike in the opposite direction of the designated traffic flow) poses significant risks to both cyclists and other road users. To this end, this paper formulates a problem of detecting wrong-way cycling ratios in CCTV videos. Specifically, we propose a sparse sampling method called WWC-Predictor to efficiently solve this problem, addressing the inefficiencies of direct tracking methods. Our approach leverages both detection-based information, which utilizes the information from bounding boxes, and orientation-based information, which provides insights into the image itself, to enhance instantaneous information capture capability. On our proposed benchmark dataset consisting of 35 minutes of video sequences and minute-level annotation, our method achieves an average error rate of a mere 1.475% while taking only 19.12% GPU time of straightforward tracking methods under the same detection model. This remarkable performance demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in identifying and predicting instances of wrong-way cycling.

- **Summary**: In NeRF-aided editing tasks, object movement presents difficulties in supervision generation due to the introduction of variability in object positions. Moreover, the removal operations of certain scene objects often lead to empty regions, presenting challenges for NeRF models in inpainting them effectively. We propose an implicit ray transformation strategy, allowing for direct manipulation of the 3D object's pose by operating on the neural-point in NeRF rays. To address the challenge of inpainting potential empty regions, we present a plug-and-play inpainting module, dubbed differentiable neural-point resampling (DNR), which interpolates those regions in 3D space at the original ray locations within the implicit space, thereby facilitating object removal & scene inpainting tasks. Importantly, employing DNR effectively narrows the gap between ground truth and predicted implicit features, potentially increasing the mutual information (MI) of the features across rays. Then, we leverage DNR and ray transformation to construct a point-based editable NeRF pipeline PR^2T-NeRF. Results primarily evaluated on 3D object removal & inpainting tasks indicate that our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance. In addition, our pipeline supports high-quality rendering visualization for diverse editing operations without necessitating extra supervision.

- **Summary**: Generating robot demonstrations through simulation is widely recognized as an effective way to scale up robot data. Previous work often trained reinforcement learning agents to generate expert policies, but this approach lacks sample efficiency. Recently, a line of work has attempted to generate robot demonstrations via differentiable simulation, which is promising but heavily relies on reward design, a labor-intensive process. In this paper, we propose DiffGen, a novel framework that integrates differentiable physics simulation, differentiable rendering, and a vision-language model to enable automatic and efficient generation of robot demonstrations. Given a simulated robot manipulation scenario and a natural language instruction, DiffGen can generate realistic robot demonstrations by minimizing the distance between the embedding of the language instruction and the embedding of the simulated observation after manipulation. The embeddings are obtained from the vision-language model, and the optimization is achieved by calculating and descending gradients through the differentiable simulation, differentiable rendering, and vision-language model components, thereby accomplishing the specified task. Experiments demonstrate that with DiffGen, we could efficiently and effectively generate robot data with minimal human effort or training time.

- **Summary**: Animatable clothing transfer, aiming at dressing and animating garments across characters, is a challenging problem. Most human avatar works entangle the representations of the human body and clothing together, which leads to difficulties for virtual try-on across identities. What's worse, the entangled representations usually fail to exactly track the sliding motion of garments. To overcome these limitations, we present Layered Gaussian Avatars (LayGA), a new representation that formulates body and clothing as two separate layers for photorealistic animatable clothing transfer from multi-view videos. Our representation is built upon the Gaussian map-based avatar for its excellent representation power of garment details. However, the Gaussian map produces unstructured 3D Gaussians distributed around the actual surface. The absence of a smooth explicit surface raises challenges in accurate garment tracking and collision handling between body and garments. Therefore, we propose two-stage training involving single-layer reconstruction and multi-layer fitting. In the single-layer reconstruction stage, we propose a series of geometric constraints to reconstruct smooth surfaces and simultaneously obtain the segmentation between body and clothing. Next, in the multi-layer fitting stage, we train two separate models to represent body and clothing and utilize the reconstructed clothing geometries as 3D supervision for more accurate garment tracking. Furthermore, we propose geometry and rendering layers for both high-quality geometric reconstruction and high-fidelity rendering. Overall, the proposed LayGA realizes photorealistic animations and virtual try-on, and outperforms other baseline methods. Our project page is https://jsnln.github.io/layga/index.html.

- **Summary**: Numerous applications have resulted from the automation of agricultural disease segmentation using deep learning techniques. However, when applied to new conditions, these applications frequently face the difficulty of overfitting, resulting in lower segmentation performance. In the context of potato farming, where diseases have a large influence on yields, it is critical for the agricultural economy to quickly and properly identify these diseases. Traditional data augmentation approaches, such as rotation, flip, and translation, have limitations and frequently fail to provide strong generalization results. To address these issues, our research employs a novel approach termed as PotatoGANs. In this novel data augmentation approach, two types of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are utilized to generate synthetic potato disease images from healthy potato images. This approach not only expands the dataset but also adds variety, which helps to enhance model generalization. Using the Inception score as a measure, our experiments show the better quality and realisticness of the images created by PotatoGANs, emphasizing their capacity to resemble real disease images closely. The CycleGAN model outperforms the Pix2Pix GAN model in terms of image quality, as evidenced by its higher IS scores CycleGAN achieves higher Inception scores (IS) of 1.2001 and 1.0900 for black scurf and common scab, respectively. This synthetic data can significantly improve the training of large neural networks. It also reduces data collection costs while enhancing data diversity and generalization capabilities. Our work improves interpretability by combining three gradient-based Explainable AI algorithms (GradCAM, GradCAM++, and ScoreCAM) with three distinct CNN architectures (DenseNet169, Resnet152 V2, InceptionResNet V2) for potato disease classification.

- **Summary**: Our research focuses on the critical field of early diagnosis of disease by examining retinal blood vessels in fundus images. While automatic segmentation of retinal blood vessels holds promise for early detection, accurate analysis remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods, which often lack discrimination power and are susceptible to influences from pathological regions. Our research in fundus image analysis advances deep learning-based classification using eight pre-trained CNN models. To enhance interpretability, we utilize Explainable AI techniques such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Score-CAM, Faster Score-CAM, and Layer CAM. These techniques illuminate the decision-making processes of the models, fostering transparency and trust in their predictions. Expanding our exploration, we investigate ten models, including TransUNet with ResNet backbones, Attention U-Net with DenseNet and ResNet backbones, and Swin-UNET. Incorporating diverse architectures such as ResNet50V2, ResNet101V2, ResNet152V2, and DenseNet121 among others, this comprehensive study deepens our insights into attention mechanisms for enhanced fundus image analysis. Among the evaluated models for fundus image classification, ResNet101 emerged with the highest accuracy, achieving an impressive 94.17%. On the other end of the spectrum, EfficientNetB0 exhibited the lowest accuracy among the models, achieving a score of 88.33%. Furthermore, in the domain of fundus image segmentation, Swin-Unet demonstrated a Mean Pixel Accuracy of 86.19%, showcasing its effectiveness in accurately delineating regions of interest within fundus images. Conversely, Attention U-Net with DenseNet201 backbone exhibited the lowest Mean Pixel Accuracy among the evaluated models, achieving a score of 75.87%.

- **Summary**: Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has grown rapidly in recent years, among which AI-based image generation has gained widespread attention due to its efficient and imaginative image creation ability. However, AI-generated Images (AIGIs) may not satisfy human preferences due to their unique distortions, which highlights the necessity to understand and evaluate human preferences for AIGIs. To this end, in this paper, we first establish a novel Image Quality Assessment (IQA) database for AIGIs, termed AIGCIQA2023+, which provides human visual preference scores and detailed preference explanations from three perspectives including quality, authenticity, and correspondence. Then, based on the constructed AIGCIQA2023+ database, this paper presents a MINT-IQA model to evaluate and explain human preferences for AIGIs from Multi-perspectives with INstruction Tuning. Specifically, the MINT-IQA model first learn and evaluate human preferences for AI-generated Images from multi-perspectives, then via the vision-language instruction tuning strategy, MINT-IQA attains powerful understanding and explanation ability for human visual preference on AIGIs, which can be used for feedback to further improve the assessment capabilities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MINT-IQA model achieves state-of-the-art performance in understanding and evaluating human visual preferences for AIGIs, and the proposed model also achieves competing results on traditional IQA tasks compared with state-of-the-art IQA models. The AIGCIQA2023+ database and MINT-IQA model will be released to facilitate future research.

- **Summary**: In visual place recognition, accurately identifying and matching images of locations under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a new technique, called Bag-of-Queries (BoQ), which learns a set of global queries designed to capture universal place-specific attributes. Unlike existing methods that employ self-attention and generate the queries directly from the input features, BoQ employs distinct learnable global queries, which probe the input features via cross-attention, ensuring consistent information aggregation. In addition, our technique provides an interpretable attention mechanism and integrates with both CNN and Vision Transformer backbones. The performance of BoQ is demonstrated through extensive experiments on 14 large-scale benchmarks. It consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques including NetVLAD, MixVPR and EigenPlaces. Moreover, as a global retrieval technique (one-stage), BoQ surpasses two-stage retrieval methods, such as Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR and R2Former, all while being orders of magnitude faster and more efficient. The code and model weights are publicly available at https://github.com/amaralibey/Bag-of-Queries.

- **Summary**: Purpose: To examine whether incorporating anatomical awareness into a deep learning model can improve generalizability and enable prediction of disease progression.   Methods: This retrospective multicenter study included conventional pelvic radiographs of 4 different patient cohorts focusing on axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) collected at university and community hospitals. The first cohort, which consisted of 1483 radiographs, was split into training (n=1261) and validation (n=222) sets. The other cohorts comprising 436, 340, and 163 patients, respectively, were used as independent test datasets. For the second cohort, follow-up data of 311 patients was used to examine progression prediction capabilities. Two neural networks were trained, one on images cropped to the bounding box of the sacroiliac joints (anatomy-aware) and the other one on full radiographs. The performance of the models was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.   Results: On the three test datasets, the standard model achieved AUC scores of 0.853, 0.817, 0.947, with an accuracy of 0.770, 0.724, 0.850. Whereas the anatomy-aware model achieved AUC scores of 0.899, 0.846, 0.957, with an accuracy of 0.821, 0.744, 0.906, respectively. The patients who were identified as high risk by the anatomy aware model had an odds ratio of 2.16 (95% CI: 1.19, 3.86) for having progression of radiographic sacroiliitis within 2 years.   Conclusion: Anatomical awareness can improve the generalizability of a deep learning model in detecting radiographic sacroiliitis. The model is published as fully open source alongside this study.

- **Summary**: Accurate and robust camera tracking in dynamic environments presents a significant challenge for visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). Recent progress in this field often involves the use of deep learning techniques to generate mask for dynamic objects, which usually require GPUs to operate in real-time (30 fps). Therefore, this paper proposes a novel visual SLAM system for dynamic environments that obtains real-time performance on CPU by incorporating a mask prediction mechanism, which allows the deep learning method and the camera tracking to run entirely in parallel at different frequencies such that neither waits for the result from the other. Based on this, it further introduces a dual-stage optical flow tracking approach and employs a hybrid usage of optical flow and ORB features, which significantly enhance the efficiency and robustness of the system. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, this system maintains high localization accuracy in dynamic environments while achieving a tracking frame rate of 56 fps on a single laptop CPU without any hardware acceleration, thus proving that deep learning methods are still feasible for dynamic SLAM even without GPU support. Based on the available information, this is the first SLAM system to achieve this.

- **Summary**: Weeds present a significant challenge in agriculture, causing yield loss and requiring expensive control measures. Automatic weed detection using computer vision and deep learning offers a promising solution. However, conventional deep learning methods often require large amounts of labelled training data, which can be costly and time-consuming to acquire. This paper introduces a novel method for semi-supervised weed detection, comprising two main components. Firstly, a multi-scale feature representation technique is employed to capture distinctive weed features across different scales. Secondly, we propose an adaptive pseudo-label assignment strategy, leveraging a small set of labelled images during training. This strategy dynamically assigns confidence scores to pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Additionally, our approach integrates epoch-corresponding and mixed pseudo-labels to further enhance the learning process. Experimental results on the COCO dataset and five prominent weed datasets -- CottonWeedDet12, CropAndWeed, Palmer amaranth, RadishWheat, and RoboWeedMap -- illustrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in weed detection, even with significantly less labelled data compared to existing techniques. This approach holds the potential to alleviate the labelling burden and enhance the feasibility and deployment speed of deep learning for weed detection in real-world agricultural scenarios.
