- **Summary**: Intelligent detection and tracking of the vessels on the sea play a significant role in conducting traffic avoidance in unmanned surface vessels(USV). Current traffic avoidance software relies mainly on Automated Identification System (AIS) and radar to track other vessels to avoid collisions and acts as a typical perception system to detect targets. However, in a contested environment, emitting radar energy also presents the vulnerability to detection by adversaries. Deactivating these Radiofrequency transmitting sources will increase the threat of detection and degrade the USV's ability to monitor shipping traffic in the vicinity. Therefore, an intelligent visual perception system based on an onboard camera with passive sensing capabilities that aims to assist USV in addressing this problem is presented in this paper. This paper will present a novel low-cost vision perception system for detecting and tracking vessels in the maritime environment. This novel low-cost vision perception system is introduced using the deep learning framework. A neural network, DisBeaNet, can detect vessels, track, and estimate the vessel's distance and bearing from the monocular camera. The outputs obtained from this neural network are used to determine the latitude and longitude of the identified vessel.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of organs from abdominal CT scans is essential for clinical applications such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient monitoring. To handle challenges of heterogeneity in organ shapes, sizes, and complex anatomical relationships, we propose a \textbf{\textit{\ac{MDNet}}}, an encoder-decoder network that uses the pre-trained \textit{MiT-B2} as the encoder and multiple different decoder networks. Each decoder network is connected to a different part of the encoder via a multi-scale feature enhancement dilated block. With each decoder, we increase the depth of the network iteratively and refine segmentation masks, enriching feature maps by integrating previous decoders' feature maps. To refine the feature map further, we also utilize the predicted masks from the previous decoder to the current decoder to provide spatial attention across foreground and background regions. MDNet effectively refines the segmentation mask with a high dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.9013 and 0.9169 on the Liver Tumor segmentation (LiTS) and MSD Spleen datasets. Additionally, it reduces Hausdorff distance (HD) to 3.79 for the LiTS dataset and 2.26 for the spleen segmentation dataset, underscoring the precision of MDNet in capturing the complex contours. Moreover, \textit{\ac{MDNet}} is more interpretable and robust compared to the other baseline models.

- **Summary**: Purpose: Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) is a label-free technique that provides high-contrast images of tissues and cells without the use of chemicals or dyes. Accurate semantic segmentation of cells in QPI is essential for various biomedical applications. While DM-based segmentation has demonstrated promising results, the requirement for multiple sampling steps reduces efficiency. This study aims to enhance DM-based segmentation by introducing prior-guided content information into the starting noise, thereby minimizing inefficiencies associated with multiple sampling. Approach: A prior-guided mechanism is introduced into DM-based segmentation, replacing randomly sampled starting noise with noise informed by content information. This mechanism utilizes another trained DM and DDIM inversion to incorporate content information from the to-be-segmented images into the starting noise. An evaluation method is also proposed to assess the quality of the starting noise, considering both content and distribution information. Results: Extensive experiments on various QPI datasets for cell segmentation showed that the proposed method achieved superior performance in DM-based segmentation with only a single sampling. Ablation studies and visual analysis further highlighted the significance of content priors in DM-based segmentation. Conclusion: The proposed method effectively leverages prior content information to improve DM-based segmentation, providing accurate results while reducing the need for multiple samplings. The findings emphasize the importance of integrating content priors into DM-based segmentation methods for optimal performance.

- **Summary**: Transparent objects are ubiquitous in industry, pharmaceuticals, and households. Grasping and manipulating these objects is a significant challenge for robots. Existing methods have difficulty reconstructing complete depth maps for challenging transparent objects, leaving holes in the depth reconstruction. Recent work has shown neural radiance fields (NeRFs) work well for depth perception in scenes with transparent objects, and these depth maps can be used to grasp transparent objects with high accuracy. NeRF-based depth reconstruction can still struggle with especially challenging transparent objects and lighting conditions. In this work, we propose Residual-NeRF, a method to improve depth perception and training speed for transparent objects. Robots often operate in the same area, such as a kitchen. By first learning a background NeRF of the scene without transparent objects to be manipulated, we reduce the ambiguity faced by learning the changes with the new object. We propose training two additional networks: a residual NeRF learns to infer residual RGB values and densities, and a Mixnet learns how to combine background and residual NeRFs. We contribute synthetic and real experiments that suggest Residual-NeRF improves depth perception of transparent objects. The results on synthetic data suggest Residual-NeRF outperforms the baselines with a 46.1% lower RMSE and a 29.5% lower MAE. Real-world qualitative experiments suggest Residual-NeRF leads to more robust depth maps with less noise and fewer holes. Website: https://residual-nerf.github.io

- **Summary**: In everyday indoor navigation, robots often needto detect non-distinctive small-change objects (e.g., stationery,lost items, and junk, etc.) to maintain domain knowledge. Thisis most relevant to ground-view change detection (GVCD), a recently emerging research area in the field of computer vision.However, these existing techniques rely on high-quality class-specific object priors to regularize a change detector modelthat cannot be applied to semantically nondistinctive smallobjects. To address ill-posedness, in this study, we explorethe concept of degree-of-ill-posedness (DoI) from the newperspective of GVCD, aiming to improve both passive and activevision. This novel DoI problem is highly domain-dependent,and manually collecting fine-grained annotated training datais expensive. To regularize this problem, we apply the conceptof self-supervised learning to achieve efficient DoI estimationscheme and investigate its generalization to diverse datasets.Specifically, we tackle the challenging issue of obtaining self-supervision cues for semantically non-distinctive unseen smallobjects and show that novel "oversegmentation cues" from openvocabulary semantic segmentation can be effectively exploited.When applied to diverse real datasets, the proposed DoI modelcan boost state-of-the-art change detection models, and it showsstable and consistent improvements when evaluated on real-world datasets.

- **Summary**: Accurate polyp segmentation is crucial for the early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer. However, the existing polyp detection methods sometimes ignore multi-directional features and drastic changes in scale. To address these challenges, we design an Orthogonal Direction Enhancement and Scale Aware Network (ODC-SA Net) for polyp segmentation. The Orthogonal Direction Convolutional (ODC) block can extract multi-directional features using transposed rectangular convolution kernels through forming an orthogonal feature vector basis, which solves the issue of random feature direction changes and reduces computational load. Additionally, the Multi-scale Fusion Attention (MSFA) mechanism is proposed to emphasize scale changes in both spatial and channel dimensions, enhancing the segmentation accuracy for polyps of varying sizes. Extraction with Re-attention Module (ERA) is used to re-combinane effective features, and Structures of Shallow Reverse Attention Mechanism (SRA) is used to enhance polyp edge with low level information. A large number of experiments conducted on public datasets have demonstrated that the performance of this model is superior to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Foundation Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained using large-scale open-domain images and text pairs have recently been adapted to develop Vision-Language Segmentation Models (VLSMs) that allow providing text prompts during inference to guide image segmentation. If robust and powerful VLSMs can be built for medical images, it could aid medical professionals in many clinical tasks where they must spend substantial time delineating the target structure of interest. VLSMs for medical images resort to fine-tuning base VLM or VLSM pretrained on open-domain natural image datasets due to fewer annotated medical image datasets; this fine-tuning is resource-consuming and expensive as it usually requires updating all or a significant fraction of the pretrained parameters. Recently, lightweight blocks called adapters have been proposed in VLMs that keep the pretrained model frozen and only train adapters during fine-tuning, substantially reducing the computing resources required. We introduce a novel adapter, VLSM-Adapter, that can fine-tune pretrained vision-language segmentation models using transformer encoders. Our experiments in widely used CLIP-based segmentation models show that with only 3 million trainable parameters, the VLSM-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art and is comparable to the upper bound end-to-end fine-tuning.

- **Summary**: Large unlabeled data and difficult-to-identify anomalies are the urgent issues need to overcome in most industrial scene. In order to address this issue, a new meth-odology for detecting surface defects in in-dustrial settings is introduced, referred to as Memory Augmentation and Pseudo-Labeling(MAPL). The methodology first in-troduces an anomaly simulation strategy, which significantly improves the model's ability to recognize rare or unknown anom-aly types by generating simulated anomaly samples. To cope with the problem of the lack of labeling of anomalous simulated samples, a pseudo-labeler method based on a one-classifier ensemble was employed in this study, which enhances the robustness of the model in the case of limited labeling data by automatically selecting key pseudo-labeling hyperparameters. Meanwhile, a memory-enhanced learning mechanism is introduced to effectively predict abnormal regions by analyzing the difference be-tween the input samples and the normal samples in the memory pool. An end-to-end learning framework is employed by MAPL to identify the abnormal regions directly from the input data, which optimizes the ef-ficiency and real-time performance of de-tection. By conducting extensive trials on the recently developed BHAD dataset (in-cluding MVTec AD [1], Visa [2], and MDPP [3]), MAPL achieves an average im-age-level AUROC score of 86.2%, demon-strating a 5.1% enhancement compared to the original MemSeg [4] model.

- **Summary**: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has been widely applied to measure heart rate from face videos. To increase the generalizability of the algorithms, domain generalization (DG) attracted increasing attention in rPPG. However, when rPPG is extended to simultaneously measure more vital signs (e.g., respiration and blood oxygen saturation), achieving generalizability brings new challenges. Although partial features shared among different physiological signals can benefit multi-task learning, the sparse and imbalanced target label space brings the seesaw effect over task-specific feature learning. To resolve this problem, we designed an end-to-end Mixture of Low-rank Experts for multi-task remote Physiological measurement (PhysMLE), which is based on multiple low-rank experts with a novel router mechanism, thereby enabling the model to adeptly handle both specifications and correlations within tasks. Additionally, we introduced prior knowledge from physiology among tasks to overcome the imbalance of label space under real-world multi-task physiological measurement. For fair and comprehensive evaluations, this paper proposed a large-scale multi-task generalization benchmark, named Multi-Source Synsemantic Domain Generalization (MSSDG) protocol. Extensive experiments with MSSDG and intra-dataset have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of PhysMLE. In addition, a new dataset was collected and made publicly available to meet the needs of the MSSDG.

- **Summary**: Recent progress in large-scale scene rendering has yielded Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models with an impressive ability to synthesize scenes across small objects and indoor scenes. Nevertheless, extending this idea to large-scale aerial rendering poses two critical problems. Firstly, a single NeRF cannot render the entire scene with high-precision for complex large-scale aerial datasets since the sampling range along each view ray is insufficient to cover buildings adequately. Secondly, traditional NeRFs are infeasible to train on one GPU to enable interactive fly-throughs for modeling massive images. Instead, existing methods typically separate the whole scene into multiple regions and train a NeRF on each region, which are unaccustomed to different flight trajectories and difficult to achieve fast rendering. To that end, we propose Aerial-NeRF with three innovative modifications for jointly adapting NeRF in large-scale aerial rendering: (1) Designing an adaptive spatial partitioning and selection method based on drones' poses to adapt different flight trajectories; (2) Using similarity of poses instead of (expert) network for rendering speedup to determine which region a new viewpoint belongs to; (3) Developing an adaptive sampling approach for rendering performance improvement to cover the entire buildings at different heights. Extensive experiments have conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of Aerial-NeRF, and new state-of-the-art results have been achieved on two public large-scale aerial datasets and presented SCUTic dataset. Note that our model allows us to perform rendering over 4 times as fast as compared to multiple competitors. Our dataset, code, and model are publicly available at https://drliuqi.github.io/.

- **Summary**: Event sensors offer high temporal resolution visual sensing, which makes them ideal for perceiving fast visual phenomena without suffering from motion blur. Certain applications in robotics and vision-based navigation require 3D perception of an object undergoing circular or spinning motion in front of a static camera, such as recovering the angular velocity and shape of the object. The setting is equivalent to observing a static object with an orbiting camera. In this paper, we propose event-based structure-from-orbit (eSfO), where the aim is to simultaneously reconstruct the 3D structure of a fast spinning object observed from a static event camera, and recover the equivalent orbital motion of the camera. Our contributions are threefold: since state-of-the-art event feature trackers cannot handle periodic self-occlusion due to the spinning motion, we develop a novel event feature tracker based on spatio-temporal clustering and data association that can better track the helical trajectories of valid features in the event data. The feature tracks are then fed to our novel factor graph-based structure-from-orbit back-end that calculates the orbital motion parameters (e.g., spin rate, relative rotational axis) that minimize the reprojection error. For evaluation, we produce a new event dataset of objects under spinning motion. Comparisons against ground truth indicate the efficacy of eSfO.

- **Summary**: Visual grounding (VG) is a challenging task to localize an object in an image based on a textual description. Recent surge in the scale of VG models has substantially improved performance, but also introduced a significant burden on computational costs during fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore applying parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) to efficiently transfer the pre-trained vision-language knowledge to VG. Specifically, we propose \textbf{DARA}, a novel PETL method comprising \underline{\textbf{D}}omain-aware \underline{\textbf{A}}dapters (DA Adapters) and \underline{\textbf{R}}elation-aware \underline{\textbf{A}}dapters (RA Adapters) for VG. DA Adapters first transfer intra-modality representations to be more fine-grained for the VG domain. Then RA Adapters share weights to bridge the relation between two modalities, improving spatial reasoning. Empirical results on widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that DARA achieves the best accuracy while saving numerous updated parameters compared to the full fine-tuning and other PETL methods. Notably, with only \textbf{2.13\%} tunable backbone parameters, DARA improves average accuracy by \textbf{0.81\%} across the three benchmarks compared to the baseline model.

- **Summary**: Conventional methods in semi-supervised learning (SSL) often face challenges related to limited data utilization, mainly due to their reliance on threshold-based techniques for selecting high-confidence unlabeled data during training. Various efforts (e.g., FreeMatch) have been made to enhance data utilization by tweaking the thresholds, yet none have managed to use 100% of the available data. To overcome this limitation and improve SSL performance, we introduce \algo, a novel algorithm that fully utilizes unlabeled data to boost semi-supervised learning. \algo integrates a self-supervised learning strategy, i.e., Masked Autoencoder (MAE), that uses all available data to enforce the visual representation learning. This enables the SSL algorithm to leverage all available data, including samples typically filtered out by traditional methods. In addition, we propose a synthetic data training approach to further increase data utilization and improve generalization. These innovations lead \algo to achieve state-of-the-art results on challenging datasets. For instance, on CIFAR-100 with 2 labels per class, STL-10 with 4 labels per class, and Euro-SAT with 2 labels per class, \algo achieves low error rates of 18.71%, 9.47%, and 3.07%, respectively. The code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is an important task for many applications but it is still quite challenging to achieve advanced performance with limited computational costs. In this paper, we present CGRSeg, an efficient yet competitive segmentation framework based on context-guided spatial feature reconstruction. A Rectangular Self-Calibration Module is carefully designed for spatial feature reconstruction and pyramid context extraction. It captures the global context in both horizontal and vertical directions and gets the axial global context to explicitly model rectangular key areas. A shape self-calibration function is designed to make the key areas more close to the foreground object. Besides, a lightweight Dynamic Prototype Guided head is proposed to improve the classification of foreground objects by explicit class embedding. Our CGRSeg is extensively evaluated on ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, and Pascal Context benchmarks, and achieves state-of-the-art semantic performance. Specifically, it achieves $43.6\%$ mIoU on ADE20K with only $4.0$ GFLOPs, which is $0.9\%$ and $2.5\%$ mIoU better than SeaFormer and SegNeXt but with about $38.0\%$ fewer GFLOPs.

- **Summary**: In the realm of time series analysis, accurately measuring similarity is crucial for applications such as forecasting, anomaly detection, and clustering. However, existing metrics often fail to capture the complex, multidimensional nature of time series data, limiting their effectiveness and application. This paper introduces the Structured Similarity Index Measure for Time Series (TS3IM), a novel approach inspired by the success of the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) in image analysis, tailored to address these limitations by assessing structural similarity in time series. TS3IM evaluates multiple dimensions of similarity-trend, variability, and structural integrity-offering a more nuanced and comprehensive measure. This metric represents a significant leap forward, providing a robust tool for analyzing temporal data and offering more accurate and comprehensive sequence analysis and decision support in fields such as monitoring power consumption, analyzing traffic flow, and adversarial recognition. Our extensive experimental results also show that compared with traditional methods that rely heavily on computational correlation, TS3IM is 1.87 times more similar to Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in evaluation results and improves by more than 50% in adversarial recognition.

- **Summary**: This letter introduces a novel framework for dense Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) based on Gaussian Splatting. Recently Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM has yielded promising results, but rely on RGB-D input and is weak in tracking. To address these limitations, we uniquely integrates advanced sparse visual odometry with a dense Gaussian Splatting scene representation for the first time, thereby eliminating the dependency on depth maps typical of Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM systems and enhancing tracking robustness. Here, the sparse visual odometry tracks camera poses in RGB stream, while Gaussian Splatting handles map reconstruction. These components are interconnected through a Multi-View Stereo (MVS) depth estimation network. And we propose a depth smooth loss to reduce the negative effect of estimated depth maps. Furthermore, the consistency in scale between the sparse visual odometry and the dense Gaussian map is preserved by Sparse-Dense Adjustment Ring (SDAR). We have evaluated our system across various synthetic and real-world datasets. The accuracy of our pose estimation surpasses existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, it outperforms previous monocular methods in terms of novel view synthesis fidelity, matching the results of neural SLAM systems that utilize RGB-D input.

- **Summary**: Feature matching determines the orientation accuracy for the High Spatial Resolution (HSR) optical satellite stereos, subsequently impacting several significant applications such as 3D reconstruction and change detection. However, the matching of off-track HSR optical satellite stereos often encounters challenging conditions including wide-baseline observation, significant radiometric differences, multi-temporal changes, varying spatial resolutions, inconsistent spectral resolution, and diverse sensors. In this study, we evaluate various advanced feature matching algorithms for HSR optical satellite stereos. Utilizing a specially constructed dataset from five satellites across six challenging scenarios, HSROSS Dataset, we conduct a comparative analysis of four algorithms: the traditional SIFT, and deep-learning based methods including SuperPoint + SuperGlue, SuperPoint + LightGlue, and LoFTR. Our findings highlight overall superior performance of SuperPoint + LightGlue in balancing robustness, accuracy, distribution, and efficiency, showcasing its potential in complex HSR optical satellite scenarios.

- **Summary**: The advancement of agricultural robotics holds immense promise for transforming fruit harvesting practices, particularly within the apple industry. The accurate detection and localization of fruits are pivotal for the successful implementation of robotic harvesting systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to apple detection and position estimation utilizing an object detection model, YOLOv5. Our primary objective is to develop a robust system capable of identifying apples in complex orchard environments and providing precise location information. To achieve this, we curated an autonomously labeled dataset comprising diverse apple tree images, which was utilized for both training and evaluation purposes. Through rigorous experimentation, we compared the performance of our YOLOv5-based system with other popular object detection models, including SSD. Our results demonstrate that the YOLOv5 model outperforms its counterparts, achieving an impressive apple detection accuracy of approximately 85%. We believe that our proposed system's accurate apple detection and position estimation capabilities represent a significant advancement in agricultural robotics, laying the groundwork for more efficient and sustainable fruit harvesting practices.

- **Summary**: Lane detection (LD) plays a crucial role in enhancing the L2+ capabilities of autonomous driving, capturing widespread attention. The Post-Processing Quantization (PTQ) could facilitate the practical application of LD models, enabling fast speeds and limited memories without labeled data. However, prior PTQ methods do not consider the complex LD outputs that contain physical semantics, such as offsets, locations, etc., and thus cannot be directly applied to LD models. In this paper, we pioneeringly investigate semantic sensitivity to post-processing for lane detection with a novel Lane Distortion Score. Moreover, we identify two main factors impacting the LD performance after quantization, namely intra-head sensitivity and inter-head sensitivity, where a small quantization error in specific semantics can cause significant lane distortion. Thus, we propose a Selective Focus framework deployed with Semantic Guided Focus and Sensitivity Aware Selection modules, to incorporate post-processing information into PTQ reconstruction. Based on the observed intra-head sensitivity, Semantic Guided Focus is introduced to prioritize foreground-related semantics using a practical proxy. For inter-head sensitivity, we present Sensitivity Aware Selection, efficiently recognizing influential prediction heads and refining the optimization objectives at runtime. Extensive experiments have been done on a wide variety of models including keypoint-, anchor-, curve-, and segmentation-based ones. Our method produces quantized models in minutes on a single GPU and can achieve 6.4% F1 Score improvement on the CULane dataset.

- **Summary**: Semantic mapping with Bayesian Kernel Inference (BKI) has shown promise in providing a richer understanding of environments by effectively leveraging local spatial information. However, existing methods face challenges in constructing accurate semantic maps or reliable uncertainty maps in perceptually challenging environments due to unreliable semantic predictions. To address this issue, we propose an evidential semantic mapping framework, which integrates the evidential reasoning of Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence (DST) into the entire mapping pipeline by adopting Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) and Dempster's rule of combination. Additionally, the extended belief is devised to incorporate local spatial information based on their uncertainty during the mapping process. Comprehensive experiments across various off-road datasets demonstrate that our framework enhances the reliability of uncertainty maps, consistently outperforming existing methods in scenes with high perceptual uncertainties while showing semantic accuracy comparable to the best-performing semantic mapping techniques.

- **Summary**: Recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have demonstrated substantial potential in computer vision tasks. In this paper, we present an Efficient Spiking Deraining Network, called ESDNet. Our work is motivated by the observation that rain pixel values will lead to a more pronounced intensity of spike signals in SNNs. However, directly applying deep SNNs to image deraining task still remains a significant challenge. This is attributed to the information loss and training difficulties that arise from discrete binary activation and complex spatio-temporal dynamics. To this end, we develop a spiking residual block to convert the input into spike signals, then adaptively optimize the membrane potential by introducing attention weights to adjust spike responses in a data-driven manner, alleviating information loss caused by discrete binary activation. By this way, our ESDNet can effectively detect and analyze the characteristics of rain streaks by learning their fluctuations. This also enables better guidance for the deraining process and facilitates high-quality image reconstruction. Instead of relying on the ANN-SNN conversion strategy, we introduce a gradient proxy strategy to directly train the model for overcoming the challenge of training. Experimental results show that our approach gains comparable performance against ANN-based methods while reducing energy consumption by 54%.

- **Summary**: Adversarial attacks pose a significant challenge to deploying deep learning models in safety-critical applications. Maintaining model robustness while ensuring interpretability is vital for fostering trust and comprehension in these models. This study investigates the impact of Saliency-guided Training (SGT) on model robustness, a technique aimed at improving the clarity of saliency maps to deepen understanding of the model's decision-making process. Experiments were conducted on standard benchmark datasets using various deep learning architectures trained with and without SGT. Findings demonstrate that SGT enhances both model robustness and interpretability. Additionally, we propose a novel approach combining SGT with standard adversarial training to achieve even greater robustness while preserving saliency map quality. Our strategy is grounded in the assumption that preserving salient features crucial for correctly classifying adversarial examples enhances model robustness, while masking non-relevant features improves interpretability. Our technique yields significant gains, achieving a 35\% and 20\% improvement in robustness against PGD attack with noise magnitudes of $0.2$ and $0.02$ for the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively, while producing high-quality saliency maps.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has shown promising results for multiple 3D point cloud registration datasets. However, in the underwater domain, most registration of multibeam echo-sounder (MBES) point cloud data are still performed using classical methods in the iterative closest point (ICP) family. In this work, we curate and release DotsonEast Dataset, a semi-synthetic MBES registration dataset constructed from an autonomous underwater vehicle in West Antarctica. Using this dataset, we systematically benchmark the performance of 2 classical and 4 learning-based methods. The experimental results show that the learning-based methods work well for coarse alignment, and are better at recovering rough transforms consistently at high overlap (20-50%). In comparison, GICP (a variant of ICP) performs well for fine alignment and is better across all metrics at extremely low overlap (10%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to benchmark both learning-based and classical registration methods on an AUV-based MBES dataset. To facilitate future research, both the code and data are made available online.

- **Summary**: Ultra-fine-grained visual categorization (Ultra-FGVC) aims at distinguishing highly similar sub-categories within fine-grained objects, such as different soybean cultivars. Compared to traditional fine-grained visual categorization, Ultra-FGVC encounters more hurdles due to the small inter-class and large intra-class variation. Given these challenges, relying on human annotation for Ultra-FGVC is impractical. To this end, our work introduces a novel task termed Ultra-Fine-Grained Novel Class Discovery (UFG-NCD), which leverages partially annotated data to identify new categories of unlabeled images for Ultra-FGVC. To tackle this problem, we devise a Region-Aligned Proxy Learning (RAPL) framework, which comprises a Channel-wise Region Alignment (CRA) module and a Semi-Supervised Proxy Learning (SemiPL) strategy. The CRA module is designed to extract and utilize discriminative features from local regions, facilitating knowledge transfer from labeled to unlabeled classes. Furthermore, SemiPL strengthens representation learning and knowledge transfer with proxy-guided supervised learning and proxy-guided contrastive learning. Such techniques leverage class distribution information in the embedding space, improving the mining of subtle differences between labeled and unlabeled ultra-fine-grained classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAPL significantly outperforms baselines across various datasets, indicating its effectiveness in handling the challenges of UFG-NCD.

- **Summary**: Generalizability in deep neural networks plays a pivotal role in medical image segmentation. However, deep learning-based medical image analyses tend to overlook the importance of frequency variance, which is critical element for achieving a model that is both modality-agnostic and domain-generalizable. Additionally, various models fail to account for the potential information loss that can arise from multi-task learning under deep supervision, a factor that can impair the model representation ability. To address these challenges, we propose a Modality-agnostic Domain Generalizable Network (MADGNet) for medical image segmentation, which comprises two key components: a Multi-Frequency in Multi-Scale Attention (MFMSA) block and Ensemble Sub-Decoding Module (E-SDM). The MFMSA block refines the process of spatial feature extraction, particularly in capturing boundary features, by incorporating multi-frequency and multi-scale features, thereby offering informative cues for tissue outline and anatomical structures. Moreover, we propose E-SDM to mitigate information loss in multi-task learning with deep supervision, especially during substantial upsampling from low resolution. We evaluate the segmentation performance of MADGNet across six modalities and fifteen datasets. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MADGNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across various modalities, showcasing superior segmentation performance. This affirms MADGNet as a robust solution for medical image segmentation that excels in diverse imaging scenarios. Our MADGNet code is available in GitHub Link.

- **Summary**: With growing complexity and responsibility of automated driving functions in road traffic and growing scope of their operational design domains, there is increasing demand for covering significant parts of development, validation, and verification via virtual environments and simulation models.   If, however, simulations are meant not only to augment real-world experiments, but to replace them, quantitative approaches are required that measure to what degree and under which preconditions simulation models adequately represent reality, and thus allow their usage for virtual testing of driving functions. Especially in research and development areas related to the safety impacts of the "open world", there is a significant shortage of real-world data to parametrize and/or validate simulations - especially with respect to the behavior of human traffic participants, whom automated vehicles will meet in mixed traffic.   This paper presents the intermediate results of the German AVEAS research project (www.aveas.org) which aims at developing methods and metrics for the harmonized, systematic, and scalable acquisition of real-world data for virtual verification and validation of advanced driver assistance systems and automated driving, and establishing an online database following the FAIR principles.

- **Summary**: In weakly supervised medical image segmentation, the absence of structural priors and the discreteness of class feature distribution present a challenge, i.e., how to accurately propagate supervision signals from local to global regions without excessively spreading them to other irrelevant regions? To address this, we propose a novel weakly supervised medical image segmentation framework named PCLMix, comprising dynamic mix augmentation, pixel-level contrastive learning, and consistency regularization strategies. Specifically, PCLMix is built upon a heterogeneous dual-decoder backbone, addressing the absence of structural priors through a strategy of dynamic mix augmentation during training. To handle the discrete distribution of class features, PCLMix incorporates pixel-level contrastive learning based on prediction uncertainty, effectively enhancing the model's ability to differentiate inter-class pixel differences and intra-class consistency. Furthermore, to reinforce segmentation consistency and robustness, PCLMix employs an auxiliary decoder for dual consistency regularization. In the inference phase, the auxiliary decoder will be dropped and no computation complexity is increased. Extensive experiments on the ACDC dataset demonstrate that PCLMix appropriately propagates local supervision signals to the global scale, further narrowing the gap between weakly supervised and fully supervised segmentation methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Torpedo2648/PCLMix.

- **Summary**: The Universal Similarity Metric (USM) has been demonstrated to give practically useful measures of "similarity" between sequence data. Here we have used the USM as an alternative distance metric in a K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) learner to allow effective pattern recognition of variable length sequence data. We compare this USM approach with the commonly used string-to-word vector approach. Our experiments have used two data sets of divergent domains: (1) spam email filtering and (2) protein subcellular localization. Our results with this data reveal that the USM-based K-NN learner (1) gives predictions with higher classification accuracy than those output by techniques that use the string-to-word vector approach, and (2) can be used to generate reliable probability forecasts.

- **Summary**: This study investigates the cognitive plausibility of a pretrained multimodal model, CLIP, in recognizing emotions evoked by abstract visual art. We employ a dataset comprising images with associated emotion labels and textual rationales of these labels provided by human annotators. We perform linguistic analyses of rationales, zero-shot emotion classification of images and rationales, apply similarity-based prediction of emotion, and investigate color-emotion associations. The relatively low, yet above baseline, accuracy in recognizing emotion for abstract images and rationales suggests that CLIP decodes emotional complexities in a manner not well aligned with human cognitive processes. Furthermore, we explore color-emotion interactions in images and rationales. Expected color-emotion associations, such as red relating to anger, are identified in images and texts annotated with emotion labels by both humans and CLIP, with the latter showing even stronger interactions. Our results highlight the disparity between human processing and machine processing when connecting image features and emotions.

- **Summary**: In the context of recent, highly destructive conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, reliable estimates of building damage are essential for an informed public discourse, human rights monitoring, and humanitarian aid provision. Given the contentious nature of conflict damage assessment, these estimates must be fully reproducible, explainable, and derived from open access data. This paper introduces a new method for building damage detection-- the Pixel-Wise T-Test (PWTT)-- that satisfies these conditions. Using a combination of freely-available synthetic aperture radar imagery and statistical change detection, the PWTT generates accurate conflict damage estimates across a wide area at regular time intervals. Accuracy is assessed using an original dataset of over half a million labeled building footprints spanning 12 cities across Ukraine, Palestine, Syria, and Iraq. Despite being simple and lightweight, the algorithm achieves building-level accuracy statistics (AUC=0.88 across Ukraine, 0.81 in Gaza) rivalling state of the art methods that use deep learning and high resolution imagery. The workflow is open source and deployed entirely within the Google Earth Engine environment, allowing for the generation of interactive Battle Damage Dashboards for Ukraine and Gaza that update in near-real time, allowing the public and humanitarian practitioners to immediately get estimates of damaged buildings in a given area.



### Improving Transferable Targeted Adversarial Attack via Normalized Logit Calibration and Truncated Feature Mixing

- **Summary**: This paper aims to enhance the transferability of adversarial samples in targeted attacks, where attack success rates remain comparatively low. To achieve this objective, we propose two distinct techniques for improving the targeted transferability from the loss and feature aspects. First, in previous approaches, logit calibrations used in targeted attacks primarily focus on the logit margin between the targeted class and the untargeted classes among samples, neglecting the standard deviation of the logit. In contrast, we introduce a new normalized logit calibration method that jointly considers the logit margin and the standard deviation of logits. This approach effectively calibrates the logits, enhancing the targeted transferability. Second, previous studies have demonstrated that mixing the features of clean samples during optimization can significantly increase transferability. Building upon this, we further investigate a truncated feature mixing method to reduce the impact of the source training model, resulting in additional improvements. The truncated feature is determined by removing the Rank-1 feature associated with the largest singular value decomposed from the high-level convolutional layers of the clean sample. Extensive experiments conducted on the ImageNet-Compatible and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate the individual and mutual benefits of our proposed two components, which outperform the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in black-box targeted attacks.

- **Summary**: This paper focuses on the task of quality enhancement for compressed videos. Although deep network-based video restorers achieve impressive progress, most of the existing methods lack a structured design to optimally leverage the priors within compression codecs. Since the quality degradation of the video is primarily induced by the compression algorithm, a new paradigm is urgently needed for a more "conscious" process of quality enhancement. As a result, we propose the Compression-Realize Deep Structural Network (CRDS), introducing three inductive biases aligned with the three primary processes in the classic compression codec, merging the strengths of classical encoder architecture with deep network capabilities. Inspired by the residual extraction and domain transformation process in the codec, a pre-trained Latent Degradation Residual Auto-Encoder is proposed to transform video frames into a latent feature space, and the mutual neighborhood attention mechanism is integrated for precise motion estimation and residual extraction. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from the quantization noise distribution of the codec, CRDS proposes a novel Progressive Denoising framework with intermediate supervision that decomposes the quality enhancement into a series of simpler denoising sub-tasks. Experimental results on datasets like LDV 2.0 and MFQE 2.0 indicate our approach surpasses state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have dominated the majority of computer vision tasks. However, CNNs' vulnerability to adversarial attacks has raised concerns about deploying these models to safety-critical applications. In contrast, the Human Visual System (HVS), which utilizes spatial frequency channels to process visual signals, is immune to adversarial attacks. As such, this paper presents an empirical study exploring the vulnerability of CNN models in the frequency domain. Specifically, we utilize the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to construct the Spatial-Frequency (SF) layer to produce a block-wise frequency spectrum of an input image and formulate Spatial Frequency CNNs (SF-CNNs) by replacing the initial feature extraction layers of widely-used CNN backbones with the SF layer. Through extensive experiments, we observe that SF-CNN models are more robust than their CNN counterparts under both white-box and black-box attacks. To further explain the robustness of SF-CNNs, we compare the SF layer with a trainable convolutional layer with identical kernel sizes using two mixing strategies to show that the lower frequency components contribute the most to the adversarial robustness of SF-CNNs. We believe our observations can guide the future design of robust CNN models.

However, SalfMix reliance on duplicating salient features poses a risk of overfitting, potentially compromising the model's generalization capabilities. Conversely, KeepAugment, which selectively preserves salient regions and augments non-salient ones, introduces a domain shift that hinders the exchange of crucial contextual information, impeding overall model understanding. In response to these challenges, we introduce KeepOriginalAugment, a novel data augmentation approach. This method intelligently incorporates the most salient region within the non-salient area, allowing augmentation to be applied to either region. Striking a balance between data diversity and information preservation, KeepOriginalAugment enables models to leverage both diverse salient and non-salient regions, leading to enhanced performance. We explore three strategies for determining the placement of the salient region minimum, maximum, or random and investigate swapping perspective strategies to decide which part (salient or non-salient) undergoes augmentation. Our experimental evaluations, conducted on classification datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate the superior performance of KeepOriginalAugment compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.

- **Summary**: Atmospheric turbulence poses a significant challenge to the performance of object detection models. Turbulence causes distortions, blurring, and noise in images by bending and scattering light rays due to variations in the refractive index of air. This results in non-rigid geometric distortions and temporal fluctuations in the electromagnetic radiation received by optical systems. This paper explores the effectiveness of turbulence image augmentation techniques in improving the accuracy and robustness of thermal-adapted and deep learning-based object detection models under atmospheric turbulence. Three distinct approximation-based turbulence simulators (geometric, Zernike-based, and P2S) are employed to generate turbulent training and test datasets. The performance of three state-of-the-art deep learning-based object detection models: RTMDet-x, DINO-4scale, and YOLOv8-x, is employed on these turbulent datasets with and without turbulence augmentation during training. The results demonstrate that utilizing turbulence-specific augmentations during model training can significantly improve detection accuracy and robustness against distorted turbulent images. Turbulence augmentation enhances performance even for a non-turbulent test set.

- **Summary**: Continual Novel Class Discovery (CNCD) aims to continually discover novel classes without labels while maintaining the recognition capability for previously learned classes. The main challenges faced by CNCD include the feature-discrepancy problem, the inter-session confusion problem, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel Feature Enhancement and Adaptation method for the CNCD to tackle the above challenges, which consists of a guide-to-novel framework, a centroid-to-samples similarity constraint (CSS), and a boundary-aware prototype constraint (BAP). More specifically, the guide-to-novel framework is established to continually discover novel classes under the guidance of prior distribution. Afterward, the CSS is designed to constrain the relationship between centroid-to-samples similarities of different classes, thereby enhancing the distinctiveness of features among novel classes. Finally, the BAP is proposed to keep novel class features aware of the positions of other class prototypes during incremental sessions, and better adapt novel class features to the shared feature space. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, especially in more challenging protocols with more incremental sessions.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting is a novel method for 3D view synthesis, which can gain an implicit neural learning rendering result than the traditional neural rendering technology but keep the more high-definition fast rendering speed. But it is still difficult to achieve a fast enough efficiency on 3D Gaussian Splatting for the practical applications. To Address this issue, we propose the I3DS, a synthetic model performance improvement evaluation solution and experiments test. From multiple and important levels or dimensions of the original 3D Gaussian Splatting, we made more than two thousand various kinds of experiments to test how the selected different items and components can make an impact on the training efficiency of the 3D Gaussian Splatting model. In this paper, we will share abundant and meaningful experiences and methods about how to improve the training, performance and the impacts caused by different items of the model. A special but normal Integer compression in base 95 and a floating-point compression in base 94 with ASCII encoding and decoding mechanism is presented. Many real and effective experiments and test results or phenomena will be recorded. After a series of reasonable fine-tuning, I3DS can gain excellent performance improvements than the previous one. The project code is available as open source.

- **Summary**: Purpose: To introduce a deep learning model capable of multi-organ segmentation in MRI scans, offering a solution to the current limitations in MRI analysis due to challenges in resolution, standardized intensity values, and variability in sequences.   Materials and Methods: he model was trained on 1,200 manually annotated MRI scans from the UK Biobank, 221 in-house MRI scans and 1228 CT scans, leveraging cross-modality transfer learning from CT segmentation models. A human-in-the-loop annotation workflow was employed to efficiently create high-quality segmentations. The model's performance was evaluated on NAKO and the AMOS22 dataset containing 600 and 60 MRI examinations. Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff Distance (HD) was used to assess segmentation accuracy. The model will be open sourced.   Results: The model showcased high accuracy in segmenting well-defined organs, achieving Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) scores of 0.97 for the right and left lungs, and 0.95 for the heart. It also demonstrated robustness in organs like the liver (DSC: 0.96) and kidneys (DSC: 0.95 left, 0.95 right), which present more variability. However, segmentation of smaller and complex structures such as the portal and splenic veins (DSC: 0.54) and adrenal glands (DSC: 0.65 left, 0.61 right) revealed the need for further model optimization.   Conclusion: The proposed model is a robust, tool for accurate segmentation of 40 anatomical structures in MRI and CT images. By leveraging cross-modality learning and interactive annotation, the model achieves strong performance and generalizability across diverse datasets, making it a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised anomaly detection encompasses diverse applications in industrial settings where a high-throughput and precision is imperative. Early works were centered around one-class-one-model paradigm, which poses significant challenges in large-scale production environments. Knowledge-distillation based multi-class anomaly detection promises a low latency with a reasonably good performance but with a significant drop as compared to one-class version. We propose a DCAM (Distributed Convolutional Attention Module) which improves the distillation process between teacher and student networks when there is a high variance among multiple classes or objects. Integrated multi-scale feature matching strategy to utilise a mixture of multi-level knowledge from the feature pyramid of the two networks, intuitively helping in detecting anomalies of varying sizes which is also an inherent problem in the multi-class scenario. Briefly, our DCAM module consists of Convolutional Attention blocks distributed across the feature maps of the student network, which essentially learns to masks the irrelevant information during student learning alleviating the "cross-class interference" problem. This process is accompanied by minimizing the relative entropy using KL-Divergence in Spatial dimension and a Channel-wise Cosine Similarity between the same feature maps of teacher and student. The losses enables to achieve scale-invariance and capture non-linear relationships. We also highlight that the DCAM module would only be used during training and not during inference as we only need the learned feature maps and losses for anomaly scoring and hence, gaining a performance gain of 3.92% than the multi-class baseline with a preserved latency.

- **Summary**: The task of medical image recognition is notably complicated by the presence of varied and multiple pathological indications, presenting a unique challenge in multi-label classification with unseen labels. This complexity underlines the need for computer-aided diagnosis methods employing multi-label zero-shot learning. Recent advancements in pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have showcased notable zero-shot classification abilities on medical images. However, these methods have limitations on leveraging extensive pre-trained knowledge from broader image datasets, and often depend on manual prompt construction by expert radiologists. By automating the process of prompt tuning, prompt learning techniques have emerged as an efficient way to adapt VLMs to downstream tasks. Yet, existing CoOp-based strategies fall short in performing class-specific prompts on unseen categories, limiting generalizability in fine-grained scenarios. To overcome these constraints, we introduce a novel prompt generation approach inspirited by text generation in natural language processing (NLP). Our method, named Pseudo-Prompt Generating (PsPG), capitalizes on the priori knowledge of multi-modal features. Featuring a RNN-based decoder, PsPG autoregressively generates class-tailored embedding vectors, i.e., pseudo-prompts. Comparative evaluations on various multi-label chest radiograph datasets affirm the superiority of our approach against leading medical vision-language and multi-label prompt learning methods.

- **Summary**: The technology of autonomous driving is currently attracting a great deal of interest in both research and industry. In this paper, we present a deep learning dual-model solution that uses two deep neural networks for combined braking and steering in autonomous vehicles. Steering control is achieved by applying the NVIDIA's PilotNet model to predict the steering wheel angle, while braking control relies on the use of MobileNet SSD. Both models rely on a single front-facing camera for image input. The MobileNet SSD model is suitable for devices with constrained resources, whereas PilotNet struggles to operate efficiently on smaller devices with limited resources. To make it suitable for such devices, we modified the PilotNet model using our own original network design and reduced the number of model parameters and its memory footprint by approximately 60%. The inference latency has also been reduced, making the model more suitable to operate on resource-constrained devices. The modified PilotNet model achieves similar loss and accuracy compared to the original PilotNet model. When evaluated in a simulated environment, both autonomous driving systems, one using the modified PilotNet model and the other using the original PilotNet model for steering, show similar levels of autonomous driving performance.

- **Summary**: Multi-target unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to learn a unified model to address the domain shift between multiple target domains. Due to the difficulty of obtaining annotations for dense predictions, it has recently been introduced into cross-domain semantic segmentation. However, most existing solutions require labeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data from multiple target domains concurrently during training. Collectively, we refer to this data as "external". When faced with new unlabeled data from an unseen target domain, these solutions either do not generalize well or require retraining from scratch on all data. To address these challenges, we introduce a new strategy called "multi-target UDA without external data" for semantic segmentation. Specifically, the segmentation model is initially trained on the external data. Then, it is adapted to a new unseen target domain without accessing any external data. This approach is thus more scalable than existing solutions and remains applicable when external data is inaccessible. We demonstrate this strategy using a simple method that incorporates self-distillation and adversarial learning, where knowledge acquired from the external data is preserved during adaptation through "one-way" adversarial learning. Extensive experiments in several synthetic-to-real and real-to-real adaptation settings on four benchmark urban driving datasets show that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art solutions, even in the absence of external data.

- **Summary**: Vanilla pixel-level classifiers for semantic segmentation are based on a certain paradigm, involving the inner product of fixed prototypes obtained from the training set and pixel features in the test image. This approach, however, encounters significant limitations, i.e., feature deviation in the semantic domain and information loss in the spatial domain. The former struggles with large intra-class variance among pixel features from different images, while the latter fails to utilize the structured information of semantic objects effectively. This leads to blurred mask boundaries as well as a deficiency of fine-grained recognition capability. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic and Spatial Adaptive (SSA) classifier to address the above challenges. Specifically, we employ the coarse masks obtained from the fixed prototypes as a guide to adjust the fixed prototype towards the center of the semantic and spatial domains in the test image. The adapted prototypes in semantic and spatial domains are then simultaneously considered to accomplish classification decisions. In addition, we propose an online multi-domain distillation learning strategy to improve the adaption process. Experimental results on three publicly available benchmarks show that the proposed SSA significantly improves the segmentation performance of the baseline models with only a minimal increase in computational cost.

- **Summary**: Compositional image generation requires models to generalise well in situations where two or more input concepts do not necessarily appear together in training (compositional generalisation). Despite recent progress in compositional image generation via composing continuous sampling processes such as diffusion and energy-based models, composing discrete generative processes has remained an open challenge, with the promise of providing improvements in efficiency, interpretability and simplicity. To this end, we propose a formulation for controllable conditional generation of images via composing the log-probability outputs of discrete generative models of the latent space. Our approach, when applied alongside VQ-VAE and VQ-GAN, achieves state-of-the-art generation accuracy in three distinct settings (FFHQ, Positional CLEVR and Relational CLEVR) while attaining competitive Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores. Our method attains an average generation accuracy of $80.71\%$ across the studied settings. Our method also outperforms the next-best approach (ranked by accuracy) in terms of FID in seven out of nine experiments, with an average FID of $24.23$ (an average improvement of $-9.58$). Furthermore, our method offers a $2.3\times$ to $12\times$ speedup over comparable continuous compositional methods on our hardware. We find that our method can generalise to combinations of input conditions that lie outside the training data (e.g. more objects per image) in addition to offering an interpretable dimension of controllability via concept weighting. We further demonstrate that our approach can be readily applied to an open pre-trained discrete text-to-image model without any fine-tuning, allowing for fine-grained control of text-to-image generation.

- **Summary**: Mesh denoising, aimed at removing noise from input meshes while preserving their feature structures, is a practical yet challenging task. Despite the remarkable progress in learning-based mesh denoising methodologies in recent years, their network designs often encounter two principal drawbacks: a dependence on single-modal geometric representations, which fall short in capturing the multifaceted attributes of meshes, and a lack of effective global feature aggregation, hindering their ability to fully understand the mesh's comprehensive structure. To tackle these issues, we propose SurfaceFormer, a pioneering Transformer-based mesh denoising framework. Our first contribution is the development of a new representation known as Local Surface Descriptor, which is crafted by establishing polar systems on each mesh face, followed by sampling points from adjacent surfaces using geodesics. The normals of these points are organized into 2D patches, mimicking images to capture local geometric intricacies, whereas the poles and vertex coordinates are consolidated into a point cloud to embody spatial information. This advancement surmounts the hurdles posed by the irregular and non-Euclidean characteristics of mesh data, facilitating a smooth integration with Transformer architecture. Next, we propose a dual-stream structure consisting of a Geometric Encoder branch and a Spatial Encoder branch, which jointly encode local geometry details and spatial information to fully explore multimodal information for mesh denoising. A subsequent Denoising Transformer module receives the multimodal information and achieves efficient global feature aggregation through self-attention operators. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that this novel approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both objective and subjective assessments, marking a significant leap forward in mesh denoising.

- **Summary**: One image to editable dynamic 3D model and video generation is novel direction and change in the research area of single image to 3D representation or 3D reconstruction of image. Gaussian Splatting has demonstrated its advantages in implicit 3D reconstruction, compared with the original Neural Radiance Fields. As the rapid development of technologies and principles, people tried to used the Stable Diffusion models to generate targeted models with text instructions. However, using the normal implicit machine learning methods is hard to gain the precise motions and actions control, further more, it is difficult to generate a long content and semantic continuous 3D video. To address this issue, we propose the OneTo3D, a method and theory to used one single image to generate the editable 3D model and generate the targeted semantic continuous time-unlimited 3D video. We used a normal basic Gaussian Splatting model to generate the 3D model from a single image, which requires less volume of video memory and computer calculation ability. Subsequently, we designed an automatic generation and self-adaptive binding mechanism for the object armature. Combined with the re-editable motions and actions analyzing and controlling algorithm we proposed, we can achieve a better performance than the SOTA projects in the area of building the 3D model precise motions and actions control, and generating a stable semantic continuous time-unlimited 3D video with the input text instructions. Here we will analyze the detailed implementation methods and theories analyses. Relative comparisons and conclusions will be presented. The project code is open source.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is a core computer vision problem, but the high costs of data annotation have hindered its wide application. Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) offers a cost-efficient workaround to extensive labeling in comparison to fully-supervised methods by using partial or incomplete labels. Existing WSSS methods have difficulties in learning the boundaries of objects leading to poor segmentation results. We propose a novel and effective framework that addresses these issues by leveraging visual foundation models inside the bounding box. Adopting a two-stage WSSS framework, our proposed network consists of a pseudo-label generation module and a segmentation module. The first stage leverages Segment Anything Model (SAM) to generate high-quality pseudo-labels. To alleviate the problem of delineating precise boundaries, we adopt SAM inside the bounding box with the help of another pre-trained foundation model (e.g., Grounding-DINO). Furthermore, we eliminate the necessity of using the supervision of image labels, by employing CLIP in classification. Then in the second stage, the generated high-quality pseudo-labels are used to train an off-the-shelf segmenter that achieves the state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014.

- **Summary**: This work presents the first quantitative study of alignment errors between small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) geospatial imagery and a priori building polygons and finds that alignment errors are non-uniform and irregular. The work also introduces a publicly available dataset of imagery, building polygons, and human-generated and curated adjustments that can be used to evaluate existing strategies for aligning building polygons with sUAS imagery. There are no efforts that have aligned pre-existing spatial data with sUAS imagery, and thus, there is no clear state of practice. However, this effort and analysis show that the translational alignment errors present in this type of data, averaging 82px and an intersection over the union of 0.65, which would induce further errors and biases in downstream machine learning systems unless addressed. This study identifies and analyzes the translational alignment errors of 21,619 building polygons in fifty-one orthomosaic images, covering 16787.2 Acres (26.23 square miles), constructed from sUAS raw imagery from nine wide-area disasters (Hurricane Ian, Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Michael, Hurricane Ida, Hurricane Idalia, Hurricane Laura, the Mayfield Tornado, the Musset Bayou Fire, and the Kilauea Eruption). The analysis finds no uniformity among the angle and distance metrics of the building polygon alignments as they present an average degree variance of 0.4 and an average pixel distance variance of 0.45. This work alerts the sUAS community to the problem of spatial alignment and that a simple linear transform, often used to align satellite imagery, will not be sufficient to align spatial data in sUAS orthomosaic imagery.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing image change captioning (RSICC) aims to automatically generate sentences that describe content differences in remote sensing bitemporal images. Recently, attention-based transformers have become a prevalent idea for capturing the features of global change. However, existing transformer-based RSICC methods face challenges, e.g., high parameters and high computational complexity caused by the self-attention operation in the transformer encoder component. To alleviate these issues, this paper proposes a Sparse Focus Transformer (SFT) for the RSICC task. Specifically, the SFT network consists of three main components, i.e. a high-level features extractor based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), a sparse focus attention mechanism-based transformer encoder network designed to locate and capture changing regions in dual-temporal images, and a description decoder that embeds images and words to generate sentences for captioning differences. The proposed SFT network can reduce the parameter number and computational complexity by incorporating a sparse attention mechanism within the transformer encoder network. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that even with a reduction of over 90\% in parameters and computational complexity for the transformer encoder, our proposed network can still obtain competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art RSICC methods.

- **Summary**: Low-light scenes are prevalent in real-world applications (e.g. autonomous driving and surveillance at night). Recently, multi-object tracking in various practical use cases have received much attention, but multi-object tracking in dark scenes is rarely considered. In this paper, we focus on multi-object tracking in dark scenes. To address the lack of datasets, we first build a Low-light Multi-Object Tracking (LMOT) dataset. LMOT provides well-aligned low-light video pairs captured by our dual-camera system, and high-quality multi-object tracking annotations for all videos. Then, we propose a low-light multi-object tracking method, termed as LTrack. We introduce the adaptive low-pass downsample module to enhance low-frequency components of images outside the sensor noises. The degradation suppression learning strategy enables the model to learn invariant information under noise disturbance and image quality degradation. These components improve the robustness of multi-object tracking in dark scenes. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of our LMOT dataset and proposed LTrack. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method and its competitiveness in real night low-light scenes. Dataset and Code: https: //github.com/ying-fu/LMOT

- **Summary**: We evaluate the zero-shot ability of GPT-4 and LLaVa to perform simple Visual Network Analysis (VNA) tasks on small-scale graphs. We evaluate the Vision Language Models (VLMs) on 5 tasks related to three foundational network science concepts: identifying nodes of maximal degree on a rendered graph, identifying whether signed triads are balanced or unbalanced, and counting components. The tasks are structured to be easy for a human who understands the underlying graph theoretic concepts, and can all be solved by counting the appropriate elements in graphs. We find that while GPT-4 consistently outperforms LLaVa, both models struggle with every visual network analysis task we propose. We publicly release the first benchmark for the evaluation of VLMs on foundational VNA tasks.

- **Summary**: An important handicap of document analysis research is that documents tend to be copyrighted or contain private information, which prohibits their open publication and the creation of centralised, large-scale document datasets. Instead, documents are scattered in private data silos, making extensive training over heterogeneous data a tedious task. In this work, we explore the use of a federated learning (FL) scheme as a way to train a shared model on decentralised private document data. We focus on the problem of Document VQA, a task particularly suited to this approach, as the type of reasoning capabilities required from the model can be quite different in diverse domains. Enabling training over heterogeneous document datasets can thus substantially enrich DocVQA models. We assemble existing DocVQA datasets from diverse domains to reflect the data heterogeneity in real-world applications. We explore the self-pretraining technique in this multi-modal setting, where the same data is used for both pretraining and finetuning, making it relevant for privacy preservation. We further propose combining self-pretraining with a Federated DocVQA training method using centralized adaptive optimization that outperforms the FedAvg baseline. With extensive experiments, we also present a multi-faceted analysis on training DocVQA models with FL, which provides insights for future research on this task. We show that our pretraining strategies can effectively learn and scale up under federated training with diverse DocVQA datasets and tuning hyperparameters is essential for practical document tasks under federation.

- **Summary**: In the last twenty years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have garnered growing interest due to their expanding applications in both military and civilian domains. Detecting non-cooperative aerial vehicles with efficiency and estimating collisions accurately are pivotal for achieving fully autonomous aircraft and facilitating Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). This paper presents a deep-learning framework that utilizes optical sensors for the detection, tracking, and distance estimation of non-cooperative aerial vehicles. In implementing this comprehensive sensing framework, the availability of depth information is essential for enabling autonomous aerial vehicles to perceive and navigate around obstacles. In this work, we propose a method for estimating the distance information of a detected aerial object in real time using only the input of a monocular camera. In order to train our deep learning components for the object detection, tracking and depth estimation tasks we utilize the Amazon Airborne Object Tracking (AOT) Dataset. In contrast to previous approaches that integrate the depth estimation module into the object detector, our method formulates the problem as image-to-image translation. We employ a separate lightweight encoder-decoder network for efficient and robust depth estimation. In a nutshell, the object detection module identifies and localizes obstacles, conveying this information to both the tracking module for monitoring obstacle movement and the depth estimation module for calculating distances. Our approach is evaluated on the Airborne Object Tracking (AOT) dataset which is the largest (to the best of our knowledge) air-to-air airborne object dataset.

- **Summary**: The main barrier to achieving fully autonomous flights lies in autonomous aircraft navigation. Managing non-cooperative traffic presents the most important challenge in this problem. The most efficient strategy for handling non-cooperative traffic is based on monocular video processing through deep learning models. This study contributes to the vision-based deep learning aircraft detection and tracking literature by investigating the impact of data corruption arising from environmental and hardware conditions on the effectiveness of these methods. More specifically, we designed $7$ types of common corruptions for camera inputs taking into account real-world flight conditions. By applying these corruptions to the Airborne Object Tracking (AOT) dataset we constructed the first robustness benchmark dataset named AOT-C for air-to-air aerial object detection. The corruptions included in this dataset cover a wide range of challenging conditions such as adverse weather and sensor noise. The second main contribution of this letter is to present an extensive experimental evaluation involving $8$ diverse object detectors to explore the degradation in the performance under escalating levels of corruptions (domain shifts). Based on the evaluation results, the key observations that emerge are the following: 1) One-stage detectors of the YOLO family demonstrate better robustness, 2) Transformer-based and multi-stage detectors like Faster R-CNN are extremely vulnerable to corruptions, 3) Robustness against corruptions is related to the generalization ability of models. The third main contribution is to present that finetuning on our augmented synthetic data results in improvements in the generalisation ability of the object detector in real-world flight experiments.

- **Summary**: Human motion synthesis is an important task in computer graphics and computer vision. While focusing on various conditioning signals such as text, action class, or audio to guide the generation process, most existing methods utilize skeleton-based pose representation, requiring additional skinning to produce renderable meshes. Given that human motion is a complex interplay of bones, joints, and muscles, considering solely the skeleton for generation may neglect their inherent interdependency, which can limit the variability and precision of the generated results. To address this issue, we propose a Shape-conditioned Motion Diffusion model (SMD), which enables the generation of motion sequences directly in mesh format, conditioned on a specified target mesh. In SMD, the input meshes are transformed into spectral coefficients using graph Laplacian, to efficiently represent meshes. Subsequently, we propose a Spectral-Temporal Autoencoder (STAE) to leverage cross-temporal dependencies within the spectral domain. Extensive experimental evaluations show that SMD not only produces vivid and realistic motions but also achieves competitive performance in text-to-motion and action-to-motion tasks when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Accurate and effective 3D object detection is critical for ensuring the driving safety of autonomous vehicles. Recently, state-of-the-art two-stage 3D object detectors have exhibited promising performance. However, these methods refine proposals individually, ignoring the rich contextual information in the object relationships between the neighbor proposals. In this study, we introduce an object relation module, consisting of a graph generator and a graph neural network (GNN), to learn the spatial information from certain patterns to improve 3D object detection. Specifically, we create an inter-object relationship graph based on proposals in a frame via the graph generator to connect each proposal with its neighbor proposals. Afterward, the GNN module extracts edge features from the generated graph and iteratively refines proposal features with the captured edge features. Ultimately, we leverage the refined features as input to the detection head to obtain detection results. Our approach improves upon the baseline PV-RCNN on the KITTI validation set for the car class across easy, moderate, and hard difficulty levels by 0.82%, 0.74%, and 0.58%, respectively. Additionally, our method outperforms the baseline by more than 1% under the moderate and hard levels BEV AP on the test server.

- **Summary**: We introduce SAM3D, a new approach to semi-automatic zero-shot segmentation of 3D images building on the existing Segment Anything Model. We achieve fast and accurate segmentations in 3D images with a four-step strategy comprising: volume slicing along non-orthogonal axes, efficient prompting in 3D, slice-wise inference using the pretrained SAM, and recoposition and refinement in 3D. We evaluated SAM3D performance qualitatively on an array of imaging modalities and anatomical structures and quantify performance for specific organs in body CT and tumors in brain MRI. By enabling users to create 3D segmentations of unseen data quickly and with dramatically reduced manual input, these methods have the potential to aid surgical planning and education, diagnostic imaging, and scientific research.

- **Summary**: Denoising diffusion models (DDM) have gained recent traction in medical image translation given improved training stability over adversarial models. DDMs learn a multi-step denoising transformation to progressively map random Gaussian-noise images onto target-modality images, while receiving stationary guidance from source-modality images. As this denoising transformation diverges significantly from the task-relevant source-to-target transformation, DDMs can suffer from weak source-modality guidance. Here, we propose a novel self-consistent recursive diffusion bridge (SelfRDB) for improved performance in medical image translation. Unlike DDMs, SelfRDB employs a novel forward process with start- and end-points defined based on target and source images, respectively. Intermediate image samples across the process are expressed via a normal distribution with mean taken as a convex combination of start-end points, and variance from additive noise. Unlike regular diffusion bridges that prescribe zero variance at start-end points and high variance at mid-point of the process, we propose a novel noise scheduling with monotonically increasing variance towards the end-point in order to boost generalization performance and facilitate information transfer between the two modalities. To further enhance sampling accuracy in each reverse step, we propose a novel sampling procedure where the network recursively generates a transient-estimate of the target image until convergence onto a self-consistent solution. Comprehensive analyses in multi-contrast MRI and MRI-CT translation indicate that SelfRDB offers superior performance against competing methods.

- **Summary**: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a severe and sudden medical condition caused by the rupture of blood vessels in the brain, leading to permanent damage to brain tissue and often resulting in functional disabilities or death in patients. Diagnosis and analysis of ICH typically rely on brain CT imaging. Given the urgency of ICH conditions, early treatment is crucial, necessitating rapid analysis of CT images to formulate tailored treatment plans. However, the complexity of ICH CT images and the frequent scarcity of specialist radiologists pose significant challenges. Therefore, we built a dataset for ICH and normal classification and three types of ICH image classification based on the hemorrhage location, i.e., Deep, Subcortical, and Lobar. In addition, we propose a dual-task vision transformer (DTViT) for the automated classification and diagnosis of ICH images. This neural network utilizes the encoder from ViT, employing attention mechanisms for feature extraction from CT images. We incorporated two multilayer perception (MLP)-based decoders within the network to simultaneously identify the presence of ICH and classify three types of hemorrhage locations. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed multi-classification network performs well on the built real-world test dataset. The code and dataset for this study will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance at: https://github.com/Jialiangfan/ICH-classification.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel task named "3D part grouping". Suppose there is a mixed set containing scattered parts from various shapes. This task requires algorithms to find out every possible combination among all the parts. To address this challenge, we propose the so called Gradient Field-based Auto-Regressive Sampling framework (G-FARS) tailored specifically for the 3D part grouping task. In our framework, we design a gradient-field-based selection graph neural network (GNN) to learn the gradients of a log conditional probability density in terms of part selection, where the condition is the given mixed part set. This innovative approach, implemented through the gradient-field-based selection GNN, effectively captures complex relationships among all the parts in the input. Upon completion of the training process, our framework becomes capable of autonomously grouping 3D parts by iteratively selecting them from the mixed part set, leveraging the knowledge acquired by the trained gradient-field-based selection GNN. Our code is available at: https://github.com/J-F-Cheng/G-FARS-3DPartGrouping.

- **Summary**: The increasing integration of machine learning algorithms in daily life underscores the critical need for fairness and equity in their deployment. As these technologies play a pivotal role in decision-making, addressing biases across diverse subpopulation groups, including age, gender, and race, becomes paramount. Automatic affect analysis, at the intersection of physiology, psychology, and machine learning, has seen significant development. However, existing databases and methodologies lack uniformity, leading to biased evaluations. This work addresses these issues by analyzing six affective databases, annotating demographic attributes, and proposing a common protocol for database partitioning. Emphasis is placed on fairness in evaluations. Extensive experiments with baseline and state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the impact of these changes, revealing the inadequacy of prior assessments. The findings underscore the importance of considering demographic attributes in affect analysis research and provide a foundation for more equitable methodologies.

- **Summary**: It is now possible to estimate 3D human pose from monocular images with off-the-shelf 3D pose estimators. However, many practical applications require fine-grained absolute pose information for which multi-view cues and camera calibration are necessary. Such multi-view recordings are laborious because they require manual calibration, and are expensive when using dedicated hardware. Our goal is full automation, which includes temporal synchronization, as well as intrinsic and extrinsic camera calibration. This is done by using persons in the scene as the calibration objects. Existing methods either address only synchronization or calibration, assume one of the former as input, or have significant limitations. A common limitation is that they only consider single persons, which eases correspondence finding. We attain this generality by partitioning the high-dimensional time and calibration space into a cascade of subspaces and introduce tailored algorithms to optimize each efficiently and robustly. The outcome is an easy-to-use, flexible, and robust motion capture toolbox that we release to enable scientific applications, which we demonstrate on diverse multi-view benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Vision graph neural networks (ViG) offer a new avenue for exploration in computer vision. A major bottleneck in ViGs is the inefficient k-nearest neighbor (KNN) operation used for graph construction. To solve this issue, we propose a new method for designing ViGs, Dynamic Axial Graph Construction (DAGC), which is more efficient than KNN as it limits the number of considered graph connections made within an image. Additionally, we propose a novel CNN-GNN architecture, GreedyViG, which uses DAGC. Extensive experiments show that GreedyViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy, GMACs, and parameters on image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation tasks. Our smallest model, GreedyViG-S, achieves 81.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, 2.9% higher than Vision GNN and 2.2% higher than Vision HyperGraph Neural Network (ViHGNN), with less GMACs and a similar number of parameters. Our largest model, GreedyViG-B obtains 83.9% top-1 accuracy, 0.2% higher than Vision GNN, with a 66.6% decrease in parameters and a 69% decrease in GMACs. GreedyViG-B also obtains the same accuracy as ViHGNN with a 67.3% decrease in parameters and a 71.3% decrease in GMACs. Our work shows that hybrid CNN-GNN architectures not only provide a new avenue for designing efficient models, but that they can also exceed the performance of current state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: In recent years many methods have been developed to understand the internal workings of neural networks, often by describing the function of individual neurons in the model. However, these methods typically only focus on explaining the very highest activations of a neuron. In this paper we show this is not sufficient, and that the highest activation range is only responsible for a very small percentage of the neuron's causal effect. In addition, inputs causing lower activations are often very different and can't be reliably predicted by only looking at high activations. We propose that neurons should instead be understood as a linear combination of concepts, and develop an efficient method for producing these linear explanations. In addition, we show how to automatically evaluate description quality using simulation, i.e. predicting neuron activations on unseen inputs in vision setting.
