- **Summary**: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) consistently requires language and appearance semantics to more understand each other. The need becomes acute especially under hard situations. To achieve, existing works tend to resort to various trans-representing mechanisms to directly feed forward language semantic along main RGB branch, which however will result in referent distribution weakly-mined in space and non-referent semantic contaminated along channel. In this paper, we propose Spatial Semantic Recurrent Mining (S\textsuperscript{2}RM) to achieve high-quality cross-modality fusion. It follows a working strategy of trilogy: distributing language feature, spatial semantic recurrent coparsing, and parsed-semantic balancing. During fusion, S\textsuperscript{2}RM will first generate a constraint-weak yet distribution-aware language feature, then bundle features of each row and column from rotated features of one modality context to recurrently correlate relevant semantic contained in feature from other modality context, and finally resort to self-distilled weights to weigh on the contributions of different parsed semantics. Via coparsing, S\textsuperscript{2}RM transports information from the near and remote slice layers of generator context to the current slice layer of parsed context, capable of better modeling global relationship bidirectional and structured. Besides, we also propose a Cross-scale Abstract Semantic Guided Decoder (CASG) to emphasize the foreground of the referent, finally integrating different grained features at a comparatively low cost. Extensive experimental results on four current challenging datasets show that our proposed method performs favorably against other state-of-the-art algorithms.

- **Summary**: The ambiguous appearance, tiny scale, and fine-grained classes of objects in remote sensing imagery inevitably lead to the noisy annotations in category labels of detection dataset. However, the effects and treatments of the label noises are underexplored in modern oriented remote sensing object detectors. To address this issue, we propose a robust oriented remote sensing object detection method through dynamic loss decay (DLD) mechanism, inspired by the two phase ``early-learning'' and ``memorization'' learning dynamics of deep neural networks on clean and noisy samples. To be specific, we first observe the end point of early learning phase termed as EL, after which the models begin to memorize the false labels that significantly degrade the detection accuracy. Secondly, under the guidance of the training indicator, the losses of each sample are ranked in descending order, and we adaptively decay the losses of the top K largest ones (bad samples) in the following epochs. Because these large losses are of high confidence to be calculated with wrong labels. Experimental results show that the method achieves excellent noise resistance performance tested on multiple public datasets such as HRSC2016 and DOTA-v1.0/v2.0 with synthetic category label noise. Our solution also has won the 2st place in the "fine-grained object detection based on sub-meter remote sensing imagery" track with noisy labels of 2023 National Big Data and Computing Intelligence Challenge.

- **Summary**: Significant progress has been made in the field of handwritten mathematical expression recognition, while existing encoder-decoder methods are usually difficult to model global information in \LaTeX. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel approach, Implicit Character-Aided Learning (ICAL), to mine the global expression information and enhance handwritten mathematical expression recognition. Specifically, we propose the Implicit Character Construction Module (ICCM) to predict implicit character sequences and use a Fusion Module to merge the outputs of the ICCM and the decoder, thereby producing corrected predictions. By modeling and utilizing implicit character information, ICAL achieves a more accurate and context-aware interpretation of handwritten mathematical expressions. Experimental results demonstrate that ICAL notably surpasses the state-of-the-art(SOTA) models, improving the expression recognition rate (ExpRate) by 2.21\%/1.75\%/1.28\% on the CROHME 2014/2016/2019 datasets respectively, and achieves a remarkable 69.25\% on the challenging HME100k test set.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the segmentation of tumor subtypes in whole slide images (WSI) by utilizing incomplete label proportions. Specifically, we utilize `partial' label proportions, which give the proportions among tumor subtypes but do not give the proportion between tumor and non-tumor. Partial label proportions are recorded as the standard diagnostic information by pathologists, and we, therefore, want to use them for realizing the segmentation model that can classify each WSI patch into one of the tumor subtypes or non-tumor. We call this problem ``learning from partial label proportions (LPLP)'' and formulate the problem as a weakly supervised learning problem. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm for this challenging problem by decomposing it into two weakly supervised learning subproblems: multiple instance learning (MIL) and learning from label proportions (LLP). These subproblems are optimized efficiently in the end-to-end manner. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated through experiments conducted on two WSI datasets.

- **Summary**: Domain adaptation is pivotal for enabling deep learning models to generalize across diverse domains, a task complicated by variations in presentation and cognitive nuances. In this paper, we introduce AD-Aligning, a novel approach that combines adversarial training with source-target domain alignment to enhance generalization capabilities. By pretraining with Coral loss and standard loss, AD-Aligning aligns target domain statistics with those of the pretrained encoder, preserving robustness while accommodating domain shifts. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets and domain shift scenarios, including noise-induced shifts and cognitive domain adaptation tasks, we demonstrate AD-Aligning's superior performance compared to existing methods such as Deep Coral and ADDA. Our findings highlight AD-Aligning's ability to emulate the nuanced cognitive processes inherent in human perception, making it a promising solution for real-world applications requiring adaptable and robust domain adaptation strategies.

- **Summary**: Today's analog/mixed-signal (AMS) integrated circuit (IC) designs demand substantial manual intervention. The advent of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has unveiled significant potential across various fields, suggesting their applicability in streamlining large-scale AMS IC design as well. A bottleneck in employing MLLMs for automatic AMS circuit generation is the absence of a comprehensive dataset delineating the schematic-netlist relationship. We therefore design an automatic technique for converting schematics into netlists, and create dataset AMSNet, encompassing transistor-level schematics and corresponding SPICE format netlists. With a growing size, AMSNet can significantly facilitate exploration of MLLM applications in AMS circuit design. We have made an initial set of netlists public, and will make both our netlist generation tool and the full dataset available upon publishing of this paper.

- **Summary**: This study investigates the use of trajectory and dynamic state information for efficient data curation in autonomous driving machine learning tasks. We propose methods for clustering trajectory-states and sampling strategies in an active learning framework, aiming to reduce annotation and data costs while maintaining model performance. Our approach leverages trajectory information to guide data selection, promoting diversity in the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on the trajectory prediction task using the nuScenes dataset, showing consistent performance gains over random sampling across different data pool sizes, and even reaching sub-baseline displacement errors at just 50% of the data cost. Our results suggest that sampling typical data initially helps overcome the ''cold start problem,'' while introducing novelty becomes more beneficial as the training pool size increases. By integrating trajectory-state-informed active learning, we demonstrate that more efficient and robust autonomous driving systems are possible and practical using low-cost data curation strategies.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in deep learning for 3D models have propelled breakthroughs in generation, detection, and scene understanding. However, the effectiveness of these algorithms hinges on large training datasets. We address the challenge by introducing Efficient 3D Seam Carving (E3SC), a novel 3D model augmentation method based on seam carving, which progressively deforms only part of the input model while ensuring the overall semantics are unchanged. Experiments show that our approach is capable of producing diverse and high-quality augmented 3D shapes across various types and styles of input models, achieving considerable improvements over previous methods. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the novelty and quality of shapes generated by other subsequent 3D generation algorithms.

- **Summary**: The detection and tracking of small targets in passive optical remote sensing (PORS) has broad applications. However, most of the previously proposed methods seldom utilize the abundant temporal features formed by target motion, resulting in poor detection and tracking performance for low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) targets. In this article, we analyze the difficulty based on spatial features and the feasibility based on temporal features of realizing effective detection. According to this analysis, we use a multi-frame as a detection unit and propose a detection method based on temporal energy selective scaling (TESS). Specifically, we investigated the composition of intensity temporal profiles (ITPs) formed by pixels on a multi-frame detection unit. For the target-present pixel, the target passing through the pixel will bring a weak transient disturbance on the ITP and introduce a change in the statistical properties of ITP. We use a well-designed function to amplify the transient disturbance, suppress the background and noise components, and output the trajectory of the target on the multi-frame detection unit. Subsequently, to solve the contradiction between the detection rate and the false alarm rate brought by the traditional threshold segmentation, we associate the temporal and spatial features of the output trajectory and propose a trajectory extraction method based on the 3D Hough transform. Finally, we model the trajectory of the target and propose a trajectory-based multi-target tracking method. Compared with the various state-of-the-art detection and tracking methods, experiments in multiple scenarios prove the superiority of our proposed methods.

- **Summary**: In medical image segmentation tasks, diffusion models have shown significant potential. However, mainstream diffusion models suffer from drawbacks such as multiple sampling times and slow prediction results. Recently, consistency models, as a standalone generative network, have resolved this issue. Compared to diffusion models, consistency models can reduce the sampling times to once, not only achieving similar generative effects but also significantly speeding up training and prediction. However, they are not suitable for image segmentation tasks, and their application in the medical imaging field has not yet been explored. Therefore, this paper applies the consistency model to medical image segmentation tasks, designing multi-scale feature signal supervision modes and loss function guidance to achieve model convergence. Experiments have verified that the CTS model can obtain better medical image segmentation results with a single sampling during the test phase.

- **Summary**: Although face analysis has achieved remarkable improvements in the past few years, designing a multi-task face analysis model is still challenging. Most face analysis tasks are studied as separate problems and do not benefit from the synergy among related tasks. In this work, we propose a novel task-adaptive multi-task face analysis method named as Q-Face, which simultaneously performs multiple face analysis tasks with a unified model. We fuse the features from multiple layers of a large-scale pre-trained model so that the whole model can use both local and global facial information to support multiple tasks. Furthermore, we design a task-adaptive module that performs cross-attention between a set of query vectors and the fused multi-stage features and finally adaptively extracts desired features for each face analysis task. Extensive experiments show that our method can perform multiple tasks simultaneously and achieves state-of-the-art performance on face expression recognition, action unit detection, face attribute analysis, age estimation, and face pose estimation. Compared to conventional methods, our method opens up new possibilities for multi-task face analysis and shows the potential for both accuracy and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Deep models produce a number of features in each internal layer. A key problem in applications such as feature compression for remote inference is determining how important each feature is for the task(s) performed by the model. The problem is especially challenging in the case of multi-task inference, where the same feature may carry different importance for different tasks. In this paper, we examine how effective is mutual information (MI) between a feature and a model's task output as a measure of the feature's importance for that task. Experiments involving hard selection and soft selection (unequal compression) based on MI are carried out to compare the MI-based method with alternative approaches. Multi-objective analysis is provided to offer further insight.



### RSHazeDiff: A Unified Fourier-aware Diffusion Model for Remote Sensing Image Dehazing

- **Summary**: Haze severely degrades the visual quality of remote sensing images and hampers the performance of automotive navigation, intelligent monitoring, and urban management. The emerging denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) exhibits the significant potential for dense haze removal with its strong generation ability. Since remote sensing images contain extensive small-scale texture structures, it is important to effectively restore image details from hazy images. However, current wisdom of DDPM fails to preserve image details and color fidelity well, limiting its dehazing capacity for remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a novel unified Fourier-aware diffusion model for remote sensing image dehazing, termed RSHazeDiff. From a new perspective, RSHazeDiff explores the conditional DDPM to improve image quality in dense hazy scenarios, and it makes three key contributions. First, RSHazeDiff refines the training phase of diffusion process by performing noise estimation and reconstruction constraints in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Thus, it remedies the unpleasing results caused by the simple noise estimation constraint in DDPM. Second, by taking the frequency information as important prior knowledge during iterative sampling steps, RSHazeDiff can preserve more texture details and color fidelity in dehazed images. Third, we design a global compensated learning module to utilize the Fourier transform to capture the global dependency features of input images, which can effectively mitigate the effects of boundary artifacts when processing fixed-size patches. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the favorable performance of RSHazeDiff over multiple state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we delve into a new task known as small object editing (SOE), which focuses on text-based image inpainting within a constrained, small-sized area. Despite the remarkable success have been achieved by current image inpainting approaches, their application to the SOE task generally results in failure cases such as Object Missing, Text-Image Mismatch, and Distortion. These failures stem from the limited use of small-sized objects in training datasets and the downsampling operations employed by U-Net models, which hinders accurate generation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel training-based approach, SOEDiff, aimed at enhancing the capability of baseline models like StableDiffusion in editing small-sized objects while minimizing training costs. Specifically, our method involves two key components: SO-LoRA, which efficiently fine-tunes low-rank matrices, and Cross-Scale Score Distillation loss, which leverages high-resolution predictions from the pre-trained teacher diffusion model. Our method presents significant improvements on the test dataset collected from MSCOCO and OpenImage, validating the effectiveness of our proposed method in small object editing. In particular, when comparing SOEDiff with SD-I model on the OpenImage-f dataset, we observe a 0.99 improvement in CLIP-Score and a reduction of 2.87 in FID.

### HAAP: Vision-context Hierarchical Attention Autoregressive with Adaptive Permutation for Scene Text Recognition

- **Summary**: Internal Language Model (LM)-based methods use permutation language modeling (PLM) to solve the error correction caused by conditional independence in external LM-based methods. However, random permutations of human interference cause fit oscillations in the model training, and Iterative Refinement (IR) operation to improve multimodal information decoupling also introduces additional overhead. To address these issues, this paper proposes the Hierarchical Attention autoregressive Model with Adaptive Permutation (HAAP) to enhance the location-context-image interaction capability, improving autoregressive generalization with internal LM. First, we propose Implicit Permutation Neurons (IPN) to generate adaptive attention masks to dynamically exploit token dependencies. The adaptive masks increase the diversity of training data and prevent model dependency on a specific order. It reduces the training overhead of PLM while avoiding training fit oscillations. Second, we develop Cross-modal Hierarchical Attention mechanism (CHA) to couple context and image features. This processing establishes rich positional semantic dependencies between context and image while avoiding IR. Extensive experimental results show the proposed HAAP achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of accuracy, complexity, and latency on several datasets.

- **Summary**: Despite the impressive performance of Multi-view Stereo (MVS) approaches given plenty of training samples, the performance degradation when generalizing to unseen domains has not been clearly explored yet. In this work, we focus on the domain generalization problem in MVS. To evaluate the generalization results, we build a novel MVS domain generalization benchmark including synthetic and real-world datasets. In contrast to conventional domain generalization benchmarks, we consider a more realistic but challenging scenario, where only one source domain is available for training. The MVS problem can be analogized back to the feature matching task, and maintaining robust feature consistency among views is an important factor for improving generalization performance. To address the domain generalization problem in MVS, we propose a novel MVS framework, namely RobustMVS. A DepthClustering-guided Whitening (DCW) loss is further introduced to preserve the feature consistency among different views, which decorrelates multi-view features from viewpoint-specific style information based on geometric priors from depth maps. The experimental results further show that our method achieves superior performance on the domain generalization benchmark.

- **Summary**: Gait recognition, a rapidly advancing vision technology for person identification from a distance, has made significant strides in indoor settings. However, evidence suggests that existing methods often yield unsatisfactory results when applied to newly released real-world gait datasets. Furthermore, conclusions drawn from indoor gait datasets may not easily generalize to outdoor ones. Therefore, the primary goal of this work is to present a comprehensive benchmark study aimed at improving practicality rather than solely focusing on enhancing performance. To this end, we first develop OpenGait, a flexible and efficient gait recognition platform. Using OpenGait as a foundation, we conduct in-depth ablation experiments to revisit recent developments in gait recognition. Surprisingly, we detect some imperfect parts of certain prior methods thereby resulting in several critical yet undiscovered insights. Inspired by these findings, we develop three structurally simple yet empirically powerful and practically robust baseline models, i.e., DeepGaitV2, SkeletonGait, and SkeletonGait++, respectively representing the appearance-based, model-based, and multi-modal methodology for gait pattern description. Beyond achieving SoTA performances, more importantly, our careful exploration sheds new light on the modeling experience of deep gait models, the representational capacity of typical gait modalities, and so on. We hope this work can inspire further research and application of gait recognition towards better practicality. The code is available at https://github.com/ShiqiYu/OpenGait.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection and localization without any manual annotations and prior knowledge is a challenging task under the setting of unsupervised learning. The existing works achieve excellent performance in the anomaly detection, but with complex networks or cumbersome pipelines. To address this issue, this paper explores a simple but effective architecture in the anomaly detection. It consists of a well pre-trained encoder to extract hierarchical feature representations and a decoder to reconstruct these intermediate features from the encoder. In particular, it does not require any data augmentations and anomalous images for training. The anomalies can be detected when the decoder fails to reconstruct features well, and then errors of hierarchical feature reconstruction are aggregated into an anomaly map to achieve anomaly localization. The difference comparison between those features of encoder and decode lead to more accurate and robust localization results than the comparison in single feature or pixel-by-pixel comparison in the conventional works. Experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and MVTec Anomaly Detection datasets on both anomaly detection and localization.

- **Summary**: Most dataset distillation methods struggle to accommodate large-scale datasets due to their substantial computational and memory requirements. In this paper, we present a curriculum-based dataset distillation framework designed to harmonize scalability with efficiency. This framework strategically distills synthetic images, adhering to a curriculum that transitions from simple to complex. By incorporating curriculum evaluation, we address the issue of previous methods generating images that tend to be homogeneous and simplistic, doing so at a manageable computational cost. Furthermore, we introduce adversarial optimization towards synthetic images to further improve their representativeness and safeguard against their overfitting to the neural network involved in distilling. This enhances the generalization capability of the distilled images across various neural network architectures and also increases their robustness to noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework sets new benchmarks in large-scale dataset distillation, achieving substantial improvements of 11.1\% on Tiny-ImageNet, 9.0\% on ImageNet-1K, and 7.3\% on ImageNet-21K. The source code will be released to the community.

- **Summary**: As image recognition models become more prevalent, scalable coding methods for machines and humans gain more importance. Applications of image recognition models include traffic monitoring and farm management. In these use cases, the scalable coding method proves effective because the tasks require occasional image checking by humans. Existing image compression methods for humans and machines meet these requirements to some extent. However, these compression methods are effective solely for specific image recognition models. We propose a learning-based scalable image coding method for humans and machines that is compatible with numerous image recognition models. We combine an image compression model for machines with a compression model, providing additional information to facilitate image decoding for humans. The features in these compression models are fused using a feature fusion network to achieve efficient image compression. Our method's additional information compression model is adjusted to reduce the number of parameters by enabling combinations of features of different sizes in the feature fusion network. Our approach confirms that the feature fusion network efficiently combines image compression models while reducing the number of parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scalable coding method by evaluating the image compression performance in terms of decoded image quality and bitrate.

- **Summary**: The automation of writing imaging reports is a valuable tool for alleviating the workload of radiologists. Crucial steps in this process involve the cross-modal alignment between medical images and reports, as well as the retrieval of similar historical cases. However, the presence of presentation-style vocabulary (e.g., sentence structure and grammar) in reports poses challenges for cross-modal alignment. Additionally, existing methods for similar historical cases retrieval face suboptimal performance owing to the modal gap issue. In response, this paper introduces a novel method, named Factual Serialization Enhancement (FSE), for chest X-ray report generation. FSE begins with the structural entities approach to eliminate presentation-style vocabulary in reports, providing specific input for our model. Then, uni-modal features are learned through cross-modal alignment between images and factual serialization in reports. Subsequently, we present a novel approach to retrieve similar historical cases from the training set, leveraging aligned image features. These features implicitly preserve semantic similarity with their corresponding reference reports, enabling us to calculate similarity solely among aligned features. This effectively eliminates the modal gap issue for knowledge retrieval without the requirement for disease labels. Finally, the cross-modal fusion network is employed to query valuable information from these cases, enriching image features and aiding the text decoder in generating high-quality reports. Experiments on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-ray datasets from both specific and general scenarios demonstrate the superiority of FSE over state-of-the-art approaches in both natural language generation and clinical efficacy metrics.

- **Summary**: Due to the increasing need for effective security measures and the integration of cameras in commercial products, a hugeamount of visual data is created today. Law enforcement agencies (LEAs) are inspecting images and videos to findradicalization, propaganda for terrorist organizations and illegal products on darknet markets. This is time consuming.Instead of an undirected search, LEAs would like to adapt to new crimes and threats, and focus only on data from specificlocations, persons or objects, which requires flexible interpretation of image content. Visual concept detection with deepconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a crucial component to understand the image content. This paper has fivecontributions. The first contribution allows image-based geo-localization to estimate the origin of an image. CNNs andgeotagged images are used to create a model that determines the location of an image by its pixel values. The secondcontribution enables analysis of fine-grained concepts to distinguish sub-categories in a generic concept. The proposedmethod encompasses data acquisition and cleaning and concept hierarchies. The third contribution is the recognition ofperson attributes (e.g., glasses or moustache) to enable query by textual description for a person. The person-attributeproblem is treated as a specific sub-task of concept classification. The fourth contribution is an intuitive image annotationtool based on active learning. Active learning allows users to define novel concepts flexibly and train CNNs with minimalannotation effort. The fifth contribution increases the flexibility for LEAs in the query definition by using query expansion.Query expansion maps user queries to known and detectable concepts. Therefore, no prior knowledge of the detectableconcepts is required for the users. The methods are validated on data with varying locations (popular and non-touristiclocations), varying person attributes (CelebA dataset), and varying number of annotations.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose to tackle several challenges hindering the development of Automatic Target Detection (ATD) algorithms for ground targets in SAR images. To address the lack of representative training data, we propose a Deep Learning approach to train ATD models with synthetic target signatures produced with the MOCEM simulator. We define an incrustation pipeline to incorporate synthetic targets into real backgrounds. Using this hybrid dataset, we train ATD models specifically tailored to bridge the domain gap between synthetic and real data. Our approach notably relies on massive physics-based data augmentation techniques and Adversarial Training of two deep-learning detection architectures. We then test these models on several datasets, including (1) patchworks of real SAR images, (2) images with the incrustation of real targets in real backgrounds, and (3) images with the incrustation of synthetic background objects in real backgrounds. Results show that the produced hybrid datasets are exempt from image overlay bias. Our approach can reach up to 90% of Average Precision on real data while exclusively using synthetic targets for training.

Our work directly confronts a pivotal industry issue by grappling with the prohibitive service costs that hinder the broad adoption of large-scale multimodal systems. Through rigorous training, we have developed a 1B-scale language model from the ground up, employing the LLaVA paradigm for modal alignment. The result, which we call Xmodel-VLM, is a lightweight yet powerful multimodal vision language model. Extensive testing across numerous classic multimodal benchmarks has revealed that despite its smaller size and faster execution, Xmodel-VLM delivers performance comparable to that of larger models.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of foundation models (FMs) across language, image, audio, and video domains has shown remarkable capabilities in diverse tasks. However, the proliferation of FMs brings forth a critical challenge: the potential to generate hallucinated outputs, particularly in high-stakes applications. The tendency of foundation models to produce hallucinated content arguably represents the biggest hindrance to their widespread adoption in real-world scenarios, especially in domains where reliability and accuracy are paramount. This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview of recent developments that aim to identify and mitigate the problem of hallucination in FMs, spanning text, image, video, and audio modalities. By synthesizing recent advancements in detecting and mitigating hallucination across various modalities, the paper aims to provide valuable insights for researchers, developers, and practitioners. Essentially, it establishes a clear framework encompassing definition, taxonomy, and detection strategies for addressing hallucination in multimodal foundation models, laying the foundation for future research in this pivotal area.

The handwritten recognition is one of the useful area in real life use where both offline and online handwriting recognition are required. The chain code as feature extraction technique has shown significant results in literature and we have been able to use chain codes with graph neural networks. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents first time a novel combination of handwritten trajectories features as chain codes and graph neural networks together. The handwritten trajectories for offline handwritten text has been evaluated using recovery of drawing order, whereas online handwritten trajectories are directly used with chain codes. Our results prove that present combination surpass previous results and minimize error rate in few epochs only.

- **Summary**: The task of generating dance from music is crucial, yet current methods, which mainly produce joint sequences, lead to outputs that lack intuitiveness and complicate data collection due to the necessity for precise joint annotations. We introduce a Dance Any Beat Diffusion model, namely DabFusion, that employs music as a conditional input to directly create dance videos from still images, utilizing conditional image-to-video generation principles. This approach pioneers the use of music as a conditioning factor in image-to-video synthesis. Our method unfolds in two stages: training an auto-encoder to predict latent optical flow between reference and driving frames, eliminating the need for joint annotation, and training a U-Net-based diffusion model to produce these latent optical flows guided by music rhythm encoded by CLAP. Although capable of producing high-quality dance videos, the baseline model struggles with rhythm alignment. We enhance the model by adding beat information, improving synchronization. We introduce a 2D motion-music alignment score (2D-MM Align) for quantitative assessment. Evaluated on the AIST++ dataset, our enhanced model shows marked improvements in 2D-MM Align score and established metrics. Video results can be found on our project page: https://DabFusion.github.io.

- **Summary**: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of short videos, which usually contain both visual and audio modalities. Background music is important to the short videos, which can significantly influence the emotions of the viewers. However, at present, the background music of short videos is generally chosen by the video producer, and there is a lack of automatic music recommendation methods for short videos. This paper introduces MVBind, an innovative Music-Video embedding space Binding model for cross-modal retrieval. MVBind operates as a self-supervised approach, acquiring inherent knowledge of intermodal relationships directly from data, without the need of manual annotations. Additionally, to compensate the lack of a corresponding musical-visual pair dataset for short videos, we construct a dataset, SVM-10K(Short Video with Music-10K), which mainly consists of meticulously selected short videos. On this dataset, MVBind manifests significantly improved performance compared to other baseline methods. The constructed dataset and code will be released to facilitate future research.

- **Summary**: Deep learning classifiers are prone to latching onto dominant confounders present in a dataset rather than on the causal markers associated with the target class, leading to poor generalization and biased predictions. Although explainability via counterfactual image generation has been successful at exposing the problem, bias mitigation strategies that permit accurate explainability in the presence of dominant and diverse artifacts remain unsolved. In this work, we propose the DeCoDEx framework and show how an external, pre-trained binary artifact detector can be leveraged during inference to guide a diffusion-based counterfactual image generator towards accurate explainability. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset, using both synthetic artifacts and real visual artifacts (support devices), show that the proposed method successfully synthesizes the counterfactual images that change the causal pathology markers associated with Pleural Effusion while preserving or ignoring the visual artifacts. Augmentation of ERM and Group-DRO classifiers with the DeCoDEx generated images substantially improves the results across underrepresented groups that are out of distribution for each class.

- **Summary**: Medical image interpretation using deep learning has shown promise but often requires extensive expert-annotated datasets. To reduce this annotation burden, we develop an Image-Graph Contrastive Learning framework that pairs chest X-rays with structured report knowledge graphs automatically extracted from radiology notes. Our approach uniquely encodes the disconnected graph components via a relational graph convolution network and transformer attention. In experiments on the CheXpert dataset, this novel graph encoding strategy enabled the framework to outperform existing methods that use image-text contrastive learning in 1% linear evaluation and few-shot settings, while achieving comparable performance to radiologists. By exploiting unlabeled paired images and text, our framework demonstrates the potential of structured clinical insights to enhance contrastive learning for medical images. This work points toward reducing demands on medical experts for annotations, improving diagnostic precision, and advancing patient care through robust medical image understanding.

- **Summary**: With the benefit of deep learning techniques, recent researches have made significant progress in image compression artifacts reduction. Despite their improved performances, prevailing methods only focus on learning a mapping from the compressed image to the original one but ignore the intrinsic attributes of the given compressed images, which greatly harms the performance of downstream parsing tasks. Different from these methods, we propose to decouple the intrinsic attributes into two complementary features for artifacts reduction,ie, the compression-insensitive features to regularize the high-level semantic representations during training and the compression-sensitive features to be aware of the compression degree. To achieve this, we first employ adversarial training to regularize the compressed and original encoded features for retaining high-level semantics, and we then develop the compression quality-aware feature encoder for compression-sensitive features. Based on these dual complementary features, we propose a Dual Awareness Guidance Network (DAGN) to utilize these awareness features as transformation guidance during the decoding phase. In our proposed DAGN, we develop a cross-feature fusion module to maintain the consistency of compression-insensitive features by fusing compression-insensitive features into the artifacts reduction baseline. Our method achieves an average 2.06 dB PSNR gains on BSD500, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, and only requires 29.7 ms to process one image on BSD500. Besides, the experimental results on LIVE1 and LIU4K also demonstrate the efficiency, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed method in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, and downstream machine vision tasks.

- **Summary**: AI-based analysis of histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) is central in computational pathology. However, image quality can impact model performance. Here, we investigate to what extent unsharp areas of WSIs impact deep convolutional neural network classification performance. We propose a multi-model approach, i.e. DeepBlurMM, to alleviate the impact of unsharp image areas and improve the model performance. DeepBlurMM uses the sigma cut-offs to determine the most suitable model for predicting tiles with various levels of blurring within a single WSI, where sigma is the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution. Specifically, the cut-offs categorise the tiles into sharp or slight blur, moderate blur, and high blur. Each blur level has a corresponding model to be selected for tile-level predictions. Throughout the simulation study, we demonstrated the application of DeepBlurMM in a binary classification task for breast cancer Nottingham Histological Grade 1 vs 3. Performance, evaluated over 5-fold cross-validation, showed that DeepBlurMM outperformed the base model under moderate blur and mixed blur conditions. Unsharp image tiles (local blurriness) at prediction time reduced model performance. The proposed multi-model approach improved performance under some conditions, with the potential to improve quality in both research and clinical applications.

- **Summary**: This paper explores a novel multi-modal alternating learning paradigm pursuing a reconciliation between the exploitation of uni-modal features and the exploration of cross-modal interactions. This is motivated by the fact that current paradigms of multi-modal learning tend to explore multi-modal features simultaneously. The resulting gradient prohibits further exploitation of the features in the weak modality, leading to modality competition, where the dominant modality overpowers the learning process. To address this issue, we study the modality-alternating learning paradigm to achieve reconcilement. Specifically, we propose a new method called ReconBoost to update a fixed modality each time. Herein, the learning objective is dynamically adjusted with a reconcilement regularization against competition with the historical models. By choosing a KL-based reconcilement, we show that the proposed method resembles Friedman's Gradient-Boosting (GB) algorithm, where the updated learner can correct errors made by others and help enhance the overall performance. The major difference with the classic GB is that we only preserve the newest model for each modality to avoid overfitting caused by ensembling strong learners. Furthermore, we propose a memory consolidation scheme and a global rectification scheme to make this strategy more effective. Experiments over six multi-modal benchmarks speak to the efficacy of the method. We release the code at https://github.com/huacong/ReconBoost.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in computed tomography (CT) imaging, especially with dual-robot systems, have introduced new challenges for scan trajectory optimization. This paper presents a novel approach using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to optimize CT scan trajectories. Our approach exploits the flexibility of robotic CT systems to select projections that enhance image quality by improving resolution and contrast while reducing scan time. We focus on cone-beam CT and employ several projection-based metrics, including absorption, pixel intensities, contrast-to-noise ratio, and data completeness. The GRU network aims to minimize data redundancy and maximize completeness with a limited number of projections. We validate our method using simulated data of a test specimen, focusing on a specific voxel of interest. The results show that the GRU-optimized scan trajectories can outperform traditional circular CT trajectories in terms of image quality metrics. For the used specimen, SSIM improves from 0.38 to 0.49 and CNR increases from 6.97 to 9.08. This finding suggests that the application of GRU in CT scan trajectory optimization can lead to more efficient, cost-effective, and high-quality imaging solutions.

- **Summary**: While content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has been extensively studied in natural image retrieval, its application to medical images presents ongoing challenges, primarily due to the 3D nature of medical images. Recent studies have shown the potential use of pre-trained vision embeddings for CBIR in the context of radiology image retrieval. However, a benchmark for the retrieval of 3D volumetric medical images is still lacking, hindering the ability to objectively evaluate and compare the efficiency of proposed CBIR approaches in medical imaging. In this study, we extend previous work and establish a benchmark for region-based and multi-organ retrieval using the TotalSegmentator dataset (TS) with detailed multi-organ annotations. We benchmark embeddings derived from pre-trained supervised models on medical images against embeddings derived from pre-trained unsupervised models on non-medical images for 29 coarse and 104 detailed anatomical structures in volume and region levels. We adopt a late interaction re-ranking method inspired by text matching for image retrieval, comparing it against the original method proposed for volume and region retrieval achieving retrieval recall of 1.0 for diverse anatomical regions with a wide size range. The findings and methodologies presented in this paper provide essential insights and benchmarks for the development and evaluation of CBIR approaches in the context of medical imaging.

- **Summary**: Image-guided depth completion aims at generating a dense depth map from sparse LiDAR data and RGB image. Recent methods have shown promising performance by reformulating it as a classification problem with two sub-tasks: depth discretization and probability prediction. They divide the depth range into several discrete depth values as depth categories, serving as priors for scene depth distributions. However, previous depth discretization methods are easy to be impacted by depth distribution variations across different scenes, resulting in suboptimal scene depth distribution priors. To address the above problem, we propose a progressive depth decoupling and modulating network, which incrementally decouples the depth range into bins and adaptively generates multi-scale dense depth maps in multiple stages. Specifically, we first design a Bins Initializing Module (BIM) to construct the seed bins by exploring the depth distribution information within a sparse depth map, adapting variations of depth distribution. Then, we devise an incremental depth decoupling branch to progressively refine the depth distribution information from global to local. Meanwhile, an adaptive depth modulating branch is developed to progressively improve the probability representation from coarse-grained to fine-grained. And the bi-directional information interactions are proposed to strengthen the information interaction between those two branches (sub-tasks) for promoting information complementation in each branch. Further, we introduce a multi-scale supervision mechanism to learn the depth distribution information in latent features and enhance the adaptation capability across different scenes. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The code will be open-sourced at [this https URL](https://github.com/Cisse-away/PDDM).

- **Summary**: The multi-scale receptive field and large kernel attention (LKA) module have been shown to significantly improve performance in the lightweight image super-resolution task. However, existing lightweight super-resolution (SR) methods seldom pay attention to designing efficient building block with multi-scale receptive field for local modeling, and their LKA modules face a quadratic increase in computational and memory footprints as the convolutional kernel size increases. To address the first issue, we propose the multi-scale blueprint separable convolutions (MBSConv) as highly efficient building block with multi-scale receptive field, it can focus on the learning for the multi-scale information which is a vital component of discriminative representation. As for the second issue, we revisit the key properties of LKA in which we find that the adjacent direct interaction of local information and long-distance dependencies is crucial to provide remarkable performance. Thus, taking this into account and in order to mitigate the complexity of LKA, we propose a large coordinate kernel attention (LCKA) module which decomposes the 2D convolutional kernels of the depth-wise convolutional layers in LKA into horizontal and vertical 1-D kernels. LCKA enables the adjacent direct interaction of local information and long-distance dependencies not only in the horizontal direction but also in the vertical. Besides, LCKA allows for the direct use of extremely large kernels in the depth-wise convolutional layers to capture more contextual information, which helps to significantly improve the reconstruction performance, and it incurs lower computational complexity and memory footprints. Integrating MBSConv and LCKA, we propose a large coordinate kernel attention network (LCAN).

- **Summary**: Localizing oneself during endoscopic procedures can be problematic due to the lack of distinguishable textures and landmarks, as well as difficulties due to the endoscopic device such as a limited field of view and challenging lighting conditions. Expert knowledge shaped by years of experience is required for localization within the human body during endoscopic procedures. In this work, we present a deep learning method based on anatomy recognition, that constructs a surgical path in an unsupervised manner from surgical videos, modelling relative location and variations due to different viewing angles. At inference time, the model can map an unseen video's frames on the path and estimate the viewing angle, aiming to provide guidance, for instance, to reach a particular destination. We test the method on a dataset consisting of surgical videos of transsphenoidal adenomectomies, as well as on a synthetic dataset. An online tool that lets researchers upload their surgical videos to obtain anatomy detections and the weights of the trained YOLOv7 model are available at: https://surgicalvision.bmic.ethz.ch.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a predictive quantifier to estimate the retraining cost of a trained model in distribution shifts. The proposed Aggregated Representation Measure (ARM) quantifies the change in the model's representation from the old to new data distribution. It provides, before actually retraining the model, a single concise index of resources - epochs, energy, and carbon emissions - required for the retraining. This enables reuse of a model with a much lower cost than training a new model from scratch. The experimental results indicate that ARM reasonably predicts retraining costs for varying noise intensities and enables comparisons among multiple model architectures to determine the most cost-effective and sustainable option.

- **Summary**: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is essential in actively acquiring information for Earth observation. SAR Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) focuses on detecting and classifying various target categories under different image conditions. The current deep learning-based SAR ATR methods are typically designed for specific datasets and applications. Various target characteristics, scene background information, and sensor parameters across ATR datasets challenge the generalization of those methods. This paper aims to achieve general SAR ATR based on a foundation model with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). Our motivation is to break through the specific dataset and condition limitations and obtain universal perceptual capabilities across the target, scene, and sensor. A foundation model named SARATR-X is proposed with the following four aspects: pre-training dataset, model backbone, SSL, and evaluation task. First, we integrated 14 datasets with various target categories and imaging conditions as a pre-training dataset. Second, different model backbones were discussed to find the most suitable approaches for remote-sensing images. Third, we applied two-stage training and SAR gradient features to ensure the diversity and scalability of SARATR-X. Finally, SARATR-X has achieved competitive and superior performance on 5 datasets with 8 task settings, which shows that the foundation model can achieve universal SAR ATR. We believe it is time to embrace fundamental models for SAR image interpretation in the era of increasing big data.

- **Summary**: A fundamental tenet of pattern recognition is that overlap between training and testing sets causes an optimistic accuracy estimate. Deep CNNs for face recognition are trained for N-way classification of the identities in the training set. Accuracy is commonly estimated as average 10-fold classification accuracy on image pairs from test sets such as LFW, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP-FP and AgeDB-30. Because train and test sets have been independently assembled, images and identities in any given test set may also be present in any given training set. In particular, our experiments reveal a surprising degree of identity and image overlap between the LFW family of test sets and the MS1MV2 training set. Our experiments also reveal identity label noise in MS1MV2. We compare accuracy achieved with same-size MS1MV2 subsets that are identity-disjoint and not identity-disjoint with LFW, to reveal the size of the optimistic bias. Using more challenging test sets from the LFW family, we find that the size of the optimistic bias is larger for more challenging test sets. Our results highlight the lack of and the need for identity-disjoint train and test methodology in face recognition research.

- **Summary**: Contrastive pretraining provides robust representations by ensuring their invariance to different image transformations while simultaneously preventing representational collapse. Equivariant contrastive learning, on the other hand, provides representations sensitive to specific image transformations while remaining invariant to others. By introducing equivariance to time-induced transformations, such as disease-related anatomical changes in longitudinal imaging, the model can effectively capture such changes in the representation space. In this work, we pro-pose a Time-equivariant Contrastive Learning (TC) method. First, an encoder embeds two unlabeled scans from different time points of the same patient into the representation space. Next, a temporal equivariance module is trained to predict the representation of a later visit based on the representation from one of the previous visits and the corresponding time interval with a novel regularization loss term while preserving the invariance property to irrelevant image transformations. On a large longitudinal dataset, our model clearly outperforms existing equivariant contrastive methods in predicting progression from intermediate age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to advanced wet-AMD within a specified time-window.

- **Summary**: Objective: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while keeping data locally. Currently, most FL studies in radiology are conducted in simulated environments due to numerous hurdles impeding its translation into practice. The few existing real-world FL initiatives rarely communicate specific measures taken to overcome these hurdles, leaving behind a significant knowledge gap. Minding efforts to implement real-world FL, there is a notable lack of comprehensive assessment comparing FL to less complex alternatives. Materials & Methods: We extensively reviewed FL literature, categorizing insights along with our findings according to their nature and phase while establishing a FL initiative, summarized to a comprehensive guide. We developed our own FL infrastructure within the German Radiological Cooperative Network (RACOON) and demonstrated its functionality by training FL models on lung pathology segmentation tasks across six university hospitals. We extensively evaluated FL against less complex alternatives in three distinct evaluation scenarios. Results: The proposed guide outlines essential steps, identified hurdles, and proposed solutions for establishing successful FL initiatives conducting real-world experiments. Our experimental results show that FL outperforms less complex alternatives in all evaluation scenarios, justifying the effort required to translate FL into real-world applications. Discussion & Conclusion: Our proposed guide aims to aid future FL researchers in circumventing pitfalls and accelerating translation of FL into radiological applications. Our results underscore the value of efforts needed to translate FL into real-world applications by demonstrating advantageous performance over alternatives, and emphasize the importance of strategic organization, robust management of distributed data and infrastructure in real-world settings.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces the Global-Local Image Perceptual Score (GLIPS), an image metric designed to assess the photorealistic image quality of AI-generated images with a high degree of alignment to human visual perception. Traditional metrics such as FID and KID scores do not align closely with human evaluations. The proposed metric incorporates advanced transformer-based attention mechanisms to assess local similarity and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to evaluate global distributional similarity. To evaluate the performance of GLIPS, we conducted a human study on photorealistic image quality. Comprehensive tests across various generative models demonstrate that GLIPS consistently outperforms existing metrics like FID, SSIM, and MS-SSIM in terms of correlation with human scores. Additionally, we introduce the Interpolative Binning Scale (IBS), a refined scaling method that enhances the interpretability of metric scores by aligning them more closely with human evaluative standards. The proposed metric and scaling approach not only provides more reliable assessments of AI-generated images but also suggest pathways for future enhancements in image generation technologies.

- **Summary**: 3D content creation plays a vital role in various applications, such as gaming, robotics simulation, and virtual reality. However, the process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring skilled designers to invest considerable effort in creating a single 3D asset. To address this challenge, text-to-3D generation technologies have emerged as a promising solution for automating 3D creation. Leveraging the success of large vision language models, these techniques aim to generate 3D content based on textual descriptions. Despite recent advancements in this area, existing solutions still face significant limitations in terms of generation quality and efficiency. In this survey, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the latest text-to-3D creation methods. We provide a comprehensive background on text-to-3D creation, including discussions on datasets employed in training and evaluation metrics used to assess the quality of generated 3D models. Then, we delve into the various 3D representations that serve as the foundation for the 3D generation process. Furthermore, we present a thorough comparison of the rapidly growing literature on generative pipelines, categorizing them into feedforward generators, optimization-based generation, and view reconstruction approaches. By examining the strengths and weaknesses of these methods, we aim to shed light on their respective capabilities and limitations. Lastly, we point out several promising avenues for future research. With this survey, we hope to inspire researchers further to explore the potential of open-vocabulary text-conditioned 3D content creation.

- **Summary**: Glass largely blurs the boundary between the real world and the reflection. The special transmittance and reflectance quality have confused the semantic tasks related to machine vision. Therefore, how to clear the boundary built by glass, and avoid over-capturing features as false positive information in deep structure, matters for constraining the segmentation of reflection surface and penetrating glass. We proposed the Fourier Boundary Features Network with Wider Catchers (FBWC), which might be the first attempt to utilize sufficiently wide horizontal shallow branches without vertical deepening for guiding the fine granularity segmentation boundary through primary glass semantic information. Specifically, we designed the Wider Coarse-Catchers (WCC) for anchoring large area segmentation and reducing excessive extraction from a structural perspective. We embed fine-grained features by Cross Transpose Attention (CTA), which is introduced to avoid the incomplete area within the boundary caused by reflection noise. For excavating glass features and balancing high-low layers context, a learnable Fourier Convolution Controller (FCC) is proposed to regulate information integration robustly. The proposed method has been validated on three different public glass segmentation datasets. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method yields better segmentation performance compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in glass image segmentation.

- **Summary**: Accurate detection of vulvovaginal candidiasis is critical for women's health, yet its sparse distribution and visually ambiguous characteristics pose significant challenges for accurate identification by pathologists and neural networks alike. Our eye-tracking data reveals that areas garnering sustained attention - yet not marked by experts after deliberation - are often aligned with false positives of neural networks. Leveraging this finding, we introduce Gaze-DETR, a pioneering method that integrates gaze data to enhance neural network precision by diminishing false positives. Gaze-DETR incorporates a universal gaze-guided warm-up protocol applicable across various detection methods and a gaze-guided rectification strategy specifically designed for DETR-based models. Our comprehensive tests confirm that Gaze-DETR surpasses existing leading methods, showcasing remarkable improvements in detection accuracy and generalizability.

- **Summary**: With the advent of image super-resolution (SR) algorithms, how to evaluate the quality of generated SR images has become an urgent task. Although full-reference methods perform well in SR image quality assessment (SR-IQA), their reliance on high-resolution (HR) images limits their practical applicability. Leveraging available reconstruction information as much as possible for SR-IQA, such as low-resolution (LR) images and the scale factors, is a promising way to enhance assessment performance for SR-IQA without HR for reference. In this letter, we attempt to evaluate the perceptual quality and reconstruction fidelity of SR images considering LR images and scale factors. Specifically, we propose a novel dual-branch reduced-reference SR-IQA network, \ie, Perception- and Fidelity-aware SR-IQA (PFIQA). The perception-aware branch evaluates the perceptual quality of SR images by leveraging the merits of global modeling of Vision Transformer (ViT) and local relation of ResNet, and incorporating the scale factor to enable comprehensive visual perception. Meanwhile, the fidelity-aware branch assesses the reconstruction fidelity between LR and SR images through their visual perception. The combination of the two branches substantially aligns with the human visual system, enabling a comprehensive SR image evaluation. Experimental results indicate that our PFIQA outperforms current state-of-the-art models across three widely-used SR-IQA benchmarks. Notably, PFIQA excels in assessing the quality of real-world SR images.

- **Summary**: The primary color profile of the same identity is assumed to remain consistent in typical Person Re-identification (Person ReID) tasks. However, this assumption may be invalid in real-world situations and images hold variant color profiles, because of cross-modality cameras or identity with different clothing. To address this issue, we propose Color Space Learning (CSL) for those Cross-Color Person ReID problems. Specifically, CSL guides the model to be less color-sensitive with two modules: Image-level Color-Augmentation and Pixel-level Color-Transformation. The first module increases the color diversity of the inputs and guides the model to focus more on the non-color information. The second module projects every pixel of input images onto a new color space. In addition, we introduce a new Person ReID benchmark across RGB and Infrared modalities, NTU-Corridor, which is the first with privacy agreements from all participants. To evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed CSL, we evaluate it on several Cross-Color Person ReID benchmarks. Our method surpasses the state-of-the-art methods consistently. The code and benchmark are available at: https://github.com/niejiahao1998/CSL

- **Summary**: Esophageal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide and ranks sixth in cancer-related mortality. Accurate computer-assisted diagnosis of cancer progression can help physicians effectively customize personalized treatment plans. Currently, CT-based cancer diagnosis methods have received much attention for their comprehensive ability to examine patients' conditions. However, multi-modal based methods may likely introduce information redundancy, leading to underperformance. In addition, efficient and effective interactions between multi-modal representations need to be further explored, lacking insightful exploration of prognostic correlation in multi-modality features. In this work, we introduce a multi-modal heterogeneous graph-based conditional feature-guided diffusion model for lymph node metastasis diagnosis based on CT images as well as clinical measurements and radiomics data. To explore the intricate relationships between multi-modal features, we construct a heterogeneous graph. Following this, a conditional feature-guided diffusion approach is applied to eliminate information redundancy. Moreover, we propose a masked relational representation learning strategy, aiming to uncover the latent prognostic correlations and priorities of primary tumor and lymph node image representations. Various experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/wuchengyu123/MMFusion.

- **Summary**: Aerial imagery is increasingly used in Earth science and natural resource management as a complement to labor-intensive ground-based surveys. Aerial systems can collect overlapping images that provide multiple views of each location from different perspectives. However, most prediction approaches (e.g. for tree species classification) use a single, synthesized top-down "orthomosaic" image as input that contains little to no information about the vertical aspects of objects and may include processing artifacts. We propose an alternate approach that generates predictions directly on the raw images and accurately maps these predictions into geospatial coordinates using semantic meshes. This method$\unicode{x2013}$released as a user-friendly open-source toolkit$\unicode{x2013}$enables analysts to use the highest quality data for predictions, capture information about the sides of objects, and leverage multiple viewpoints of each location for added robustness. We demonstrate the value of this approach on a new benchmark dataset of four forest sites in the western U.S. that consists of drone images, photogrammetry results, predicted tree locations, and species classification data derived from manual surveys. We show that our proposed multiview method improves classification accuracy from 53% to 75% relative to an orthomosaic baseline on a challenging cross-site tree species classification task.

- **Summary**: The systematic evaluation and understanding of computer vision models under varying conditions require large amounts of data with comprehensive and customized labels, which real-world vision datasets rarely satisfy. While current synthetic data generators offer a promising alternative, particularly for embodied AI tasks, they often fall short for computer vision tasks due to low asset and rendering quality, limited diversity, and unrealistic physical properties. We introduce the BEHAVIOR Vision Suite (BVS), a set of tools and assets to generate fully customized synthetic data for systematic evaluation of computer vision models, based on the newly developed embodied AI benchmark, BEHAVIOR-1K. BVS supports a large number of adjustable parameters at the scene level (e.g., lighting, object placement), the object level (e.g., joint configuration, attributes such as "filled" and "folded"), and the camera level (e.g., field of view, focal length). Researchers can arbitrarily vary these parameters during data generation to perform controlled experiments. We showcase three example application scenarios: systematically evaluating the robustness of models across different continuous axes of domain shift, evaluating scene understanding models on the same set of images, and training and evaluating simulation-to-real transfer for a novel vision task: unary and binary state prediction.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge learned from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. While UDA methods for synthetic to real-world domains (synth-to-real) show remarkable performance in tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection, very few were proposed for the instance segmentation task. In this paper, we introduce UDA4Inst, a model of synth-to-real UDA for instance segmentation in autonomous driving. We propose a novel cross-domain bidirectional data mixing method at the instance level to fully leverage the data from both source and target domains. Rare-class balancing and category module training are also employed to further improve the performance. It is worth noting that we are the first to demonstrate results on two new synth-to-real instance segmentation benchmarks, with 39.0 mAP on UrbanSyn->Cityscapes and 35.7 mAP on Synscapes->Cityscapes. UDA4Inst also achieves the state-of-the-art result on SYNTHIA->Cityscapes with 31.3 mAP, +15.6 higher than the latest approach. Our code will be released.

- **Summary**: This study examines the role of visual highlights in guiding user attention in drone monitoring tasks, employing a simulated interface for observation. The experiment results show that such highlights can significantly expedite the visual attention on the corresponding area. Based on this observation, we leverage both the temporal and spatial information in the highlight to develop a new saliency model: the highlight-informed saliency model (HISM), to infer the visual attention change in the highlight condition. Our findings show the effectiveness of visual highlights in enhancing user attention and demonstrate the potential of incorporating these cues into saliency prediction models.

- **Summary**: Anatomical shape analysis plays a pivotal role in clinical research and hypothesis testing, where the relationship between form and function is paramount. Correspondence-based statistical shape modeling (SSM) facilitates population-level morphometrics but requires a cumbersome, potentially bias-inducing construction pipeline. Recent advancements in deep learning have streamlined this process in inference by providing SSM prediction directly from unsegmented medical images. However, the proposed approaches are fully supervised and require utilizing a traditional SSM construction pipeline to create training data, thus inheriting the associated burdens and limitations. To address these challenges, we introduce a weakly supervised deep learning approach to predict SSM from images using point cloud supervision. Specifically, we propose reducing the supervision associated with the state-of-the-art fully Bayesian variational information bottleneck DeepSSM (BVIB-DeepSSM) model. BVIB-DeepSSM is an effective, principled framework for predicting probabilistic anatomical shapes from images with quantification of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Whereas the original BVIB-DeepSSM method requires strong supervision in the form of ground truth correspondence points, the proposed approach utilizes weak supervision via point cloud surface representations, which are more readily obtainable. Furthermore, the proposed approach learns correspondence in a completely data-driven manner without prior assumptions about the expected variability in shape cohort. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach yields similar accuracy and uncertainty estimation to the fully supervised scenario while substantially enhancing the feasibility of model training for SSM construction.

- **Summary**: Correspondence-based statistical shape modeling (SSM) stands as a powerful technology for morphometric analysis in clinical research. SSM facilitates population-level characterization and quantification of anatomical shapes such as bones and organs, aiding in pathology and disease diagnostics and treatment planning. Despite its potential, SSM remains under-utilized in medical research due to the significant overhead associated with automatic construction methods, which demand complete, aligned shape surface representations. Additionally, optimization-based techniques rely on bias-inducing assumptions or templates and have prolonged inference times as the entire cohort is simultaneously optimized. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Point2SSM++, a principled, self-supervised deep learning approach that directly learns correspondence points from point cloud representations of anatomical shapes. Point2SSM++ is robust to misaligned and inconsistent input, providing SSM that accurately samples individual shape surfaces while effectively capturing population-level statistics. Additionally, we present principled extensions of Point2SSM++ to adapt it for dynamic spatiotemporal and multi-anatomy use cases, demonstrating the broad versatility of the Point2SSM++ framework. Furthermore, we present extensions of Point2SSM++ tailored for dynamic spatiotemporal and multi-anatomy scenarios, showcasing the broad versatility of the framework. Through extensive validation across diverse anatomies, evaluation metrics, and clinically relevant downstream tasks, we demonstrate Point2SSM++'s superiority over existing state-of-the-art deep learning models and traditional approaches. Point2SSM++ substantially enhances the feasibility of SSM generation and significantly broadens its array of potential clinical applications.

- **Summary**: Reasoning in the real world is not divorced from situations. How to capture the present knowledge from surrounding situations and perform reasoning accordingly is crucial and challenging for machine intelligence. This paper introduces a new benchmark that evaluates the situated reasoning ability via situation abstraction and logic-grounded question answering for real-world videos, called Situated Reasoning in Real-World Videos (STAR Benchmark). This benchmark is built upon the real-world videos associated with human actions or interactions, which are naturally dynamic, compositional, and logical. The dataset includes four types of questions, including interaction, sequence, prediction, and feasibility. We represent the situations in real-world videos by hyper-graphs connecting extracted atomic entities and relations (e.g., actions, persons, objects, and relationships). Besides visual perception, situated reasoning also requires structured situation comprehension and logical reasoning. Questions and answers are procedurally generated. The answering logic of each question is represented by a functional program based on a situation hyper-graph. We compare various existing video reasoning models and find that they all struggle on this challenging situated reasoning task. We further propose a diagnostic neuro-symbolic model that can disentangle visual perception, situation abstraction, language understanding, and functional reasoning to understand the challenges of this benchmark.

- **Summary**: Learning commonsense reasoning from visual contexts and scenes in real-world is a crucial step toward advanced artificial intelligence. However, existing video reasoning benchmarks are still inadequate since they were mainly designed for factual or situated reasoning and rarely involve broader knowledge in the real world. Our work aims to delve deeper into reasoning evaluations, specifically within dynamic, open-world, and structured context knowledge. We propose a new benchmark (SOK-Bench), consisting of 44K questions and 10K situations with instance-level annotations depicted in the videos. The reasoning process is required to understand and apply situated knowledge and general knowledge for problem-solving. To create such a dataset, we propose an automatic and scalable generation method to generate question-answer pairs, knowledge graphs, and rationales by instructing the combinations of LLMs and MLLMs. Concretely, we first extract observable situated entities, relations, and processes from videos for situated knowledge and then extend to open-world knowledge beyond the visible content. The task generation is facilitated through multiple dialogues as iterations and subsequently corrected and refined by our designed self-promptings and demonstrations. With a corpus of both explicit situated facts and implicit commonsense, we generate associated question-answer pairs and reasoning processes, finally followed by manual reviews for quality assurance. We evaluated recent mainstream large vision-language models on the benchmark and found several insightful conclusions.

- **Summary**: The advances in deep generative models have greatly accelerate the process of video procession such as video enhancement and synthesis. Learning spatio-temporal video models requires to capture the temporal dynamics of a scene, in addition to the visual appearance of individual frames. Illumination consistency, which reflects the variations of illumination in the dynamic video sequences, play a vital role in video processing. Unfortunately, to date, no well-accepted quantitative metric has been proposed for video illumination consistency evaluation. In this paper, we propose a illumination histogram consistency (IHC) metric to quantitatively and automatically evaluate the illumination consistency of the video sequences. IHC measures the illumination variation of any video sequence based on the illumination histogram discrepancies across all the frames in the video sequence. Specifically, given a video sequence, we first estimate the illumination map of each individual frame using the Retinex model; Then, using the illumination maps, the mean illumination histogram of the video sequence is computed by the mean operation across all the frames; Next, we compute the illumination histogram discrepancy between each individual frame and the mean illumination histogram and sum up all the illumination histogram discrepancies to represent the illumination variations of the video sequence. Finally, we obtain the IHC score from the illumination histogram discrepancies via normalization and subtraction operations. Experiments are conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed IHC metric and its capability to measure the illumination variations in video sequences.

- **Summary**: For robotics applications where there is a limited number of (typically ego-centric) views, parametric representations such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) generalize better than non-parametric ones such as Gaussian splatting (GS) to views that are very different from those in the training data; GS however can render much faster than NeRFs. We develop a procedure to convert back and forth between the two. Our approach achieves the best of both NeRFs (superior PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS on dissimilar views, and a compact representation) and GS (real-time rendering and ability for easily modifying the representation); the computational cost of these conversions is minor compared to training the two from scratch.
