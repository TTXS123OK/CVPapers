- **Summary**: Recent advancements in human video synthesis have enabled the generation of high-quality videos through the application of stable diffusion models. However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on animating solely the human element (the foreground) guided by pose information, while leaving the background entirely static. Contrary to this, in authentic, high-quality videos, backgrounds often dynamically adjust in harmony with foreground movements, eschewing stagnancy. We introduce a technique that concurrently learns both foreground and background dynamics by segregating their movements using distinct motion representations. Human figures are animated leveraging pose-based motion, capturing intricate actions. Conversely, for backgrounds, we employ sparse tracking points to model motion, thereby reflecting the natural interaction between foreground activity and environmental changes. Training on real-world videos enhanced with this innovative motion depiction approach, our model generates videos exhibiting coherent movement in both foreground subjects and their surrounding contexts. To further extend video generation to longer sequences without accumulating errors, we adopt a clip-by-clip generation strategy, introducing global features at each step. To ensure seamless continuity across these segments, we ingeniously link the final frame of a produced clip with input noise to spawn the succeeding one, maintaining narrative flow. Throughout the sequential generation process, we infuse the feature representation of the initial reference image into the network, effectively curtailing any cumulative color inconsistencies that may otherwise arise. Empirical evaluations attest to the superiority of our method in producing videos that exhibit harmonious interplay between foreground actions and responsive background dynamics, surpassing prior methodologies in this regard.

- **Summary**: Vision transformers have established a precedent of patchifying images into uniformly-sized chunks before processing. We hypothesize that this design choice may limit models in learning comprehensive and compositional representations from visual data. This paper explores the notion of providing semantically-meaningful visual tokens to transformer encoders within a vision-language pre-training framework. Leveraging off-the-shelf segmentation and scene-graph models, we extract representations of instance segmentation masks (referred to as tangible tokens) and relationships and actions (referred to as intangible tokens). Subsequently, we pre-train a vision-side transformer by incorporating these newly extracted tokens and aligning the resultant embeddings with caption embeddings from a text-side encoder. To capture the structural and semantic relationships among visual tokens, we introduce additive attention weights, which are used to compute self-attention scores. Our experiments on COCO demonstrate notable improvements over ViTs in learned representation quality across text-to-image (+47%) and image-to-text retrieval (+44%) tasks. Furthermore, we showcase the advantages on compositionality benchmarks such as ARO (+18%) and Winoground (+10%).

- **Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques applied to weights, activations, and the KV cache greatly reduce memory usage, latency, and power consumption of Large Language Models (LLMs), but may lead to large quantization errors when outliers are present. Recent findings suggest that rotating activation or weight matrices helps remove outliers and benefits quantization. In this work, we identify a collection of applicable rotation parameterizations that lead to identical outputs in full-precision Transformer architectures, and find that some random rotations lead to much better quantization than others, with an up to 13 points difference in downstream zero-shot reasoning performance. As a result, we propose SpinQuant that optimizes (or learns) the rotation matrices with Cayley optimization on a small validation set. With 4-bit quantization of weight, activation, and KV-cache, SpinQuant narrows the accuracy gap on zero-shot reasoning tasks with full precision to merely 2.9 points on the LLaMA-2 7B model, surpassing LLM-QAT by 19.1 points and SmoothQuant by 25.0 points. SpinQuant also outperforms concurrent work QuaRot, which applies random rotations to remove outliers. In particular, for LLaMA-2 7B/LLaMA-3 8B models that are hard to quantize, SpinQuant reduces the gap to full precision by 30.2%/34.1% relative to QuaRot.

- **Summary**: Image steganography can hide information in a host image and obtain a stego image that is perceptually indistinguishable from the original one. This technique has tremendous potential in scenarios like copyright protection, information retrospection, etc. Some previous studies have proposed to enhance the robustness of the methods against image disturbances to increase their applicability. However, they generally cannot achieve a satisfying balance between the steganography quality and robustness. In this paper, we focus on the issue of QR Code steganography that is robust to real-world printing and photography. Different from common image steganography, QR Code steganography aims to embed a non-natural image into a natural image and the restored QR Code is required to be recognizable, which increases the difficulty of data concealing and revealing. Inspired by the recent developments in transformer-based vision models, we discover that the tokenized representation of images is naturally suitable for steganography. In this paper, we propose a novel QR Code embedding framework, called Printing and Photography Robust Steganography (PPRSteg), which is competent to hide QR Code in a host image with unperceivable changes and can restore it even if the stego image is printed out and photoed. We outline a transition process to reduce the artifacts in stego images brought by QR Codes. We also propose a steganography model based on normalizing flow, which combines the attention mechanism to enhance its performance. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that integrates the advantages of transformer models into normalizing flow. We conduct comprehensive and detailed experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and the result shows that PPRSteg has great potential in robust, secure and high-quality QR Code steganography.

- **Summary**: Recent vision-language pre-trained models (VL-PTMs) have shown remarkable success in open-vocabulary tasks. However, downstream use cases often involve further fine-tuning of VL-PTMs, which may distort their general knowledge and impair their ability to handle distribution shifts. In real-world scenarios, machine learning systems inevitably encounter both covariate shifts (e.g., changes in image styles) and semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the importance of enhancing out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization on covariate shifts and simultaneously detecting semantic-shifted unseen classes. Thus a critical but underexplored question arises: How to improve VL-PTMs' generalization ability to closed-set OOD data, while effectively detecting open-set unseen classes during fine-tuning? In this paper, we propose a novel objective function of OOD detection that also serves to improve OOD generalization. We show that minimizing the gradient magnitude of energy scores on training data leads to domain-consistent Hessians of classification loss, a strong indicator for OOD generalization revealed by theoretical analysis. Based on this finding, we have developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for concurrent optimization of both tasks. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of our method.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have made rapid progress in generating high-quality samples across various domains. However, a theoretical understanding of the Lipschitz continuity and second momentum properties of the diffusion process is still lacking. In this paper, we bridge this gap by providing a detailed examination of these smoothness properties for the case where the target data distribution is a mixture of Gaussians, which serves as a universal approximator for smooth densities such as image data. We prove that if the target distribution is a $k$-mixture of Gaussians, the density of the entire diffusion process will also be a $k$-mixture of Gaussians. We then derive tight upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant and second momentum that are independent of the number of mixture components $k$. Finally, we apply our analysis to various diffusion solvers, both SDE and ODE based, to establish concrete error guarantees in terms of the total variation distance and KL divergence between the target and learned distributions. Our results provide deeper theoretical insights into the dynamics of the diffusion process under common data distributions.

- **Summary**: Multi-Channel Imaging (MCI) contains an array of challenges for encoding useful feature representations not present in traditional images. For example, images from two different satellites may both contain RGB channels, but the remaining channels can be different for each imaging source. Thus, MCI models must support a variety of channel configurations at test time. Recent work has extended traditional visual encoders for MCI, such as Vision Transformers (ViT), by supplementing pixel information with an encoding representing the channel configuration. However, these methods treat each channel equally, i.e., they do not consider the unique properties of each channel type, which can result in needless and potentially harmful redundancies in the learned features. For example, if RGB channels are always present, the other channels can focus on extracting information that cannot be captured by the RGB channels. To this end, we propose DiChaViT, which aims to enhance the diversity in the learned features of MCI-ViT models. This is achieved through a novel channel sampling strategy that encourages the selection of more distinct channel sets for training. Additionally, we employ regularization and initialization techniques to increase the likelihood that new information is learned from each channel. Many of our improvements are architecture agnostic and could be incorporated into new architectures as they are developed. Experiments on both satellite and cell microscopy datasets, CHAMMI, JUMP-CP, and So2Sat, report DiChaViT yields a 1.5-5.0% gain over the state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: The study of Maya hieroglyphic writing unlocks the rich history of cultural and societal knowledge embedded within this ancient civilization's visual narrative. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a novel lens through which we can translate these inscriptions, with the potential to allow non-specialists access to reading these texts and to aid in the decipherment of those hieroglyphs which continue to elude comprehensive interpretation. Toward this, we leverage a foundational model to segment Maya hieroglyphs from an open-source digital library dedicated to Maya artifacts. Despite the initial promise of publicly available foundational segmentation models, their effectiveness in accurately segmenting Maya hieroglyphs was initially limited. Addressing this challenge, our study involved the meticulous curation of image and label pairs with the assistance of experts in Maya art and history, enabling the fine-tuning of these foundational models. This process significantly enhanced model performance, illustrating the potential of fine-tuning approaches and the value of our expanding dataset. We plan to open-source this dataset for encouraging future research, and eventually to help make the hieroglyphic texts legible to a broader community, particularly for Maya heritage community members.



### Incremental Pseudo-Labeling for Black-Box Unsupervised Domain Adaptation

- **Summary**: Black-Box unsupervised domain adaptation (BBUDA) learns knowledge only with the prediction of target data from the source model without access to the source data and source model, which attempts to alleviate concerns about the privacy and security of data. However, incorrect pseudo-labels are prevalent in the prediction generated by the source model due to the cross-domain discrepancy, which may substantially degrade the performance of the target model. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that incrementally selects high-confidence pseudo-labels to improve the generalization ability of the target model. Specifically, we first generate pseudo-labels using a source model and train a crude target model by a vanilla BBUDA method. Second, we iteratively select high-confidence data from the low-confidence data pool by thresholding the softmax probabilities, prototype labels, and intra-class similarity. Then, we iteratively train a stronger target network based on the crude target model to correct the wrongly labeled samples to improve the accuracy of the pseudo-label. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art black-box unsupervised domain adaptation performance on three benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Achieving aesthetically pleasing photography necessitates attention to multiple factors, including composition and capture conditions, which pose challenges to novices. Prior research has explored the enhancement of photo aesthetics post-capture through 2D manipulation techniques; however, these approaches offer limited search space for aesthetics. We introduce a pioneering method that employs 3D operations to simulate the conditions at the moment of capture retrospectively. Our approach extrapolates the input image and then reconstructs the 3D scene from the extrapolated image, followed by an optimization to identify camera parameters and image aspect ratios that yield the best 3D view with enhanced aesthetics. Comparative qualitative and quantitative assessments reveal that our method surpasses traditional 2D editing techniques with superior aesthetics.

- **Summary**: Micro-expression recognition (MER) has drawn increasing attention in recent years due to its potential applications in intelligent medical and lie detection. However, the shortage of annotated data has been the major obstacle to further improve deep-learning based MER methods. Intuitively, utilizing sufficient macro-expression data to promote MER performance seems to be a feasible solution. However, the facial patterns of macro-expressions and micro-expressions are significantly different, which makes naive transfer learning methods difficult to deploy directly. To tacle this issue, we propose a generalized transfer learning paradigm, called \textbf{MA}cro-expression \textbf{TO} \textbf{MI}cro-expression (MA2MI). Under our paradigm, networks can learns the ability to represent subtle facial movement by reconstructing future frames. In addition, we also propose a two-branch micro-action network (MIACNet) to decouple facial position features and facial action features, which can help the network more accurately locate facial action locations. Extensive experiments on three popular MER benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised contrastive learning has predominantly adopted deterministic methods, which are not suited for environments characterized by uncertainty and noise. This paper introduces a new perspective on incorporating uncertainty into contrastive learning by embedding representations within a spherical space, inspired by the von Mises-Fisher distribution (vMF). We introduce an unnormalized form of vMF and leverage the concentration parameter, kappa, as a direct, interpretable measure to quantify uncertainty explicitly. This approach not only provides a probabilistic interpretation of the embedding space but also offers a method to calibrate model confidence against varying levels of data corruption and characteristics. Our empirical results demonstrate that the estimated concentration parameter correlates strongly with the degree of unforeseen data corruption encountered at test time, enables failure analysis, and enhances existing out-of-distribution detection methods.

- **Summary**: This technical report presents the 1st winning model for UG2+, a task in CVPR 2024 UAV Tracking and Pose-Estimation Challenge. This challenge faces difficulties in drone detection,   UAV-type classification and 2D/3D trajectory estimation in extreme weather conditions with multi-modal sensor information, including stereo vision, various Lidars, Radars, and audio arrays. Leveraging this information, we propose a multi-modal UAV detection, classification, and 3D tracking method for accurate UAV classification and tracking. A novel classification pipeline which incorporates sequence fusion, region of interest (ROI) cropping, and keyframe selection is proposed. Our system integrates cutting-edge classification techniques and sophisticated post-processing steps to boost accuracy and robustness. The designed pose estimation pipeline incorporates three modules: dynamic points analysis, a multi-object tracker, and trajectory completion techniques. Extensive experiments have validated the effectiveness and precision of our approach. In addition, we also propose a novel dataset pre-processing method and conduct a comprehensive ablation study for our design. We finally achieved the best performance in the classification and tracking of the MMUAD dataset.

- **Summary**: Removing rain artifacts in images is recognized as a significant issue. In this field, deep learning-based approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have succeeded. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs) have exhibited superior performance across various tasks in both natural language processing and image processing due to their ability to model long-range dependencies. This study introduces SSM to rain removal and proposes a Deraining Frequency-Enhanced State Space Model (DFSSM). To effectively remove rain streaks, which produce high-intensity frequency components in specific directions, we employ frequency domain processing concurrently with SSM. Additionally, we develop a novel mixed-scale gated-convolutional block, which uses convolutions with multiple kernel sizes to capture various scale degradations effectively and integrates a gating mechanism to manage the flow of information. Finally, experiments on synthetic and real-world rainy image datasets show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) requires models to leverage knowledge from both textual and visual modalities for step-by-step reasoning, which gains increasing attention. Nevertheless, the current MCoT benchmark still faces some challenges: (1) absence of visual modal reasoning, (2) single-step visual modal reasoning, and (3) Domain missing, thereby hindering the development of MCoT. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel benchmark (M$^3$CoT) to address the above challenges, advancing the multi-domain, multi-step, and multi-modal CoT. Additionally, we conduct a thorough evaluation involving abundant MCoT approaches on Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). In addition, we highlight that the current VLLMs still struggle to correctly reason in M$^3$CoT and there remains a large gap between existing VLLMs and human performance in M$^3$CoT, despite their superior results on previous MCoT benchmarks. To our knowledge, we take the first meaningful step toward the multi-domain, multi-step, and multi-modal scenario in MCoT. We hope that M$^3$CoT can serve as a valuable resource, providing a pioneering foundation in multi-domain, multi-step, multi-modal chain-of-thought research.

- **Summary**: The pursuit of high perceptual quality in image restoration has driven the development of revolutionary generative models, capable of producing results often visually indistinguishable from real data. However, as their perceptual quality continues to improve, these models also exhibit a growing tendency to generate hallucinations - realistic-looking details that do not exist in the ground truth images. The presence of hallucinations introduces uncertainty regarding the reliability of the models' predictions, raising major concerns about their practical application. In this paper, we employ information-theory tools to investigate this phenomenon, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between uncertainty and perception. We rigorously analyze the relationship between these two factors, proving that the global minimal uncertainty in generative models grows in tandem with perception. In particular, we define the inherent uncertainty of the restoration problem and show that attaining perfect perceptual quality entails at least twice this uncertainty. Additionally, we establish a relation between mean squared-error distortion, uncertainty and perception, through which we prove the aforementioned uncertainly-perception tradeoff induces the well-known perception-distortion tradeoff. This work uncovers fundamental limitations of generative models in achieving both high perceptual quality and reliable predictions for image restoration. We demonstrate our theoretical findings through an analysis of single image super-resolution algorithms. Our work aims to raise awareness among practitioners about this inherent tradeoff, empowering them to make informed decisions and potentially prioritize safety over perceptual performance.

- **Summary**: In response to the increasing demand for efficient and non-invasive methods to estimate food weight, this paper presents a vision-based approach utilizing 2D images. The study employs a dataset of 2380 images comprising fourteen different food types in various portions, orientations, and containers. The proposed methodology integrates deep learning and computer vision techniques, specifically employing Faster R-CNN for food detection and MobileNetV3 for weight estimation. The detection model achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 83.41\%, an average Intersection over Union (IoU) of 91.82\%, and a classification accuracy of 100\%. For weight estimation, the model demonstrated a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.3204, a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.0640\%, and an R-squared value of 98.65\%. The study underscores the potential applications of this technology in healthcare for nutrition counseling, fitness and wellness for dietary intake assessment, and smart food storage solutions to reduce waste. The results indicate that the combination of Faster R-CNN and MobileNetV3 provides a robust framework for accurate food weight estimation from 2D images, showcasing the synergy of computer vision and deep learning in practical applications.

- **Summary**: Graph matching is a fundamental tool in computer vision and pattern recognition. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for graph matching based on the proximal operator, referred to as differentiable proximal graph matching (DPGM). Specifically, we relax and decompose the quadratic assignment problem for the graph matching into a sequence of convex optimization problems. The whole algorithm can be considered as a differentiable map from the graph affinity matrix to the prediction of node correspondence. Therefore, the proposed method can be organically integrated into an end-to-end deep learning framework to jointly learn both the deep feature representation and the graph affinity matrix. In addition, we provide a theoretical guarantee to ensure the proposed method converges to a stable point with a reasonable number of iterations. Numerical experiments show that PGM outperforms existing graph matching algorithms on diverse datasets such as synthetic data, and CMU House. Meanwhile, PGM can fully harness the capability of deep feature extractors and achieve state-of-art performance on PASCAL VOC keypoints.

- **Summary**: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA), which aims to adapt the pre-trained model to ever-evolving target domains, emerges as an important task for vision models. As current vision models appear to be heavily biased towards texture, continuously adapting the model from one domain distribution to another can result in serious catastrophic forgetting. Drawing inspiration from the human visual system's adeptness at processing both shape and texture according to the famous Trichromatic Theory, we explore the integration of a Mixture-of-Activation-Sparsity-Experts (MoASE) as an adapter for the CTTA task. Given the distinct reaction of neurons with low/high activation to domain-specific/agnostic features, MoASE decomposes the neural activation into high-activation and low-activation components with a non-differentiable Spatial Differentiate Dropout (SDD). Based on the decomposition, we devise a multi-gate structure comprising a Domain-Aware Gate (DAG) that utilizes domain information to adaptive combine experts that process the post-SDD sparse activations of different strengths, and the Activation Sparsity Gate (ASG) that adaptively assigned feature selection threshold of the SDD for different experts for more precise feature decomposition. Finally, we introduce a Homeostatic-Proximal (HP) loss to bypass the error accumulation problem when continuously adapting the model. Extensive experiments on four prominent benchmarks substantiate that our methodology achieves state-of-the-art performance in both classification and segmentation CTTA tasks. Our code is now available at https://github.com/RoyZry98/MoASE-Pytorch.

- **Summary**: Neural networks are widely known to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, a method that poisons a portion of the training data to make the target model perform well on normal data sets, while outputting attacker-specified or random categories on the poisoned samples. Backdoor attacks are full of threats. Poisoned samples are becoming more and more similar to corresponding normal samples, and even the human eye cannot easily distinguish them. On the other hand, the accuracy of models carrying backdoors on normal samples is no different from that of clean models.In this article, by observing the characteristics of backdoor attacks, We provide a new model training method (PT) that freezes part of the model to train a model that can isolate suspicious samples. Then, on this basis, a clean model is fine-tuned to resist backdoor attacks.

- **Summary**: Biological motion perception (BMP) refers to humans' ability to perceive and recognize the actions of living beings solely from their motion patterns, sometimes as minimal as those depicted on point-light displays. While humans excel at these tasks without any prior training, current AI models struggle with poor generalization performance. To close this research gap, we propose the Motion Perceiver (MP). MP solely relies on patch-level optical flows from video clips as inputs. During training, it learns prototypical flow snapshots through a competitive binding mechanism and integrates invariant motion representations to predict action labels for the given video. During inference, we evaluate the generalization ability of all AI models and humans on 62,656 video stimuli spanning 24 BMP conditions using point-light displays in neuroscience. Remarkably, MP outperforms all existing AI models with a maximum improvement of 29% in top-1 action recognition accuracy on these conditions. Moreover, we benchmark all AI models in point-light displays of two standard video datasets in computer vision. MP also demonstrates superior performance in these cases. More interestingly, via psychophysics experiments, we found that MP recognizes biological movements in a way that aligns with human behavioural data. All data and code will be made public.

- **Summary**: Algorithmic detection of facial palsy offers the potential to improve current practices, which usually involve labor-intensive and subjective assessment by clinicians. In this paper, we present a multimodal fusion-based deep learning model that utilizes unstructured data (i.e. an image frame with facial line segments) and structured data (i.e. features of facial expressions) to detect facial palsy. We then contribute to a study to analyze the effect of different data modalities and the benefits of a multimodal fusion-based approach using videos of 21 facial palsy patients. Our experimental results show that among various data modalities (i.e. unstructured data - RGB images and images of facial line segments and structured data - coordinates of facial landmarks and features of facial expressions), the feed-forward neural network using features of facial expression achieved the highest precision of 76.22 while the ResNet-based model using images of facial line segments achieved the highest recall of 83.47. When we leveraged both images of facial line segments and features of facial expressions, our multimodal fusion-based deep learning model slightly improved the precision score to 77.05 at the expense of a decrease in the recall score.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image generation models have seen considerable advancement, catering to the increasing interest in personalized image creation. Current customization techniques often necessitate users to provide multiple images (typically 3-5) for each customized object, along with the classification of these objects and descriptive textual prompts for scenes. This paper questions whether the process can be made more user-friendly and the customization more intricate. We propose a method where users need only provide images along with text for each customization topic, and necessitates only a single image per visual concept. We introduce the concept of a ``multi-modal prompt'', a novel integration of text and images tailored to each customization concept, which simplifies user interaction and facilitates precise customization of both objects and scenes. Our proposed paradigm for customized text-to-image generation surpasses existing finetune-based methods in user-friendliness and the ability to customize complex objects with user-friendly inputs.

- **Summary**: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) image analysis plays an important role in the field of ophthalmology. Current successful analysis models rely on available large datasets, which can be challenging to be obtained for certain tasks. The use of deep generative models to create realistic data emerges as a promising approach. However, due to limitations in hardware resources, it is still difficulty to synthesize high-resolution OCT volumes. In this paper, we introduce a cascaded amortized latent diffusion model (CA-LDM) that can synthesis high-resolution OCT volumes in a memory-efficient way. First, we propose non-holistic autoencoders to efficiently build a bidirectional mapping between high-resolution volume space and low-resolution latent space. In tandem with autoencoders, we propose cascaded diffusion processes to synthesize high-resolution OCT volumes with a global-to-local refinement process, amortizing the memory and computational demands. Experiments on a public high-resolution OCT dataset show that our synthetic data have realistic high-resolution and global features, surpassing the capabilities of existing methods. Moreover, performance gains on two down-stream fine-grained segmentation tasks demonstrate the benefit of the proposed method in training deep learning models for medical imaging tasks. The code is public available at: https://github.com/nicetomeetu21/CA-LDM.

- **Summary**: We aim to tackle sparse-view reconstruction of a 360 3D scene using priors from latent diffusion models (LDM). The sparse-view setting is ill-posed and underconstrained, especially for scenes where the camera rotates 360 degrees around a point, as no visual information is available beyond some frontal views focused on the central object(s) of interest. In this work, we show that pretrained 2D diffusion models can strongly improve the reconstruction of a scene with low-cost fine-tuning. Specifically, we present SparseSplat360 (Sp2360), a method that employs a cascade of in-painting and artifact removal models to fill in missing details and clean novel views. Due to superior training and rendering speeds, we use an explicit scene representation in the form of 3D Gaussians over NeRF-based implicit representations. We propose an iterative update strategy to fuse generated pseudo novel views with existing 3D Gaussians fitted to the initial sparse inputs. As a result, we obtain a multi-view consistent scene representation with details coherent with the observed inputs. Our evaluation on the challenging Mip-NeRF360 dataset shows that our proposed 2D to 3D distillation algorithm considerably improves the performance of a regularized version of 3DGS adapted to a sparse-view setting and outperforms existing sparse-view reconstruction methods in 360 scene reconstruction. Qualitatively, our method generates entire 360 scenes from as few as 9 input views, with a high degree of foreground and background detail.

- **Summary**: Despite the impressive capabilities of generating images, text-to-image diffusion models are susceptible to producing undesirable outputs such as NSFW content and copyrighted artworks. To address this issue, recent studies have focused on fine-tuning model parameters to erase problematic concepts. However, existing methods exhibit a major flaw in robustness, as fine-tuned models often reproduce the undesirable outputs when faced with cleverly crafted prompts. This reveals a fundamental limitation in the current approaches and may raise risks for the deployment of diffusion models in the open world. To address this gap, we locate the concept-correlated neurons and find that these neurons show high sensitivity to adversarial prompts, thus could be deactivated when erasing and reactivated again under attacks. To improve the robustness, we introduce a new pruning-based strategy for concept erasing. Our method selectively prunes critical parameters associated with the concepts targeted for removal, thereby reducing the sensitivity of concept-related neurons. Our method can be easily integrated with existing concept-erasing techniques, offering a robust improvement against adversarial inputs. Experimental results show a significant enhancement in our model's ability to resist adversarial inputs, achieving nearly a 40% improvement in erasing the NSFW content and a 30% improvement in erasing artwork style.

- **Summary**: The remarkable generative capabilities of diffusion models have motivated extensive research in both image and video editing. Compared to video editing which faces additional challenges in the time dimension, image editing has witnessed the development of more diverse, high-quality approaches and more capable software like Photoshop. In light of this gap, we introduce a novel and generic solution that extends the applicability of image editing tools to videos by propagating edits from a single frame to the entire video using a pre-trained image-to-video model. Our method, dubbed I2VEdit, adaptively preserves the visual and motion integrity of the source video depending on the extent of the edits, effectively handling global edits, local edits, and moderate shape changes, which existing methods cannot fully achieve. At the core of our method are two main processes: Coarse Motion Extraction to align basic motion patterns with the original video, and Appearance Refinement for precise adjustments using fine-grained attention matching. We also incorporate a skip-interval strategy to mitigate quality degradation from auto-regressive generation across multiple video clips. Experimental results demonstrate our framework's superior performance in fine-grained video editing, proving its capability to produce high-quality, temporally consistent outputs.

- **Summary**: This paper aims to develop a new deep learning-inspired gaming approach for early detection of dementia. This research integrates a robust convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model for early dementia detection using health metrics data as well as facial image data through a cognitive assessment-based gaming application. We have collected 1000 data samples of health metrics dataset from Apollo Diagnostic Center Kolkata that is labeled as either demented or non-demented for the training of MOD-1D-CNN for the game level 1 and another dataset of facial images containing 1800 facial data that are labeled as either demented or non-demented is collected by our research team for the training of MOD-2D-CNN model in-game level 2. In our work, the loss for the proposed MOD-1D-CNN model is 0.2692 and the highest accuracy is 70.50% for identifying the dementia traits using real-life health metrics data. Similarly, the proposed MOD-2D-CNN model loss is 0.1755 and the highest accuracy is obtained here 95.72% for recognizing the dementia status using real-life face-based image data. Therefore, a rule-based weightage method is applied to combine both the proposed methods to achieve the final decision. The MOD-1D-CNN and MOD-2D-CNN models are more lightweight and computationally efficient alternatives because they have a significantly lower number of parameters when compared to the other state-of-the-art models. We have compared their accuracies and parameters with the other state-of-the-art deep learning models.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful representation of geometry and appearance for RGB-only dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), as it provides a compact dense map representation while enabling efficient and high-quality map rendering. However, existing methods show significantly worse reconstruction quality than competing methods using other 3D representations, e.g. neural points clouds, since they either do not employ global map and pose optimization or make use of monocular depth. In response, we propose the first RGB-only SLAM system with a dense 3D Gaussian map representation that utilizes all benefits of globally optimized tracking by adapting dynamically to keyframe pose and depth updates by actively deforming the 3D Gaussian map. Moreover, we find that refining the depth updates in inaccurate areas with a monocular depth estimator further improves the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction. Our experiments on the Replica, TUM-RGBD, and ScanNet datasets indicate the effectiveness of globally optimized 3D Gaussians, as the approach achieves superior or on par performance with existing RGB-only SLAM methods methods in tracking, mapping and rendering accuracy while yielding small map sizes and fast runtimes.

- **Summary**: A fundamental problem in learning robust and expressive visual representations lies in efficiently estimating the spatial relationships of visual semantics throughout the entire image. In this study, we propose vHeat, a novel vision backbone model that simultaneously achieves both high computational efficiency and global receptive field. The essential idea, inspired by the physical principle of heat conduction, is to conceptualize image patches as heat sources and model the calculation of their correlations as the diffusion of thermal energy. This mechanism is incorporated into deep models through the newly proposed module, the Heat Conduction Operator (HCO), which is physically plausible and can be efficiently implemented using DCT and IDCT operations with a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N^{1.5})$. Extensive experiments demonstrate that vHeat surpasses Vision Transformers (ViTs) across various vision tasks, while also providing higher inference speeds, reduced FLOPs, and lower GPU memory usage for high-resolution images. The code will be released at https://github.com/MzeroMiko/vHeat.

- **Summary**: Building robots capable of interacting with humans through natural language in the visual world presents a significant challenge in the field of robotics. To overcome this challenge, Embodied Question Answering (EQA) has been proposed as a benchmark task to measure the ability to identify an object navigating through a previously unseen environment in response to human-posed questions. Although some methods have been proposed, their evaluations have been limited to simulations, without experiments in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, all of these methods are constrained by a limited vocabulary for question-and-answer interactions, making them unsuitable for practical applications. In this work, we propose a map-based modular EQA method that enables real robots to navigate unknown environments through frontier-based map creation and address unknown QA pairs using foundation models that support open vocabulary. Unlike the questions of the previous EQA dataset on Matterport 3D (MP3D), questions in our real-world experiments contain various question formats and vocabularies not included in the training data. We conduct comprehensive experiments on virtual environments (MP3D-EQA) and two real-world house environments and demonstrate that our method can perform EQA even in the real world.

- **Summary**: We propose ID-to-3D, a method to generate identity- and text-guided 3D human heads with disentangled expressions, starting from even a single casually captured in-the-wild image of a subject. The foundation of our approach is anchored in compositionality, alongside the use of task-specific 2D diffusion models as priors for optimization. First, we extend a foundational model with a lightweight expression-aware and ID-aware architecture, and create 2D priors for geometry and texture generation, via fine-tuning only 0.2% of its available training parameters. Then, we jointly leverage a neural parametric representation for the expressions of each subject and a multi-stage generation of highly detailed geometry and albedo texture. This combination of strong face identity embeddings and our neural representation enables accurate reconstruction of not only facial features but also accessories and hair and can be meshed to provide render-ready assets for gaming and telepresence. Our results achieve an unprecedented level of identity-consistent and high-quality texture and geometry generation, generalizing to a ``world'' of unseen 3D identities, without relying on large 3D captured datasets of human assets.

- **Summary**: Limited labeled data hinder the application of deep learning in medical domain. In clinical practice, there are sufficient unlabeled data that are not effectively used, and semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising way for leveraging these unlabeled data. However, existing SSL methods ignore frequency domain and region-level information and it is important for lesion regions located at low frequencies and with significant scale changes. In this paper, we introduce two consistency regularization strategies for semi-supervised medical image segmentation, including frequency domain consistency (FDC) to assist the feature learning in frequency domain and multi-granularity region similarity consistency (MRSC) to perform multi-scale region-level local context information feature learning. With the help of the proposed FDC and MRSC, we can leverage the powerful feature representation capability of them in an effective and efficient way. We perform comprehensive experiments on two datasets, and the results show that our method achieves large performance gains and exceeds other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the deterioration of artificial materials used in structures has become a serious social issue, increasing the importance of inspections. Non-destructive testing is gaining increased demand due to its capability to inspect for defects and deterioration in structures while preserving their functionality. Among these, Laser Ultrasonic Visualization Testing (LUVT) stands out because it allows the visualization of ultrasonic propagation. This makes it visually straightforward to detect defects, thereby enhancing inspection efficiency. With the increasing number of the deterioration structures, challenges such as a shortage of inspectors and increased workload in non-destructive testing have become more apparent. Efforts to address these challenges include exploring automated inspection using machine learning. However, the lack of anomalous data with defects poses a barrier to improving the accuracy of automated inspection through machine learning. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method for automated LUVT inspection using an anomaly detection approach with a diffusion model that can be trained solely on negative examples (defect-free data). We experimentally confirmed that our proposed method improves defect detection and localization compared to general object detection algorithms used previously.

In response, TIP-Adapter and SuS-X have introduced training-free methods aimed at bolstering the efficacy of downstream tasks. While these approaches incorporate support sets to maintain data distribution consistency between knowledge cache and test sets, they often fall short in terms of generalization on the test set, particularly when faced with test data exhibiting substantial distributional variations. In this work, we present CapS-Adapter, an innovative method that employs a caption-based support set, effectively harnessing both image and caption features to exceed existing state-of-the-art techniques in training-free scenarios. CapS-Adapter adeptly constructs support sets that closely mirror target distributions, utilizing instance-level distribution features extracted from multimodal large models. By leveraging CLIP's single and cross-modal strengths, CapS-Adapter enhances predictive accuracy through the use of multimodal support sets. Our method achieves outstanding zero-shot classification results across 19 benchmark datasets, improving accuracy by 2.19\% over the previous leading method. Our contributions are substantiated through extensive validation on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance and robust generalization capabilities.

- **Summary**: With the advent of personalized generation models, users can more readily create images resembling existing content, heightening the risk of violating portrait rights and intellectual property (IP). Traditional post-hoc detection and source-tracing methods for AI-generated content (AIGC) employ proactive watermark approaches; however, these are less effective against personalized generation models. Moreover, attribution techniques for AIGC rely on passive detection but often struggle to differentiate AIGC from authentic images, presenting a substantial challenge. Integrating these two processes into a cohesive framework not only meets the practical demands for protection and forensics but also improves the effectiveness of attribution tasks. Inspired by this insight, we propose a unified approach for image copyright source-tracing and attribution, introducing an innovative watermarking-attribution method that blends proactive and passive strategies. We embed copyright watermarks into protected images and train a watermark decoder to retrieve copyright information from the outputs of personalized models, using this watermark as an initial step for confirming if an image is AIGC-generated. To pinpoint specific generation techniques, we utilize powerful visual backbone networks for classification. Additionally, we implement an incremental learning strategy to adeptly attribute new personalized models without losing prior knowledge, thereby enhancing the model's adaptability to novel generation methods. We have conducted experiments using various celebrity portrait series sourced online, and the results affirm the efficacy of our method in source-tracing and attribution tasks, as well as its robustness against knowledge forgetting.

- **Summary**: Cloth-changing person Re-IDentification (Re-ID) aims at recognizing the same person with clothing changes across non-overlapping cameras. Conventional person Re-ID methods usually bias the model's focus on cloth-related appearance features rather than identity-sensitive features associated with biological traits. Recently, advanced cloth-changing person Re-ID methods either resort to identity-related auxiliary modalities (e.g., sketches, silhouettes, keypoints and 3D shapes) or clothing labels to mitigate the impact of clothes. However, relying on unpractical and inflexible auxiliary modalities or annotations limits their real-world applicability. In this paper, we promote cloth-changing person Re-ID by effectively leveraging abundant semantics present within pedestrian images without the need for any auxiliaries. Specifically, we propose the Content and Salient Semantics Collaboration (CSSC) framework, facilitating cross-parallel semantics interaction and refinement. Our framework is simple yet effective, and the vital design is the Semantics Mining and Refinement (SMR) module. It extracts robust identity features about content and salient semantics, while mitigating interference from clothing appearances effectively. By capitalizing on the mined abundant semantic features, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three cloth-changing benchmarks as well as conventional benchmarks, demonstrating its superiority over advanced competitors.

- **Summary**: With the continuous expansion of intelligent surveillance networks, lifelong person re-identification (LReID) has received widespread attention, pursuing the need of self-evolution across different domains. However, existing LReID studies accumulate knowledge with the assumption that people would not change their clothes. In this paper, we propose a more practical task, namely lifelong person re-identification with hybrid clothing states (LReID-Hybrid), which takes a series of cloth-changing and cloth-consistent domains into account during lifelong learning. To tackle the challenges of knowledge granularity mismatch and knowledge presentation mismatch that occurred in LReID-Hybrid, we take advantage of the consistency and generalization of the text space, and propose a novel framework, dubbed $Teata$, to effectively align, transfer and accumulate knowledge in an "image-text-image" closed loop. Concretely, to achieve effective knowledge transfer, we design a Structured Semantic Prompt (SSP) learning to decompose the text prompt into several structured pairs to distill knowledge from the image space with a unified granularity of text description. Then, we introduce a Knowledge Adaptation and Projection strategy (KAP), which tunes text knowledge via a slow-paced learner to adapt to different tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed $Teata$ for LReID-Hybrid as well as on conventional LReID benchmarks over advanced methods.

- **Summary**: Mamba is an effective state space model with linear computation complexity. It has recently shown impressive efficiency in dealing with high-resolution inputs across various vision tasks. In this paper, we reveal that the powerful Mamba model shares surprising similarities with linear attention Transformer, which typically underperform conventional Transformer in practice. By exploring the similarities and disparities between the effective Mamba and subpar linear attention Transformer, we provide comprehensive analyses to demystify the key factors behind Mamba's success. Specifically, we reformulate the selective state space model and linear attention within a unified formulation, rephrasing Mamba as a variant of linear attention Transformer with six major distinctions: input gate, forget gate, shortcut, no attention normalization, single-head, and modified block design. For each design, we meticulously analyze its pros and cons, and empirically evaluate its impact on model performance in vision tasks. Interestingly, the results highlight the forget gate and block design as the core contributors to Mamba's success, while the other four designs are less crucial. Based on these findings, we propose a Mamba-Like Linear Attention (MLLA) model by incorporating the merits of these two key designs into linear attention. The resulting model outperforms various vision Mamba models in both image classification and high-resolution dense prediction tasks, while enjoying parallelizable computation and fast inference speed.

- **Summary**: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been widely adopted to design neural networks for various computer vision tasks. One of its most promising subdomains is differentiable NAS (DNAS), where the optimal architecture is found in a differentiable manner. However, gradient-based methods suffer from the discretization error, which can severely damage the process of obtaining the final architecture. In our work, we first study the risk of discretization error and show how it affects an unregularized supernet. Then, we present that penalizing high entropy, a common technique of architecture regularization, can hinder the supernet's performance. Therefore, to robustify the DNAS framework, we introduce a novel single-stage searching protocol, which is not reliant on decoding a continuous architecture. Our results demonstrate that this approach outperforms other DNAS methods by achieving 75.3% in the searching stage on the Cityscapes validation dataset and attains performance 1.1% higher than the optimal network of DCNAS on the non-dense search space comprising short connections. The entire training process takes only 5.5 GPU days due to the weight reuse, and yields a computationally efficient architecture. Additionally, we propose a new dataset split procedure, which substantially improves results and prevents architecture degeneration in DARTS.



### Few-shot Tuning of Foundation Models for Class-incremental Learning

- **Summary**: For the first time, we explore few-shot tuning of vision foundation models for class-incremental learning. Unlike existing few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) methods, which train an encoder on a base session to ensure forward compatibility for future continual learning, foundation models are generally trained on large unlabelled data without such considerations. This renders prior methods from traditional FSCIL incompatible for FSCIL with the foundation model. To this end, we propose Consistency-guided Asynchronous Contrastive Tuning (CoACT), a new approach to continually tune foundation models for new classes in few-shot settings. CoACT comprises three components: (i) asynchronous contrastive tuning, which learns new classes by including LoRA modules in the pre-trained encoder, while enforcing consistency between two asynchronous encoders; (ii) controlled fine-tuning, which facilitates effective tuning of a subset of the foundation model; and (iii) consistency-guided incremental tuning, which enforces additional regularization during later sessions to reduce forgetting of the learned classes. We perform an extensive study on 16 diverse datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of CoACT, outperforming the best baseline method by 2.47% on average and with up to 12.52% on individual datasets. Additionally, CoACT shows reduced forgetting and robustness in low-shot experiments. As an added bonus, CoACT shows up to 13.5% improvement in standard FSCIL over the current SOTA on benchmark evaluations. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/ShuvenduRoy/CoACT-FSCIL.

- **Summary**: Weakly-supervised segmentation (WSS) methods, reliant on image-level labels indicating object presence, lack explicit correspondence between labels and regions of interest (ROIs), posing a significant challenge. Despite this, WSS methods have attracted attention due to their much lower annotation costs compared to fully-supervised segmentation. Leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) self-play, we propose a novel WSS method that gamifies image segmentation of a ROI. We formulate segmentation as a competition between two agents that compete to select ROI-containing patches until exhaustion of all such patches. The score at each time-step, used to compute the reward for agent training, represents likelihood of object presence within the selection, determined by an object presence detector pre-trained using only image-level binary classification labels of object presence. Additionally, we propose a game termination condition that can be called by either side upon exhaustion of all ROI-containing patches, followed by the selection of a final patch from each. Upon termination, the agent is incentivised if ROI-containing patches are exhausted or disincentivised if an ROI-containing patch is found by the competitor. This competitive setup ensures minimisation of over- or under-segmentation, a common problem with WSS methods. Extensive experimentation across four datasets demonstrates significant performance improvements over recent state-of-the-art methods. Code: https://github.com/s-sd/spurl/tree/main/wss

- **Summary**: Human beings perceive the world through diverse senses such as sight, smell, hearing, and touch. Similarly, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enhance the capabilities of traditional large language models by integrating and processing data from multiple modalities including text, vision, audio, video, and 3D environments. Data plays a pivotal role in the development and refinement of these models. In this survey, we comprehensively review the literature on MLLMs from a data-centric perspective. Specifically, we explore methods for preparing multimodal data during the pretraining and adaptation phases of MLLMs. Additionally, we analyze the evaluation methods for datasets and review benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs. Our survey also outlines potential future research directions. This work aims to provide researchers with a detailed understanding of the data-driven aspects of MLLMs, fostering further exploration and innovation in this field.

- **Summary**: The availability of large-scale multimodal datasets and advancements in diffusion models have significantly accelerated progress in 4D content generation. Most prior approaches rely on multiple image or video diffusion models, utilizing score distillation sampling for optimization or generating pseudo novel views for direct supervision. However, these methods are hindered by slow optimization speeds and multi-view inconsistency issues. Spatial and temporal consistency in 4D geometry has been extensively explored respectively in 3D-aware diffusion models and traditional monocular video diffusion models. Building on this foundation, we propose a strategy to migrate the temporal consistency in video diffusion models to the spatial-temporal consistency required for 4D generation. Specifically, we present a novel framework, \textbf{Diffusion4D}, for efficient and scalable 4D content generation. Leveraging a meticulously curated dynamic 3D dataset, we develop a 4D-aware video diffusion model capable of synthesizing orbital views of dynamic 3D assets. To control the dynamic strength of these assets, we introduce a 3D-to-4D motion magnitude metric as guidance. Additionally, we propose a novel motion magnitude reconstruction loss and 3D-aware classifier-free guidance to refine the learning and generation of motion dynamics. After obtaining orbital views of the 4D asset, we perform explicit 4D construction with Gaussian splatting in a coarse-to-fine manner. The synthesized multi-view consistent 4D image set enables us to swiftly generate high-fidelity and diverse 4D assets within just several minutes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms of generation efficiency and 4D geometry consistency across various prompt modalities.

- **Summary**: When performing manipulation-based activities such as picking objects, a mobile robot needs to position its base at a location that supports successful execution. To address this problem, prominent approaches typically rely on costly grasp planners to provide grasp poses for a target object, which are then are then analysed to identify the best robot placements for achieving each grasp pose. In this paper, we propose instead to first find robot placements that would not result in collision with the environment and from where picking up the object is feasible, then evaluate them to find the best placement candidate. Our approach takes into account the robot's reachability, as well as RGB-D images and occupancy grid maps of the environment for identifying suitable robot poses. The proposed algorithm is embedded in a service robotic workflow, in which a person points to select the target object for grasping. We evaluate our approach with a series of grasping experiments, against an existing baseline implementation that sends the robot to a fixed navigation goal. The experimental results show how the approach allows the robot to grasp the target object from locations that are very challenging to the baseline implementation.

- **Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on multimodal tasks, without any multimodal finetuning. They are the building block for Large Multimodal Models, yet, we still lack a proper understanding of their success. In this work, we expose frozen LLMs to image, video, audio and text inputs and analyse their internal representation aiming to understand their generalization beyond textual inputs.   Findings. Perceptual tokens (1) are easily distinguishable from textual ones inside LLMs, with significantly different representations, and complete translation to textual tokens does not exist. Yet, (2) both perceptual and textual tokens activate similar LLM weights. Despite being different, (3) perceptual and textual tokens are implicitly aligned inside LLMs, we call this the implicit multimodal alignment (IMA), and argue that this is linked to architectural design, helping LLMs to generalize. This provide more evidence to believe that the generalization of LLMs to multimodal inputs is mainly due to their architecture.   Implications. (1) We find a positive correlation between the implicit alignment score and the task performance, suggesting that this could act as a proxy metric for model evaluation and selection. (2) A negative correlation exists regarding hallucinations, revealing that this problem is mainly due to misalignment between the internal perceptual and textual representations. (3) Perceptual tokens change slightly throughout the model, thus, we propose different approaches to skip computations (e.g. in FFN layers), and significantly reduce the inference cost. (4) Due to the slowly changing embeddings across layers, and the high overlap between textual and multimodal activated weights, we compress LLMs by keeping only 1 subnetwork that works well across a wide range of multimodal tasks.

- **Summary**: Capturing complex temporal relationships between video and audio modalities is vital for Audio-Visual Emotion Recognition (AVER). However, existing methods lack attention to local details, such as facial state changes between video frames, which can reduce the discriminability of features and thus lower recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Detail-Enhanced Intra- and Inter-modal Interaction network(DE-III) for AVER, incorporating several novel aspects. We introduce optical flow information to enrich video representations with texture details that better capture facial state changes. A fusion module integrates the optical flow estimation with the corresponding video frames to enhance the representation of facial texture variations. We also design attentive intra- and inter-modal feature enhancement modules to further improve the richness and discriminability of video and audio representations. A detailed quantitative evaluation shows that our proposed model outperforms all existing methods on three benchmark datasets for both concrete and continuous emotion recognition. To encourage further research and ensure replicability, we will release our full code upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Advancements in language foundation models have primarily fueled the recent surge in artificial intelligence. In contrast, generative learning of non-textual modalities, especially videos, significantly trails behind language modeling. This thesis chronicles our endeavor to build multi-task models for generating videos and other modalities under diverse conditions, as well as for understanding and compression applications. Given the high dimensionality of visual data, we pursue concise and accurate latent representations. Our video-native spatial-temporal tokenizers preserve high fidelity. We unveil a novel approach to mapping bidirectionally between visual observation and interpretable lexical terms. Furthermore, our scalable visual token representation proves beneficial across generation, compression, and understanding tasks. This achievement marks the first instances of language models surpassing diffusion models in visual synthesis and a video tokenizer outperforming industry-standard codecs. Within these multi-modal latent spaces, we study the design of multi-task generative models. Our masked multi-task transformer excels at the quality, efficiency, and flexibility of video generation. We enable a frozen language model, trained solely on text, to generate visual content. Finally, we build a scalable generative multi-modal transformer trained from scratch, enabling the generation of videos containing high-fidelity motion with the corresponding audio given diverse conditions. Throughout the course, we have shown the effectiveness of integrating multiple tasks, crafting high-fidelity latent representation, and generating multiple modalities. This work suggests intriguing potential for future exploration in generating non-textual data and enabling real-time, interactive experiences across various media forms.
