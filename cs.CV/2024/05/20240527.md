- **Summary**: Image registration estimates spatial correspondences between a pair of images. These estimates are typically obtained via numerical optimization or regression by a deep network. A desirable property of such estimators is that a correspondence estimate (e.g., the true oracle correspondence) for an image pair is maintained under deformations of the input images. Formally, the estimator should be equivariant to a desired class of image transformations. In this work, we present careful analyses of the desired equivariance properties in the context of multi-step deep registration networks. Based on these analyses we 1) introduce the notions of $[U,U]$ equivariance (network equivariance to the same deformations of the input images) and $[W,U]$ equivariance (where input images can undergo different deformations); we 2) show that in a suitable multi-step registration setup it is sufficient for overall $[W,U]$ equivariance if the first step has $[W,U]$ equivariance and all others have $[U,U]$ equivariance; we 3) show that common displacement-predicting networks only exhibit $[U,U]$ equivariance to translations instead of the more powerful $[W,U]$ equivariance; and we 4) show how to achieve multi-step $[W,U]$ equivariance via a coordinate-attention mechanism combined with displacement-predicting refinement layers (CARL). Overall, our approach obtains excellent practical registration performance on several 3D medical image registration tasks and outperforms existing unsupervised approaches for the challenging problem of abdomen registration.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), originally designed for general-purpose segmentation tasks, has been used recently for polyp segmentation. Nonetheless, fine-tuning SAM with data from new imaging centers or clinics poses significant challenges. This is because this necessitates the creation of an expensive and time-intensive annotated dataset, along with the potential for variability in user prompts during inference. To address these issues, we propose a robust fine-tuning technique, PP-SAM, that allows SAM to adapt to the polyp segmentation task with limited images. To this end, we utilize variable perturbed bounding box prompts (BBP) to enrich the learning context and enhance the model's robustness to BBP perturbations during inference. Rigorous experiments on polyp segmentation benchmarks reveal that our variable BBP perturbation significantly improves model resilience. Notably, on Kvasir, 1-shot fine-tuning boosts the DICE score by 20% and 37% with 50 and 100-pixel BBP perturbations during inference, respectively. Moreover, our experiments show that 1-shot, 5-shot, and 10-shot PP-SAM with 50-pixel perturbations during inference outperform a recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) polyp segmentation method by 26%, 7%, and 5% DICE scores, respectively. Our results motivate the broader applicability of our PP-SAM for other medical imaging tasks with limited samples. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/SLDGroup/PP-SAM.

- **Summary**: Face recognition is a very important topic in data science and biometric security research areas. It has multiple applications in military, finance, and retail, to name a few. In this paper, the novel hypergraph Laplacian Eigenmaps will be proposed and combine with the k nearest-neighbor method and/or with the kernel ridge regression method to solve the face recognition problem. Experimental results illustrate that the accuracy of the combination of the novel hypergraph Laplacian Eigenmaps and one specific classification system is similar to the accuracy of the combination of the old symmetric normalized hypergraph Laplacian Eigenmaps method and one specific classification system.

- **Summary**: Pretrained diffusion models (DMs) have recently been popularly used in solving inverse problems (IPs). The existing methods mostly interleave iterative steps in the reverse diffusion process and iterative steps to bring the iterates closer to satisfying the measurement constraint. However, such interleaving methods struggle to produce final results that look like natural objects of interest (i.e., manifold feasibility) and fit the measurement (i.e., measurement feasibility), especially for nonlinear IPs. Moreover, their capabilities to deal with noisy IPs with unknown types and levels of measurement noise are unknown. In this paper, we advocate viewing the reverse process in DMs as a function and propose a novel plug-in method for solving IPs using pretrained DMs, dubbed DMPlug. DMPlug addresses the issues of manifold feasibility and measurement feasibility in a principled manner, and also shows great potential for being robust to unknown types and levels of noise. Through extensive experiments across various IP tasks, including two linear and three nonlinear IPs, we demonstrate that DMPlug consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, often by large margins especially for nonlinear IPs.

- **Summary**: We address the challenge of multi-agent cooperation, where agents achieve a common goal by interacting with a 3D scene and cooperating with decentralized agents under complex partial observations. This involves managing communication costs and optimizing interaction trajectories in dynamic environments. Our research focuses on three primary limitations of existing cooperative agent systems. Firstly, current systems demonstrate inefficiency in managing acquired information through observation, resulting in declining planning performance as the environment becomes more complex with additional objects or goals. Secondly, the neglect of false plans in partially observable settings leads to suboptimal cooperative performance, as agents struggle to adapt to environmental changes influenced by the unseen actions of other agents. Lastly, the failure to incorporate spatial data into decision-making processes restricts the agent's ability to construct optimized trajectories. To overcome these limitations, we propose the RElevance and Validation-Enhanced Cooperative Language Agent (REVECA), a novel cognitive architecture powered by GPT-3.5. REVECA leverages relevance assessment, plan validation, and spatial information to enhance the efficiency and robustness of agent cooperation in dynamic and partially observable environments while minimizing continuous communication costs and effectively managing irrelevant dummy objects. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of REVECA over previous approaches, including those driven by GPT-4.0. Additionally, a user study highlights REVECA's potential for achieving trustworthy human-AI cooperation. We expect that REVECA will have significant applications in gaming, XR applications, educational tools, and humanoid robots, contributing to substantial economic, commercial, and academic advancements.

- **Summary**: We address the long-standing problem of how to learn effective pixel-based image diffusion models at scale, introducing a remarkably simple greedy growing method for stable training of large-scale, high-resolution models. without the needs for cascaded super-resolution components. The key insight stems from careful pre-training of core components, namely, those responsible for text-to-image alignment {\it vs.} high-resolution rendering. We first demonstrate the benefits of scaling a {\it Shallow UNet}, with no down(up)-sampling enc(dec)oder. Scaling its deep core layers is shown to improve alignment, object structure, and composition. Building on this core model, we propose a greedy algorithm that grows the architecture into high-resolution end-to-end models, while preserving the integrity of the pre-trained representation, stabilizing training, and reducing the need for large high-resolution datasets. This enables a single stage model capable of generating high-resolution images without the need of a super-resolution cascade. Our key results rely on public datasets and show that we are able to train non-cascaded models up to 8B parameters with no further regularization schemes. Vermeer, our full pipeline model trained with internal datasets to produce 1024x1024 images, without cascades, is preferred by 44.0% vs. 21.4% human evaluators over SDXL.

- **Summary**: Masked face recognition is important for social good but challenged by diverse occlusions that cause insufficient or inaccurate representations. In this work, we propose a unified deep network to learn generative-to-discriminative representations for facilitating masked face recognition. To this end, we split the network into three modules and learn them on synthetic masked faces in a greedy module-wise pretraining manner. First, we leverage a generative encoder pretrained for face inpainting and finetune it to represent masked faces into category-aware descriptors. Attribute to the generative encoder's ability in recovering context information, the resulting descriptors can provide occlusion-robust representations for masked faces, mitigating the effect of diverse masks. Then, we incorporate a multi-layer convolutional network as a discriminative reformer and learn it to convert the category-aware descriptors into identity-aware vectors, where the learning is effectively supervised by distilling relation knowledge from off-the-shelf face recognition model. In this way, the discriminative reformer together with the generative encoder serves as the pretrained backbone, providing general and discriminative representations towards masked faces. Finally, we cascade one fully-connected layer following by one softmax layer into a feature classifier and finetune it to identify the reformed identity-aware vectors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and realistic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in recognizing masked faces.

- **Summary**: The remarkable achievements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have captivated the attention of both academia and industry, transcending their initial role in dialogue generation. The utilization of LLMs as intermediary agents in various tasks has yielded promising results, sparking a wave of innovation in artificial intelligence. Building on these breakthroughs, we introduce a novel approach that integrates the agent paradigm into the Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection task, aiming to enhance its robustness and adaptability. Our proposed method, Concept Matching with Agent (CMA), employs neutral prompts as agents to augment the CLIP-based OOD detection process. These agents function as dynamic observers and communication hubs, interacting with both In-distribution (ID) labels and data inputs to form vector triangle relationships. This triangular framework offers a more nuanced approach than the traditional binary relationship, allowing for better separation and identification of ID and OOD inputs. Our extensive experimental results showcase the superior performance of CMA over both zero-shot and training-required methods in a diverse array of real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models equipped with language models demonstrate excellent controllability in image generation tasks, allowing image processing to adhere to human instructions. However, the lack of diverse instruction-following data hampers the development of models that effectively recognize and execute user-customized instructions, particularly in low-level tasks. Moreover, the stochastic nature of the diffusion process leads to deficiencies in image generation or editing tasks that require the detailed preservation of the generated images. To address these limitations, we propose PromptFix, a comprehensive framework that enables diffusion models to follow human instructions to perform a wide variety of image-processing tasks. First, we construct a large-scale instruction-following dataset that covers comprehensive image-processing tasks, including low-level tasks, image editing, and object creation. Next, we propose a high-frequency guidance sampling method to explicitly control the denoising process and preserve high-frequency details in unprocessed areas. Finally, we design an auxiliary prompting adapter, utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance text prompts and improve the model's task generalization. Experimental results show that PromptFix outperforms previous methods in various image-processing tasks. Our proposed model also achieves comparable inference efficiency with these baseline models and exhibits superior zero-shot capabilities in blind restoration and combination tasks.

- **Summary**: We introduce a technique for the reconstruction of high-fidelity surfaces from multi-view images. Our technique uses a new point-based representation, the dipole sum, which generalizes the winding number to allow for interpolation of arbitrary per-point attributes in point clouds with noisy or outlier points. Using dipole sums allows us to represent implicit geometry and radiance fields as per-point attributes of a point cloud, which we initialize directly from structure from motion. We additionally derive Barnes-Hut fast summation schemes for accelerated forward and reverse-mode dipole sum queries. These queries facilitate the use of ray tracing to efficiently and differentiably render images with our point-based representations, and thus update their point attributes to optimize scene geometry and appearance. We evaluate this inverse rendering framework against state-of-the-art alternatives, based on ray tracing of neural representations or rasterization of Gaussian point-based representations. Our technique significantly improves reconstruction quality at equal runtimes, while also supporting more general rendering techniques such as shadow rays for direct illumination. In the supplement, we provide interactive visualizations of our results.

- **Summary**: Spike cameras, with their exceptional temporal resolution, are revolutionizing high-speed visual applications. Large-scale synthetic datasets have significantly accelerated the development of these cameras, particularly in reconstruction and optical flow. However, current synthetic datasets for spike cameras lack sophistication. Addressing this gap, we introduce SCSim, a novel and more realistic spike camera simulator with a comprehensive noise model. SCSim is adept at autonomously generating driving scenarios and synthesizing corresponding spike streams. To enhance the fidelity of these streams, we've developed a comprehensive noise model tailored to the unique circuitry of spike cameras. Our evaluations demonstrate that SCSim outperforms existing simulation methods in generating authentic spike streams. Crucially, SCSim simplifies the creation of datasets, thereby greatly advancing spike-based visual tasks like reconstruction. Our project refers to https://github.com/Acnext/SCSim.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised disentanglement of content and transformation has recently drawn much research, given their efficacy in solving downstream unsupervised tasks like clustering, alignment, and shape analysis. This problem is particularly important for analyzing shape-focused real-world scientific image datasets, given their significant relevance to downstream tasks. The existing works address the problem by explicitly parameterizing the transformation factors, significantly reducing their expressiveness. Moreover, they are not applicable in cases where transformations can not be readily parametrized. An alternative to such explicit approaches is self-supervised methods with data augmentation, which implicitly disentangles transformations and content. We demonstrate that the existing self-supervised methods with data augmentation result in the poor disentanglement of content and transformations in real-world scenarios. Therefore, we developed a novel self-supervised method, DualContrast, specifically for unsupervised disentanglement of content and transformations in shape-focused image datasets. Our extensive experiments showcase the superiority of DualContrast over existing self-supervised and explicit parameterization approaches. We leveraged DualContrast to disentangle protein identities and protein conformations in cellular 3D protein images. Moreover, we also disentangled transformations in MNIST, viewpoint in the Linemod Object dataset, and human movement deformation in the Starmen dataset as transformations using DualContrast.

- **Summary**: As the field of image generation rapidly advances, traditional diffusion models and those integrated with multimodal large language models (LLMs) still encounter limitations in interpreting complex prompts and preserving image consistency pre and post-editing. To tackle these challenges, we present an innovative image editing framework that employs the robust Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and localizing capabilities of multimodal LLMs to aid diffusion models in generating more refined images. We first meticulously design a CoT process comprising instruction decomposition, region localization, and detailed description. Subsequently, we fine-tune the LISA model, a lightweight multimodal LLM, using the CoT process of Multimodal LLMs and the mask of the edited image. By providing the diffusion models with knowledge of the generated prompt and image mask, our models generate images with a superior understanding of instructions. Through extensive experiments, our model has demonstrated superior performance in image generation, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models. Notably, our model exhibits an enhanced ability to understand complex prompts and generate corresponding images, while maintaining high fidelity and consistency in images before and after generation.

- **Summary**: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and Neural Fields are a novel paradigm for signal representation, from images and audio to 3D scenes and videos. The fundamental idea is to represent a signal as a continuous and differentiable neural network. This idea offers unprecedented benefits such as continuous resolution and memory efficiency, enabling new compression techniques. However, representing data as neural networks poses new challenges. For instance, given a 2D image as a neural network, how can we further compress such a neural image?. In this work, we present a novel analysis on compressing neural fields, with the focus on images. We also introduce Adaptive Neural Images (ANI), an efficient neural representation that enables adaptation to different inference or transmission requirements. Our proposed method allows to reduce the bits-per-pixel (bpp) of the neural image by 4x, without losing sensitive details or harming fidelity. We achieve this thanks to our successful implementation of 4-bit neural representations. Our work offers a new framework for developing compressed neural fields.

- **Summary**: One of the primary challenges in brain tumor segmentation arises from the uncertainty of voxels close to tumor boundaries. However, the conventional process of generating ground truth segmentation masks fails to treat such uncertainties properly. Those ``hard labels'' with 0s and 1s conceptually influenced the majority of prior studies on brain image segmentation. As a result, tumor segmentation is often solved through voxel classification. In this work, we instead view this problem as a voxel-level regression, where the ground truth represents a certainty mapping from any pixel based on the distance to tumor border. We propose a novel ground truth label transformation, which is based on a signed geodesic transform, to capture the uncertainty in brain tumors' vicinity, while maintaining a margin between positive and negative samples. We combine this idea with a Focal-like regression L1-loss that enables effective regression learning in high-dimensional output space by appropriately weighting voxels according to their difficulty. We thoroughly conduct an experimental evaluation to validate the components of our proposed method, compare it to a diverse array of state-of-the-art segmentation models, and show that it is architecture-agnostic. The code of our method is made publicly available (\url{https://github.com/Oulu-IMEDS/SiNGR/}).

- **Summary**: Accurate retinal vessel segmentation is a crucial step in the quantitative assessment of retinal vasculature, which is needed for the early detection of retinal diseases and other conditions. Numerous studies have been conducted to tackle the problem of segmenting vessels automatically using a pixel-wise classification approach. The common practice of creating ground truth labels is to categorize pixels as foreground and background. This approach is, however, biased, and it ignores the uncertainty of a human annotator when it comes to annotating e.g. thin vessels. In this work, we propose a simple and effective method that casts the retinal image segmentation task as an image-level regression. For this purpose, we first introduce a novel Segmentation Annotation Uncertainty-Aware (SAUNA) transform, which adds pixel uncertainty to the ground truth using the pixel's closeness to the annotation boundary and vessel thickness. To train our model with soft labels, we generalize the earlier proposed Jaccard metric loss to arbitrary hypercubes, which is a second contribution of this work. The proposed SAUNA transform and the new theoretical results allow us to directly train a standard U-Net-like architecture at the image level, outperforming all recently published methods. We conduct thorough experiments and compare our method to a diverse set of baselines across 5 retinal image datasets. Our implementation is available at \url{https://github.com/Oulu-IMEDS/SAUNA}.

- **Summary**: In recent years, neural network-driven image compression (NIC) has gained significant attention. Some works adopt deep generative models such as GANs and diffusion models to enhance perceptual quality (realism). A critical obstacle of these generative NIC methods is that each model is optimized for a single bit rate. Consequently, multiple models are required to compress images to different bit rates, which is impractical for real-world applications. To tackle this issue, we propose a variable-rate generative NIC model. Specifically, we explore several discriminator designs tailored for the variable-rate approach and introduce a novel adversarial loss. Moreover, by incorporating the newly proposed multi-realism technique, our method allows the users to adjust the bit rate, distortion, and realism with a single model, achieving ultra-controllability. Unlike existing variable-rate generative NIC models, our method matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art single-rate generative NIC models while covering a wide range of bit rates using just one model.

- **Summary**: Video generative models are receiving particular attention given their ability to generate realistic and imaginative frames. Besides, these models are also observed to exhibit strong 3D consistency, significantly enhancing their potential to act as world simulators. In this work, we present Vidu4D, a novel reconstruction model that excels in accurately reconstructing 4D (i.e., sequential 3D) representations from single generated videos, addressing challenges associated with non-rigidity and frame distortion. This capability is pivotal for creating high-fidelity virtual contents that maintain both spatial and temporal coherence. At the core of Vidu4D is our proposed Dynamic Gaussian Surfels (DGS) technique. DGS optimizes time-varying warping functions to transform Gaussian surfels (surface elements) from a static state to a dynamically warped state. This transformation enables a precise depiction of motion and deformation over time. To preserve the structural integrity of surface-aligned Gaussian surfels, we design the warped-state geometric regularization based on continuous warping fields for estimating normals. Additionally, we learn refinements on rotation and scaling parameters of Gaussian surfels, which greatly alleviates texture flickering during the warping process and enhances the capture of fine-grained appearance details. Vidu4D also contains a novel initialization state that provides a proper start for the warping fields in DGS. Equipping Vidu4D with an existing video generative model, the overall framework demonstrates high-fidelity text-to-4D generation in both appearance and geometry.

- **Summary**: While text-to-image models have achieved impressive capabilities in image generation and editing, their application across various modalities often necessitates training separate models. Inspired by existing method of single image editing with self attention injection and video editing with shared attention, we propose a novel unified editing framework that combines the strengths of both approaches by utilizing only a basic 2D image text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model. Specifically, we design a sampling method that facilitates editing consecutive images while maintaining semantic consistency utilizing shared self-attention features during both reference and consecutive image sampling processes. Experimental results confirm that our method enables editing across diverse modalities including 3D scenes, videos, and panorama images.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in synthesizing photorealistic images of large-scale scenes. However, they are often plagued by a loss of fine details and long rendering durations. 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently been introduced as a potent alternative, achieving both high-fidelity visual results and accelerated rendering performance. Nonetheless, scaling 3D Gaussian Splatting is fraught with challenges. Specifically, large-scale scenes grapples with the integration of objects across multiple scales and disparate viewpoints, which often leads to compromised efficacy as the Gaussians need to balance between detail levels. Furthermore, the generation of initialization points via COLMAP from large-scale dataset is both computationally demanding and prone to incomplete reconstructions. To address these challenges, we present Pyramidal 3D Gaussian Splatting (PyGS) with NeRF Initialization. Our approach represent the scene with a hierarchical assembly of Gaussians arranged in a pyramidal fashion. The top level of the pyramid is composed of a few large Gaussians, while each subsequent layer accommodates a denser collection of smaller Gaussians. We effectively initialize these pyramidal Gaussians through sampling a rapidly trained grid-based NeRF at various frequencies. We group these pyramidal Gaussians into clusters and use a compact weighting network to dynamically determine the influence of each pyramid level of each cluster considering camera viewpoint during rendering. Our method achieves a significant performance leap across multiple large-scale datasets and attains a rendering time that is over 400 times faster than current state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Autoregressive next-token prediction is a standard pretraining method for large-scale language models, but its application to vision tasks is hindered by the non-sequential nature of image data, leading to cumulative errors. Most vision models employ masked autoencoder (MAE) based pretraining, which faces scalability issues. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{TokenUnify}, a novel pretraining method that integrates random token prediction, next-token prediction, and next-all token prediction. We provide theoretical evidence demonstrating that TokenUnify mitigates cumulative errors in visual autoregression. Cooperated with TokenUnify, we have assembled a large-scale electron microscopy (EM) image dataset with ultra-high resolution, ideal for creating spatially correlated long sequences. This dataset includes over 120 million annotated voxels, making it the largest neuron segmentation dataset to date and providing a unified benchmark for experimental validation. Leveraging the Mamba network inherently suited for long-sequence modeling on this dataset, TokenUnify not only reduces the computational complexity but also leads to a significant 45\% improvement in segmentation performance on downstream EM neuron segmentation tasks compared to existing methods. Furthermore, TokenUnify demonstrates superior scalability over MAE and traditional autoregressive methods, effectively bridging the gap between pretraining strategies for language and vision models.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal object detection in autonomous driving has achieved great breakthroughs due to the usage of fusing complementary information from different sensors. The calibration in fusion between sensors such as LiDAR and camera is always supposed to be precise in previous work. However, in reality, calibration matrices are fixed when the vehicles leave the factory, but vibration, bumps, and data lags may cause calibration bias. As the research on the calibration influence on fusion detection performance is relatively few, flexible calibration dependency multi-sensor detection method has always been attractive. In this paper, we conducted experiments on SOTA detection method EPNet++ and proved slight bias on calibration can reduce the performance seriously. We also proposed a re-calibration model based on semantic segmentation which can be combined with a detection algorithm to improve the performance and robustness of multi-modal calibration bias.

- **Summary**: In this work, we introduce a novel approach for creating controllable dynamics in 3D-generated Gaussians using casually captured reference videos. Our method transfers the motion of objects from reference videos to a variety of generated 3D Gaussians across different categories, ensuring precise and customizable motion transfer. We achieve this by employing blend skinning-based non-parametric shape reconstruction to extract the shape and motion of reference objects. This process involves segmenting the reference objects into motion-related parts based on skinning weights and establishing shape correspondences with generated target shapes. To address shape and temporal inconsistencies prevalent in existing methods, we integrate physical simulation, driving the target shapes with matched motion. This integration is optimized through a displacement loss to ensure reliable and genuine dynamics. Our approach supports diverse reference inputs, including humans, quadrupeds, and articulated objects, and can generate dynamics of arbitrary length, providing enhanced fidelity and applicability. Unlike methods heavily reliant on diffusion video generation models, our technique offers specific and high-quality motion transfer, maintaining both shape integrity and temporal consistency.

- **Summary**: In the field of medical image compression, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) networks have shown remarkable versatility due to their flexible compression ratios, yet they are constrained by a one-to-one fitting approach that results in lengthy encoding times. Our novel method, ``\textbf{UniCompress}'', innovatively extends the compression capabilities of INR by being the first to compress multiple medical data blocks using a single INR network. By employing wavelet transforms and quantization, we introduce a codebook containing frequency domain information as a prior input to the INR network. This enhances the representational power of INR and provides distinctive conditioning for different image blocks. Furthermore, our research introduces a new technique for the knowledge distillation of implicit representations, simplifying complex model knowledge into more manageable formats to improve compression ratios. Extensive testing on CT and electron microscopy (EM) datasets has demonstrated that UniCompress outperforms traditional INR methods and commercial compression solutions like HEVC, especially in complex and high compression scenarios. Notably, compared to existing INR techniques, UniCompress achieves a 4$\sim$5 times increase in compression speed, marking a significant advancement in the field of medical image compression. Codes will be publicly available.



### Estimating Depth of Monocular Panoramic Image with Teacher-Student Model Fusing Equirectangular and Spherical Representations

- **Summary**: Disconnectivity and distortion are the two problems which must be coped with when processing 360 degrees equirectangular images. In this paper, we propose a method of estimating the depth of monocular panoramic image with a teacher-student model fusing equirectangular and spherical representations. In contrast with the existing methods fusing an equirectangular representation with a cube map representation or tangent representation, a spherical representation is a better choice because a sampling on a sphere is more uniform and can also cope with distortion more effectively. In this processing, a novel spherical convolution kernel computing with sampling points on a sphere is developed to extract features from the spherical representation, and then, a Segmentation Feature Fusion(SFF) methodology is utilized to combine the features with ones extracted from the equirectangular representation. In contrast with the existing methods using a teacher-student model to obtain a lighter model of depth estimation, we use a teacher-student model to learn the latent features of depth images. This results in a trained model which estimates the depth map of an equirectangular image using not only the feature maps extracted from an input equirectangular image but also the distilled knowledge learnt from the ground truth of depth map of a training set. In experiments, the proposed method is tested on several well-known 360 monocular depth estimation benchmark datasets, and outperforms the existing methods for the most evaluation indexes.

- **Summary**: Gender bias in vision-language models (VLMs) can reinforce harmful stereotypes and discrimination. In this paper, we focus on mitigating gender bias towards vision-language tasks. We identify object hallucination as the essence of gender bias in VLMs. Existing VLMs tend to focus on salient or familiar attributes in images but ignore contextualized nuances. Moreover, most VLMs rely on the co-occurrence between specific objects and gender attributes to infer the ignored features, ultimately resulting in gender bias. We propose GAMA, a task-agnostic generation framework to mitigate gender bias. GAMA consists of two stages: narrative generation and answer inference. During narrative generation, GAMA yields all-sided but gender-obfuscated narratives, which prevents premature concentration on localized image features, especially gender attributes. During answer inference, GAMA integrates the image, generated narrative, and a task-specific question prompt to infer answers for different vision-language tasks. This approach allows the model to rethink gender attributes and answers. We conduct extensive experiments on GAMA, demonstrating its debiasing and generalization ability.

- **Summary**: Collaborative perception is dedicated to tackling the constraints of single-agent perception, such as occlusions, based on the multiple agents' multi-view sensor inputs. However, most existing works assume an ideal condition that all agents' multi-view cameras are continuously available. In reality, cameras may be highly noisy, obscured or even failed during the collaboration. In this work, we introduce a new robust camera-insensitivity problem: how to overcome the issues caused by the failed camera perspectives, while stabilizing high collaborative performance with low calibration cost? To address above problems, we propose RCDN, a Robust Camera-insensitivity collaborative perception with a novel Dynamic feature-based 3D Neural modeling mechanism. The key intuition of RCDN is to construct collaborative neural rendering field representations to recover failed perceptual messages sent by multiple agents. To better model collaborative neural rendering field, RCDN first establishes a geometry BEV feature based time-invariant static field with other agents via fast hash grid modeling. Based on the static background field, the proposed time-varying dynamic field can model corresponding motion vectors for foregrounds with appropriate positions. To validate RCDN, we create OPV2V-N, a new large-scale dataset with manual labelling under different camera failed scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted on OPV2V-N show that RCDN can be ported to other baselines and improve their robustness in extreme camera-insensitivity settings. Our code and datasets will be available soon.

- **Summary**: In the field of 3D object detection tasks, fusing heterogeneous features from LiDAR and camera sensors into a unified Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation is a widely adopted paradigm. However, existing methods are often compromised by imprecise sensor calibration, resulting in feature misalignment in LiDAR-camera BEV fusion. Moreover, such inaccuracies result in errors in depth estimation for the camera branch, ultimately causing misalignment between LiDAR and camera BEV features. In this work, we propose a novel ContrastAlign approach that utilizes contrastive learning to enhance the alignment of heterogeneous modalities, thereby improving the robustness of the fusion process. Specifically, our approach includes the L-Instance module, which directly outputs LiDAR instance features within LiDAR BEV features. Then, we introduce the C-Instance module, which predicts camera instance features through RoI (Region of Interest) pooling on the camera BEV features. We propose the InstanceFusion module, which utilizes contrastive learning to generate similar instance features across heterogeneous modalities. We then use graph matching to calculate the similarity between the neighboring camera instance features and the similarity instance features to complete the alignment of instance features. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an mAP of 70.3%, surpassing BEVFusion by 1.8% on the nuScenes validation set. Importantly, our method outperforms BEVFusion by 7.3% under conditions with misalignment noise.

- **Summary**: Deriving co-speech 3D gestures has seen tremendous progress in virtual avatar animation. Yet, the existing methods often produce stiff and unreasonable gestures with unseen human speech inputs due to the limited 3D speech-gesture data. In this paper, we propose CoCoGesture, a novel framework enabling vivid and diverse gesture synthesis from unseen human speech prompts. Our key insight is built upon the custom-designed pretrain-fintune training paradigm. At the pretraining stage, we aim to formulate a large generalizable gesture diffusion model by learning the abundant postures manifold. Therefore, to alleviate the scarcity of 3D data, we first construct a large-scale co-speech 3D gesture dataset containing more than 40M meshed posture instances across 4.3K speakers, dubbed GES-X. Then, we scale up the large unconditional diffusion model to 1B parameters and pre-train it to be our gesture experts. At the finetune stage, we present the audio ControlNet that incorporates the human voice as condition prompts to guide the gesture generation. Here, we construct the audio ControlNet through a trainable copy of our pre-trained diffusion model. Moreover, we design a novel Mixture-of-Gesture-Experts (MoGE) block to adaptively fuse the audio embedding from the human speech and the gesture features from the pre-trained gesture experts with a routing mechanism. Such an effective manner ensures audio embedding is temporal coordinated with motion features while preserving the vivid and diverse gesture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CoCoGesture outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the zero-shot speech-to-gesture generation. The dataset will be publicly available at: https://mattie-e.github.io/GES-X/

- **Summary**: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) systems can autonomously monitor and identify disturbances, reducing the need for manual labor and associated costs. However, current VAD systems are often limited by their superficial semantic understanding of scenes and minimal user interaction. Additionally, the prevalent data scarcity in existing datasets restricts their applicability in open-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Hawk, a novel framework that leverages interactive large Visual Language Models (VLM) to interpret video anomalies precisely. Recognizing the difference in motion information between abnormal and normal videos, Hawk explicitly integrates motion modality to enhance anomaly identification. To reinforce motion attention, we construct an auxiliary consistency loss within the motion and video space, guiding the video branch to focus on the motion modality. Moreover, to improve the interpretation of motion-to-language, we establish a clear supervisory relationship between motion and its linguistic representation. Furthermore, we have annotated over 8,000 anomaly videos with language descriptions, enabling effective training across diverse open-world scenarios, and also created 8,000 question-answering pairs for users' open-world questions. The final results demonstrate that Hawk achieves SOTA performance, surpassing existing baselines in both video description generation and question-answering. Our codes/dataset/demo will be released at https://github.com/jqtangust/hawk.

- **Summary**: Recently, the emergence of diffusion models has opened up new opportunities for single-view reconstruction. However, all the existing methods represent the target object as a closed mesh devoid of any structural information, thus neglecting the part-based structure, which is crucial for many downstream applications, of the reconstructed shape. Moreover, the generated meshes usually suffer from large noises, unsmooth surfaces, and blurry textures, making it challenging to obtain satisfactory part segments using 3D segmentation techniques. In this paper, we present Part123, a novel framework for part-aware 3D reconstruction from a single-view image. We first use diffusion models to generate multiview-consistent images from a given image, and then leverage Segment Anything Model (SAM), which demonstrates powerful generalization ability on arbitrary objects, to generate multiview segmentation masks. To effectively incorporate 2D part-based information into 3D reconstruction and handle inconsistency, we introduce contrastive learning into a neural rendering framework to learn a part-aware feature space based on the multiview segmentation masks. A clustering-based algorithm is also developed to automatically derive 3D part segmentation results from the reconstructed models. Experiments show that our method can generate 3D models with high-quality segmented parts on various objects. Compared to existing unstructured reconstruction methods, the part-aware 3D models from our method benefit some important applications, including feature-preserving reconstruction, primitive fitting, and 3D shape editing.

- **Summary**: Generating compact and sharply detailed 3D meshes poses a significant challenge for current 3D generative models. Different from extracting dense meshes from neural representation, some recent works try to model the native mesh distribution (i.e., a set of triangles), which generates more compact results as humans crafted. However, due to the complexity and variety of mesh topology, these methods are typically limited to small datasets with specific categories and are hard to extend. In this paper, we introduce a generic and scalable mesh generation framework PivotMesh, which makes an initial attempt to extend the native mesh generation to large-scale datasets. We employ a transformer-based auto-encoder to encode meshes into discrete tokens and decode them from face level to vertex level hierarchically. Subsequently, to model the complex typology, we first learn to generate pivot vertices as coarse mesh representation and then generate the complete mesh tokens with the same auto-regressive Transformer. This reduces the difficulty compared with directly modeling the mesh distribution and further improves the model controllability. PivotMesh demonstrates its versatility by effectively learning from both small datasets like Shapenet, and large-scale datasets like Objaverse and Objaverse-xl. Extensive experiments indicate that PivotMesh can generate compact and sharp 3D meshes across various categories, highlighting its great potential for native mesh modeling.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, generate highly realistic images from text descriptions. However, the generation of certain content at such high quality raises concerns. A prominent issue is the accurate depiction of identifiable facial images, which could lead to malicious deepfake generation and privacy violations. In this paper, we propose Anonymization Prompt Learning (APL) to address this problem. Specifically, we train a learnable prompt prefix for text-to-image diffusion models, which forces the model to generate anonymized facial identities, even when prompted to produce images of specific individuals. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the successful anonymization performance of APL, which anonymizes any specific individuals without compromising the quality of non-identity-specific image generation. Furthermore, we reveal the plug-and-play property of the learned prompt prefix, enabling its effective application across different pretrained text-to-image models for transferrable privacy and security protection against the risks of deepfakes.

- **Summary**: We provide results of our study on text-based 3D human motion retrieval and particularly focus on cross-dataset generalization. Due to practical reasons such as dataset-specific human body representations, existing works typically benchmarkby training and testing on partitions from the same dataset. Here, we employ a unified SMPL body format for all datasets, which allows us to perform training on one dataset, testing on the other, as well as training on a combination of datasets. Our results suggest that there exist dataset biases in standard text-motion benchmarks such as HumanML3D, KIT Motion-Language, and BABEL. We show that text augmentations help close the domain gap to some extent, but the gap remains. We further provide the first zero-shot action recognition results on BABEL, without using categorical action labels during training, opening up a new avenue for future research.

- **Summary**: Massive web-crawled image-text datasets lay the foundation for recent progress in multimodal learning. These datasets are designed with the goal of training a model to do well on standard computer vision benchmarks, many of which, however, have been shown to be English-centric (e.g., ImageNet). Consequently, existing data curation techniques gravitate towards using predominantly English image-text pairs and discard many potentially useful non-English samples. Our work questions this practice. Multilingual data is inherently enriching not only because it provides a gateway to learn about culturally salient concepts, but also because it depicts common concepts differently from monolingual data. We thus conduct a systematic study to explore the performance benefits of using more samples of non-English origins with respect to English vision tasks. By translating all multilingual image-text pairs from a raw web crawl to English and re-filtering them, we increase the prevalence of (translated) multilingual data in the resulting training set. Pre-training on this dataset outperforms using English-only or English-dominated datasets on ImageNet, ImageNet distribution shifts, image-English-text retrieval and on average across 38 tasks from the DataComp benchmark. On a geographically diverse task like GeoDE, we also observe improvements across all regions, with the biggest gain coming from Africa. In addition, we quantitatively show that English and non-English data are significantly different in both image and (translated) text space. We hope that our findings motivate future work to be more intentional about including multicultural and multilingual data, not just when non-English or geographically diverse tasks are involved, but to enhance model capabilities at large.

- **Summary**: While large multi-modal models (LMMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, their effectiveness in handling complex tasks has been limited by the prevailing single-step reasoning paradigm. To this end, this paper proposes VoCoT, a multi-step Visually grounded object-centric Chain-of-Thought reasoning framework tailored for inference with LMMs. VoCoT is characterized by two key features: (1) object-centric reasoning paths that revolve around cross-modal shared object-level information, and (2) visually grounded representation of object concepts in a multi-modal interleaved and aligned manner, which effectively bridges the modality gap within LMMs during long-term generation. Additionally, we construct an instruction dataset to facilitate LMMs in adapting to reasoning with VoCoT. By introducing VoCoT into the prevalent open-source LMM architecture, we introduce VolCano. With only 7B parameters and limited input resolution, VolCano demonstrates excellent performance across various scenarios, surpassing SOTA models, including GPT-4V, in tasks requiring complex reasoning. Our code, data and model will be available at https://github.com/RupertLuo/VoCoT.

- **Summary**: With the emergence of Gaussian Splats, recent efforts have focused on large-scale scene geometric reconstruction. However, most of these efforts either concentrate on memory reduction or spatial space division, neglecting information in the semantic space. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named SA-GS, for fine-grained 3D geometry reconstruction using semantic-aware 3D Gaussian Splats. Specifically, we leverage prior information stored in large vision models such as SAM and DINO to generate semantic masks. We then introduce a geometric complexity measurement function to serve as soft regularization, guiding the shape of each Gaussian Splat within specific semantic areas. Additionally, we present a method that estimates the expected number of Gaussian Splats in different semantic areas, effectively providing a lower bound for Gaussian Splats in these areas. Subsequently, we extract the point cloud using a novel probability density-based extraction method, transforming Gaussian Splats into a point cloud crucial for downstream tasks. Our method also offers the potential for detailed semantic inquiries while maintaining high image-based reconstruction results. We provide extensive experiments on publicly available large-scale scene reconstruction datasets with highly accurate point clouds as ground truth and our novel dataset. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our method over current state-of-the-art Gaussian Splats reconstruction methods by a significant margin in terms of geometric-based measurement metrics. Code and additional results will soon be available on our project page.

- **Summary**: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) focuses on identifying visual relationships within the spatial-temporal domain of videos. Conventional approaches often employ multi-stage pipelines, which typically consist of object detection, temporal association, and multi-relation classification. However, these methods exhibit inherent limitations due to the separation of multiple stages, and independent optimization of these sub-problems may yield sub-optimal solutions. To remedy these limitations, we propose a one-stage end-to-end framework, termed OED, which streamlines the DSGG pipeline. This framework reformulates the task as a set prediction problem and leverages pair-wise features to represent each subject-object pair within the scene graph. Moreover, another challenge of DSGG is capturing temporal dependencies, we introduce a Progressively Refined Module (PRM) for aggregating temporal context without the constraints of additional trackers or handcrafted trajectories, enabling end-to-end optimization of the network. Extensive experiments conducted on the Action Genome benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our design. The code and models are available at \url{https://github.com/guanw-pku/OED}.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) can utilize unlabeled data to enhance model performance. In recent years, with increasingly powerful generative models becoming available, a large number of synthetic images have been uploaded to public image sets. Therefore, when collecting unlabeled data from these sources, the inclusion of synthetic images is inevitable. This prompts us to consider the impact of unlabeled data mixed with real and synthetic images on SSL. In this paper, we set up a new task, Real and Synthetic hybrid SSL (RS-SSL), to investigate this problem. We discover that current SSL methods are unable to fully utilize synthetic data and are sometimes negatively affected. Then, by analyzing the issues caused by synthetic images, we propose a new SSL method, RSMatch, to tackle the RS-SSL problem. Extensive experimental results show that RSMatch can better utilize the synthetic data in unlabeled images to improve the SSL performance. The effectiveness is further verified through ablation studies and visualization.

- **Summary**: Monocular visual simultaneous localization and mapping (V-SLAM) is nowadays an irreplaceable tool in mobile robotics and augmented reality, where it performs robustly. However, human colonoscopies pose formidable challenges like occlusions, blur, light changes, lack of texture, deformation, water jets or tool interaction, which result in very frequent tracking losses. ORB-SLAM3, the top performing multiple-map V-SLAM, is unable to recover from them by merging sub-maps or relocalizing the camera, due to the poor performance of its place recognition algorithm based on ORB features and DBoW2 bag-of-words.   We present CudaSIFT-SLAM, the first V-SLAM system able to process complete human colonoscopies in real-time. To overcome the limitations of ORB-SLAM3, we use SIFT instead of ORB features and replace the DBoW2 direct index with the more computationally demanding brute-force matching, being able to successfully match images separated in time for relocation and map merging. Real-time performance is achieved thanks to CudaSIFT, a GPU implementation for SIFT extraction and brute-force matching.   We benchmark our system in the C3VD phantom colon dataset, and in a full real colonoscopy from the Endomapper dataset, demonstrating the capabilities to merge sub-maps and relocate in them, obtaining significantly longer sub-maps. Our system successfully maps in real-time 88 % of the frames in the C3VD dataset. In a real screening colonoscopy, despite the much higher prevalence of occluded and blurred frames, the mapping coverage is 53 % in carefully explored areas and 38 % in the full sequence, a 70 % improvement over ORB-SLAM3.

- **Summary**: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) calls for explanatory reasoning behind question answering over visual scenes. To achieve this goal, a model is required to provide an acceptable rationale as the reason for the predicted answers. Progress on the benchmark dataset stems largely from the recent advancement of Vision-Language Transformers (VL Transformers). These models are first pre-trained on some generic large-scale vision-text datasets, and then the learned representations are transferred to the downstream VCR task. Despite their attractive performance, this paper posits that the VL Transformers do not exhibit visual commonsense, which is the key to VCR. In particular, our empirical results pinpoint several shortcomings of existing VL Transformers: small gains from pre-training, unexpected language bias, limited model architecture for the two inseparable sub-tasks, and neglect of the important object-tag correlation. With these findings, we tentatively suggest some future directions from the aspect of dataset, evaluation metric, and training tricks. We believe this work could make researchers revisit the intuition and goals of VCR, and thus help tackle the remaining challenges in visual reasoning.

- **Summary**: Adversarial attacks on Face Recognition (FR) systems have proven highly effective in compromising pure FR models, yet adversarial examples may be ineffective to the complete FR systems as Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) models are often incorporated and can detect a significant number of them. To address this under-explored and essential problem, we propose a novel setting of adversarially attacking both FR and FAS models simultaneously, aiming to enhance the practicability of adversarial attacks on FR systems. In particular, we introduce a new attack method, namely Style-aligned Distribution Biasing (SDB), to improve the capacity of black-box attacks on both FR and FAS models. Specifically, our SDB framework consists of three key components. Firstly, to enhance the transferability of FAS models, we design a Distribution-aware Score Biasing module to optimize adversarial face examples away from the distribution of spoof images utilizing scores. Secondly, to mitigate the substantial style differences between live images and adversarial examples initialized with spoof images, we introduce an Instance Style Alignment module that aligns the style of adversarial examples with live images. In addition, to alleviate the conflicts between the gradients of FR and FAS models, we propose a Gradient Consistency Maintenance module to minimize disparities between the gradients using Hessian approximation. Extensive experiments showcase the superiority of our proposed attack method to state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.

- **Summary**: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a well-established functional imaging technique for diagnosing brain disorders. However, PET's high costs and radiation exposure limit its widespread use. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does not have these limitations. Although it also captures neurodegenerative changes, MRI is a less sensitive diagnostic tool than PET. To close this gap, we aim to generate synthetic PET from MRI. Herewith, we introduce PASTA, a novel pathology-aware image translation framework based on conditional diffusion models. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, PASTA excels in preserving both structural and pathological details in the target modality, which is achieved through its highly interactive dual-arm architecture and multi-modal condition integration. A cycle exchange consistency and volumetric generation strategy elevate PASTA's capability to produce high-quality 3D PET scans. Our qualitative and quantitative results confirm that the synthesized PET scans from PASTA not only reach the best quantitative scores but also preserve the pathology correctly. For Alzheimer's classification, the performance of synthesized scans improves over MRI by 4%, almost reaching the performance of actual PET. Code is available at https://github.com/ai-med/PASTA.

- **Summary**: We introduce the first zero-shot approach for Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS) based on pre-trained diffusion models. A growing research direction attempts to employ diffusion models to perform downstream vision tasks by exploiting their deep understanding of image semantics. Yet, the majority of these approaches have focused on image-related tasks like semantic correspondence and segmentation, with less emphasis on video tasks such as VSS. Ideally, diffusion-based image semantic segmentation approaches can be applied to videos in a frame-by-frame manner. However, we find their performance on videos to be subpar due to the absence of any modeling of temporal information inherent in the video data. To this end, we tackle this problem and introduce a framework tailored for VSS based on pre-trained image and video diffusion models. We propose building a scene context model based on the diffusion features, where the model is autoregressively updated to adapt to scene changes. This context model predicts per-frame coarse segmentation maps that are temporally consistent. To refine these maps further, we propose a correspondence-based refinement strategy that aggregates predictions temporally, resulting in more confident predictions. Finally, we introduce a masked modulation approach to upsample the coarse maps to the full resolution at a high quality. Experiments show that our proposed approach outperforms existing zero-shot image semantic segmentation approaches significantly on various VSS benchmarks without any training or fine-tuning. Moreover, it rivals supervised VSS approaches on the VSPW dataset despite not being explicitly trained for VSS.

- **Summary**: Real-time analysis of Martian craters is crucial for mission-critical operations, including safe landings and geological exploration. This work leverages the latest breakthroughs for on-the-edge crater detection aboard spacecraft. We rigorously benchmark several YOLO networks using a Mars craters dataset, analyzing their performance on embedded systems with a focus on optimization for low-power devices. We optimize this process for a new wave of cost-effective, commercial-off-the-shelf-based smaller satellites. Implementations on diverse platforms, including Google Coral Edge TPU, AMD Versal SoC VCK190, Nvidia Jetson Nano and Jetson AGX Orin, undergo a detailed trade-off analysis. Our findings identify optimal network-device pairings, enhancing the feasibility of crater detection on resource-constrained hardware and setting a new precedent for efficient and resilient extraterrestrial imaging.

- **Summary**: Alzheimer's disease is one of the most incisive illnesses among the neurodegenerative ones, and it causes a progressive decline in cognitive abilities that, in the worst cases, becomes severe enough to interfere with daily life. Currently, there is no cure, so an early diagnosis is strongly needed to try and slow its progression through medical treatments. Handwriting analysis is considered a potential tool for detecting and understanding certain neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease. While handwriting analysis alone cannot provide a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's, it may offer some insights and be used for a comprehensive assessment. The Sigma-lognormal model is conceived for movement analysis and can also be applied to handwriting. This model returns a set of lognormal parameters as output, which forms the basis for the computation of novel and significant features. This paper presents a machine learning approach applied to handwriting features extracted through the sigma-lognormal model. The aim is to develop a support system to help doctors in the diagnosis and study of Alzheimer, evaluate the effectiveness of the extracted features and finally study the relation among them.

- **Summary**: There has been a recent surge of interest in learning to perceive depth from monocular videos in an unsupervised fashion. A key challenge in this field is achieving robust and accurate depth estimation in challenging scenarios, particularly in regions with weak textures or where dynamic objects are present. This study makes three major contributions by delving deeply into dense correspondence priors to provide existing frameworks with explicit geometric constraints. The first novelty is a contextual-geometric depth consistency loss, which employs depth maps triangulated from dense correspondences based on estimated ego-motion to guide the learning of depth perception from contextual information, since explicitly triangulated depth maps capture accurate relative distances among pixels. The second novelty arises from the observation that there exists an explicit, deducible relationship between optical flow divergence and depth gradient. A differential property correlation loss is, therefore, designed to refine depth estimation with a specific emphasis on local variations. The third novelty is a bidirectional stream co-adjustment strategy that enhances the interaction between rigid and optical flows, encouraging the former towards more accurate correspondence and making the latter more adaptable across various scenarios under the static scene hypotheses. DCPI-Depth, a framework that incorporates all these innovative components and couples two bidirectional and collaborative streams, achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizability across multiple public datasets, outperforming all existing prior arts. Specifically, it demonstrates accurate depth estimation in texture-less and dynamic regions, and shows more reasonable smoothness.

- **Summary**: To ensure safe operation of autonomous vehicles in complex urban environments, complete perception of the environment is necessary. However, due to environmental conditions, sensor limitations, and occlusions, this is not always possible from a single point of view. To address this issue, collective perception is an effective method. Realistic and large-scale datasets are essential for training and evaluating collective perception methods. This paper provides the first comprehensive technical review of collective perception datasets in the context of autonomous driving. The survey analyzes existing V2V and V2X datasets, categorizing them based on different criteria such as sensor modalities, environmental conditions, and scenario variety. The focus is on their applicability for the development of connected automated vehicles. This study aims to identify the key criteria of all datasets and to present their strengths, weaknesses, and anomalies. Finally, this survey concludes by making recommendations regarding which dataset is most suitable for collective 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: In seismic exploration, identifying the first break (FB) is a critical component in establishing subsurface velocity models. Various automatic picking techniques based on deep neural networks have been developed to expedite this procedure. The most popular class is using semantic segmentation networks to pick on a shot gather called 2-dimensional (2-D) picking. Generally, 2-D segmentation-based picking methods input an image of a shot gather, and output a binary segmentation map, in which the maximum of each column is the location of FB. However, current designed segmentation networks is difficult to ensure the horizontal continuity of the segmentation. Additionally, FB jumps also exist in some areas, and it is not easy for current networks to detect such jumps. Therefore, it is important to pick as much as possible and ensure horizontal continuity. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel semantic segmentation network for the 2-D seismic FB picking task, where we introduce the dynamic snake convolution into U-Net and call the new segmentation network dynamic-snake U-Net (DSU-Net). Specifically, we develop original dynamic-snake convolution (DSConv) in CV and propose a novel DSConv module, which can extract the horizontal continuous feature in the shallow feature of the shot gather. Many experiments have shown that DSU-Net demonstrates higher accuracy and robustness than the other 2-D segmentation-based models, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in 2-D seismic field surveys. Particularly, it can effectively detect FB jumps and better ensure the horizontal continuity of FB. In addition, the ablation experiment and the anti-noise experiment, respectively, verify the optimal structure of the DSConv module and the robustness of the picking.

- **Summary**: In the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) field, agents are tasked with navigating real-world scenes guided by linguistic instructions. Enabling the agent to adhere to instructions throughout the process of navigation represents a significant challenge within the domain of VLN. To address this challenge, common approaches often rely on encoders to explicitly record past locations and actions, increasing model complexity and resource consumption. Our proposal, the Vision-and-Language Navigation Generative Pretrained Transformer (VLN-GPT), adopts a transformer decoder model (GPT2) to model trajectory sequence dependencies, bypassing the need for historical encoding modules. This method allows for direct historical information access through trajectory sequence, enhancing efficiency. Furthermore, our model separates the training process into offline pre-training with imitation learning and online fine-tuning with reinforcement learning. This distinction allows for more focused training objectives and improved performance. Performance assessments on the VLN dataset reveal that VLN-GPT surpasses complex state-of-the-art encoder-based models.

- **Summary**: Noisy correspondence that refers to mismatches in cross-modal data pairs, is prevalent on human-annotated or web-crawled datasets. Prior approaches to leverage such data mainly consider the application of uni-modal noisy label learning without amending the impact on both cross-modal and intra-modal geometrical structures in multimodal learning. Actually, we find that both structures are effective to discriminate noisy correspondence through structural differences when being well-established. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a Geometrical Structure Consistency (GSC) method to infer the true correspondence. Specifically, GSC ensures the preservation of geometrical structures within and between modalities, allowing for the accurate discrimination of noisy samples based on structural differences. Utilizing these inferred true correspondence labels, GSC refines the learning of geometrical structures by filtering out the noisy samples. Experiments across four cross-modal datasets confirm that GSC effectively identifies noisy samples and significantly outperforms the current leading methods.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based fault detection methods have achieved significant success. In visual fault detection of freight trains, there exists a large characteristic difference between inter-class components (scale variance) but intra-class on the contrary, which entails scale-awareness for detectors. Moreover, the design of task-specific networks heavily relies on human expertise. As a consequence, neural architecture search (NAS) that automates the model design process gains considerable attention because of its promising performance. However, NAS is computationally intensive due to the large search space and huge data volume. In this work, we propose an efficient NAS-based framework for visual fault detection of freight trains to search for the task-specific detection head with capacities of multi-scale representation. First, we design a scale-aware search space for discovering an effective receptive field in the head. Second, we explore the robustness of data volume to reduce search costs based on the specifically designed search space, and a novel sharing strategy is proposed to reduce memory and further improve search efficiency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with data volume robustness, which achieves 46.8 and 47.9 mAP on the Bottom View and Side View datasets, respectively. Our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and linearly decreases the search costs with reduced data volumes.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs) have demonstrated promising potential in terms of generalization and robustness when applied to different modalities. While previous works have already achieved 3D human motion generation using various approaches including language modeling, they mostly % are mostly carefully designed use specialized architecture and are restricted to single-human motion generation. Inspired by the success of MM-LLMs, we propose MotionLLM, a simple and general framework that can achieve single-human, multi-human motion generation, and motion captioning by fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. Specifically, we encode and quantize motions into discrete LLM-understandable tokens, which results in a unified vocabulary consisting of both motion and text tokens. With only 1--3% parameters of the LLMs trained by using adapters, our single-human motion generation achieves comparable results to those diffusion models and other trained-from-scratch transformer-based models. Additionally, we show that our approach is scalable and flexible, allowing easy extension to multi-human motion generation through autoregressive generation of single-human motions.

- **Summary**: Continuous diffusion models have demonstrated their effectiveness in addressing the inherent uncertainty and indeterminacy in monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE). Despite their strengths, the need for large search spaces and the corresponding demand for substantial training data make these models prone to generating biomechanically unrealistic poses. This challenge is particularly noticeable in occlusion scenarios, where the complexity of inferring 3D structures from 2D images intensifies. In response to these limitations, we introduce the Discrete Diffusion Pose ($\text{Di}^2\text{Pose}$), a novel framework designed for occluded 3D HPE that capitalizes on the benefits of a discrete diffusion model. Specifically, $\text{Di}^2\text{Pose}$ employs a two-stage process: it first converts 3D poses into a discrete representation through a \emph{pose quantization step}, which is subsequently modeled in latent space through a \emph{discrete diffusion process}. This methodological innovation restrictively confines the search space towards physically viable configurations and enhances the model's capability to comprehend how occlusions affect human pose within the latent space. Extensive evaluations conducted on various benchmarks (e.g., Human3.6M, 3DPW, and 3DPW-Occ) have demonstrated its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is proposed to continually learn from novel classes with only a few samples after the (pre-)training on base classes with sufficient data. However, this remains a challenge. In contrast, humans can easily recognize novel classes with a few samples. Cognitive science demonstrates that an important component of such human capability is compositional learning. This involves identifying visual primitives from learned knowledge and then composing new concepts using these transferred primitives, making incremental learning both effective and interpretable. To imitate human compositional learning, we propose a cognitive-inspired method for the FSCIL task. We define and build a compositional model based on set similarities, and then equip it with a primitive composition module and a primitive reuse module. In the primitive composition module, we propose to utilize the Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity to approximate the similarity between primitive sets, allowing the training and evaluation based on primitive compositions. In the primitive reuse module, we enhance primitive reusability by classifying inputs based on primitives replaced with the closest primitives from other classes. Experiments on three datasets validate our method, showing it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods with improved interpretability. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zoilsen/Comp-FSCIL.

- **Summary**: Variational approaches to disparity estimation typically use a linearised brightness constancy constraint, which only applies in smooth regions and over small distances. Accordingly, current variational approaches rely on a schedule to progressively include image data. This paper proposes the use of Gradient Consistency information to assess the validity of the linearisation; this information is used to determine the weights applied to the data term as part of an analytically inspired Gradient Consistency Model. The Gradient Consistency Model penalises the data term for view pairs that have a mismatch between the spatial gradients in the source view and the spatial gradients in the target view. Instead of relying on a tuned or learned schedule, the Gradient Consistency Model is self-scheduling, since the weights evolve as the algorithm progresses. We show that the Gradient Consistency Model outperforms standard coarse-to-fine schemes and the recently proposed progressive inclusion of views approach in both rate of convergence and accuracy.

- **Summary**: We present a novel synthetically generated multi-modal dataset, SCaRL, to enable the training and validation of autonomous driving solutions. Multi-modal datasets are essential to attain the robustness and high accuracy required by autonomous systems in applications such as autonomous driving. As deep learning-based solutions are becoming more prevalent for object detection, classification, and tracking tasks, there is great demand for datasets combining camera, lidar, and radar sensors. Existing real/synthetic datasets for autonomous driving lack synchronized data collection from a complete sensor suite. SCaRL provides synchronized Synthetic data from RGB, semantic/instance, and depth Cameras; Range-Doppler-Azimuth/Elevation maps and raw data from Radar; and 3D point clouds/2D maps of semantic, depth and Doppler data from coherent Lidar. SCaRL is a large dataset based on the CARLA Simulator, which provides data for diverse, dynamic scenarios and traffic conditions. SCaRL is the first dataset to include synthetic synchronized data from coherent Lidar and MIMO radar sensors.   The dataset can be accessed here: https://fhr-ihs-sva.pages.fraunhofer.de/asp/scarl/

- **Summary**: Existing 3D occupancy networks demand significant hardware resources, hindering the deployment of edge devices. Binarized Neural Networks (BNN) offer substantially reduced computational and memory requirements. However, their performance decreases notably compared to full-precision networks. Moreover, it is challenging to enhance the performance of binarized models by increasing the number of binarized convolutional layers, which limits their practicability for 3D occupancy prediction. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel binarized deep convolution (BDC) unit that effectively enhances performance while increasing the number of binarized convolutional layers. Firstly, through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that 1 \times 1 binarized convolutions introduce minimal binarization errors. Therefore, additional binarized convolutional layers are constrained to 1 \times 1 in the BDC unit. Secondly, we introduce the per-channel weight branch to mitigate the impact of binarization errors from unimportant channel features on the performance of binarized models, thereby improving performance while increasing the number of binarized convolutional layers. Furthermore, we decompose the 3D occupancy network into four convolutional modules and utilize the proposed BDC unit to binarize these modules. Our BDC-Occ model is created by applying the proposed BDC unit to binarize the existing 3D occupancy networks. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed BDC-Occ is the state-of-the-art binarized 3D occupancy network algorithm.

- **Summary**: Inspired by the software industry's practice of offering different editions or versions of a product tailored to specific user groups or use cases, we propose a novel task, namely, training-free editioning, for text-to-image models. Specifically, we aim to create variations of a base text-to-image model without retraining, enabling the model to cater to the diverse needs of different user groups or to offer distinct features and functionalities. To achieve this, we propose that different editions of a given text-to-image model can be formulated as concept subspaces in the latent space of its text encoder (e.g., CLIP). In such a concept subspace, all points satisfy a specific user need (e.g., generating images of a cat lying on the grass/ground/falling leaves). Technically, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to obtain the desired concept subspaces from representative text embedding that correspond to a specific user need or requirement. Projecting the text embedding of a given prompt into these low-dimensional subspaces enables efficient model editioning without retraining. Intuitively, our proposed editioning paradigm enables a service provider to customize the base model into its "cat edition" (or other editions) that restricts image generation to cats, regardless of the user's prompt (e.g., dogs, people, etc.). This introduces a new dimension for product differentiation, targeted functionality, and pricing strategies, unlocking novel business models for text-to-image generators. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach and its potential to enable a wide range of customized text-to-image model editions across various domains and applications.

- **Summary**: Despite significant progress has been made in image deraining, existing approaches are mostly carried out on low-resolution images. The effectiveness of these methods on high-resolution images is still unknown, especially for ultra-high-definition (UHD) images, given the continuous advancement of imaging devices. In this paper, we focus on the task of UHD image deraining, and contribute the first large-scale UHD image deraining dataset, 4K-Rain13k, that contains 13,000 image pairs at 4K resolution. Based on this dataset, we conduct a benchmark study on existing methods for processing UHD images. Furthermore, we develop an effective and efficient vision MLP-based architecture (UDR-Mixer) to better solve this task. Specifically, our method contains two building components: a spatial feature rearrangement layer that captures long-range information of UHD images, and a frequency feature modulation layer that facilitates high-quality UHD image reconstruction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining a lower model complexity. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/cschenxiang/UDR-Mixer.

- **Summary**: The success of the text-guided diffusion model has inspired the development and release of numerous powerful diffusion models within the open-source community. These models are typically fine-tuned on various expert datasets, showcasing diverse denoising capabilities. Leveraging multiple high-quality models to produce stronger generation ability is valuable, but has not been extensively studied. Existing methods primarily adopt parameter merging strategies to produce a new static model. However, they overlook the fact that the divergent denoising capabilities of the models may dynamically change across different states, such as when experiencing different prompts, initial noises, denoising steps, and spatial locations. In this paper, we propose a novel ensembling method, Adaptive Feature Aggregation (AFA), which dynamically adjusts the contributions of multiple models at the feature level according to various states (i.e., prompts, initial noises, denoising steps, and spatial locations), thereby keeping the advantages of multiple diffusion models, while suppressing their disadvantages. Specifically, we design a lightweight Spatial-Aware Block-Wise (SABW) feature aggregator that adaptive aggregates the block-wise intermediate features from multiple U-Net denoisers into a unified one. The core idea lies in dynamically producing an individual attention map for each model's features by comprehensively considering various states. It is worth noting that only SABW is trainable with about 50 million parameters, while other models are frozen. Both the quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Adaptive Feature Aggregation method. The code is available at https://github.com/tenvence/afa/.

- **Summary**: The neural radiance field (NeRF) has made significant strides in representing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views. Despite its advancements, the high computational costs of NeRF have posed challenges for its deployment in resource-constrained environments and real-time applications. As an alternative to NeRF-like neural rendering methods, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers rapid rendering speeds while maintaining excellent image quality. However, as it represents objects and scenes using a myriad of Gaussians, it requires substantial storage to achieve high-quality representation. To mitigate the storage overhead, we propose Factorized 3D Gaussian Splatting (F-3DGS), a novel approach that drastically reduces storage requirements while preserving image quality. Inspired by classical matrix and tensor factorization techniques, our method represents and approximates dense clusters of Gaussians with significantly fewer Gaussians through efficient factorization. We aim to efficiently represent dense 3D Gaussians by approximating them with a limited amount of information for each axis and their combinations. This method allows us to encode a substantially large number of Gaussians along with their essential attributes -- such as color, scale, and rotation -- necessary for rendering using a relatively small number of elements. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that F-3DGS achieves a significant reduction in storage costs while maintaining comparable quality in rendered images.

- **Summary**: While a number of promising uncertainty quantification methods have been proposed to address the prevailing shortcomings of deep neural networks like overconfidence and lack of explainability, quantifying predictive uncertainties in the context of joint semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation has not been explored yet. Since many real-world applications are multi-modal in nature and, hence, have the potential to benefit from multi-task learning, this is a substantial gap in current literature. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive series of experiments to study how multi-task learning influences the quality of uncertainty estimates in comparison to solving both tasks separately.

- **Summary**: Surround-view depth estimation is a crucial task aims to acquire the depth maps of the surrounding views. It has many applications in real world scenarios such as autonomous driving, AR/VR and 3D reconstruction, etc. However, given that most of the data in the autonomous driving dataset is collected in daytime scenarios, this leads to poor depth model performance in the face of out-of-distribution(OoD) data. While some works try to improve the robustness of depth model under OoD data, these methods either require additional training data or lake generalizability. In this report, we introduce the DINO-SD, a novel surround-view depth estimation model. Our DINO-SD does not need additional data and has strong robustness. Our DINO-SD get the best performance in the track4 of ICRA 2024 RoboDepth Challenge.

- **Summary**: Visual grounding is an essential tool that links user-provided text queries with query-specific regions within an image. Despite advancements in visual grounding models, their ability to comprehend complex queries remains limited. To overcome this limitation, we introduce LLM-Optic, an innovative method that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) as an optical lens to enhance existing visual grounding models in comprehending complex text queries involving intricate text structures, multiple objects, or object spatial relationships, situations that current models struggle with. LLM-Optic first employs an LLM as a Text Grounder to interpret complex text queries and accurately identify objects the user intends to locate. Then a pre-trained visual grounding model is used to generate candidate bounding boxes given the refined query by the Text Grounder. After that, LLM-Optic annotates the candidate bounding boxes with numerical marks to establish a connection between text and specific image regions, thereby linking two distinct modalities. Finally, it employs a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a Visual Grounder to select the marked candidate objects that best correspond to the original text query. Through LLM-Optic, we have achieved universal visual grounding, which allows for the detection of arbitrary objects specified by arbitrary human language input. Importantly, our method achieves this enhancement without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across various challenging benchmarks demonstrate that LLM-Optic achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot visual grounding capabilities.

- **Summary**: Insufficient prior knowledge of a captured hyperspectral image (HSI) scene may lead the experts or the automatic labeling systems to offer incorrect labels or ambiguous labels (i.e., assigning each training sample to a group of candidate labels, among which only one of them is valid; this is also known as partial label learning) during the labeling process. Accordingly, how to learn from such data with ambiguous labels is a problem of great practical importance. In this paper, we propose a novel superpixelwise low-rank approximation (LRA)-based partial label learning method, namely SLAP, which is the first to take into account partial label learning in HSI classification. SLAP is mainly composed of two phases: disambiguating the training labels and acquiring the predictive model. Specifically, in the first phase, we propose a superpixelwise LRA-based model, preparing the affinity graph for the subsequent label propagation process while extracting the discriminative representation to enhance the following classification task of the second phase. Then to disambiguate the training labels, label propagation propagates the labeling information via the affinity graph of training pixels. In the second phase, we take advantage of the resulting disambiguated training labels and the discriminative representations to enhance the classification performance. The extensive experiments validate the advantage of the proposed SLAP method over state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Social VR platforms enable social, economic, and creative activities by allowing users to create and share their own virtual spaces. In social VR, photography within a VR scene is an important indicator of visitors' activities. Although automatic identification of photo spots within a VR scene can facilitate the process of creating a VR scene and enhance the visitor experience, there are challenges in quantitatively evaluating photos taken in the VR scene and efficiently exploring the large VR scene. We propose PanoTree, an automated photo-spot explorer in VR scenes. To assess the aesthetics of images captured in VR scenes, a deep scoring network is trained on a large dataset of photos collected by a social VR platform to determine whether humans are likely to take similar photos. Furthermore, we propose a Hierarchical Optimistic Optimization (HOO)-based search algorithm to efficiently explore 3D VR spaces with the reward from the scoring network. Our user study shows that the scoring network achieves human-level performance in distinguishing randomly taken images from those taken by humans. In addition, we show applications using the explored photo spots, such as automatic thumbnail generation, support for VR world creation, and visitor flow planning within a VR scene.

- **Summary**: Sample selection is the most straightforward technique to combat label noise, aiming to distinguish mislabeled samples during training and avoid the degradation of the robustness of the model. In the workflow, $\textit{selecting possibly clean data}$ and $\textit{model update}$ are iterative. However, their interplay and intrinsic characteristics hinder the robustness and efficiency of learning with noisy labels: 1) The model chooses clean data with selection bias, leading to the accumulated error in the model update. 2) Most selection strategies leverage partner networks or supplementary information to mitigate label corruption, albeit with increased computation resources and lower throughput speed. Therefore, we employ only one network with the jump manner update to decouple the interplay and mine more semantic information from the loss for a more precise selection. Specifically, the selection of clean data for each model update is based on one of the prior models, excluding the last iteration. The strategy of model update exhibits a jump behavior in the form. Moreover, we map the outputs of the network and labels into the same semantic feature space, respectively. In this space, a detailed and simple loss distribution is generated to distinguish clean samples more effectively. Our proposed approach achieves almost up to $2.53\times$ speedup, $0.46\times$ peak memory footprint, and superior robustness over state-of-the-art works with various noise settings.

- **Summary**: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) stands out as a prominent method for image representation learning. Various architectures, from vision transformers (ViTs) to convolutional networks (ResNets) have been trained with CLIP to serve as general solutions to diverse vision tasks. This paper explores the differences across various CLIP-trained vision backbones. Despite using the same data and training objective, we find that these architectures have notably different representations, different classification performance across datasets, and different robustness properties to certain types of image perturbations. Our findings indicate a remarkable possible synergy across backbones by leveraging their respective strengths. In principle, classification accuracy could be improved by over 40 percentage with an informed selection of the optimal backbone per test example.Using this insight, we develop a straightforward yet powerful approach to adaptively ensemble multiple backbones. The approach uses as few as one labeled example per class to tune the adaptive combination of backbones. On a large collection of datasets, the method achieves a remarkable increase in accuracy of up to 39.1% over the best single backbone, well beyond traditional ensembles

- **Summary**: Research on multi-view stereo based on remote sensing images has promoted the development of large-scale urban 3D reconstruction. However, remote sensing multi-view image data suffers from the problems of occlusion and uneven brightness between views during acquisition, which leads to the problem of blurred details in depth estimation. To solve the above problem, we re-examine the deformable learning method in the Multi-View Stereo task and propose a novel paradigm based on view Space and Depth deformable Learning (SDL-MVS), aiming to learn deformable interactions of features in different view spaces and deformably model the depth ranges and intervals to enable high accurate depth estimation. Specifically, to solve the problem of view noise caused by occlusion and uneven brightness, we propose a Progressive Space deformable Sampling (PSS) mechanism, which performs deformable learning of sampling points in the 3D frustum space and the 2D image space in a progressive manner to embed source features to the reference feature adaptively. To further optimize the depth, we introduce Depth Hypothesis deformable Discretization (DHD), which achieves precise positioning of the depth prior by adaptively adjusting the depth range hypothesis and performing deformable discretization of the depth interval hypothesis. Finally, our SDL-MVS achieves explicit modeling of occlusion and uneven brightness faced in multi-view stereo through the deformable learning paradigm of view space and depth, achieving accurate multi-view depth estimation. Extensive experiments on LuoJia-MVS and WHU datasets show that our SDL-MVS reaches state-of-the-art performance. It is worth noting that our SDL-MVS achieves an MAE error of 0.086, an accuracy of 98.9% for <0.6m, and 98.9% for <3-interval on the LuoJia-MVS dataset under the premise of three views as input.

- **Summary**: X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) is one of the most important diagnostic imaging techniques in clinical applications. Sparse-view CT imaging reduces the number of projection views to a lower radiation dose and alleviates the potential risk of radiation exposure. Most existing deep learning (DL) and deep unfolding sparse-view CT reconstruction methods: 1) do not fully use the projection data; 2) do not always link their architecture designs to a mathematical theory; 3) do not flexibly deal with multi-sparse-view reconstruction assignments. This paper aims to use mathematical ideas and design optimal DL imaging algorithms for sparse-view tomography reconstructions. We propose a novel dual-domain deep unfolding unified framework that offers a great deal of flexibility for multi-sparse-view CT reconstruction with different sampling views through a single model. This framework combines the theoretical advantages of model-based methods with the superior reconstruction performance of DL-based methods, resulting in the expected generalizability of DL. We propose a refinement module that utilizes unfolding projection domain to refine full-sparse-view projection errors, as well as an image domain correction module that distills multi-scale geometric error corrections to reconstruct sparse-view CT. This provides us with a new way to explore the potential of projection information and a new perspective on designing network architectures. All parameters of our proposed framework are learnable end to end, and our method possesses the potential to be applied to plug-and-play reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework is superior to other existing state-of-the-art methods. Our source codes are available at https://github.com/fanxiaohong/MVMS-RCN.

- **Summary**: This study investigates whether Compressed-Language Models (CLMs), i.e. language models operating on raw byte streams from Compressed File Formats~(CFFs), can understand files compressed by CFFs. We focus on the JPEG format as a representative CFF, given its commonality and its representativeness of key concepts in compression, such as entropy coding and run-length encoding. We test if CLMs understand the JPEG format by probing their capabilities to perform along three axes: recognition of inherent file properties, handling of files with anomalies, and generation of new files. Our findings demonstrate that CLMs can effectively perform these tasks. These results suggest that CLMs can understand the semantics of compressed data when directly operating on the byte streams of files produced by CFFs. The possibility to directly operate on raw compressed files offers the promise to leverage some of their remarkable characteristics, such as their ubiquity, compactness, multi-modality and segment-nature.

- **Summary**: The pre-trained point cloud model based on Masked Point Modeling (MPM) has exhibited substantial improvements across various tasks. However, these models heavily rely on the Transformer, leading to quadratic complexity and limited decoder, hindering their practice application. To address this limitation, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of existing Transformer-based MPM, emphasizing the idea that redundancy reduction is crucial for point cloud analysis. To this end, we propose a Locally constrained Compact point cloud Model (LCM) consisting of a locally constrained compact encoder and a locally constrained Mamba-based decoder. Our encoder replaces self-attention with our local aggregation layers to achieve an elegant balance between performance and efficiency. Considering the varying information density between masked and unmasked patches in the decoder inputs of MPM, we introduce a locally constrained Mamba-based decoder. This decoder ensures linear complexity while maximizing the perception of point cloud geometry information from unmasked patches with higher information density. Extensive experimental results show that our compact model significantly surpasses existing Transformer-based models in both performance and efficiency, especially our LCM-based Point-MAE model, compared to the Transformer-based model, achieved an improvement of 2.24%, 0.87%, and 0.94% in performance on the three variants of ScanObjectNN while reducing parameters by 88% and computation by 73%.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models significantly improve the quality of super-resolved images with their impressive content generation capabilities. However, the huge computational costs limit the applications of these methods.Recent efforts have explored reasonable inference acceleration to reduce the number of sampling steps, but the computational cost remains high as each step is performed on the entire image.This paper introduces PatchScaler, a patch-independent diffusion-based single image super-resolution (SR) method, designed to enhance the efficiency of the inference process.The proposed method is motivated by the observation that not all the image patches within an image need the same sampling steps for reconstructing high-resolution images.Based on this observation, we thus develop a Patch-adaptive Group Sampling (PGS) to divide feature patches into different groups according to the patch-level reconstruction difficulty and dynamically assign an appropriate sampling configuration for each group so that the inference speed can be better accelerated.In addition, to improve the denoising ability at each step of the sampling, we develop a texture prompt to guide the estimations of the diffusion model by retrieving high-quality texture priors from a patch-independent reference texture memory.Experiments show that our PatchScaler achieves favorable performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations with fast inference speed.Our code and model are available at \url{https://github.com/yongliuy/PatchScaler}.

- **Summary**: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) plays a vital role in clinical applications by mitigating radiation risks. Nevertheless, reducing radiation doses significantly degrades image quality. Concurrently, common deep learning methods demand extensive data, posing concerns about privacy, cost, and time constraints. Consequently, we propose a few-shot low-dose CT reconstruction method using Partitioned Hankel-based Diffusion (PHD) models. During the prior learning stage, the projection data is first transformed into multiple partitioned Hankel matrices. Structured tensors are then extracted from these matrices to facilitate prior learning through multiple diffusion models. In the iterative reconstruction stage, an iterative stochastic differential equation solver is employed along with data consistency constraints to update the acquired projection data. Furthermore, penalized weighted least-squares and total variation techniques are introduced to enhance the resulting image quality. The results approximate those of normal-dose counterparts, validating PHD model as an effective and practical model for reducing artifacts and noise while preserving image quality.

- **Summary**: The vulnerability of neural network classifiers to adversarial attacks is a major obstacle to their deployment in safety-critical applications. Regularization of network parameters during training can be used to improve adversarial robustness and generalization performance. Usually, the network is regularized end-to-end, with parameters at all layers affected by regularization. However, in settings where learning representations is key, such as self-supervised learning (SSL), layers after the feature representation will be discarded when performing inference. For these models, regularizing up to the feature space is more suitable. To this end, we propose a new spectral regularizer for representation learning that encourages black-box adversarial robustness in downstream classification tasks. In supervised classification settings, we show empirically that this method is more effective in boosting test accuracy and robustness than previously-proposed methods that regularize all layers of the network. We then show that this method improves the adversarial robustness of classifiers using representations learned with self-supervised training or transferred from another classification task. In all, our work begins to unveil how representational structure affects adversarial robustness.

- **Summary**: Humans naturally retain memories of permanent elements, while ephemeral moments often slip through the cracks of memory. This selective retention is crucial for robotic perception, localization, and mapping. To endow robots with this capability, we introduce 3D Gaussian Mapping (3DGM), a self-supervised, camera-only offline mapping framework grounded in 3D Gaussian Splatting. 3DGM converts multitraverse RGB videos from the same region into a Gaussian-based environmental map while concurrently performing 2D ephemeral object segmentation. Our key observation is that the environment remains consistent across traversals, while objects frequently change. This allows us to exploit self-supervision from repeated traversals to achieve environment-object decomposition. More specifically, 3DGM formulates multitraverse environmental mapping as a robust differentiable rendering problem, treating pixels of the environment and objects as inliers and outliers, respectively. Using robust feature distillation, feature residuals mining, and robust optimization, 3DGM jointly performs 3D mapping and 2D segmentation without human intervention. We build the Mapverse benchmark, sourced from the Ithaca365 and nuPlan datasets, to evaluate our method in unsupervised 2D segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and neural rendering. Extensive results verify the effectiveness and potential of our method for self-driving and robotics.

- **Summary**: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful tool for generating high-fidelity data. However, the main bottleneck of existing approaches is the lack of supervision on the generator training, which often results in undamped oscillation and unsatisfactory performance. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm called Monte Carlo GAN (MCGAN). This approach, utilizing an innovative generative loss function, termly the regression loss, reformulates the generator training as a regression task and enables the generator training by minimizing the mean squared error between the discriminator's output of real data and the expected discriminator of fake data. We demonstrate the desirable analytic properties of the regression loss, including discriminability and optimality, and show that our method requires a weaker condition on the discriminator for effective generator training. These properties justify the strength of this approach to improve the training stability while retaining the optimality of GAN by leveraging strong supervision of the regression loss. Numerical results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that the proposed MCGAN significantly and consistently improves the existing state-of-the-art GAN models in terms of quality, accuracy, training stability, and learned latent space. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm exhibits great flexibility for integrating with a variety of backbone models to generate spatial images, temporal time-series, and spatio-temporal video data.

- **Summary**: Compositional reasoning capabilities are usually considered as fundamental skills to characterize human perception. Recent studies show that current Vision Language Models (VLMs) surprisingly lack sufficient knowledge with respect to such capabilities. To this end, we propose to thoroughly diagnose the composition representations encoded by VLMs, systematically revealing the potential cause for this weakness. Specifically, we propose evaluation methods from a novel game-theoretic view to assess the vulnerability of VLMs on different aspects of compositional understanding, e.g., relations and attributes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate and validate several insights to understand the incapabilities of VLMs on compositional reasoning, which provide useful and reliable guidance for future studies.

- **Summary**: The absence of real targets to guide the model training is one of the main problems with the makeup transfer task. Most existing methods tackle this problem by synthesizing pseudo ground truths (PGTs). However, the generated PGTs are often sub-optimal and their imprecision will eventually lead to performance degradation. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel Content-Style Decoupled Makeup Transfer (CSD-MT) method, which works in a purely unsupervised manner and thus eliminates the negative effects of generating PGTs. Specifically, based on the frequency characteristics analysis, we assume that the low-frequency (LF) component of a face image is more associated with its makeup style information, while the high-frequency (HF) component is more related to its content details. This assumption allows CSD-MT to decouple the content and makeup style information in each face image through the frequency decomposition. After that, CSD-MT realizes makeup transfer by maximizing the consistency of these two types of information between the transferred result and input images, respectively. Two newly designed loss functions are also introduced to further improve the transfer performance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses show the effectiveness of our CSD-MT method.

- **Summary**: Recently, we have witnessed the success of total variation (TV) for many imaging applications. However, traditional TV is defined on the original pixel domain, which limits its potential. In this work, we suggest a new TV regularization defined on the neural domain. Concretely, the discrete data is continuously and implicitly represented by a deep neural network (DNN), and we use the derivatives of DNN outputs w.r.t. input coordinates to capture local correlations of data. As compared with classical TV on the original domain, the proposed TV on the neural domain (termed NeurTV) enjoys two advantages. First, NeurTV is not limited to meshgrid but is suitable for both meshgrid and non-meshgrid data. Second, NeurTV can more exactly capture local correlations across data for any direction and any order of derivatives attributed to the implicit and continuous nature of neural domain. We theoretically reinterpret NeurTV under the variational approximation framework, which allows us to build the connection between classical TV and NeurTV and inspires us to develop variants (e.g., NeurTV with arbitrary resolution and space-variant NeurTV). Extensive numerical experiments with meshgrid data (e.g., color and hyperspectral images) and non-meshgrid data (e.g., point clouds and spatial transcriptomics) showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

- **Summary**: Generating novel views from a single image remains a challenging task due to the complexity of 3D scenes and the limited diversity in the existing multi-view datasets to train a model on. Recent research combining large-scale text-to-image (T2I) models with monocular depth estimation (MDE) has shown promise in handling in-the-wild images. In these methods, an input view is geometrically warped to novel views with estimated depth maps, then the warped image is inpainted by T2I models. However, they struggle with noisy depth maps and loss of semantic details when warping an input view to novel viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for single-shot novel view synthesis, a semantic-preserving generative warping framework that enables T2I generative models to learn where to warp and where to generate, through augmenting cross-view attention with self-attention. Our approach addresses the limitations of existing methods by conditioning the generative model on source view images and incorporating geometric warping signals. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios.

- **Summary**: In this work, we study the perception problem for garments using tools from computational topology: the identification of their geometry and position in space from point-cloud samples, as obtained e.g. with 3D scanners. We present a reconstruction algorithm based on a direct topological study of the sampled textile surface that allows us to obtain a cellular decomposition of it via a Morse function. No intermediate triangulation or local implicit equations are used, avoiding reconstruction-induced artifices. No a priori knowledge of the surface topology, density or regularity of the point-sample is required to run the algorithm. The results are a piecewise decomposition of the surface as a union of Morse cells (i.e. topological disks), suitable for tasks such as noise-filtering or mesh-independent reparametrization, and a cell complex of small rank determining the surface topology. This algorithm can be applied to smooth surfaces with or without boundary, embedded in an ambient space of any dimension.

- **Summary**: Simulation is a powerful tool to better understand physical systems, but generally requires computationally expensive numerical methods. Downstream applications of such simulations can become computationally infeasible if they require many forward solves, for example in the case of inverse design with many degrees of freedom. In this work, we investigate and extend neural PDE solvers as a tool to aid in scaling simulations for two-phase flow problems, and simulations of oil expulsion from a pore specifically. We extend existing numerical methods for this problem to a more complex setting involving varying geometries of the domain to generate a challenging dataset. Further, we investigate three prominent neural PDE solver methods, namely the UNet, DRN and U-FNO, and extend them for characteristics of the oil-expulsion problem: (1) spatial conditioning on the geometry; (2) periodicity in the boundary; (3) approximate mass conservation. We scale all methods and benchmark their speed-accuracy trade-off, evaluate qualitative properties, and perform an ablation study. We find that the investigated methods can accurately model the droplet dynamics with up to three orders of magnitude speed-up, that our extensions improve performance over the baselines, and that the introduced varying geometries constitute a significantly more challenging setting over the previously considered oil expulsion problem.

- **Summary**: There is a prevalent opinion in the recent literature that Diffusion-based models outperform GAN-based counterparts on the Image Super Resolution (ISR) problem. However, in most studies, Diffusion-based ISR models were trained longer and utilized larger networks than the GAN baselines. This raises the question of whether the superiority of Diffusion models is due to the Diffusion paradigm being better suited for the ISR task or if it is a consequence of the increased scale and computational resources used in contemporary studies. In our work, we compare Diffusion-based and GAN-based Super Resolution under controlled settings, where both approaches are matched in terms of architecture, model and dataset size, and computational budget. We show that a GAN-based model can achieve results comparable to a Diffusion-based model. Additionally, we explore the impact of design choices such as text conditioning and augmentation on the performance of ISR models, showcasing their effect on several downstream tasks. We will release the inference code and weights of our scaled GAN.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing data provide a low-cost solution for large-scale monitoring of air pollution via the retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD), but is often limited by cloud contamination. Existing methods for AOD reconstruction rely on temporal information. However, for remote sensing data at high spatial resolution, multi-temporal observations are often unavailable. In this letter, we take advantage of deep representation learning from convolutional neural networks and propose Deep Feature Gaussian Processes (DFGP) for single-scene AOD reconstruction. By using deep learning, we transform the variables to a feature space with better explainable power. By using Gaussian processes, we explicitly consider the correlation between observed AOD and missing AOD in spatial and feature domains. Experiments on two AOD datasets with real-world cloud patterns showed that the proposed method outperformed deep CNN and random forest, achieving R$^2$ of 0.7431 on MODIS AOD and R$^2$ of 0.9211 on EMIT AOD, compared to deep CNN's R$^2$ of 0.6507 and R$^2$ of 0.8619. The proposed methods increased R$^2$ by over 0.35 compared to the popular random forest in AOD reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Federated learning (FL) is a popular privacy-preserving paradigm that enables distributed clients to collaboratively train models with a central server while keeping raw data locally. In practice, distinct model architectures, varying data distributions, and limited resources across local clients inevitably cause model performance degradation and a slowdown in convergence speed. However, existing FL methods can only solve some of the above heterogeneous challenges and have obvious performance limitations. Notably, a unified framework has not yet been explored to overcome these challenges. Accordingly, we propose FedHPL, a parameter-efficient unified $\textbf{Fed}$erated learning framework for $\textbf{H}$eterogeneous settings based on $\textbf{P}$rompt tuning and $\textbf{L}$ogit distillation. Specifically, we employ a local prompt tuning scheme that leverages a few learnable visual prompts to efficiently fine-tune the frozen pre-trained foundation model for downstream tasks, thereby accelerating training and improving model performance under limited local resources and data heterogeneity. Moreover, we design a global logit distillation scheme to handle the model heterogeneity and guide the local training. In detail, we leverage logits to implicitly capture local knowledge and design a weighted knowledge aggregation mechanism to generate global client-specific logits. We provide a theoretical guarantee on the generalization error bound for FedHPL. The experiments on various benchmark datasets under diverse settings of models and data demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art FL approaches, with less computation overhead and training rounds.

- **Summary**: Event camera, a bio-inspired asynchronous triggered camera, offers promising prospects for fusion with frame-based cameras owing to its low latency and high dynamic range. However, calibrating stereo vision systems that incorporate both event and frame-based cameras remains a significant challenge. In this letter, we present EF-Calib, a spatiotemporal calibration framework for event- and frame-based cameras using continuous-time trajectories. A novel calibration pattern applicable to both camera types and the corresponding event recognition algorithm is proposed. Leveraging the asynchronous nature of events, a derivable piece-wise B-spline to represent camera pose continuously is introduced, enabling calibration for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset, with analytical Jacobians provided. Various experiments are carried out to evaluate the calibration performance of EF-Calib, including calibration experiments for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset. Experimental results show that EF-Calib achieves the most accurate intrinsic parameters compared to current SOTA, the close accuracy of the extrinsic parameters compared to the frame-based results, and accurate time offset estimation. EF-Calib provides a convenient and accurate toolbox for calibrating the system that fuses events and frames.

- **Summary**: Generating realistic animated videos from static images is an important area of research in computer vision. Methods based on physical simulation and motion prediction have achieved notable advances, but they are often limited to specific object textures and motion trajectories, failing to exhibit highly complex environments and physical dynamics. In this paper, we introduce an open-domain controllable image animation method using motion priors with video diffusion models. Our method achieves precise control over the direction and speed of motion in the movable region by extracting the motion field information from videos and learning moving trajectories and strengths. Current pretrained video generation models are typically limited to producing very short videos, typically less than 30 frames. In contrast, we propose an efficient long-duration video generation method based on noise reschedule specifically tailored for image animation tasks, facilitating the creation of videos over 100 frames in length while maintaining consistency in content scenery and motion coordination. Specifically, we decompose the denoise process into two distinct phases: the shaping of scene contours and the refining of motion details. Then we reschedule the noise to control the generated frame sequences maintaining long-distance noise correlation. We conducted extensive experiments with 10 baselines, encompassing both commercial tools and academic methodologies, which demonstrate the superiority of our method.

- **Summary**: We propose a method for depth estimation under different illumination conditions, i.e., day and night time. As photometry is uninformative in regions under low-illumination, we tackle the problem through a multi-sensor fusion approach, where we take as input an additional synchronized sparse point cloud (i.e., from a LiDAR) projected onto the image plane as a sparse depth map, along with a camera image. The crux of our method lies in the use of the abundantly available synthetic data to first approximate the 3D scene structure by learning a mapping from sparse to (coarse) dense depth maps along with their predictive uncertainty - we term this, SpaDe. In poorly illuminated regions where photometric intensities do not afford the inference of local shape, the coarse approximation of scene depth serves as a prior; the uncertainty map is then used with the image to guide refinement through an uncertainty-driven residual learning (URL) scheme. The resulting depth completion network leverages complementary strengths from both modalities - depth is sparse but insensitive to illumination and in metric scale, and image is dense but sensitive with scale ambiguity. SpaDe can be used in a plug-and-play fashion, which allows for 25% improvement when augmented onto existing methods to preprocess sparse depth. We demonstrate URL on the nuScenes dataset where we improve over all baselines by an average 11.65% in all-day scenarios, 11.23% when tested specifically for daytime, and 13.12% for nighttime scenes.

- **Summary**: This paper focuses on tracking birds that appear small in a panoramic video. When the size of the tracked object is small in the image (small object tracking) and move quickly, object detection and association suffers. To address these problems, we propose Adaptive Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (Adaptive SAHI), which reduces the candidate regions to apply detection, and Detection History-aware Similarity Criterion (DHSC), which accurately associates objects in consecutive frames based on the detection history. Experiments on the NUBird2022 dataset verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method by showing improvements in both accuracy and speed.



### DOF-GS: Adjustable Depth-of-Field 3D Gaussian Splatting for Refocusing,Defocus Rendering and Blur Removal

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting-based techniques have recently advanced 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, achieving high-quality real-time rendering. However, these approaches are inherently limited by the underlying pinhole camera assumption in modeling the images and hence only work for All-in-Focus (AiF) sharp image inputs. This severely affects their applicability in real-world scenarios where images often exhibit defocus blur due to the limited depth-of-field (DOF) of imaging devices. Additionally, existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods also do not support rendering of DOF effects.   To address these challenges, we introduce DOF-GS that allows for rendering adjustable DOF effects, removing defocus blur as well as refocusing of 3D scenes, all from multi-view images degraded by defocus blur. To this end, we re-imagine the traditional Gaussian Splatting pipeline by employing a finite aperture camera model coupled with explicit, differentiable defocus rendering guided by the Circle-of-Confusion (CoC). The proposed framework provides for dynamic adjustment of DOF effects by changing the aperture and focal distance of the underlying camera model on-demand. It also enables rendering varying DOF effects of 3D scenes post-optimization, and generating AiF images from defocused training images. Furthermore, we devise a joint optimization strategy to further enhance details in the reconstructed scenes by jointly optimizing rendered defocused and AiF images. Our experimental results indicate that DOF-GS produces high-quality sharp all-in-focus renderings conditioned on inputs compromised by defocus blur, with the training process incurring only a modest increase in GPU memory consumption. We further demonstrate the applications of the proposed method for adjustable defocus rendering and refocusing of the 3D scene from input images degraded by defocus blur.

- **Summary**: Video and wearable sensor data provide complementary information about human movement. Video provides a holistic understanding of the entire body in the world while wearable sensors provide high-resolution measurements of specific body segments. A robust method to fuse these modalities and obtain biomechanically accurate kinematics would have substantial utility for clinical assessment and monitoring. While multiple video-sensor fusion methods exist, most assume that a time-intensive, and often brittle, sensor-body calibration process has already been performed. In this work, we present a method to combine handheld smartphone video and uncalibrated wearable sensor data at their full temporal resolution. Our monocular, video-only, biomechanical reconstruction already performs well, with only several degrees of error at the knee during walking compared to markerless motion capture. Reconstructing from a fusion of video and wearable sensor data further reduces this error. We validate this in a mixture of people with no gait impairments, lower limb prosthesis users, and individuals with a history of stroke. We also show that sensor data allows tracking through periods of visual occlusion.

- **Summary**: The way organs are positioned and moved in the workplace can cause pain and physical harm. Therefore, ergonomists use ergonomic risk assessments based on visual observation of the workplace, or review pictures and videos taken in the workplace. Sometimes the workers in the photos are not in perfect condition. Some parts of the workers' bodies may not be in the camera's field of view, could be obscured by objects, or by self-occlusion, this is the main problem in 2D human posture recognition. It is difficult to predict the position of body parts when they are not visible in the image, and geometric mathematical methods are not entirely suitable for this purpose. Therefore, we created a dataset with artificial images of a 3D human model, specifically for painful postures, and real human photos from different viewpoints. Each image we captured was based on a predefined joint angle for each 3D model or human model. We created various images, including images where some body parts are not visible. Nevertheless, the joint angle is estimated beforehand, so we could study the case by converting the input images into the sequence of joint connections between predefined body parts and extracting the desired joint angle with a convolutional neural network. In the end, we obtained root mean square error (RMSE) of 12.89 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.7 on the test dataset.

- **Summary**: We present a novel approach for single-image mesh texturing, which employs a diffusion model with judicious conditioning to seamlessly transfer an object's texture from a single RGB image to a given 3D mesh object. We do not assume that the two objects belong to the same category, and even if they do, there can be significant discrepancies in their geometry and part proportions. Our method aims to rectify the discrepancies by conditioning a pre-trained Stable Diffusion generator with edges describing the mesh through ControlNet, and features extracted from the input image using IP-Adapter to generate textures that respect the underlying geometry of the mesh and the input texture without any optimization or training. We also introduce Image Inversion, a novel technique to quickly personalize the diffusion model for a single concept using a single image, for cases where the pre-trained IP-Adapter falls short in capturing all the details from the input image faithfully. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our edge-aware single-image mesh texturing approach, coined EASI-Tex, in preserving the details of the input texture on diverse 3D objects, while respecting their geometry.

- **Summary**: Understanding human behavior fundamentally relies on accurate 3D human pose estimation. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have recently shown promising advancements, delivering state-of-the-art performance with rather lightweight architectures. In the context of graph-structured data, leveraging the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix for positional encoding is effective. Yet, the approach does not specify how to handle scenarios where edges in the input graph are missing. To this end, we propose a novel positional encoding technique, PerturbPE, that extracts consistent and regular components from the eigenbasis. Our method involves applying multiple perturbations and taking their average to extract the consistent and regular component from the eigenbasis. PerturbPE leverages the Rayleigh-Schrodinger Perturbation Theorem (RSPT) for calculating the perturbed eigenvectors. Employing this labeling technique enhances the robustness and generalizability of the model. Our results support our theoretical findings, e.g. our experimental analysis observed a performance enhancement of up to $12\%$ on the Human3.6M dataset in instances where occlusion resulted in the absence of one edge. Furthermore, our novel approach significantly enhances performance in scenarios where two edges are missing, setting a new benchmark for state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: World models can foresee the outcomes of different actions, which is of paramount importance for autonomous driving. Nevertheless, existing driving world models still have limitations in generalization to unseen environments, prediction fidelity of critical details, and action controllability for flexible application. In this paper, we present Vista, a generalizable driving world model with high fidelity and versatile controllability. Based on a systematic diagnosis of existing methods, we introduce several key ingredients to address these limitations. To accurately predict real-world dynamics at high resolution, we propose two novel losses to promote the learning of moving instances and structural information. We also devise an effective latent replacement approach to inject historical frames as priors for coherent long-horizon rollouts. For action controllability, we incorporate a versatile set of controls from high-level intentions (command, goal point) to low-level maneuvers (trajectory, angle, and speed) through an efficient learning strategy. After large-scale training, the capabilities of Vista can seamlessly generalize to different scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that Vista outperforms the most advanced general-purpose video generator in over 70% of comparisons and surpasses the best-performing driving world model by 55% in FID and 27% in FVD. Moreover, for the first time, we utilize the capacity of Vista itself to establish a generalizable reward for real-world action evaluation without accessing the ground truth actions.

- **Summary**: We propose Reference-Based Modulation (RB-Modulation), a new plug-and-play solution for training-free personalization of diffusion models. Existing training-free approaches exhibit difficulties in (a) style extraction from reference images in the absence of additional style or content text descriptions, (b) unwanted content leakage from reference style images, and (c) effective composition of style and content. RB-Modulation is built on a novel stochastic optimal controller where a style descriptor encodes the desired attributes through a terminal cost. The resulting drift not only overcomes the difficulties above, but also ensures high fidelity to the reference style and adheres to the given text prompt. We also introduce a cross-attention-based feature aggregation scheme that allows RB-Modulation to decouple content and style from the reference image. With theoretical justification and empirical evidence, our framework demonstrates precise extraction and control of content and style in a training-free manner. Further, our method allows a seamless composition of content and style, which marks a departure from the dependency on external adapters or ControlNets.

- **Summary**: We present a novel approach for generating high-quality, spatio-temporally coherent human videos from a single image under arbitrary viewpoints. Our framework combines the strengths of U-Nets for accurate condition injection and diffusion transformers for capturing global correlations across viewpoints and time. The core is a cascaded 4D transformer architecture that factorizes attention across views, time, and spatial dimensions, enabling efficient modeling of the 4D space. Precise conditioning is achieved by injecting human identity, camera parameters, and temporal signals into the respective transformers. To train this model, we curate a multi-dimensional dataset spanning images, videos, multi-view data and 3D/4D scans, along with a multi-dimensional training strategy. Our approach overcomes the limitations of previous methods based on GAN or UNet-based diffusion models, which struggle with complex motions and viewpoint changes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate our method's ability to synthesize realistic, coherent and free-view human videos, paving the way for advanced multimedia applications in areas such as virtual reality and animation.

- **Summary**: Research on video generation has recently made tremendous progress, enabling high-quality videos to be generated from text prompts or images. Adding control to the video generation process is an important goal moving forward and recent approaches that condition video generation models on camera trajectories make strides towards it. Yet, it remains challenging to generate a video of the same scene from multiple different camera trajectories. Solutions to this multi-video generation problem could enable large-scale 3D scene generation with editable camera trajectories, among other applications. We introduce collaborative video diffusion (CVD) as an important step towards this vision. The CVD framework includes a novel cross-video synchronization module that promotes consistency between corresponding frames of the same video rendered from different camera poses using an epipolar attention mechanism. Trained on top of a state-of-the-art camera-control module for video generation, CVD generates multiple videos rendered from different camera trajectories with significantly better consistency than baselines, as shown in extensive experiments.

- **Summary**: $Q$-learning algorithms are appealing for real-world applications due to their data-efficiency, but they are very prone to overfitting and training instabilities when trained from visual observations. Prior work, namely SVEA, finds that selective application of data augmentation can improve the visual generalization of RL agents without destabilizing training. We revisit its recipe for data augmentation, and find an assumption that limits its effectiveness to augmentations of a photometric nature. Addressing these limitations, we propose a generalized recipe, SADA, that works with wider varieties of augmentations. We benchmark its effectiveness on DMC-GB2 -- our proposed extension of the popular DMControl Generalization Benchmark -- as well as tasks from Meta-World and the Distracting Control Suite, and find that our method, SADA, greatly improves training stability and generalization of RL agents across a diverse set of augmentations.

- **Summary**: Robot manipulation policies have shown unsatisfactory action performance when confronted with novel task or object instances. Hence, the capability to automatically detect and self-correct failure action is essential for a practical robotic system. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in visual instruction following and demonstrated strong reasoning abilities in various tasks. To unleash general MLLMs as an end-to-end robotic agent, we introduce a Self-Corrected (SC)-MLLM, equipping our model not only to predict end-effector poses but also to autonomously recognize and correct failure actions. Specifically, we first conduct parameter-efficient fine-tuning to empower MLLM with pose prediction ability, which is reframed as a language modeling problem. When facing execution failures, our model learns to identify low-level action error causes (i.e., position and rotation errors) and adaptively seeks prompt feedback from experts. Based on the feedback, SC-MLLM rethinks the current failure scene and generates the corrected actions. Furthermore, we design a continuous policy learning method for successfully corrected samples, enhancing the model's adaptability to the current scene configuration and reducing the frequency of expert intervention. To evaluate our SC-MLLM, we conduct extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings. SC-MLLM agent significantly improve manipulation accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art robotic MLLM (ManipLLM), increasing from 57\% to 79\% on seen object categories and from 47\% to 69\% on unseen novel categories.

- **Summary**: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is important for deploying machine learning models in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and robot-assisted surgery. Existing research has mainly focused on unimodal scenarios on image data. However, real-world applications are inherently multimodal, which makes it essential to leverage information from multiple modalities to enhance the efficacy of OOD detection. To establish a foundation for more realistic Multimodal OOD Detection, we introduce the first-of-its-kind benchmark, MultiOOD, characterized by diverse dataset sizes and varying modality combinations. We first evaluate existing unimodal OOD detection algorithms on MultiOOD, observing that the mere inclusion of additional modalities yields substantial improvements. This underscores the importance of utilizing multiple modalities for OOD detection. Based on the observation of Modality Prediction Discrepancy between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data, and its strong correlation with OOD performance, we propose the Agree-to-Disagree (A2D) algorithm to encourage such discrepancy during training. Moreover, we introduce a novel outlier synthesis method, NP-Mix, which explores broader feature spaces by leveraging the information from nearest neighbor classes and complements A2D to strengthen OOD detection performance. Extensive experiments on MultiOOD demonstrate that training with A2D and NP-Mix improves existing OOD detection algorithms by a large margin.

- **Summary**: We introduce 4D Motion Scaffolds (MoSca), a neural information processing system designed to reconstruct and synthesize novel views of dynamic scenes from monocular videos captured casually in the wild. To address such a challenging and ill-posed inverse problem, we leverage prior knowledge from foundational vision models, lift the video data to a novel Motion Scaffold (MoSca) representation, which compactly and smoothly encodes the underlying motions / deformations. The scene geometry and appearance are then disentangled from the deformation field, and are encoded by globally fusing the Gaussians anchored onto the MoSca and optimized via Gaussian Splatting. Additionally, camera poses can be seamlessly initialized and refined during the dynamic rendering process, without the need for other pose estimation tools. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on dynamic rendering benchmarks.

- **Summary**: 3D object detection aims to recover the 3D information of concerning objects and serves as the fundamental task of autonomous driving perception. Its performance greatly depends on the scale of labeled training data, yet it is costly to obtain high-quality annotations for point cloud data. While conventional methods focus on generating pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples as supplements for training, the structural nature of 3D point cloud data facilitates the composition of objects and backgrounds to synthesize realistic scenes. Motivated by this, we propose a hardness-aware scene synthesis (HASS) method to generate adaptive synthetic scenes to improve the generalization of the detection models. We obtain pseudo-labels for unlabeled objects and generate diverse scenes with different compositions of objects and backgrounds. As the scene synthesis is sensitive to the quality of pseudo-labels, we further propose a hardness-aware strategy to reduce the effect of low-quality pseudo-labels and maintain a dynamic pseudo-database to ensure the diversity and quality of synthetic scenes. Extensive experimental results on the widely used KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HASS method, which outperforms existing semi-supervised learning methods on 3D object detection.

- **Summary**: This paper aims to advance our understanding of how Visual Language Models (VLMs) handle privacy-sensitive information, a crucial concern as these technologies become integral to everyday life. To this end, we introduce a new benchmark PrivBench, which contains images from 8 sensitive categories such as passports, or fingerprints. We evaluate 10 state-of-the-art VLMs on this benchmark and observe a generally limited understanding of privacy, highlighting a significant area for model improvement. Based on this we introduce PrivTune, a new instruction-tuning dataset aimed at equipping VLMs with knowledge about visual privacy. By tuning two pretrained VLMs, TinyLLaVa and MiniGPT-v2, on this small dataset, we achieve strong gains in their ability to recognize sensitive content, outperforming even GPT4-V. At the same time, we show that privacy-tuning only minimally affects the VLMs performance on standard benchmarks such as VQA. Overall, this paper lays out a crucial challenge for making VLMs effective in handling real-world data safely and provides a simple recipe that takes the first step towards building privacy-aware VLMs.

- **Summary**: Due to the need to interact with the real world, embodied agents are required to possess comprehensive prior knowledge, long-horizon planning capability, and a swift response speed. Despite recent large language model (LLM) based agents achieving promising performance, they still exhibit several limitations. For instance, the output of LLMs is a descriptive sentence, which is ambiguous when determining specific actions. To address these limitations, we introduce the large auto-regressive model (LARM). LARM leverages both text and multi-view images as input and predicts subsequent actions in an auto-regressive manner. To train LARM, we develop a novel data format named auto-regressive node transmission structure and assemble a corresponding dataset. Adopting a two-phase training regimen, LARM successfully harvests enchanted equipment in Minecraft, which demands significantly more complex decision-making chains than the highest achievements of prior best methods. Besides, the speed of LARM is 6.8x faster.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in bird's eye view (BEV) representations have shown remarkable promise for in-vehicle 3D perception. However, while these methods have achieved impressive results on standard benchmarks, their robustness in varied conditions remains insufficiently assessed. In this study, we present RoboBEV, an extensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate the resilience of BEV algorithms. This suite incorporates a diverse set of camera corruption types, each examined over three severity levels. Our benchmarks also consider the impact of complete sensor failures that occur when using multi-modal models. Through RoboBEV, we assess 33 state-of-the-art BEV-based perception models spanning tasks like detection, map segmentation, depth estimation, and occupancy prediction. Our analyses reveal a noticeable correlation between the model's performance on in-distribution datasets and its resilience to out-of-distribution challenges. Our experimental results also underline the efficacy of strategies like pre-training and depth-free BEV transformations in enhancing robustness against out-of-distribution data. Furthermore, we observe that leveraging extensive temporal information significantly improves the model's robustness. Based on our observations, we design an effective robustness enhancement strategy based on the CLIP model. The insights from this study pave the way for the development of future BEV models that seamlessly combine accuracy with real-world robustness.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have shown their potential in various domains, especially concept reasoning. Despite these developments, applications in understanding 3D environments remain limited. This paper introduces Reason3D, a novel LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding. Reason3D takes point cloud data and text prompts as input to produce textual responses and segmentation masks, facilitating advanced tasks like 3D reasoning segmentation, hierarchical searching, express referring, and question answering with detailed mask outputs. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical mask decoder to locate small objects within expansive scenes. This decoder initially generates a coarse location estimate covering the object's general area. This foundational estimation facilitates a detailed, coarse-to-fine segmentation strategy that significantly enhances the precision of object identification and segmentation. Experiments validate that Reason3D achieves remarkable results on large-scale ScanNet and Matterport3D datasets for 3D express referring, 3D question answering, and 3D reasoning segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: 3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to obtain 3D fine-grained geometry and semantics of the surrounding scene and is an important task for the robustness of vision-centric autonomous driving. Most existing methods employ dense grids such as voxels as scene representations, which ignore the sparsity of occupancy and the diversity of object scales and thus lead to unbalanced allocation of resources. To address this, we propose an object-centric representation to describe 3D scenes with sparse 3D semantic Gaussians where each Gaussian represents a flexible region of interest and its semantic features. We aggregate information from images through the attention mechanism and iteratively refine the properties of 3D Gaussians including position, covariance, and semantics. We then propose an efficient Gaussian-to-voxel splatting method to generate 3D occupancy predictions, which only aggregates the neighboring Gaussians for a certain position. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely adopted nuScenes and KITTI-360 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GaussianFormer achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods with only 17.8% - 24.8% of their memory consumption.

- **Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) such as LLaVA have shown strong performance in visual-linguistic reasoning. These models first embed images into a fixed large number of visual tokens and then feed them into a Large Language Model (LLM). However, this design causes an excessive number of tokens for dense visual scenarios such as high-resolution images and videos, leading to great inefficiency. While token pruning/merging methods do exist, they produce a single length output for each image and do not afford flexibility in trading off information density v.s. efficiency. Inspired by the concept of Matryoshka Dolls, we propose M3: Matryoshka Multimodal Models, which learns to represent visual content as nested sets of visual tokens that capture information across multiple coarse-to-fine granularities. Our approach offers several unique benefits for LMMs: (1) One can explicitly control the visual granularity per test instance during inference, e.g. , adjusting the number of tokens used to represent an image based on the anticipated complexity or simplicity of the content; (2) M3 provides a framework for analyzing the granularity needed for existing datasets, where we find that COCO-style benchmarks only need around ~9 visual tokens to obtain accuracy similar to that of using all 576 tokens; (3) Our approach provides a foundation to explore the best trade-off between performance and visual token length at sample level, where our investigation reveals that a large gap exists between the oracle upper bound and current fixed-scale representations.
