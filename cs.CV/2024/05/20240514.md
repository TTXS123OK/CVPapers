- **Summary**: Ancient murals are valuable cultural heritage with great archaeological value. They provide insights into ancient religions, ceremonies, folklore, among other things through their content. However, due to long-term oxidation and inadequate protection, ancient murals have suffered continuous damage, including peeling and mold etc. Additionally, since ancient murals were typically painted indoors, the light intensity in images captured by digital devices is often low. The poor visibility hampers the further restoration of damaged areas. To address the escalating damage to ancient frescoes and facilitate batch restoration at archaeological sites, we propose a two-stage restoration model which called MER(Mural Enhancement and Restoration net) for ancient murals that are damaged and have been captured in low light. Our two-stage model not only enhances the visual quality of restored images but also achieves commendable results in relevant metric evaluations compared with other competitors. Furthermore, we have launched a website dedicated to the restoration of ancient mural paintings, utilizing the proposed model. Code is available at https://gitee.com/bbfan2024/MER.git.

- **Summary**: Existing text-to-image models struggle to follow complex text prompts, raising the need for extra grounding inputs for better controllability. In this work, we propose to decompose a scene into visual primitives - denoted as dense blob representations - that contain fine-grained details of the scene while being modular, human-interpretable, and easy-to-construct. Based on blob representations, we develop a blob-grounded text-to-image diffusion model, termed BlobGEN, for compositional generation. Particularly, we introduce a new masked cross-attention module to disentangle the fusion between blob representations and visual features. To leverage the compositionality of large language models (LLMs), we introduce a new in-context learning approach to generate blob representations from text prompts. Our extensive experiments show that BlobGEN achieves superior zero-shot generation quality and better layout-guided controllability on MS-COCO. When augmented by LLMs, our method exhibits superior numerical and spatial correctness on compositional image generation benchmarks. Project page: https://blobgen-2d.github.io.

- **Summary**: In large-scale disaster events, the planning of optimal rescue routes depends on the object detection ability at the disaster scene, with one of the main challenges being the presence of dense and occluded objects. Existing methods, which are typically based on the RGB modality, struggle to distinguish targets with similar colors and textures in crowded environments and are unable to identify obscured objects. To this end, we first construct two multimodal dense and occlusion vehicle detection datasets for large-scale events, utilizing RGB and height map modalities. Based on these datasets, we propose a multimodal collaboration network for dense and occluded vehicle detection, MuDet for short. MuDet hierarchically enhances the completeness of discriminable information within and across modalities and differentiates between simple and complex samples. MuDet includes three main modules: Unimodal Feature Hierarchical Enhancement (Uni-Enh), Multimodal Cross Learning (Mul-Lea), and Hard-easy Discriminative (He-Dis) Pattern. Uni-Enh and Mul-Lea enhance the features within each modality and facilitate the cross-integration of features from two heterogeneous modalities. He-Dis effectively separates densely occluded vehicle targets with significant intra-class differences and minimal inter-class differences by defining and thresholding confidence values, thereby suppressing the complex background. Experimental results on two re-labeled multimodal benchmark datasets, the 4K-SAI-LCS dataset, and the ISPRS Potsdam dataset, demonstrate the robustness and generalization of the MuDet.

- **Summary**: As an important subtopic of image enhancement, color transfer aims to enhance the color scheme of a source image according to a reference one while preserving the semantic context. To implement color transfer, the palette-based color mapping framework was proposed. \textcolor{black}{It is a classical solution that does not depend on complex semantic analysis to generate a new color scheme. However, the framework usually requires manual settings, blackucing its practicality.} The quality of traditional palette generation depends on the degree of color separation. In this paper, we propose a new palette-based color transfer method that can automatically generate a new color scheme. With a redesigned palette-based clustering method, pixels can be classified into different segments according to color distribution with better applicability. {By combining deep learning-based image segmentation and a new color mapping strategy, color transfer can be implemented on foreground and background parts independently while maintaining semantic consistency.} The experimental results indicate that our method exhibits significant advantages over peer methods in terms of natural realism, color consistency, generality, and robustness.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based medical image segmentation models often face performance degradation when deployed across various medical centers, largely due to the discrepancies in data distribution. Test Time Adaptation (TTA) methods, which adapt pre-trained models to test data, have been employed to mitigate such discrepancies. However, existing TTA methods primarily focus on manipulating Batch Normalization (BN) layers or employing prompt and adversarial learning, which may not effectively rectify the inconsistencies arising from divergent data distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel Human-in-the-loop TTA (HiTTA) framework that stands out in two significant ways. First, it capitalizes on the largely overlooked potential of clinician-corrected predictions, integrating these corrections into the TTA process to steer the model towards predictions that coincide more closely with clinical annotation preferences. Second, our framework conceives a divergence loss, designed specifically to diminish the prediction divergence instigated by domain disparities, through the careful calibration of BN parameters. Our HiTTA is distinguished by its dual-faceted capability to acclimatize to the distribution of test data whilst ensuring the model's predictions align with clinical expectations, thereby enhancing its relevance in a medical context. Extensive experiments on a public dataset underscore the superiority of our HiTTA over existing TTA methods, emphasizing the advantages of integrating human feedback and our divergence loss in enhancing the model's performance and adaptability across diverse medical centers.

- **Summary**: The surgical intervention is crucial to patient healthcare, and many studies have developed advanced algorithms to provide understanding and decision-making assistance for surgeons. Despite great progress, these algorithms are developed for a single specific task and scenario, and in practice require the manual combination of different functions, thus limiting the applicability. Thus, an intelligent and versatile surgical assistant is expected to accurately understand the surgeon's intentions and accordingly conduct the specific tasks to support the surgical process. In this work, by leveraging advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we propose a Versatile Surgery Assistant (VS-Assistant) that can accurately understand the surgeon's intention and complete a series of surgical understanding tasks, e.g., surgical scene analysis, surgical instrument detection, and segmentation on demand. Specifically, to achieve superior surgical multimodal understanding, we devise a mixture of projectors (MOP) module to align the surgical MLLM in VS-Assistant to balance the natural and surgical knowledge. Moreover, we devise a surgical Function-Calling Tuning strategy to enable the VS-Assistant to understand surgical intentions, and thus make a series of surgical function calls on demand to meet the needs of the surgeons. Extensive experiments on neurosurgery data confirm that our VS-Assistant can understand the surgeon's intention more accurately than the existing MLLM, resulting in overwhelming performance in textual analysis and visual tasks. Source code and models will be made public.

- **Summary**: Tensors serve as a crucial tool in the representation and analysis of complex, multi-dimensional data. As data volumes continue to expand, there is an increasing demand for developing optimization algorithms that can directly operate on tensors to deliver fast and effective computations. Many problems in real-world applications can be formulated as the task of recovering high-order tensors characterized by sparse and/or low-rank structures. In this work, we propose novel Kaczmarz algorithms with a power of the $\ell_1$-norm regularization for reconstructing high-order tensors by exploiting sparsity and/or low-rankness of tensor data. In addition, we develop both a block and an accelerated variant, along with a thorough convergence analysis of these algorithms. A variety of numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and significant potential of the proposed methods in image and video processing tasks, such as image sequence destriping and video deconvolution.

- **Summary**: Objective: Automated segmentation tools are useful for calculating kidney volumes rapidly and accurately. Furthermore, these tools have the power to facilitate large-scale image-based artificial intelligence projects by generating input labels, such as for image registration algorithms. Prior automated segmentation models have largely ignored non-contrast computed tomography (CT) imaging. This work aims to implement and train a deep learning (DL) model to segment the kidneys and cystic renal lesions (CRLs) from non-contrast CT scans.   Methods: Manual segmentation of the kidneys and CRLs was performed on 150 non-contrast abdominal CT scans. The data were divided into an 80/20 train/test split and a deep learning (DL) model was trained to segment the kidneys and CRLs. Various scoring metrics were used to assess model performance, including the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Jaccard Index (JI), and absolute and percent error kidney volume and lesion volume. Bland-Altman (B-A) analysis was performed to compare manual versus DL-based kidney volumes.   Results: The DL model achieved a median kidney DSC of 0.934, median CRL DSC of 0.711, and total median study DSC of 0.823. Average volume errors were 0.9% for renal parenchyma, 37.0% for CRLs, and 2.2% overall. B-A analysis demonstrated that DL-based volumes tended to be greater than manual volumes, with a mean bias of +3.0 ml (+/- 2 SD of +/- 50.2 ml).   Conclusion: A deep learning model trained to segment kidneys and cystic renal lesions on non-contrast CT examinations was able to provide highly accurate segmentations, with a median kidney Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.934.   Keywords: deep learning; kidney segmentation; artificial intelligence; convolutional neural networks.

- **Summary**: The uses of machine learning (ML) have snowballed in recent years. In many cases, ML models are highly complex, and their operation is beyond the understanding of human decision-makers. Nevertheless, some uses of ML models involve high-stakes and safety-critical applications. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to help human decision-makers in understanding the operation of such complex ML models, thus eliciting trust in their operation. Unfortunately, the majority of past XAI work is based on informal approaches, that offer no guarantees of rigor. Unsurprisingly, there exists comprehensive experimental and theoretical evidence confirming that informal methods of XAI can provide human-decision makers with erroneous information. Logic-based XAI represents a rigorous approach to explainability; it is model-based and offers the strongest guarantees of rigor of computed explanations. However, a well-known drawback of logic-based XAI is the complexity of logic reasoning, especially for highly complex ML models. Recent work proposed distance-restricted explanations, i.e. explanations that are rigorous provided the distance to a given input is small enough. Distance-restricted explainability is tightly related with adversarial robustness, and it has been shown to scale for moderately complex ML models, but the number of inputs still represents a key limiting factor. This paper investigates novel algorithms for scaling up the performance of logic-based explainers when computing and enumerating ML model explanations with a large number of inputs.

- **Summary**: From a perspective of feature matching, optical flow estimation for event cameras involves identifying event correspondences by comparing feature similarity across accompanying event frames. In this work, we introduces an effective and robust high-dimensional (HD) feature descriptor for event frames, utilizing Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA). The topological similarity among neighboring variables within VSA contributes to the enhanced representation similarity of feature descriptors for flow-matching points, while its structured symbolic representation capacity facilitates feature fusion from both event polarities and multiple spatial scales. Based on this HD feature descriptor, we propose a novel feature matching framework for event-based optical flow, encompassing both model-based (VSA-Flow) and self-supervised learning (VSA-SM) methods. In VSA-Flow, accurate optical flow estimation validates the effectiveness of HD feature descriptors. In VSA-SM, a novel similarity maximization method based on the HD feature descriptor is proposed to learn optical flow in a self-supervised way from events alone, eliminating the need for auxiliary grayscale images. Evaluation results demonstrate that our VSA-based method achieves superior accuracy in comparison to both model-based and self-supervised learning methods on the DSEC benchmark, while remains competitive among both methods on the MVSEC benchmark. This contribution marks a significant advancement in event-based optical flow within the feature matching methodology.

- **Summary**: Point cloud filtering is a fundamental 3D vision task, which aims to remove noise while recovering the underlying clean surfaces. State-of-the-art methods remove noise by moving noisy points along stochastic trajectories to the clean surfaces. These methods often require regularization within the training objective and/or during post-processing, to ensure fidelity. In this paper, we introduce StraightPCF, a new deep learning based method for point cloud filtering. It works by moving noisy points along straight paths, thus reducing discretization errors while ensuring faster convergence to the clean surfaces. We model noisy patches as intermediate states between high noise patch variants and their clean counterparts, and design the VelocityModule to infer a constant flow velocity from the former to the latter. This constant flow leads to straight filtering trajectories. In addition, we introduce a DistanceModule that scales the straight trajectory using an estimated distance scalar to attain convergence near the clean surface. Our network is lightweight and only has $\sim530K$ parameters, being 17% of IterativePFN (a most recent point cloud filtering network). Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Our method also demonstrates nice distributions of filtered points without the need for regularization. The implementation code can be found at: https://github.com/ddsediri/StraightPCF.

- **Summary**: Identifying lesions in fundus images is an important milestone toward an automated and interpretable diagnosis of retinal diseases. To support research in this direction, multiple datasets have been released, proposing groundtruth maps for different lesions. However, important discrepancies exist between the annotations and raise the question of generalization across datasets. This study characterizes several known datasets and compares different techniques that have been proposed to enhance the generalisation performance of a model, such as stochastic weight averaging, model soups and ensembles. Our results provide insights into how to combine coarsely labelled data with a finely-grained dataset in order to improve the lesions segmentation.

- **Summary**: Perivascular spaces(PVSs) form a central component of the brain\'s waste clearance system, the glymphatic system. These structures are visible on MRI images, and their morphology is associated with aging and neurological disease. Manual quantification of PVS is time consuming and subjective. Numerous deep learning methods for PVS segmentation have been developed, however the majority have been developed and evaluated on homogenous datasets and high resolution scans, perhaps limiting their applicability for the wide range of image qualities acquired in clinic and research. In this work we train a nnUNet, a top-performing biomedical image segmentation algorithm, on a heterogenous training sample of manually segmented MRI images of a range of different qualities and resolutions from 6 different datasets. These are compared to publicly available deep learning methods for 3D segmentation of PVS. The resulting model, PINGU (Perivascular space Identification Nnunet for Generalised Usage), achieved voxel and cluster level dice scores of 0.50(SD=0.15), 0.63(0.17) in the white matter(WM), and 0.54(0.11), 0.66(0.17) in the basal ganglia(BG). Performance on data from unseen sites was substantially lower for both PINGU(0.20-0.38(WM, voxel), 0.29-0.58(WM, cluster), 0.22-0.36(BG, voxel), 0.46-0.60(BG, cluster)) and the publicly available algorithms(0.18-0.30(WM, voxel), 0.29-0.38(WM cluster), 0.10-0.20(BG, voxel), 0.15-0.37(BG, cluster)), but PINGU strongly outperformed the publicly available algorithms, particularly in the BG. Finally, training PINGU on manual segmentations from a single site with homogenous scan properties gave marginally lower performances on internal cross-validation, but in some cases gave higher performance on external validation. PINGU stands out as broad-use PVS segmentation tool, with particular strength in the BG, an area of PVS related to vascular disease and pathology.

- **Summary**: DNN-based watermarking methods are rapidly developing and delivering impressive performances. Recent advances achieve resolution-agnostic image watermarking by reducing the variant resolution watermarking problem to a fixed resolution watermarking problem. However, such a reduction process can potentially introduce artifacts and low robustness. To address this issue, we propose the first, to the best of our knowledge, Resolution-Agnostic Image WaterMarking (RAIMark) framework by watermarking the implicit neural representation (INR) of image. Unlike previous methods, our method does not rely on the previous reduction process by directly watermarking the continuous signal instead of image pixels, thus achieving resolution-agnostic watermarking. Precisely, given an arbitrary-resolution image, we fit an INR for the target image. As a continuous signal, such an INR can be sampled to obtain images with variant resolutions. Then, we quickly fine-tune the fitted INR to get a watermarked INR conditioned on a binary secret message. A pre-trained watermark decoder extracts the hidden message from any sampled images with arbitrary resolutions. By directly watermarking INR, we achieve resolution-agnostic watermarking with increased robustness. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms previous methods with significant improvements: averagely improved bit accuracy by 7%$\sim$29%. Notably, we observe that previous methods are vulnerable to at least one watermarking attack (e.g. JPEG, crop, resize), while ours are robust against all watermarking attacks.



### No Time to Waste: Squeeze Time into Channel for Mobile Video Understanding

- **Summary**: Current architectures for video understanding mainly build upon 3D convolutional blocks or 2D convolutions with additional operations for temporal modeling. However, these methods all regard the temporal axis as a separate dimension of the video sequence, which requires large computation and memory budgets and thus limits their usage on mobile devices. In this paper, we propose to squeeze the time axis of a video sequence into the channel dimension and present a lightweight video recognition network, term as \textit{SqueezeTime}, for mobile video understanding. To enhance the temporal modeling capability of the proposed network, we design a Channel-Time Learning (CTL) Block to capture temporal dynamics of the sequence. This module has two complementary branches, in which one branch is for temporal importance learning and another branch with temporal position restoring capability is to enhance inter-temporal object modeling ability. The proposed SqueezeTime is much lightweight and fast with high accuracies for mobile video understanding. Extensive experiments on various video recognition and action detection benchmarks, i.e., Kinetics400, Kinetics600, HMDB51, AVA2.1 and THUMOS14, demonstrate the superiority of our model. For example, our SqueezeTime achieves $+1.2\%$ accuracy and $+80\%$ GPU throughput gain on Kinetics400 than prior methods. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/xinghaochen/SqueezeTime and https://github.com/mindspore-lab/models/tree/master/research/huawei-noah/SqueezeTime.

- **Summary**: Reports regarding the misuse of $\textit{Generative AI}$ ($\textit{GenAI}$) to create harmful deepfakes are emerging daily. Recently, defensive watermarking, which enables $\textit{GenAI}$ providers to hide fingerprints in their images to later use for deepfake detection, has been on the rise. Yet, its potential has not been fully explored. We present $\textit{UnMarker}$ -- the first practical $\textit{universal}$ attack on defensive watermarking. Unlike existing attacks, $\textit{UnMarker}$ requires no detector feedback, no unrealistic knowledge of the scheme or similar models, and no advanced denoising pipelines that may not be available. Instead, being the product of an in-depth analysis of the watermarking paradigm revealing that robust schemes must construct their watermarks in the spectral amplitudes, $\textit{UnMarker}$ employs two novel adversarial optimizations to disrupt the spectra of watermarked images, erasing the watermarks. Evaluations against the $\textit{SOTA}$ prove its effectiveness, not only defeating traditional schemes while retaining superior quality compared to existing attacks but also breaking $\textit{semantic}$ watermarks that alter the image's structure, reducing the best detection rate to $43\%$ and rendering them useless. To our knowledge, $\textit{UnMarker}$ is the first practical attack on $\textit{semantic}$ watermarks, which have been deemed the future of robust watermarking. $\textit{UnMarker}$ casts doubts on the very penitential of this countermeasure and exposes its paradoxical nature as designing schemes for robustness inevitably compromises other robustness aspects.

- **Summary**: Underwater imaging often suffers from low quality due to factors affecting light propagation and absorption in water. To improve image quality, some underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformer have been proposed. However, CNN-based UIE methods are limited in modeling long-range dependencies, and Transformer-based methods involve a large number of parameters and complex self-attention mechanisms, posing efficiency challenges. Considering computational complexity and severe underwater image degradation, a state space model (SSM) with linear computational complexity for UIE, named WaterMamba, is proposed. We propose spatial-channel omnidirectional selective scan (SCOSS) blocks comprising spatial-channel coordinate omnidirectional selective scan (SCCOSS) modules and a multi-scale feedforward network (MSFFN). The SCOSS block models pixel and channel information flow, addressing dependencies. The MSFFN facilitates information flow adjustment and promotes synchronized operations within SCCOSS modules. Extensive experiments showcase WaterMamba's cutting-edge performance with reduced parameters and computational resources, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on various datasets, validating its effectiveness and generalizability. The code will be released on GitHub after acceptance.

- **Summary**: Stereo image super-resolution (SR) refers to the reconstruction of a high-resolution (HR) image from a pair of low-resolution (LR) images as typically captured by a dual-camera device. To enhance the quality of SR images, most previous studies focused on increasing the number and size of feature maps and introducing complex and computationally intensive structures, resulting in models with high computational complexity. Here, we propose a simple yet efficient stereo image SR model called NAFRSSR, which is modified from the previous state-of-the-art model NAFSSR by introducing recursive connections and lightweighting the constituent modules. Our NAFRSSR model is composed of nonlinear activation free and group convolution-based blocks (NAFGCBlocks) and depth-separated stereo cross attention modules (DSSCAMs). The NAFGCBlock improves feature extraction and reduces number of parameters by removing the simple channel attention mechanism from NAFBlock and using group convolution. The DSSCAM enhances feature fusion and reduces number of parameters by replacing 1x1 pointwise convolution in SCAM with weight-shared 3x3 depthwise convolution. Besides, we propose to incorporate trainable edge detection operator into NAFRSSR to further improve the model performance. Four variants of NAFRSSR with different sizes, namely, NAFRSSR-Mobile (NAFRSSR-M), NAFRSSR-Tiny (NAFRSSR-T), NAFRSSR-Super (NAFRSSR-S) and NAFRSSR-Base (NAFRSSR-B) are designed, and they all exhibit fewer parameters, higher PSNR/SSIM, and faster speed than the previous state-of-the-art models. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, NAFRSSR-M is the lightest (0.28M parameters) and fastest (50 ms inference time) model achieving an average PSNR/SSIM as high as 24.657 dB/0.7622 on the benchmark datasets. Codes and models will be released at https://github.com/JNUChenYiHong/NAFRSSR.

- **Summary**: Robust road surface estimation is required for autonomous ground vehicles to navigate safely. Despite it becoming one of the main targets for autonomous mobility researchers in recent years, it is still an open problem in which cameras and LiDAR sensors have demonstrated to be adequate to predict the position, size and shape of the road a vehicle is driving on in different environments. In this work, a novel Convolutional Neural Network model is proposed for the accurate estimation of the roadway surface. Furthermore, an ablation study has been conducted to investigate how different encoding strategies affect model performance, testing 6 slightly different neural network architectures. Our model is based on the use of a Twin Encoder-Decoder Neural Network (TEDNet) for independent camera and LiDAR feature extraction, and has been trained and evaluated on the Kitti-Road dataset. Bird's Eye View projections of the camera and LiDAR data are used in this model to perform semantic segmentation on whether each pixel belongs to the road surface. The proposed method performs among other state-of-the-art methods and operates at the same frame-rate as the LiDAR and cameras, so it is adequate for its use in real-time applications.

- **Summary**: Image-to-image translation can create large impact in medical imaging, i.e. if images of a patient can be translated to another modality, type or sequence for better diagnosis. However, these methods must be validated by human reader studies, which are costly and restricted to small samples. Automatic evaluation of large samples to pre-evaluate and continuously improve methods before human validation is needed. In this study, we give an overview of reference and non-reference metrics for image synthesis assessment and investigate the ability of nine metrics, that need a reference (SSIM, MS-SSIM, PSNR, MSE, NMSE, MAE, LPIPS, NMI and PCC) and three non-reference metrics (BLUR, MSN, MNG) to detect 11 kinds of distortions in MR images from the BraSyn dataset. In addition we test a downstream segmentation metric and the effect of three normalization methods (Minmax, cMinMax and Zscore). Although PSNR and SSIM are frequently used to evaluate generative models for image-to-image-translation tasks in the medical domain, they show very specific shortcomings. SSIM ignores blurring but is very sensitive to intensity shifts in unnormalized MR images. PSNR is even more sensitive to different normalization methods and hardly measures the degree of distortions. Further metrics, such as LPIPS, NMI and DICE can be very useful to evaluate other similarity aspects. If the images to be compared are misaligned, most metrics are flawed. By carefully selecting and reasonably combining image similarity metrics, the training and selection of generative models for MR image synthesis can be improved. Many aspects of their output can be validated before final and costly evaluation by trained radiologists is conducted.

- **Summary**: Image matching is still challenging in such scenes with large viewpoints or illumination changes or with low textures. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based pseudo 3D image matching method. It upgrades the 2D features extracted from the source image to 3D features with the help of a reference image and matches to the 2D features extracted from the destination image by the coarse-to-fine 3D matching. Our key discovery is that by introducing the reference image, the source image's fine points are screened and furtherly their feature descriptors are enriched from 2D to 3D, which improves the match performance with the destination image. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art on the tasks of homography estimation, pose estimation and visual localization especially in challenging scenes.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Few-shot segmentation remains challenging due to the limitations of its labeling information for unseen classes. Most previous approaches rely on extracting high-level feature maps from the frozen visual encoder to compute the pixel-wise similarity as a key prior guidance for the decoder. However, such a prior representation suffers from coarse granularity and poor generalization to new classes since these high-level feature maps have obvious category bias. In this work, we propose to replace the visual prior representation with the visual-text alignment capacity to capture more reliable guidance and enhance the model generalization. Specifically, we design two kinds of training-free prior information generation strategy that attempts to utilize the semantic alignment capability of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training model (CLIP) to locate the target class. Besides, to acquire more accurate prior guidance, we build a high-order relationship of attention maps and utilize it to refine the initial prior information. Experiments on both the PASCAL-5{i} and COCO-20{i} datasets show that our method obtains a clearly substantial improvement and reaches the new state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: In this work, we introduce a novel method for calculating the 6DoF pose of an object using a single RGB-D image. Unlike existing methods that either directly predict objects' poses or rely on sparse keypoints for pose recovery, our approach addresses this challenging task using dense correspondence, i.e., we regress the object coordinates for each visible pixel. Our method leverages existing object detection methods. We incorporate a re-projection mechanism to adjust the camera's intrinsic matrix to accommodate cropping in RGB-D images. Moreover, we transform the 3D object coordinates into a residual representation, which can effectively reduce the output space and yield superior performance. We conducted extensive experiments to validate the efficacy of our approach for 6D pose estimation. Our approach outperforms most previous methods, especially in occlusion scenarios, and demonstrates notable improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In recent years, deep learning has greatly streamlined the process of generating realistic fake face images. Aware of the dangers, researchers have developed various tools to spot these counterfeits. Yet none asked the fundamental question: What digital manipulations make a real photographic face image fake, while others do not? In this paper, we put face forgery in a semantic context and define that computational methods that alter semantic face attributes to exceed human discrimination thresholds are sources of face forgery. Guided by our new definition, we construct a large face forgery image dataset, where each image is associated with a set of labels organized in a hierarchical graph. Our dataset enables two new testing protocols to probe the generalization of face forgery detectors. Moreover, we propose a semantics-oriented face forgery detection method that captures label relations and prioritizes the primary task (\ie, real or fake face detection). We show that the proposed dataset successfully exposes the weaknesses of current detectors as the test set and consistently improves their generalizability as the training set. Additionally, we demonstrate the superiority of our semantics-oriented method over traditional binary and multi-class classification-based detectors.

- **Summary**: Deep learning methods, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT), are frequently employed to perform semantic segmentation of high-resolution remotely sensed images. However, CNNs are constrained by their restricted receptive fields, while ViTs face challenges due to their quadratic complexity. Recently, the Mamba model, featuring linear complexity and a global receptive field, has gained extensive attention for vision tasks. In such tasks, images need to be serialized to form sequences compatible with the Mamba model. Numerous research efforts have explored scanning strategies to serialize images, aiming to enhance the Mamba model's understanding of images. However, the effectiveness of these scanning strategies remains uncertain. In this research, we conduct a comprehensive experimental investigation on the impact of mainstream scanning directions and their combinations on semantic segmentation of remotely sensed images. Through extensive experiments on the LoveDA, ISPRS Potsdam, and ISPRS Vaihingen datasets, we demonstrate that no single scanning strategy outperforms others, regardless of their complexity or the number of scanning directions involved. A simple, single scanning direction is deemed sufficient for semantic segmentation of high-resolution remotely sensed images. Relevant directions for future research are also recommended.

- **Summary**: Class-incremental learning (CIL) has emerged as a means to learn new classes incrementally without catastrophic forgetting of previous classes. Recently, CIL has undergone a paradigm shift towards dynamic architectures due to their superior performance. However, these models are still limited by the following aspects: (i) Data augmentation (DA), which are tightly coupled with CIL, remains under-explored in dynamic architecture scenarios. (ii) Feature representation. The discriminativeness of dynamic feature are sub-optimal and possess potential for refinement. (iii) Classifier. The misalignment between dynamic feature and classifier constrains the capabilities of the model. To tackle the aforementioned drawbacks, we propose the Dynamic Feature Learning and Matching (DFLM) model in this paper from above three perspectives. Specifically, we firstly introduce class weight information and non-stationary functions to extend the mix DA method for dynamically adjusting the focus on memory during training. Then, von Mises-Fisher (vMF) classifier is employed to effectively model the dynamic feature distribution and implicitly learn their discriminative properties. Finally, the matching loss is proposed to facilitate the alignment between the learned dynamic features and the classifier by minimizing the distribution distance. Extensive experiments on CIL benchmarks validate that our proposed model achieves significant performance improvements over existing methods.

- **Summary**: In visual tasks, large teacher models capture essential features and deep information, enhancing performance. However, distilling this information into smaller student models often leads to performance loss due to structural differences and capacity limitations. To tackle this, we propose a distillation framework based on graph knowledge, including a multi-level feature alignment strategy and an attention-guided mechanism to provide a targeted learning trajectory for the student model. We emphasize spectral embedding (SE) as a key technique in our distillation process, which merges the student's feature space with the relational knowledge and structural complexities similar to the teacher network. This method captures the teacher's understanding in a graph-based representation, enabling the student model to more accurately mimic the complex structural dependencies present in the teacher model. Compared to methods that focus only on specific distillation areas, our strategy not only considers key features within the teacher model but also endeavors to capture the relationships and interactions among feature sets, encoding these complex pieces of information into a graph structure to understand and utilize the dynamic relationships among these pieces of information from a global perspective. Experiments show that our method outperforms previous feature distillation methods on the CIFAR-100, MS-COCO, and Pascal VOC datasets, proving its efficiency and applicability.

- **Summary**: Portrait images typically consist of a salient person against diverse backgrounds. With the development of mobile devices and image processing techniques, users can conveniently capture portrait images anytime and anywhere. However, the quality of these portraits may suffer from the degradation caused by unfavorable environmental conditions, subpar photography techniques, and inferior capturing devices. In this paper, we introduce a dual-branch network for portrait image quality assessment (PIQA), which can effectively address how the salient person and the background of a portrait image influence its visual quality. Specifically, we utilize two backbone networks (\textit{i.e.,} Swin Transformer-B) to extract the quality-aware features from the entire portrait image and the facial image cropped from it. To enhance the quality-aware feature representation of the backbones, we pre-train them on the large-scale video quality assessment dataset LSVQ and the large-scale facial image quality assessment dataset GFIQA. Additionally, we leverage LIQE, an image scene classification and quality assessment model, to capture the quality-aware and scene-specific features as the auxiliary features. Finally, we concatenate these features and regress them into quality scores via a multi-perception layer (MLP). We employ the fidelity loss to train the model via a learning-to-rank manner to mitigate inconsistencies in quality scores in the portrait image quality assessment dataset PIQ. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in the PIQ dataset, validating its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the problem of pathological lung segmentation, a significant challenge in medical image analysis, particularly pronounced in cases of peripheral opacities (severe fibrosis and consolidation) because of the textural similarity between lung tissue and surrounding areas. To overcome these challenges, this paper emphasizes the use of CycleGAN for unpaired image-to-image translation, in order to provide an augmentation method able to generate fake pathological images matching an existing ground truth. Although previous studies have employed CycleGAN, they often neglect the challenge of shape deformation, which is crucial for accurate medical image segmentation. Our work introduces an innovative strategy that incorporates additional loss functions. Specifically, it proposes an L1 loss based on the lung surrounding which shape is constrained to remain unchanged at the transition from the healthy to pathological domains. The lung surrounding is derived based on ground truth lung masks available in the healthy domain. Furthermore, preprocessing steps, such as cropping based on ribs/vertebra locations, are applied to refine the input for the CycleGAN, ensuring that the network focus on the lung region. This is essential to avoid extraneous biases, such as the zoom effect bias, which can divert attention from the main task. The method is applied to enhance in semi-supervised manner the lung segmentation process by employing a U-Net model trained with on-the-fly data augmentation incorporating synthetic pathological tissues generated by the CycleGAN model. Preliminary results from this research demonstrate significant qualitative and quantitative improvements, setting a new benchmark in the field of pathological lung segmentation.

- **Summary**: Although pre-training on a large amount of data is beneficial for robot learning, current paradigms only perform large-scale pretraining for visual representations, whereas representations for other modalities are trained from scratch. In contrast to the abundance of visual data, it is unclear what relevant internet-scale data may be used for pretraining other modalities such as tactile sensing. Such pretraining becomes increasingly crucial in the low-data regimes common in robotics applications. In this paper, we address this gap by using contact microphones as an alternative tactile sensor. Our key insight is that contact microphones capture inherently audio-based information, allowing us to leverage large-scale audio-visual pretraining to obtain representations that boost the performance of robotic manipulation. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first approach leveraging large-scale multisensory pre-training for robotic manipulation.

- **Summary**: Image stitching aims to construct a wide field of view with high spatial resolution, which cannot be achieved in a single exposure. Typically, conventional image stitching techniques, other than deep learning, require complex computation and thus computational pricy, especially for stitching large raw images. In this study, inspired by the multiscale feature of fluid turbulence, we developed a fast feature point detection algorithm named local-peak scale-invariant feature transform (LP-SIFT), based on the multiscale local peaks and scale-invariant feature transform method. By combining LP-SIFT and RANSAC in image stitching, the stitching speed can be improved by orders, compared with the original SIFT method. Nine large images (over 2600*1600 pixels), arranged randomly without prior knowledge, can be stitched within 158.94 s. The algorithm is highly practical for applications requiring a wide field of view in diverse application scenes, e.g., terrain mapping, biological analysis, and even criminal investigation.

- **Summary**: Domain generalization aims to develop models that are robust to distribution shifts. Existing methods focus on learning invariance across domains to enhance model robustness, and data augmentation has been widely used to learn invariant predictors, with most methods performing augmentation in the input space. However, augmentation in the input space has limited diversity whereas in the feature space is more versatile and has shown promising results. Nonetheless, feature semantics is seldom considered and existing feature augmentation methods suffer from a limited variety of augmented features. We decompose features into class-generic, class-specific, domain-generic, and domain-specific components. We propose a cross-domain feature augmentation method named XDomainMix that enables us to increase sample diversity while emphasizing the learning of invariant representations to achieve domain generalization. Experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative analysis indicates that our feature augmentation approach facilitates the learning of effective models that are invariant across different domains.

- **Summary**: Tissue tracking in echocardiography is challenging due to the complex cardiac motion and the inherent nature of ultrasound acquisitions. Although optical flow methods are considered state-of-the-art (SOTA), they struggle with long-range tracking, noise occlusions, and drift throughout the cardiac cycle. Recently, novel learning-based point tracking techniques have been introduced to tackle some of these issues. In this paper, we build upon these techniques and introduce EchoTracker, a two-fold coarse-to-fine model that facilitates the tracking of queried points on a tissue surface across ultrasound image sequences. The architecture contains a preliminary coarse initialization of the trajectories, followed by reinforcement iterations based on fine-grained appearance changes. It is efficient, light, and can run on mid-range GPUs. Experiments demonstrate that the model outperforms SOTA methods, with an average position accuracy of 67% and a median trajectory error of 2.86 pixels. Furthermore, we show a relative improvement of 25% when using our model to calculate the global longitudinal strain (GLS) in a clinical test-retest dataset compared to other methods. This implies that learning-based point tracking can potentially improve performance and yield a higher diagnostic and prognostic value for clinical measurements than current techniques.

- **Summary**: In many applications, the demand arises for algorithms capable of aligning partially overlapping point sets while remaining invariant to the corresponding transformations. This research presents a method designed to meet such requirements through minimization of the objective function of the robust point matching (RPM) algorithm. First, we show that the RPM objective is a cubic polynomial. Then, through variable substitution, we transform the RPM objective to a quadratic function. Leveraging the convex envelope of bilinear monomials, we proceed to relax the resulting objective function, thus obtaining a lower bound problem that can be conveniently decomposed into distinct linear assignment and low-dimensional convex quadratic program components, both amenable to efficient optimization. Furthermore, a branch-and-bound (BnB) algorithm is devised, which solely branches over the transformation parameters, thereby boosting convergence rate. Empirical evaluations demonstrate better robustness of the proposed methodology against non-rigid deformation, positional noise, and outliers, particularly in scenarios where outliers remain distinct from inliers, when compared with prevailing state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: The nature of diversity in real-world environments necessitates neural network models to expand from closed category settings to accommodate novel emerging categories. In this paper, we study the open-vocabulary object detection (OVD), which facilitates the detection of novel object classes under the supervision of only base annotations and open-vocabulary knowledge. However, we find that the inadequacy of neighboring relationships between regions during the alignment process inevitably constrains the performance on recent distillation-based OVD strategies. To this end, we propose Neighboring Region Attention Alignment (NRAA), which performs alignment within the attention mechanism of a set of neighboring regions to boost the open-vocabulary inference. Specifically, for a given proposal region, we randomly explore the neighboring boxes and conduct our proposed neighboring region attention (NRA) mechanism to extract relationship information. Then, this interaction information is seamlessly provided into the distillation procedure to assist the alignment between the detector and the pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). Extensive experiments validate that our proposed model exhibits superior performance on open-vocabulary benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Field(NeRF) is an novel implicit method to achieve the 3D reconstruction and representation with a high resolution. After the first research of NeRF is proposed, NeRF has gained a robust developing power and is booming in the 3D modeling, representation and reconstruction areas. However the first and most of the followed research projects based on NeRF is static, which are weak in the practical applications. Therefore, more researcher are interested and focused on the study of dynamic NeRF that is more feasible and useful in practical applications or situations. Compared with the static NeRF, implementing the Dynamic NeRF is more difficult and complex. But Dynamic is more potential in the future even is the basic of Editable NeRF. In this review, we made a detailed and abundant statement for the development and important implementation principles of Dynamci NeRF. The analysis of main principle and development of Dynamic NeRF is from 2021 to 2023, including the most of the Dynamic NeRF projects. What is more, with colorful and novel special designed figures and table, We also made a detailed comparison and analysis of different features of various of Dynamic. Besides, we analyzed and discussed the key methods to implement a Dynamic NeRF. The volume of the reference papers is large. The statements and comparisons are multidimensional. With a reading of this review, the whole development history and most of the main design method or principles of Dynamic NeRF can be easy understood and gained.

- **Summary**: With recent advances in deep learning, numerous algorithms have been developed to enhance video quality, reduce visual artefacts and improve perceptual quality. However, little research has been reported on the quality assessment of enhanced content - the evaluation of enhancement methods is often based on quality metrics that were designed for compression applications. In this paper, we propose a novel blind deep video quality assessment (VQA) method specifically for enhanced video content. It employs a new Recurrent Memory Transformer (RMT) based network architecture to obtain video quality representations, which is optimised through a novel content-quality-aware contrastive learning strategy based on a new database containing 13K training patches with enhanced content. The extracted quality representations are then combined through linear regression to generate video-level quality indices. The proposed method, RMT-BVQA, has been evaluated on the VDPVE (VQA Dataset for Perceptual Video Enhancement) database through a five-fold cross validation. The results show its superior correlation performance when compared to ten existing no-reference quality metrics.

- **Summary**: With the increasing use of neural networks in critical systems, runtime monitoring becomes essential to reject unsafe predictions during inference. Various techniques have emerged to establish rejection scores that maximize the separability between the distributions of safe and unsafe predictions. The efficacy of these approaches is mostly evaluated using threshold-agnostic metrics, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. However, in real-world applications, an effective monitor also requires identifying a good threshold to transform these scores into meaningful binary decisions. Despite the pivotal importance of threshold optimization, this problem has received little attention. A few studies touch upon this question, but they typically assume that the runtime data distribution mirrors the training distribution, which is a strong assumption as monitors are supposed to safeguard a system against potentially unforeseen threats. In this work, we present rigorous experiments on various image datasets to investigate: 1. The effectiveness of monitors in handling unforeseen threats, which are not available during threshold adjustments. 2. Whether integrating generic threats into the threshold optimization scheme can enhance the robustness of monitors.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is an approach to extract useful feature representations from unlabeled data, and enable fine-tuning on downstream tasks with limited labeled examples. Self-pretraining is a SSL approach that uses the curated task dataset for both pretraining the networks and fine-tuning them. Availability of large, diverse, and uncurated public medical image sets provides the opportunity to apply SSL in the "wild" and potentially extract features robust to imaging variations. However, the benefit of wild- vs self-pretraining has not been studied for medical image analysis. In this paper, we compare robustness of wild versus self-pretrained transformer (vision transformer [ViT] and hierarchical shifted window [Swin]) models to computed tomography (CT) imaging differences for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) segmentation. Wild-pretrained Swin models outperformed self-pretrained Swin for the various imaging acquisitions. ViT resulted in similar accuracy for both wild- and self-pretrained models. Masked image prediction pretext task that forces networks to learn the local structure resulted in higher accuracy compared to contrastive task that models global image information. Wild-pretrained models resulted in higher feature reuse at the lower level layers and feature differentiation close to output layer after fine-tuning. Hence, we conclude: Wild-pretrained networks were more robust to analyzed CT imaging differences for lung tumor segmentation than self-pretrained methods. Swin architecture benefited from such pretraining more than ViT.

- **Summary**: The increasing complexity of Artificial Intelligence models poses challenges to interpretability, particularly in the healthcare sector. This study investigates the impact of deep learning model complexity and Explainable AI (XAI) efficacy, utilizing four ResNet architectures (ResNet-18, 34, 50, 101). Through methodical experimentation on 4,369 lung X-ray images of COVID-19-infected and healthy patients, the research evaluates models' classification performance and the relevance of corresponding XAI explanations with respect to the ground-truth disease masks. Results indicate that the increase in model complexity is associated with a decrease in classification accuracy and AUC-ROC scores (ResNet-18: 98.4%, 0.997; ResNet-101: 95.9%, 0.988). Notably, in eleven out of twelve statistical tests performed, no statistically significant differences occurred between XAI quantitative metrics - Relevance Rank Accuracy and the proposed Positive Attribution Ratio - across trained models. These results suggest that increased model complexity does not consistently lead to higher performance or relevance of explanations for models' decision-making processes.

- **Summary**: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in natural vision tasks, motivating researchers across domains to explore domain-specific VLMs. However, the construction of powerful domain-specific VLMs demands vast amounts of annotated data, substantial electrical energy, and computing resources, primarily accessible to industry, yet hindering VLM research in academia. To address this challenge and foster sustainable and equitable VLM research, we present the Generalized Domain Prompt Learning (GDPL) framework. GDPL facilitates the transfer of VLMs' robust recognition capabilities from natural vision to specialized domains, without the need for extensive data or resources. By leveraging small-scale domain-specific foundation models and minimal prompt samples, GDPL empowers the language branch with domain knowledge through quaternion networks, uncovering cross-modal relationships between domain-specific vision features and natural vision-based contextual embeddings. Simultaneously, GDPL guides the vision branch into specific domains through hierarchical propagation of generated vision prompt features, grounded in well-matched vision-language relations. Furthermore, to fully harness the domain adaptation potential of VLMs, we introduce a novel low-rank adaptation approach. Extensive experiments across diverse domains like remote sensing, medical imaging, geology, Synthetic Aperture Radar, and fluid dynamics, validate the efficacy of GDPL, demonstrating its ability to achieve state-of-the-art domain recognition performance in a prompt learning paradigm. Our framework paves the way for sustainable and inclusive VLM research, transcending the barriers between academia and industry.

- **Summary**: Depth estimation plays a crucial role in various tasks within endoscopic surgery, including navigation, surface reconstruction, and augmented reality visualization. Despite the significant achievements of foundation models in vision tasks, including depth estimation, their direct application to the medical domain often results in suboptimal performance. This highlights the need for efficient adaptation methods to adapt these models to endoscopic depth estimation. We propose Endoscopic Depth Any Camera (EndoDAC) which is an efficient self-supervised depth estimation framework that adapts foundation models to endoscopic scenes. Specifically, we develop the Dynamic Vector-Based Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LoRA) and employ Convolutional Neck blocks to tailor the foundational model to the surgical domain, utilizing remarkably few trainable parameters. Given that camera information is not always accessible, we also introduce a self-supervised adaptation strategy that estimates camera intrinsics using the pose encoder. Our framework is capable of being trained solely on monocular surgical videos from any camera, ensuring minimal training costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach obtains superior performance even with fewer training epochs and unaware of the ground truth camera intrinsics.

- **Summary**: Numerous studies have revealed that deep learning-based medical image classification models may exhibit bias towards specific demographic attributes, such as race, gender, and age. Existing bias mitigation methods often achieve high level of fairness at the cost of significant accuracy degradation. In response to this challenge, we propose an innovative and adaptable Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss-based channel pruning framework, which achieves fairness through channel pruning. Traditionally, channel pruning is utilized to accelerate neural network inference. However, our work demonstrates that pruning can also be a potent tool for achieving fairness. Our key insight is that different channels in a layer contribute differently to the accuracy of different groups. By selectively pruning critical channels that lead to the accuracy difference between the privileged and unprivileged groups, we can effectively improve fairness without sacrificing accuracy significantly. Experiments conducted on two skin lesion diagnosis datasets across multiple sensitive attributes validate the effectiveness of our method in achieving state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and fairness. Our code is available at https://github.com/Kqp1227/Sensitive-Channel-Pruning.

- **Summary**: Addressing multi-label action recognition in videos represents a significant challenge for robotic applications in dynamic environments, especially when the robot is required to cooperate with humans in tasks that involve objects. Existing methods still struggle to recognize unseen actions or require extensive training data. To overcome these problems, we propose Dual-VCLIP, a unified approach for zero-shot multi-label action recognition. Dual-VCLIP enhances VCLIP, a zero-shot action recognition method, with the DualCoOp method for multi-label image classification. The strength of our method is that at training time it only learns two prompts, and it is therefore much simpler than other methods. We validate our method on the Charades dataset that includes a majority of object-based actions, demonstrating that -- despite its simplicity -- our method performs favorably with respect to existing methods on the complete dataset, and promising performance when tested on unseen actions. Our contribution emphasizes the impact of verb-object class-splits during robots' training for new cooperative tasks, highlighting the influence on the performance and giving insights into mitigating biases.

- **Summary**: We present a simple algorithm for differentiable rendering of surfaces represented by Signed Distance Fields (SDF), which makes it easy to integrate rendering into gradient-based optimization pipelines. To tackle visibility-related derivatives that make rendering non-differentiable, existing physically based differentiable rendering methods often rely on elaborate guiding data structures or reparameterization with a global impact on variance. In this article, we investigate an alternative that embraces nonzero bias in exchange for low variance and architectural simplicity. Our method expands the lower-dimensional boundary integral into a thin band that is easy to sample when the underlying surface is represented by an SDF. We demonstrate the performance and robustness of our formulation in end-to-end inverse rendering tasks, where it obtains results that are competitive with or superior to existing work.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a simple but effective method to enhance blind video quality assessment (BVQA) models for social media videos. Motivated by previous researches that leverage pre-trained features extracted from various computer vision models as the feature representation for BVQA, we further explore rich quality-aware features from pre-trained blind image quality assessment (BIQA) and BVQA models as auxiliary features to help the BVQA model to handle complex distortions and diverse content of social media videos. Specifically, we use SimpleVQA, a BVQA model that consists of a trainable Swin Transformer-B and a fixed SlowFast, as our base model. The Swin Transformer-B and SlowFast components are responsible for extracting spatial and motion features, respectively. Then, we extract three kinds of features from Q-Align, LIQE, and FAST-VQA to capture frame-level quality-aware features, frame-level quality-aware along with scene-specific features, and spatiotemporal quality-aware features, respectively. Through concatenating these features, we employ a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network to regress them into quality scores. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves the best performance on three public social media VQA datasets. Moreover, the proposed model won first place in the CVPR NTIRE 2024 Short-form UGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/sunwei925/RQ-VQA.git}.

- **Summary**: We present Hunyuan-DiT, a text-to-image diffusion transformer with fine-grained understanding of both English and Chinese. To construct Hunyuan-DiT, we carefully design the transformer structure, text encoder, and positional encoding. We also build from scratch a whole data pipeline to update and evaluate data for iterative model optimization. For fine-grained language understanding, we train a Multimodal Large Language Model to refine the captions of the images. Finally, Hunyuan-DiT can perform multi-turn multimodal dialogue with users, generating and refining images according to the context. Through our holistic human evaluation protocol with more than 50 professional human evaluators, Hunyuan-DiT sets a new state-of-the-art in Chinese-to-image generation compared with other open-source models.

- **Summary**: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to train a model which can segment the object from novel classes with a few labeled samples. The insufficient generalization ability of models leads to unsatisfactory performance when the models lack enough labeled data from the novel classes. Considering that there are abundant unlabeled data available, it is promising to improve the generalization ability by exploiting these various data. For leveraging unlabeled data, we propose a novel method, named Image to Pseudo-Episode (IPE), to generate pseudo-episodes from unlabeled data. Specifically, our method contains two modules, i.e., the pseudo-label generation module and the episode generation module. The former module generates pseudo-labels from unlabeled images by the spectral clustering algorithm, and the latter module generates pseudo-episodes from pseudo-labeled images by data augmentation methods. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-$5^i$ and COCO-$20^i$ demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance for FSS.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical when deploying machine learning models in the real world. Outlier exposure methods, which incorporate auxiliary outlier data in the training process, can drastically improve OOD detection performance compared to approaches without advanced training strategies. We introduce Hopfield Boosting, a boosting approach, which leverages modern Hopfield energy (MHE) to sharpen the decision boundary between the in-distribution and OOD data. Hopfield Boosting encourages the model to concentrate on hard-to-distinguish auxiliary outlier examples that lie close to the decision boundary between in-distribution and auxiliary outlier data. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art in OOD detection with outlier exposure, improving the FPR95 metric from 2.28 to 0.92 on CIFAR-10 and from 11.76 to 7.94 on CIFAR-100.

- **Summary**: The superior performance of modern visual backbones usually comes with a costly training procedure. We contribute to this issue by generalizing the idea of curriculum learning beyond its original formulation, i.e., training models using easier-to-harder data. Specifically, we reformulate the training curriculum as a soft-selection function, which uncovers progressively more difficult patterns within each example during training, instead of performing easier-to-harder sample selection. Our work is inspired by an intriguing observation on the learning dynamics of visual backbones: during the earlier stages of training, the model predominantly learns to recognize some 'easier-to-learn' discriminative patterns in the data. These patterns, when observed through frequency and spatial domains, incorporate lower-frequency components, and the natural image contents without distortion or data augmentation. Motivated by these findings, we propose a curriculum where the model always leverages all the training data at every learning stage, yet the exposure to the 'easier-to-learn' patterns of each example is initiated first, with harder patterns gradually introduced as training progresses. To implement this idea in a computationally efficient way, we introduce a cropping operation in the Fourier spectrum of the inputs, enabling the model to learn from only the lower-frequency components. Then we show that exposing the contents of natural images can be readily achieved by modulating the intensity of data augmentation. Finally, we integrate these aspects and design curriculum schedules with tailored search algorithms. The resulting method, EfficientTrain++, is simple, general, yet surprisingly effective. It reduces the training time of a wide variety of popular models by 1.5-3.0x on ImageNet-1K/22K without sacrificing accuracy. It also demonstrates efficacy in self-supervised learning (e.g., MAE).

- **Summary**: Indian folk paintings have a rich mosaic of symbols, colors, textures, and stories making them an invaluable repository of cultural legacy. The paper presents a novel approach to classifying these paintings into distinct art forms and tagging them with their unique salient features. A custom dataset named FolkTalent, comprising 2279 digital images of paintings across 12 different forms, has been prepared using websites that are direct outlets of Indian folk paintings. Tags covering a wide range of attributes like color, theme, artistic style, and patterns are generated using GPT4, and verified by an expert for each painting. Classification is performed employing the RandomForest ensemble technique on fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to classify Indian folk paintings, achieving an accuracy of 91.83%. Tagging is accomplished via the prominent fine-tuned CNN-based backbones with a custom classifier attached to its top to perform multi-label image classification. The generated tags offer a deeper insight into the painting, enabling an enhanced search experience based on theme and visual attributes. The proposed hybrid model sets a new benchmark in folk painting classification and tagging, significantly contributing to cataloging India's folk-art heritage.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has enabled breakthroughs in automated diagnosis from medical imaging, with many successful applications in ophthalmology. However, standard medical image classification approaches only assess disease presence at the time of acquisition, neglecting the common clinical setting of longitudinal imaging. For slow, progressive eye diseases like age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), patients undergo repeated imaging over time to track disease progression and forecasting the future risk of developing disease is critical to properly plan treatment. Our proposed Longitudinal Transformer for Survival Analysis (LTSA) enables dynamic disease prognosis from longitudinal medical imaging, modeling the time to disease from sequences of fundus photography images captured over long, irregular time periods. Using longitudinal imaging data from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS), LTSA significantly outperformed a single-image baseline in 19/20 head-to-head comparisons on late AMD prognosis and 18/20 comparisons on POAG prognosis. A temporal attention analysis also suggested that, while the most recent image is typically the most influential, prior imaging still provides additional prognostic value.

- **Summary**: The Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) is pivotal in the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer through MRI imaging. Current deep learning-based PI-RADS scoring methods often lack the incorporation of essential PI-RADS clinical guidelines~(PICG) utilized by radiologists, potentially compromising scoring accuracy. This paper introduces a novel approach that adapts a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to incorporate PICG into PI-RADS scoring without additional annotations and network parameters. We present a two-stage fine-tuning process aimed at adapting MLLMs originally trained on natural images to the MRI data domain while effectively integrating the PICG. In the first stage, we develop a domain adapter layer specifically tailored for processing 3D MRI image inputs and design the MLLM instructions to differentiate MRI modalities effectively. In the second stage, we translate PICG into guiding instructions for the model to generate PICG-guided image features. Through feature distillation, we align scoring network features with the PICG-guided image feature, enabling the scoring network to effectively incorporate the PICG information. We develop our model on a public dataset and evaluate it in a real-world challenging in-house dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of current scoring networks.

- **Summary**: Datasets labelled by human annotators are widely used in the training and testing of machine learning models. In recent years, researchers are increasingly paying attention to label quality. However, it is not always possible to objectively determine whether an assigned label is correct or not. The present work investigates this ambiguity in the annotation of autonomous driving datasets as an important dimension of data quality. Our experiments show that excluding highly ambiguous data from the training improves model performance of a state-of-the-art pedestrian detector in terms of LAMR, precision and F1 score, thereby saving training time and annotation costs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in order to safely remove ambiguous instances and ensure the retained representativeness of the training data, an understanding of the properties of the dataset and class under investigation is crucial.

- **Summary**: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have proven flexible and generalisable across many tasks and fields. Although they have strong potential to aid scientific research, their capabilities in this domain are not well characterised. A key aspect of scientific research is the ability to understand and interpret figures, which serve as a rich, compressed source of complex information. In this work, we present SciFIBench, a scientific figure interpretation benchmark. Our main benchmark consists of a 1000-question gold set of multiple-choice questions split between two tasks across 12 categories. The questions are curated from CS arXiv paper figures and captions, using adversarial filtering to find hard negatives and human verification for quality control. We evaluate 26 LMMs on SciFIBench, finding it to be a challenging benchmark. Finally, we investigate the alignment and reasoning faithfulness of the LMMs on augmented question sets from our benchmark. We release SciFIBench to encourage progress in this domain.

- **Summary**: Current datasets for long-form video understanding often fall short of providing genuine long-form comprehension challenges, as many tasks derived from these datasets can be successfully tackled by analyzing just one or a few random frames from a video. To address this issue, we present a novel dataset and benchmark, CinePile, specifically designed for authentic long-form video understanding. This paper details our innovative approach for creating a question-answer dataset, utilizing advanced LLMs with human-in-the-loop and building upon human-generated raw data. Our comprehensive dataset comprises 305,000 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), covering various visual and multimodal aspects, including temporal comprehension, understanding human-object interactions, and reasoning about events or actions within a scene. Additionally, we evaluate recent video-centric LLMs, both open-source and proprietary, on the test split of our dataset. The findings reveal that even state-of-the-art video-centric LLMs significantly lag behind human performance in these tasks, highlighting the complexity and challenge inherent in video understanding.

- **Summary**: We propose a simple strategy for masking image patches during visual-language contrastive learning that improves the quality of the learned representations and the training speed. During each iteration of training, we randomly mask clusters of visually similar image patches, as measured by their raw pixel intensities. This provides an extra learning signal, beyond the contrastive training itself, since it forces a model to predict words for masked visual structures solely from context. It also speeds up training by reducing the amount of data used in each image. We evaluate the effectiveness of our model by pre-training on a number of benchmarks, finding that it outperforms other masking strategies, such as FLIP, on the quality of the learned representation.

- **Summary**: Current video summarization methods primarily depend on supervised computer vision techniques, which demands time-consuming manual annotations. Further, the annotations are always subjective which make this task more challenging. To address these issues, we analyzed the feasibility in transforming the video summarization into a text summary task and leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to boost video summarization. This paper proposes a novel self-supervised framework for video summarization guided by LLMs. Our method begins by generating captions for video frames, which are then synthesized into text summaries by LLMs. Subsequently, we measure semantic distance between the frame captions and the text summary. It's worth noting that we propose a novel loss function to optimize our model according to the diversity of the video. Finally, the summarized video can be generated by selecting the frames whose captions are similar with the text summary. Our model achieves competitive results against other state-of-the-art methods and paves a novel pathway in video summarization.

- **Summary**: Many query-based approaches for 3D Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) adopt the tracking-by-attention paradigm, utilizing track queries for identity-consistent detection and object queries for identity-agnostic track spawning. Tracking-by-attention, however, entangles detection and tracking queries in one embedding for both the detection and tracking task, which is sub-optimal. Other approaches resemble the tracking-by-detection paradigm, detecting objects using decoupled track and detection queries followed by a subsequent association. These methods, however, do not leverage synergies between the detection and association task. Combining the strengths of both paradigms, we introduce ADA-Track, a novel end-to-end framework for 3D MOT from multi-view cameras. We introduce a learnable data association module based on edge-augmented cross-attention, leveraging appearance and geometric features. Furthermore, we integrate this association module into the decoder layer of a DETR-based 3D detector, enabling simultaneous DETR-like query-to-image cross-attention for detection and query-to-query cross-attention for data association. By stacking these decoder layers, queries are refined for the detection and association task alternately, effectively harnessing the task dependencies. We evaluate our method on the nuScenes dataset and demonstrate the advantage of our approach compared to the two previous paradigms. Code is available at https://github.com/dsx0511/ADA-Track.

- **Summary**: CLIP models perform remarkably well on zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks. But recent studies have shown that learnt representations in CLIP are not well suited for dense prediction tasks like object detection, semantic segmentation or depth estimation. More recently, multi-stage training methods for CLIP models was introduced to mitigate the weak performance of CLIP on downstream tasks. In this work, we find that simply improving the quality of captions in image-text datasets improves the quality of CLIP's visual representations, resulting in significant improvement on downstream dense prediction vision tasks. In fact, we find that CLIP pretraining with good quality captions can surpass recent supervised, self-supervised and weakly supervised pretraining methods. We show that when CLIP model with ViT-B/16 as image encoder is trained on well aligned image-text pairs it obtains 12.1% higher mIoU and 11.5% lower RMSE on semantic segmentation and depth estimation tasks over recent state-of-the-art Masked Image Modeling (MIM) pretraining methods like Masked Autoencoder (MAE). We find that mobile architectures also benefit significantly from CLIP pretraining. A recent mobile vision architecture, MCi2, with CLIP pretraining obtains similar performance as Swin-L, pretrained on ImageNet-22k for semantic segmentation task while being 6.1$\times$ smaller. Moreover, we show that improving caption quality results in $10\times$ data efficiency when finetuning for dense prediction tasks.

- **Summary**: A recent study by De et al. (2022) has reported that large-scale representation learning through pre-training on a public dataset significantly enhances differentially private (DP) learning in downstream tasks, despite the high dimensionality of the feature space. To theoretically explain this phenomenon, we consider the setting of a layer-peeled model in representation learning, which results in interesting phenomena related to learned features in deep learning and transfer learning, known as Neural Collapse (NC).   Within the framework of NC, we establish an error bound indicating that the misclassification error is independent of dimension when the distance between actual features and the ideal ones is smaller than a threshold. Additionally, the quality of the features in the last layer is empirically evaluated under different pre-trained models within the framework of NC, showing that a more powerful transformer leads to a better feature representation. Furthermore, we reveal that DP fine-tuning is less robust compared to fine-tuning without DP, particularly in the presence of perturbations. These observations are supported by both theoretical analyses and experimental evaluation. Moreover, to enhance the robustness of DP fine-tuning, we suggest several strategies, such as feature normalization or employing dimension reduction methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Empirically, we demonstrate a significant improvement in testing accuracy by conducting PCA on the last-layer features.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes leveraging vision-language pretraining on bone X-rays paired with French reports to address downstream tasks of interest on bone radiography. A practical processing pipeline is introduced to anonymize and process French medical reports. Pretraining then consists in the self-supervised alignment of visual and textual embedding spaces derived from deep model encoders. The resulting image encoder is then used to handle various downstream tasks, including quantification of osteoarthritis, estimation of bone age on pediatric wrists, bone fracture and anomaly detection. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance on downstream tasks, compared to alternatives requiring a significantly larger amount of human expert annotations. Our work stands as the first study to integrate French reports to shape the embedding space devoted to bone X-Rays representations, capitalizing on the large quantity of paired images and reports data available in an hospital. By relying on generic vision-laguage deep models in a language-specific scenario, it contributes to the deployement of vision models for wider healthcare applications.

- **Summary**: In recent years, street view imagery has grown to become one of the most important sources of geospatial data collection and urban analytics, which facilitates generating meaningful insights and assisting in decision-making. Synthesizing a street-view image from its corresponding satellite image is a challenging task due to the significant differences in appearance and viewpoint between the two domains. In this study, we screened 20 recent research papers to provide a thorough review of the state-of-the-art of how street-view images are synthesized from their corresponding satellite counterparts. The main findings are: (i) novel deep learning techniques are required for synthesizing more realistic and accurate street-view images; (ii) more datasets need to be collected for public usage; and (iii) more specific evaluation metrics need to be investigated for evaluating the generated images appropriately. We conclude that, due to applying outdated deep learning techniques, the recent literature failed to generate detailed and diverse street-view images.

- **Summary**: Modeling visual saliency in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) allows to understand how people perceive GUI designs and what elements attract their attention. One aspect that is often overlooked is the fact that computational models depend on a series of design parameters that are not straightforward to decide. We systematically analyze how different design parameters affect scanpath evaluation metrics using a state-of-the-art computational model (DeepGaze++). We particularly focus on three design parameters: input image size, inhibition-of-return decay, and masking radius. We show that even small variations of these design parameters have a noticeable impact on standard evaluation metrics such as DTW or Eyenalysis. These effects also occur in other scanpath models, such as UMSS and ScanGAN, and in other datasets such as MASSVIS. Taken together, our results put forward the impact of design decisions for predicting users' viewing behavior on GUIs.

- **Summary**: We perform detailed theoretical analysis of an expectation-maximization-based algorithm recently proposed in for solving a variation of the 3D registration problem, named multi-model 3D registration. Despite having shown superior empirical results, did not theoretically justify the conditions under which the EM approach converges to the ground truth. In this project, we aim to close this gap by establishing such conditions. In particular, the analysis revolves around the usage of probabilistic tail bounds that are developed and applied in various instances throughout the course. The problem studied in this project stands as another example, different from those seen in the course, in which tail-bounds help advance our algorithmic understanding in a probabilistic way.

- **Summary**: "How does the person in the bounding box feel?" Achieving human-level recognition of the apparent emotion of a person in real world situations remains an unsolved task in computer vision. Facial expressions are not enough: body pose, contextual knowledge, and commonsense reasoning all contribute to how humans perform this emotional theory of mind task. In this paper, we examine two major approaches enabled by recent large vision language models: 1) image captioning followed by a language-only LLM, and 2) vision language models, under zero-shot and fine-tuned setups. We evaluate the methods on the Emotions in Context (EMOTIC) dataset and demonstrate that a vision language model, fine-tuned even on a small dataset, can significantly outperform traditional baselines. The results of this work aim to help robots and agents perform emotionally sensitive decision-making and interaction in the future.

- **Summary**: We investigate the problem of pixelwise correspondence for deformable objects, namely cloth and rope, by comparing both classical and learning-based methods. We choose cloth and rope because they are traditionally some of the most difficult deformable objects to analytically model with their large configuration space, and they are meaningful in the context of robotic tasks like cloth folding, rope knot-tying, T-shirt folding, curtain closing, etc. The correspondence problem is heavily motivated in robotics, with wide-ranging applications including semantic grasping, object tracking, and manipulation policies built on top of correspondences. We present an exhaustive survey of existing classical methods for doing correspondence via feature-matching, including SIFT, SURF, and ORB, and two recently published learning-based methods including TimeCycle and Dense Object Nets. We make three main contributions: (1) a framework for simulating and rendering synthetic images of deformable objects, with qualitative results demonstrating transfer between our simulated and real domains (2) a new learning-based correspondence method extending Dense Object Nets, and (3) a standardized comparison across state-of-the-art correspondence methods. Our proposed method provides a flexible, general formulation for learning temporally and spatially continuous correspondences for nonrigid (and rigid) objects. We report root mean squared error statistics for all methods and find that Dense Object Nets outperforms baseline classical methods for correspondence, and our proposed extension of Dense Object Nets performs similarly.
