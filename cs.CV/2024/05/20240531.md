- **Summary**: Information theory, which describes the transmission of signals in the presence of noise, has enabled the development of reliable communication systems that underlie the modern world. Imaging systems can also be viewed as a form of communication, in which information about the object is "transmitted" through images. However, the application of information theory to imaging systems has been limited by the challenges of accounting for their physical constraints. Here, we introduce a framework that addresses these limitations by modeling the probabilistic relationship between objects and their measurements. Using this framework, we develop a method to estimate information using only a dataset of noisy measurements, without making any assumptions about the image formation process. We demonstrate that these estimates comprehensively quantify measurement quality across a diverse range of imaging systems and applications. Furthermore, we introduce Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL), a technique to optimize the design of imaging hardware for maximum information capture. This work provides new insights into the fundamental performance limits of imaging systems and offers powerful new tools for their analysis and design.

- **Summary**: With the development of diffusion-based customization methods like DreamBooth, individuals now have access to train the models that can generate their personalized images. Despite the convenience, malicious users have misused these techniques to create fake images, thereby triggering a privacy security crisis. In light of this, proactive adversarial attacks are proposed to protect users against customization. The adversarial examples are trained to distort the customization model's outputs and thus block the misuse. In this paper, we propose DisDiff (Disrupting Diffusion), a novel adversarial attack method to disrupt the diffusion model outputs. We first delve into the intrinsic image-text relationships, well-known as cross-attention, and empirically find that the subject-identifier token plays an important role in guiding image generation. Thus, we propose the Cross-Attention Erasure module to explicitly "erase" the indicated attention maps and disrupt the text guidance. Besides,we analyze the influence of the sampling process of the diffusion model on Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack and introduce a novel Merit Sampling Scheduler to adaptively modulate the perturbation updating amplitude in a step-aware manner. Our DisDiff outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 12.75% of FDFR scores and 7.25% of ISM scores across two facial benchmarks and two commonly used prompts on average.

- **Summary**: Traditional semi-supervised learning (SSL) assumes that the feature distributions of labeled and unlabeled data are consistent which rarely holds in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel SSL setting, where unlabeled samples are drawn from a mixed distribution that deviates from the feature distribution of labeled samples. Under this setting, previous SSL methods tend to predict wrong pseudo-labels with the model fitted on labeled data, resulting in noise accumulation. To tackle this issue, we propose Self-Supervised Feature Adaptation (SSFA), a generic framework for improving SSL performance when labeled and unlabeled data come from different distributions. SSFA decouples the prediction of pseudo-labels from the current model to improve the quality of pseudo-labels. Particularly, SSFA incorporates a self-supervised task into the SSL framework and uses it to adapt the feature extractor of the model to the unlabeled data. In this way, the extracted features better fit the distribution of unlabeled data, thereby generating high-quality pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments show that our proposed SSFA is applicable to various pseudo-label-based SSL learners and significantly improves performance in labeled, unlabeled, and even unseen distributions.

- **Summary**: Deep learning (DL) enables deep neural networks (DNNs) to automatically learn complex tasks or rules from given examples without instructions or guiding principles. As we do not engineer DNNs' functions, it is extremely difficult to diagnose their decisions, and multiple lines of studies proposed to explain principles of DNNs/DL operations. Notably, one line of studies suggests that DNNs may learn concepts, the high level features recognizable to humans. Thus, we hypothesized that DNNs develop abstract codes, not necessarily recognizable to humans, which can be used to augment DNNs' decision-making. To address this hypothesis, we combined foundation segmentation models and unsupervised learning to extract internal codes and identify potential use of abstract codes to make DL's decision-making more reliable and safer.



### Vision-Language Meets the Skeleton: Progressively Distillation with Cross-Modal Knowledge for 3D Action Representation Learning

- **Summary**: Supervised and self-supervised learning are two main training paradigms for skeleton-based human action recognition. However, the former one-hot classification requires labor-intensive predefined action categories annotations, while the latter involves skeleton transformations (e.g., cropping) in the pretext tasks that may impair the skeleton structure. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel skeleton-based training framework (C$^2$VL) based on Cross-modal Contrastive learning that uses the progressive distillation to learn task-agnostic human skeleton action representation from the Vision-Language knowledge prompts. Specifically, we establish the vision-language action concept space through vision-language knowledge prompts generated by pre-trained large multimodal models (LMMs), which enrich the fine-grained details that the skeleton action space lacks. Moreover, we propose the intra-modal self-similarity and inter-modal cross-consistency softened targets in the cross-modal contrastive process to progressively control and guide the degree of pulling vision-language knowledge prompts and corresponding skeletons closer. These soft instance discrimination and self-knowledge distillation strategies contribute to the learning of better skeleton-based action representations from the noisy skeleton-vision-language pairs. During the inference phase, our method requires only the skeleton data as the input for action recognition and no longer for vision-language prompts. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD datasets. The code will be available in the future.



### Textual Inversion and Self-supervised Refinement for Radiology Report Generation

- **Summary**: Existing mainstream approaches follow the encoder-decoder paradigm for generating radiology reports. They focus on improving the network structure of encoders and decoders, which leads to two shortcomings: overlooking the modality gap and ignoring report content constraints. In this paper, we proposed Textual Inversion and Self-supervised Refinement (TISR) to address the above two issues. Specifically, textual inversion can project text and image into the same space by representing images as pseudo words to eliminate the cross-modeling gap. Subsequently, self-supervised refinement refines these pseudo words through contrastive loss computation between images and texts, enhancing the fidelity of generated reports to images. Notably, TISR is orthogonal to most existing methods, plug-and-play. We conduct experiments on two widely-used public datasets and achieve significant improvements on various baselines, which demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of TISR. The code will be available soon.

- **Summary**: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, the Mean Teacher- and co-training-based approaches are employed to mitigate confirmation bias and coupling problems. However, despite their high performance, these approaches frequently involve complex training pipelines and a substantial computational burden, limiting the scalability and compatibility of these methods. In this paper, we propose a PrevMatch framework that effectively mitigates the aforementioned limitations by maximizing the utilization of the temporal knowledge obtained during the training process. The PrevMatch framework relies on two core strategies: (1) we reconsider the use of temporal knowledge and thus directly utilize previous models obtained during training to generate additional pseudo-label guidance, referred to as previous guidance. (2) we design a highly randomized ensemble strategy to maximize the effectiveness of the previous guidance. Experimental results on four benchmark semantic segmentation datasets confirm that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing methods across various evaluation protocols. In particular, with DeepLabV3+ and ResNet-101 network settings, PrevMatch outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method, Diverse Co-training, by +1.6 mIoU on Pascal VOC with only 92 annotated images, while achieving 2.4 times faster training. Furthermore, the results indicate that PrevMatch induces stable optimization, particularly in benefiting classes that exhibit poor performance.

- **Summary**: In the preclinical translational studies, drug candidates with remarkable anti-epileptic efficacy demonstrate long-term suppression of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs), particularly convulsive seizures (CSs), in mouse models of chronic epilepsy. However, the current methods for monitoring CSs have limitations in terms of invasiveness, specific laboratory settings, high cost, and complex operation, which hinder drug screening efforts. In this study, a camera-based system for automated detection of CSs in chronically epileptic mice is first established to screen potential anti-epilepsy drugs.

- **Summary**: In an era of rapidly evolving internet technology, the surge in multimodal content, including videos, has expanded the horizons of online communication. However, the detection of toxic content in this diverse landscape, particularly in low-resource code-mixed languages, remains a critical challenge. While substantial research has addressed toxic content detection in textual data, the realm of video content, especially in non-English languages, has been relatively underexplored. This paper addresses this research gap by introducing a benchmark dataset, the first of its kind, consisting of 931 videos with 4021 code-mixed Hindi-English utterances collected from YouTube. Each utterance within this dataset has been meticulously annotated for toxicity, severity, and sentiment labels. We have developed an advanced Multimodal Multitask framework built for Toxicity detection in Video Content by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), crafted for the primary objective along with the additional tasks of conducting sentiment and severity analysis. ToxVidLLM incorporates three key modules the Encoder module, Cross-Modal Synchronization module, and Multitask module crafting a generic multimodal LLM customized for intricate video classification tasks. Our experiments reveal that incorporating multiple modalities from the videos substantially enhances the performance of toxic content detection by achieving an Accuracy and Weighted F1 score of 94.29% and 94.35%, respectively.



### Action-OOD: An End-to-End Skeleton-Based Model for Robust Out-of-Distribution Human Action Detection

- **Summary**: Human action recognition is a crucial task in computer vision systems. However, in real-world scenarios, human actions often fall outside the distribution of training data, requiring a model to both recognize in-distribution (ID) actions and reject out-of-distribution (OOD) ones. Despite its importance, there has been limited research on OOD detection in human actions. Existing works on OOD detection mainly focus on image data with RGB structure, and many methods are post-hoc in nature. While these methods are convenient and computationally efficient, they often lack sufficient accuracy and fail to consider the presence of OOD samples. To address these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end skeleton-based model called Action-OOD, specifically designed for OOD human action detection. Unlike some existing approaches that may require prior knowledge of existing OOD data distribution, our model solely utilizes in-distribution (ID) data during the training stage, effectively mitigating the overconfidence issue prevalent in OOD detection. We introduce an attention-based feature fusion block, which enhances the model's capability to recognize unknown classes while preserving classification accuracy for known classes. Further, we present a novel energy-based loss function and successfully integrate it with the traditional cross-entropy loss to maximize the separation of data distributions between ID and OOD. Through extensive experiments conducted on NTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120, and Kinetics-400 datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of classic OOD detection techniques in the context of skeleton-based action recognition tasks, offering promising avenues for future research in this field.

- **Summary**: Gaze-annotated facial data is crucial for training deep neural networks (DNNs) for gaze estimation. However, obtaining these data is labor-intensive and requires specialized equipment due to the challenge of accurately annotating the gaze direction of a subject. In this work, we present a generative framework to create annotated gaze data by leveraging the benefits of labeled and unlabeled data sources. We propose a Gaze-aware Compositional GAN that learns to generate annotated facial images from a limited labeled dataset. Then we transfer this model to an unlabeled data domain to take advantage of the diversity it provides. Experiments demonstrate our approach's effectiveness in generating within-domain image augmentations in the ETH-XGaze dataset and cross-domain augmentations in the CelebAMask-HQ dataset domain for gaze estimation DNN training. We also show additional applications of our work, which include facial image editing and gaze redirection.

- **Summary**: Video is an increasingly prominent and information-dense medium, yet it poses substantial challenges for language models. A typical video consists of a sequence of shorter segments, or shots, that collectively form a coherent narrative. Each shot is analogous to a word in a sentence where multiple data streams of information (such as visual and auditory data) must be processed simultaneously. Comprehension of the entire video requires not only understanding the visual-audio information of each shot but also requires that the model links the ideas between each shot to generate a larger, all-encompassing story. Despite significant progress in the field, current works often overlook videos' more granular shot-by-shot semantic information. In this project, we propose a family of efficient large language vision models (LLVMs) to boost video summarization and captioning called Shotluck Holmes. By leveraging better pretraining and data collection strategies, we extend the abilities of existing small LLVMs from being able to understand a picture to being able to understand a sequence of frames. Specifically, we show that Shotluck Holmes achieves better performance than state-of-the-art results on the Shot2Story video captioning and summary task with significantly smaller and more computationally efficient models.



### GenMix: Combining Generative and Mixture Data Augmentation for Medical Image Classification

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation technique called GenMix, which combines generative and mixture approaches to leverage the strengths of both methods. While generative models excel at creating new data patterns, they face challenges such as mode collapse in GANs and difficulties in training diffusion models, especially with limited medical imaging data. On the other hand, mixture models enhance class boundary regions but tend to favor the major class in scenarios with class imbalance. To address these limitations, GenMix integrates both approaches to complement each other. GenMix operates in two stages: (1) training a generative model to produce synthetic images, and (2) performing mixup between synthetic and real data. This process improves the quality and diversity of synthetic data while simultaneously benefiting from the new pattern learning of generative models and the boundary enhancement of mixture models. We validate the effectiveness of our method on the task of classifying focal liver lesions (FLLs) in CT images. Our results demonstrate that GenMix enhances the performance of various generative models, including DCGAN, StyleGAN, Textual Inversion, and Diffusion Models. Notably, the proposed method with Textual Inversion outperforms other methods without fine-tuning diffusion model on the FLL dataset.



### MASA: Motion-aware Masked Autoencoder with Semantic Alignment for Sign Language Recognition

- **Summary**: Sign language recognition (SLR) has long been plagued by insufficient model representation capabilities. Although current pre-training approaches have alleviated this dilemma to some extent and yielded promising performance by employing various pretext tasks on sign pose data, these methods still suffer from two primary limitations: 1) Explicit motion information is usually disregarded in previous pretext tasks, leading to partial information loss and limited representation capability. 2) Previous methods focus on the local context of a sign pose sequence, without incorporating the guidance of the global meaning of lexical signs. To this end, we propose a Motion-Aware masked autoencoder with Semantic Alignment (MASA) that integrates rich motion cues and global semantic information in a self-supervised learning paradigm for SLR. Our framework contains two crucial components, i.e., a motion-aware masked autoencoder (MA) and a momentum semantic alignment module (SA). Specifically, in MA, we introduce an autoencoder architecture with a motion-aware masked strategy to reconstruct motion residuals of masked frames, thereby explicitly exploring dynamic motion cues among sign pose sequences. Moreover, in SA, we embed our framework with global semantic awareness by aligning the embeddings of different augmented samples from the input sequence in the shared latent space. In this way, our framework can simultaneously learn local motion cues and global semantic features for comprehensive sign language representation. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on four public benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Single image-to-3D generation is pivotal for crafting controllable 3D assets. Given its underconstrained nature, we leverage geometric priors from a 3D novel view generation diffusion model and appearance priors from a 2D image generation method to guide the optimization process. We note that a disparity exists between the training datasets of 2D and 3D diffusion models, leading to their outputs showing marked differences in appearance. Specifically, 2D models tend to deliver more detailed visuals, whereas 3D models produce consistent yet over-smooth results across different views. Hence, we optimize a set of 3D Gaussians using 3D priors in spatial domain to ensure geometric consistency, while exploiting 2D priors in the frequency domain through Fourier transform for higher visual quality. This 2D-3D hybrid Fourier Score Distillation objective function (dubbed hy-FSD), can be integrated into existing 3D generation methods, yielding significant performance improvements. With this technique, we further develop an image-to-3D generation pipeline to create high-quality 3D objects within one minute, named Fourier123. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fourier123 excels in efficient generation with rapid convergence speed and visual-friendly generation results.

- **Summary**: This study explores the impact of adversarial perturbations on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the aim of enhancing the understanding of their underlying mechanisms. Despite numerous defense methods proposed in the literature, there is still an incomplete understanding of this phenomenon. Instead of treating the entire model as vulnerable, we propose that specific feature maps learned during training contribute to the overall vulnerability. To investigate how the hidden representations learned by a CNN affect its vulnerability, we introduce the Adversarial Intervention framework. Experiments were conducted on models trained on three well-known computer vision datasets, subjecting them to attacks of different nature. Our focus centers on the effects that adversarial perturbations to a model's initial layer have on the overall behavior of the model. Empirical results revealed compelling insights: a) perturbing selected channel combinations in shallow layers causes significant disruptions; b) the channel combinations most responsible for the disruptions are common among different types of attacks; c) despite shared vulnerable combinations of channels, different attacks affect hidden representations with varying magnitudes; d) there exists a positive correlation between a kernel's magnitude and its vulnerability. In conclusion, this work introduces a novel framework to study the vulnerability of a CNN model to adversarial perturbations, revealing insights that contribute to a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. The identified properties pave the way for the development of efficient ad-hoc defense mechanisms in future applications.

- **Summary**: Current 4D generation methods have achieved noteworthy efficacy with the aid of advanced diffusion generative models. However, these methods lack multi-view spatial-temporal modeling and encounter challenges in integrating diverse prior knowledge from multiple diffusion models, resulting in inconsistent temporal appearance and flickers. In this paper, we propose a novel 4D generation pipeline, namely 4Diffusion aimed at generating spatial-temporally consistent 4D content from a monocular video. We first design a unified diffusion model tailored for multi-view video generation by incorporating a learnable motion module into a frozen 3D-aware diffusion model to capture multi-view spatial-temporal correlations. After training on a curated dataset, our diffusion model acquires reasonable temporal consistency and inherently preserves the generalizability and spatial consistency of the 3D-aware diffusion model. Subsequently, we propose 4D-aware Score Distillation Sampling loss, which is based on our multi-view video diffusion model, to optimize 4D representation parameterized by dynamic NeRF. This aims to eliminate discrepancies arising from multiple diffusion models, allowing for generating spatial-temporally consistent 4D content. Moreover, we devise an anchor loss to enhance the appearance details and facilitate the learning of dynamic NeRF. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to previous methods.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have emerged as a powerful class of deep generative models, achieving remarkable performance in image synthesis tasks. However, these models face challenges in terms of widespread adoption due to their reliance on sequential denoising steps during sample generation. This dependence leads to substantial computational requirements, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained or real-time processing systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that integrates denoising phases directly into the model's architecture, thereby reducing the need for resource-intensive computations. Our approach combines diffusion models with generative adversarial networks (GANs) through knowledge distillation, enabling more efficient training and evaluation. By utilizing a pre-trained diffusion model as a teacher model, we train a student model through adversarial learning, employing layerwise transformations for denoising and submodules for predicting the teacher model's output at various points in time. This integration significantly reduces the number of parameters and denoising steps required, leading to improved sampling speed at test time. We validate our method with extensive experiments, demonstrating comparable performance with reduced computational requirements compared to existing approaches. By enabling the deployment of diffusion models on resource-constrained devices, our research mitigates their computational burden and paves the way for wider accessibility and practical use across the research community and end-users.

- **Summary**: In the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the importance of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is increasingly recognized, particularly as AI models become more integral to our lives. One notable single-instance XAI approach is counterfactual explanation, which aids users in comprehending a model's decisions and offers guidance on altering these decisions. Specifically in the context of image classification models, effective image counterfactual explanations can significantly enhance user understanding. This paper introduces a novel method for computing feature importance within the feature space of a black-box model. By employing information fusion techniques, our method maximizes the use of data to address feature counterfactual explanations in the feature space. Subsequently, we utilize an image generation model to transform these feature counterfactual explanations into image counterfactual explanations. Our experiments demonstrate that the counterfactual explanations generated by our method closely resemble the original images in both pixel and feature spaces. Additionally, our method outperforms established baselines, achieving impressive experimental results.

- **Summary**: Deep learning algorithms have a large number of trainable parameters often with sizes of hundreds of thousands or more. Training this algorithm requires a large amount of training data and generating a sufficiently large dataset for these algorithms is costly\cite{noguchi2019image}.   GANs are generative neural networks that use two deep learning networks that are competing with each other. The networks are generator and discriminator networks. The generator tries to generate realistic images which resemble the actual training dataset by approximating the training data distribution and the discriminator is trained to classify images as real or fake(generated)\cite{goodfellow2016nips}. Training these GAN algorithms also requires a large amount of training dataset\cite{noguchi2019image}.   In this study, the aim is to address the question, "Given an unconditioned pretrained generator network and a pretrained classifier, is it feasible to develop a conditioned generator without relying on any training dataset?"   The paper begins with a general introduction to the problem. The subsequent sections are structured as follows: Section 2 provides background information on the problem. Section 3 reviews relevant literature on the topic. Section 4 outlines the methodology employed in this study. Section 5 presents the experimental results. Section 6 discusses the findings and proposes potential future research directions. Finally, Section 7 offers concluding remarks.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has shown promising results in image rendering and surface reconstruction. However, its potential in volumetric reconstruction tasks, such as X-ray computed tomography, remains under-explored. This paper introduces R2-Gaussian, the first 3DGS-based framework for sparse-view tomographic reconstruction. By carefully deriving X-ray rasterization functions, we discover a previously unknown integration bias in the standard 3DGS formulation, which hampers accurate volume retrieval. To address this issue, we propose a novel rectification technique via refactoring the projection from 3D to 2D Gaussians. Our new method presents three key innovations: (1) introducing tailored Gaussian kernels, (2) extending rasterization to X-ray imaging, and (3) developing a CUDA-based differentiable voxelizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 0.93 dB in PSNR and 0.014 in SSIM. Crucially, it delivers high-quality results in 3 minutes, which is 12x faster than NeRF-based methods and on par with traditional algorithms. The superior performance and rapid convergence of our method highlight its practical value.

- **Summary**: Generalized category discovery presents a challenge in a realistic scenario, which requires the model's generalization ability to recognize unlabeled samples from known and unknown categories. This paper revisits the challenge of generalized category discovery through the lens of information maximization (InfoMax) with a probabilistic parametric classifier. Our findings reveal that ensuring independence between known and unknown classes while concurrently assuming a uniform probability distribution across all classes, yields an enlarged margin among known and unknown classes that promotes the model's performance. To achieve the aforementioned independence, we propose a novel InfoMax-based method, Regularized Parametric InfoMax (RPIM), which adopts pseudo labels to supervise unlabeled samples during InfoMax, while proposing a regularization to ensure the quality of the pseudo labels. Additionally, we introduce novel semantic-bias transformation to refine the features from the pre-trained model instead of direct fine-tuning to rescue the computational costs. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. RPIM significantly improves the performance regarding unknown classes, surpassing the state-of-the-art method by an average margin of 3.5%.

- **Summary**: Successive image generation using cyclic transformations is demonstrated by extending the CycleGAN model to transform images among three different categories. Repeated application of the trained generators produces sequences of images that transition among the different categories. The generated image sequences occupy a more limited region of the image space compared with the original training dataset. Quantitative evaluation using precision and recall metrics indicates that the generated images have high quality but reduced diversity relative to the training dataset. Such successive generation processes are characterized as chaotic dynamics in terms of dynamical system theory. Positive Lyapunov exponents estimated from the generated trajectories confirm the presence of chaotic dynamics, with the Lyapunov dimension of the attractor found to be comparable to the intrinsic dimension of the training data manifold. The results suggest that chaotic dynamics in the image space defined by the deep generative model contribute to the diversity of the generated images, constituting a novel approach for multi-class image generation. This model can be interpreted as an extension of classical associative memory to perform hetero-association among image categories.

- **Summary**: Predictions of global climate models typically operate on coarse spatial scales due to the large computational costs of climate simulations. This has led to a considerable interest in methods for statistical downscaling, a similar process to super-resolution in the computer vision context, to provide more local and regional climate information. In this work, we apply conditional normalizing flows to the task of climate variable downscaling. We showcase its successful performance on an ERA5 water content dataset for different upsampling factors. Additionally, we show that the method allows us to assess the predictive uncertainty in terms of standard deviation from the fitted conditional distribution mean.

- **Summary**: To ensure safe urban driving for autonomous platforms, it is crucial not only to develop high-performance object detection techniques but also to establish a diverse and representative dataset that captures various urban environments and object characteristics. To address these two issues, we have constructed a multi-class 3D LiDAR dataset reflecting diverse urban environments and object characteristics, and developed a robust 3D semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) based on a multiple teachers framework. This SSOD framework categorizes similar classes and assigns specialized teachers to each category. Through collaborative supervision among these category-specialized teachers, the student network becomes increasingly proficient, leading to a highly effective object detector. We propose a simple yet effective augmentation technique, Pie-based Point Compensating Augmentation (PieAug), to enable the teacher network to generate high-quality pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on the WOD, KITTI, and our datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method and the quality of our dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art 3D semi-supervised object detection methods across all datasets. We plan to release our multi-class LiDAR dataset and the source code available on our Github repository in the near future.

- **Summary**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a promising framework for novel view synthesis, offering fast rendering speeds and high fidelity. However, the large number of Gaussians and their associated attributes require effective compression techniques. Existing methods primarily compress neural Gaussians individually and independently, i.e., coding all the neural Gaussians at the same time, with little design for their interactions and spatial dependence. Inspired by the effectiveness of the context model in image compression, we propose the first autoregressive model at the anchor level for 3DGS compression in this work. We divide anchors into different levels and the anchors that are not coded yet can be predicted based on the already coded ones in all the coarser levels, leading to more accurate modeling and higher coding efficiency. To further improve the efficiency of entropy coding, e.g., to code the coarsest level with no already coded anchors, we propose to introduce a low-dimensional quantized feature as the hyperprior for each anchor, which can be effectively compressed. Our work pioneers the context model in the anchor level for 3DGS representation, yielding an impressive size reduction of over 100 times compared to vanilla 3DGS and 15 times compared to the most recent state-of-the-art work Scaffold-GS, while achieving comparable or even higher rendering quality.

- **Summary**: Gradient Inversion Attacks invert the transmitted gradients in Federated Learning (FL) systems to reconstruct the sensitive data of local clients and have raised considerable privacy concerns. A majority of gradient inversion methods rely heavily on explicit prior knowledge (e.g., a well pre-trained generative model), which is often unavailable in realistic scenarios. To alleviate this issue, researchers have proposed to leverage the implicit prior knowledge of an over-parameterized network. However, they only utilize a fixed neural architecture for all the attack settings. This would hinder the adaptive use of implicit architectural priors and consequently limit the generalizability. In this paper, we further exploit such implicit prior knowledge by proposing Gradient Inversion via Neural Architecture Search (GI-NAS), which adaptively searches the network and captures the implicit priors behind neural architectures. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed GI-NAS can achieve superior attack performance compared to state-of-the-art gradient inversion methods, even under more practical settings with high-resolution images, large-sized batches, and advanced defense strategies.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel approach to learning instance segmentation using extreme points, i.e., the topmost, leftmost, bottommost, and rightmost points, of each object. These points are readily available in the modern bounding box annotation process while offering strong clues for precise segmentation, and thus allows to improve performance at the same annotation cost with box-supervised methods. Our work considers extreme points as a part of the true instance mask and propagates them to identify potential foreground and background points, which are all together used for training a pseudo label generator. Then pseudo labels given by the generator are in turn used for supervised learning of our final model. On three public benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms existing box-supervised methods, further narrowing the gap with its fully supervised counterpart. In particular, our model generates high-quality masks when a target object is separated into multiple parts, where previous box-supervised methods often fail.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models have emerged as a powerful tool for previously challenging multi-modal classification problem in the medical domain. This development has led to the exploration of automated image description generation for multi-modal clinical scans, particularly for radiology report generation. Existing research has focused on clinical descriptions for specific modalities or body regions, leaving a gap for a model providing entire-body multi-modal descriptions. In this paper, we address this gap by automating the generation of standardized body station(s) and list of organ(s) across the whole body in multi-modal MR and CT radiological images. Leveraging the versatility of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), we refine and augment the existing approach through multiple experiments, including baseline model fine-tuning, adding station(s) as a superset for better correlation between organs, along with image and language augmentations. Our proposed approach demonstrates 47.6% performance improvement over baseline PubMedCLIP.

- **Summary**: Trajectory forecasting is crucial for video surveillance analytics, as it enables the anticipation of future movements for a set of agents, e.g. basketball players engaged in intricate interactions with long-term intentions. Deep generative models offer a natural learning approach for trajectory forecasting, yet they encounter difficulties in achieving an optimal balance between sampling fidelity and diversity. We address this challenge by leveraging Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), which utilize a discrete latent space to tackle the issue of posterior collapse. Specifically, we introduce an instance-based codebook that allows tailored latent representations for each example. In a nutshell, the rows of the codebook are dynamically adjusted to reflect contextual information (i.e., past motion patterns extracted from the observed trajectories). In this way, the discretization process gains flexibility, leading to improved reconstructions. Notably, instance-level dynamics are injected into the codebook through low-rank updates, which restrict the customization of the codebook to a lower dimension space. The resulting discrete space serves as the basis of the subsequent step, which regards the training of a diffusion-based predictive model. We show that such a two-fold framework, augmented with instance-level discretization, leads to accurate and diverse forecasts, yielding state-of-the-art performance on three established benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved great success in image generation and other fields. By fine sampling through the trajectory defined by the SDE/ODE solver based on a well-trained score model, DMs can generate remarkable high-quality results. However, this precise sampling often requires multiple steps and is computationally demanding. To address this problem, instance-based distillation methods have been proposed to distill a one-step generator from a DM by having a simpler student model mimic a more complex teacher model. Yet, our research reveals an inherent limitations in these methods: the teacher model, with more steps and more parameters, occupies different local minima compared to the student model, leading to suboptimal performance when the student model attempts to replicate the teacher. To avoid this problem, we introduce a novel distributional distillation method, which uses an exclusive distributional loss. This method exceeds state-of-the-art (SOTA) results while requiring significantly fewer training images. Additionally, we show that DMs' layers are activated differently at different time steps, leading to an inherent capability to generate images in a single step. Freezing most of the convolutional layers in a DM during distributional distillation leads to further performance improvements. Our method achieves the SOTA results on CIFAR-10 (FID 1.54), AFHQv2 64x64 (FID 1.23), FFHQ 64x64 (FID 0.85) and ImageNet 64x64 (FID 1.16) with great efficiency. Most of those results are obtained with only 5 million training images within 6 hours on 8 A100 GPUs. This breakthrough not only enhances the understanding of efficient image generation models but also offers a scalable framework for advancing the state of the art in various applications.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models for Text-to-Image (T2I) conditional generation have seen tremendous success recently. Despite their success, accurately capturing user intentions with these models still requires a laborious trial and error process. This challenge is commonly identified as a model alignment problem, an issue that has attracted considerable attention by the research community. Instead of relying on fine-grained linguistic analyses of prompts, human annotation, or auxiliary vision-language models to steer image generation, in this work we present a novel method that relies on an information-theoretic alignment measure. In a nutshell, our method uses self-supervised fine-tuning and relies on point-wise mutual information between prompts and images to define a synthetic training set to induce model alignment. Our comparative analysis shows that our method is on-par or superior to the state-of-the-art, yet requires nothing but a pre-trained denoising network to estimate MI and a lightweight fine-tuning strategy.

- **Summary**: Generative models are widely utilized to model the distribution of fused images in the field of infrared and visible image fusion. However, current generative models based fusion methods often suffer from unstable training and slow inference speed. To tackle this problem, a novel fusion method based on consistency model is proposed, termed as CoMoFusion, which can generate the high-quality images and achieve fast image inference speed. In specific, the consistency model is used to construct multi-modal joint features in the latent space with the forward and reverse process. Then, the infrared and visible features extracted by the trained consistency model are fed into fusion module to generate the final fused image. In order to enhance the texture and salient information of fused images, a novel loss based on pixel value selection is also designed. Extensive experiments on public datasets illustrate that our method obtains the SOTA fusion performance compared with the existing fusion methods.

- **Summary**: Decoupling the illumination in 3D scenes is crucial for novel view synthesis and relighting. In this paper, we propose a novel method for representing a scene illuminated by a point light using a set of relightable 3D Gaussian points. Inspired by the Blinn-Phong model, our approach decomposes the scene into ambient, diffuse, and specular components, enabling the synthesis of realistic lighting effects. To facilitate the decomposition of geometric information independent of lighting conditions, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization-based meta-learning framework. The fundamental idea is to view the rendering tasks under various lighting positions as a multi-task learning problem, which our meta-learning approach effectively addresses by generalizing the learned Gaussian geometries not only across different viewpoints but also across diverse light positions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of training efficiency and rendering quality compared to existing methods for free-viewpoint relighting.

- **Summary**: Accurate visual understanding is imperative for advancing autonomous systems and intelligent robots. Despite the powerful capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) in processing complex visual scenes, precisely recognizing obscured or ambiguously presented visual elements remains challenging. To tackle such issues, this paper proposes InsightSee, a multi-agent framework to enhance VLMs' interpretative capabilities in handling complex visual understanding scenarios. The framework comprises a description agent, two reasoning agents, and a decision agent, which are integrated to refine the process of visual information interpretation. The design of these agents and the mechanisms by which they can be enhanced in visual information processing are presented. Experimental results demonstrate that the InsightSee framework not only boosts performance on specific visual tasks but also retains the original models' strength. The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in 6 out of 9 benchmark tests, with a substantial advancement in multimodal understanding.

- **Summary**: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically integrate a pre-trained LLM with another pre-trained vision transformer through a connector, such as an MLP, endowing the LLM with visual capabilities. However, the misalignment between two embedding strategies in MLLMs -- the structural textual embeddings based on an embedding look-up table and the continuous embeddings generated directly by the vision encoder -- makes challenges for a more seamless fusion of visual and textual information. We propose Ovis, a novel MLLM architecture designed to structurally align visual and textual embeddings. Ovis integrates an additional learnable visual embedding table into the visual encoder's process. To capture rich visual semantics, each image patch indexes the visual embedding table multiple times, resulting in a final visual embedding that is a probabilistic combination of the indexed embeddings. This structural approach mirrors the method used for generating textual embeddings. Empirical evaluations on various multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Ovis outperforms open-source MLLMs of similar parameter scales and even surpasses the proprietary model Qwen-VL-Plus overall. These results highlight the potential of Ovis' structured visual representation for advancing MLLM architectural design and promoting more effective multimodal learning. Both the source code and the training dataset of Ovis will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Multi-change captioning aims to describe complex and coupled changes within an image pair in natural language. Compared with single-change captioning, this task requires the model to have higher-level cognition ability to reason an arbitrary number of changes. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware difference distilling (CARD) network to capture all genuine changes for yielding sentences. Given an image pair, CARD first decouples context features that aggregate all similar/dissimilar semantics, termed common/difference context features. Then, the consistency and independence constraints are designed to guarantee the alignment/discrepancy of common/difference context features. Further, the common context features guide the model to mine locally unchanged features, which are subtracted from the pair to distill locally difference features. Next, the difference context features augment the locally difference features to ensure that all changes are distilled. In this way, we obtain an omni-representation of all changes, which is translated into linguistic sentences by a transformer decoder. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show CARD performs favourably against state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at https://github.com/tuyunbin/CARD.

- **Summary**: Open-world semi-supervised learning (OWSSL) extends conventional semi-supervised learning to open-world scenarios by taking account of novel categories in unlabeled datasets. Despite the recent advancements in OWSSL, the success often relies on the assumptions that 1) labeled and unlabeled datasets share the same balanced class prior distribution, which does not generally hold in real-world applications, and 2) unlabeled training datasets are utilized for evaluation, where such transductive inference might not adequately address challenges in the wild. In this paper, we aim to generalize OWSSL by addressing them. Our work suggests that practical OWSSL may require different training settings, evaluation methods, and learning strategies compared to those prevalent in the existing literature.

- **Summary**: Large language models equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) represent a burgeoning field aimed at enhancing answering capabilities by leveraging external knowledge bases. Although the application of RAG with language-only models has been extensively explored, its adaptation into multimodal vision-language models remains nascent. Going beyond mere answer generation, the primary goal of multimodal RAG is to cultivate the models' ability to reason in response to relevant queries. To this end, we introduce a novel multimodal RAG framework named RMR (Retrieval Meets Reasoning). The RMR framework employs a bi-modal retrieval module to identify the most relevant question-answer pairs, which then serve as scaffolds for the multimodal reasoning process. This training-free approach not only encourages the model to engage deeply with the reasoning processes inherent in the retrieved content but also facilitates the generation of answers that are precise and richly interpretable. Surprisingly, utilizing solely the ScienceQA dataset, collected from elementary and high school science curricula, RMR significantly boosts the performance of various vision-language models across a spectrum of benchmark datasets, including A-OKVQA, MMBench, and SEED. These outcomes highlight the substantial potential of our multimodal retrieval and reasoning mechanism to improve the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models.

- **Summary**: Neural architecture search (NAS) finds high performing networks for a given task. Yet the results of NAS are fairly prosaic; they did not e.g. create a shift from convolutional structures to transformers. This is not least because the search spaces in NAS often aren't diverse enough to include such transformations a priori. Instead, for NAS to provide greater potential for fundamental design shifts, we need a novel expressive search space design which is built from more fundamental operations. To this end, we introduce einspace, a search space based on a parameterised probabilistic context-free grammar. Our space is versatile, supporting architectures of various sizes and complexities, while also containing diverse network operations which allow it to model convolutions, attention components and more. It contains many existing competitive architectures, and provides flexibility for discovering new ones. Using this search space, we perform experiments to find novel architectures as well as improvements on existing ones on the diverse Unseen NAS datasets. We show that competitive architectures can be obtained by searching from scratch, and we consistently find large improvements when initialising the search with strong baselines. We believe that this work is an important advancement towards a transformative NAS paradigm where search space expressivity and strategic search initialisation play key roles.

- **Summary**: Despite raw driving videos contain richer information on facial expressions than intermediate representations such as landmarks in the field of portrait animation, they are seldom the subject of research. This is due to two challenges inherent in portrait animation driven with raw videos: 1) significant identity leakage; 2) Irrelevant background and facial details such as wrinkles degrade performance. To harnesses the power of the raw videos for vivid portrait animation, we proposed a pioneering conditional diffusion model named as MegActor. First, we introduced a synthetic data generation framework for creating videos with consistent motion and expressions but inconsistent IDs to mitigate the issue of ID leakage. Second, we segmented the foreground and background of the reference image and employed CLIP to encode the background details. This encoded information is then integrated into the network via a text embedding module, thereby ensuring the stability of the background. Finally, we further style transfer the appearance of the reference image to the driving video to eliminate the influence of facial details in the driving videos. Our final model was trained solely on public datasets, achieving results comparable to commercial models. We hope this will help the open-source community.The code is available at https://github.com/megvii-research/MegFaceAnimate.

- **Summary**: The polygon mesh representation of 3D data exhibits great flexibility, fast rendering speed, and storage efficiency, which is widely preferred in various applications. However, given its unstructured graph representation, the direct generation of high-fidelity 3D meshes is challenging. Fortunately, with a pre-defined ordering strategy, 3D meshes can be represented as sequences, and the generation process can be seamlessly treated as an auto-regressive problem. In this paper, we validate the Neural Coordinate Field (NeurCF), an explicit coordinate representation with implicit neural embeddings, is a simple-yet-effective representation for large-scale sequential mesh modeling. After that, we present MeshXL, a family of generative pre-trained auto-regressive models, which addresses the process of 3D mesh generation with modern large language model approaches. Extensive experiments show that MeshXL is able to generate high-quality 3D meshes, and can also serve as foundation models for various down-stream applications.

- **Summary**: Despite the strong performance of Transformers, their quadratic computation complexity presents challenges in applying them to vision tasks. Automatic pruning is one of effective methods for reducing computation complexity without heuristic approaches. However, directly applying it to multi-head attention is not straightforward due to channel misalignment. In this paper, we propose an automatic channel pruning method to take into account the multi-head attention mechanism. First, we incorporate channel similarity-based weights into the pruning indicator to preserve more informative channels in each head. Then, we adjust pruning indicator to enforce removal of channels in equal proportions across all heads, preventing the channel misalignment. We also add a reweight module to compensate for information loss resulting from channel removal, and an effective initialization step for pruning indicator based on difference of attention between original structure and each channel. Our proposed method can be used to not only original attention, but also linear attention, which is more efficient as linear complexity with respect to the number of tokens. On ImageNet-1K, applying our pruning method to the FLattenTransformer, which includes both attention mechanisms, shows outperformed accuracy for several MACs compared with previous state-of-the-art efficient models and pruned methods. Code will be available soon.

- **Summary**: The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and Earth observation (EO) technologies has brought geoscience and remote sensing into an era of unparalleled capabilities. AI's transformative impact on data analysis, particularly derived from EO platforms, holds great promise in addressing global challenges such as environmental monitoring, disaster response and climate change analysis. However, the rapid integration of AI necessitates a careful examination of the responsible dimensions inherent in its application within these domains. In this paper, we represent a pioneering effort to systematically define the intersection of AI and EO, with a central focus on responsible AI practices. Specifically, we identify several critical components guiding this exploration from both academia and industry perspectives within the EO field: AI and EO for social good, mitigating unfair biases, AI security in EO, geo-privacy and privacy-preserving measures, as well as maintaining scientific excellence, open data, and guiding AI usage based on ethical principles. Furthermore, the paper explores potential opportunities and emerging trends, providing valuable insights for future research endeavors.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many computer vision tasks. However, high computational and storage demands hinder their deployment into resource-constrained environments, such as embedded devices. Model pruning helps to meet these restrictions by reducing the model size, while maintaining superior performance. Meanwhile, safety-critical applications pose more than just resource and performance constraints. In particular, predictions must not be overly confident, i.e., provide properly calibrated uncertainty estimations (proper uncertainty calibration), and CNNs must be robust against corruptions like naturally occurring input perturbations (natural corruption robustness). This work investigates the important trade-off between uncertainty calibration, natural corruption robustness, and performance for current state-of-research post-hoc CNN pruning techniques in the context of image classification tasks. Our study reveals that post-hoc pruning substantially improves the model's uncertainty calibration, performance, and natural corruption robustness, sparking hope for safe and robust embedded CNNs.Furthermore, uncertainty calibration and natural corruption robustness are not mutually exclusive targets under pruning, as evidenced by the improved safety aspects obtained by post-hoc unstructured pruning with increasing compression.

- **Summary**: As one of the tasks in Image Fusion, Infrared and Visible Image Fusion aims to integrate complementary information captured by sensors of different modalities into a single image. The Selective State Space Model (SSSM), known for its ability to capture long-range dependencies, has demonstrated its potential in the field of computer vision. However, in image fusion, current methods underestimate the potential of SSSM in capturing the global spatial information of both modalities. This limitation prevents the simultaneous consideration of the global spatial information from both modalities during interaction, leading to a lack of comprehensive perception of salient targets. Consequently, the fusion results tend to bias towards one modality instead of adaptively preserving salient targets. To address this issue, we propose the Saliency-aware Selective State Space Fusion Model (S4Fusion). In our S4Fusion, the designed Cross-Modal Spatial Awareness Module (CMSA) can simultaneously focus on global spatial information from both modalities while facilitating their interaction, thereby comprehensively capturing complementary information. Additionally, S4Fusion leverages a pre-trained network to perceive uncertainty in the fused images. By minimizing this uncertainty, S4Fusion adaptively highlights salient targets from both images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality images and enhances performance in downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Online action detection (OAD) aims to identify ongoing actions from streaming video in real-time, without access to future frames. Since these actions manifest at varying scales of granularity, ranging from coarse to fine, projecting an entire set of action frames to a single latent encoding may result in a lack of local information, necessitating the acquisition of action features across multiple scales. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale action learning transformer (MALT), which includes a novel recurrent decoder (used for feature fusion) that includes fewer parameters and can be trained more efficiently. A hierarchical encoder with multiple encoding branches is further proposed to capture multi-scale action features. The output from the preceding branch is then incrementally input to the subsequent branch as part of a cross-attention calculation. In this way, output features transition from coarse to fine as the branches deepen. We also introduce an explicit frame scoring mechanism employing sparse attention, which filters irrelevant frames more efficiently, without requiring an additional network. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets (THUMOS'14 and TVSeries), outperforming all existing models used for comparison, with an mAP of 0.2% for THUMOS'14 and an mcAP of 0.1% for TVseries.

- **Summary**: Interacting and understanding with text heavy visual content with multiple images is a major challenge for traditional vision models. This paper is on enhancing vision models' capability to comprehend or understand and learn from images containing a huge amount of textual information from the likes of textbooks and research papers which contain multiple images like graphs, etc and tables in them with different types of axes and scales. The approach involves dataset preprocessing, fine tuning which is by using instructional oriented data and evaluation. We also built a visual chat application integrating CLIP for image encoding and a model from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark which is developed to consider both textual and visual inputs. An accuracy of 96.71% was obtained. The aim of the project is to increase and also enhance the advance vision models' capabilities in understanding complex visual textual data interconnected data, contributing to multimodal AI.

- **Summary**: Ptychography is a powerful imaging technique that is used in a variety of fields, including materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, the accuracy of the reconstructed ptychography image is highly dependent on the accuracy of the recorded probe positions which often contain errors. These errors are typically corrected jointly with phase retrieval through numerical optimization approaches. When the error accumulates along the scan path or when the error magnitude is large, these approaches may not converge with satisfactory result. We propose a fundamentally new approach for ptychography probe position prediction for data with large position errors, where a neural network is used to make single-shot phase retrieval on individual diffraction patterns, yielding the object image at each scan point. The pairwise offsets among these images are then found using a robust image registration method, and the results are combined to yield the complete scan path by constructing and solving a linear equation. We show that our method can achieve good position prediction accuracy for data with large and accumulating errors on the order of $10^2$ pixels, a magnitude that often makes optimization-based algorithms fail to converge. For ptychography instruments without sophisticated position control equipment such as interferometers, our method is of significant practical potential.

- **Summary**: Scaling machine learning models significantly improves their performance. However, such gains come at the cost of inference being slow and resource-intensive. Early-exit neural networks (EENNs) offer a promising solution: they accelerate inference by allowing intermediate layers to exit and produce a prediction early. Yet a fundamental issue with EENNs is how to determine when to exit without severely degrading performance. In other words, when is it 'safe' for an EENN to go 'fast'? To address this issue, we investigate how to adapt frameworks of risk control to EENNs. Risk control offers a distribution-free, post-hoc solution that tunes the EENN's exiting mechanism so that exits only occur when the output is of sufficient quality. We empirically validate our insights on a range of vision and language tasks, demonstrating that risk control can produce substantial computational savings, all the while preserving user-specified performance goals.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as effective distribution estimators in vision, language, and reinforcement learning, but their use as priors in downstream tasks poses an intractable posterior inference problem. This paper studies amortized sampling of the posterior over data, $\mathbf{x}\sim p^{\rm post}(\mathbf{x})\propto p(\mathbf{x})r(\mathbf{x})$, in a model that consists of a diffusion generative model prior $p(\mathbf{x})$ and a black-box constraint or likelihood function $r(\mathbf{x})$. We state and prove the asymptotic correctness of a data-free learning objective, relative trajectory balance, for training a diffusion model that samples from this posterior, a problem that existing methods solve only approximately or in restricted cases. Relative trajectory balance arises from the generative flow network perspective on diffusion models, which allows the use of deep reinforcement learning techniques to improve mode coverage. Experiments illustrate the broad potential of unbiased inference of arbitrary posteriors under diffusion priors: in vision (classifier guidance), language (infilling under a discrete diffusion LLM), and multimodal data (text-to-image generation). Beyond generative modeling, we apply relative trajectory balance to the problem of continuous control with a score-based behavior prior, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks in offline reinforcement learning.

- **Summary**: Gaussian scale spaces are a cornerstone of signal representation and processing, with applications in filtering, multiscale analysis, anti-aliasing, and many more. However, obtaining such a scale space is costly and cumbersome, in particular for continuous representations such as neural fields. We present an efficient and lightweight method to learn the fully continuous, anisotropic Gaussian scale space of an arbitrary signal. Based on Fourier feature modulation and Lipschitz bounding, our approach is trained self-supervised, i.e., training does not require any manual filtering. Our neural Gaussian scale-space fields faithfully capture multiscale representations across a broad range of modalities, and support a diverse set of applications. These include images, geometry, light-stage data, texture anti-aliasing, and multiscale optimization.

- **Summary**: Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) is a fundamental, non-invasive diagnostic tool in cardiovascular medicine, enabling detailed visualization of cardiac structures crucial for diagnosing various heart conditions. Despite its widespread use, TTE ultrasound imaging faces inherent limitations, notably the trade-off between field of view (FoV) and resolution. This paper introduces a novel application of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs), specifically designed to extend the FoV in TTE ultrasound imaging while maintaining high resolution. Our proposed cGAN architecture, termed echoGAN, demonstrates the capability to generate realistic anatomical structures through outpainting, effectively broadening the viewable area in medical imaging. This advancement has the potential to enhance both automatic and manual ultrasound navigation, offering a more comprehensive view that could significantly reduce the learning curve associated with ultrasound imaging and aid in more accurate diagnoses. The results confirm that echoGAN reliably reproduce detailed cardiac features, thereby promising a significant step forward in the field of non-invasive cardiac naviagation and diagnostics.

- **Summary**: The visual projector, which bridges the vision and language modalities and facilitates cross-modal alignment, serves as a crucial component in MLLMs. However, measuring the effectiveness of projectors in vision-language alignment remains under-explored, which currently can only be inferred from the performance of MLLMs on downstream tasks. Motivated by the problem, this study examines the projector module by interpreting the vision-language semantic flow within MLLMs. Specifically, we trace back the semantic relevance flow from generated language tokens to raw visual encoder patches and the intermediate outputs produced by projectors. Our findings reveal that compressive projectors (e.g., QFormer), abstract visual patches into a limited set of semantic concepts, such as objects or attributes, resulting in a 'double abstraction' phenomenon. This involves a first visual semantic abstraction by the projector referring to pre-defined query tokens, and a second extraction by the LLM based on text instructions. The double abstraction is inefficient in training and will result in cumulative vision semantics deficiency. To mitigate this issue, we propose the key insight of 'Decouple Compression from Abstraction (DeCo), that is compressing the visual token number at the patch level by projectors and allowing the LLM to handle visual semantic abstraction entirely. Consequently, we adopt a simple compressor, i.e., 2D Adaptive Pooling, to downsample visual patches in a parameter-free manner. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that DeCo surpasses traditional compressive projectors regarding both performance and efficiency. It achieves performance gains of 0.9%, 7.1%, and 2.9% across the MLLM Benchmarks, Visual Localization, and Open-ended VQA tasks with fewer trainable parameters and faster convergence speed.

- **Summary**: The fusion of raw features from multiple sensors on an autonomous vehicle to create a Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation is crucial for planning and control systems. There is growing interest in using deep learning models for BEV semantic segmentation. Anticipating segmentation errors and improving the explainability of DNNs is essential for autonomous driving, yet it is under-studied. This paper introduces a benchmark for predictive uncertainty quantification in BEV segmentation. The benchmark assesses various approaches across three popular datasets using two representative backbones and focuses on the effectiveness of predicted uncertainty in identifying misclassified and out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels, as well as calibration. Empirical findings highlight the challenges in uncertainty quantification. Our results find that evidential deep learning based approaches show the most promise by efficiently quantifying aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. We propose the Uncertainty-Focal-Cross-Entropy (UFCE) loss, designed for highly imbalanced data, which consistently improves the segmentation quality and calibration. Additionally, we introduce a vacuity-scaled regularization term that enhances the model's focus on high uncertainty pixels, improving epistemic uncertainty quantification.

- **Summary**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have high computational costs to train their complex architectures. Throughout the training process, GANs' output is analyzed qualitatively based on the loss and synthetic images' diversity and quality. Based on this qualitative analysis, training is manually halted once the desired synthetic images are generated. By utilizing an early stopping criterion, the computational cost and dependence on manual oversight can be reduced yet impacted by training problems such as mode collapse, non-convergence, and instability. This is particularly prevalent in biomedical imagery, where training problems degrade the diversity and quality of synthetic images, and the high computational cost associated with training makes complex architectures increasingly inaccessible. This work proposes a novel early stopping criteria to quantitatively detect training problems, halt training, and reduce the computational costs associated with synthesizing biomedical images. Firstly, the range of generator and discriminator loss values is investigated to assess whether mode collapse, non-convergence, and instability occur sequentially, concurrently, or interchangeably throughout the training of GANs. Secondly, utilizing these occurrences in conjunction with the Mean Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM) and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores of synthetic images forms the basis of the proposed early stopping criteria. This work helps identify the occurrence of training problems in GANs using low-resource computational cost and reduces training time to generate diversified and high-quality synthetic images.

- **Summary**: Addressing hard cases in autonomous driving, such as anomalous road users, extreme weather conditions, and complex traffic interactions, presents significant challenges. To ensure safety, it is crucial to detect and manage these scenarios effectively for autonomous driving systems. However, the rarity and high-risk nature of these cases demand extensive, diverse datasets for training robust models. Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable zero-shot capabilities as being trained on extensive datasets. This work explores the potential of VLMs in detecting hard cases in autonomous driving. We demonstrate the capability of VLMs such as GPT-4v in detecting hard cases in traffic participant motion prediction on both agent and scenario levels. We introduce a feasible pipeline where VLMs, fed with sequential image frames with designed prompts, effectively identify challenging agents or scenarios, which are verified by existing prediction models. Moreover, by taking advantage of this detection of hard cases by VLMs, we further improve the training efficiency of the existing motion prediction pipeline by performing data selection for the training samples suggested by GPT. We show the effectiveness and feasibility of our pipeline incorporating VLMs with state-of-the-art methods on NuScenes datasets. The code is accessible at https://github.com/KTH-RPL/Detect_VLM.

- **Summary**: Text-rich images have significant and extensive value, deeply integrated into various aspects of human life. Notably, both visual cues and linguistic symbols in text-rich images play crucial roles in information transmission but are accompanied by diverse challenges. Therefore, the efficient and effective understanding of text-rich images is a crucial litmus test for the capability of Vision-Language Models. We have crafted an efficient vision-language model, StrucTexTv3, tailored to tackle various intelligent tasks for text-rich images. The significant design of StrucTexTv3 is presented in the following aspects: Firstly, we adopt a combination of an effective multi-scale reduced visual transformer and a multi-granularity token sampler (MG-Sampler) as a visual token generator, successfully solving the challenges of high-resolution input and complex representation learning for text-rich images. Secondly, we enhance the perception and comprehension abilities of StrucTexTv3 through instruction learning, seamlessly integrating various text-oriented tasks into a unified framework. Thirdly, we have curated a comprehensive collection of high-quality text-rich images, abbreviated as TIM-30M, encompassing diverse scenarios like incidental scenes, office documents, web pages, and screenshots, thereby improving the robustness of our model. Our method achieved SOTA results in text-rich image perception tasks, and significantly improved performance in comprehension tasks. Among multimodal models with LLM decoder of approximately 1.8B parameters, it stands out as a leader, which also makes the deployment of edge devices feasible. In summary, the StrucTexTv3 model, featuring efficient structural design, outstanding performance, and broad adaptability, offers robust support for diverse intelligent application tasks involving text-rich images, thus exhibiting immense potential for widespread application.

- **Summary**: Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is a zoonotic virus that poses a significant threat to public health, particularly in remote parts of Central and West Africa. Early detection of monkeypox lesions is crucial for effective treatment. However, due to its similarity with other skin diseases, monkeypox lesion detection is a challenging task. To detect monkeypox, many researchers used various deep-learning models such as MobileNetv2, VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, EfficientNetB3, MobileNetV2, and Xception. However, these models often require high storage space due to their large size. This study aims to improve the existing challenges by introducing a CNN model named MpoxSLDNet (Monkeypox Skin Lesion Detector Network) to facilitate early detection and categorization of Monkeypox lesions and Non-Monkeypox lesions in digital images. Our model represents a significant advancement in the field of monkeypox lesion detection by offering superior performance metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and AUC, compared to traditional pre-trained models such as VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121. The key novelty of our approach lies in MpoxSLDNet's ability to achieve high detection accuracy while requiring significantly less storage space than existing models. By addressing the challenge of high storage requirements, MpoxSLDNet presents a practical solution for early detection and categorization of monkeypox lesions in resource-constrained healthcare settings. In this study, we have used "Monkeypox Skin Lesion Dataset" comprising 1428 skin images of monkeypox lesions and 1764 skin images of Non-Monkeypox lesions. Dataset's limitations could potentially impact the model's ability to generalize to unseen cases. However, the MpoxSLDNet model achieved a validation accuracy of 94.56%, compared to 86.25%, 84.38%, and 67.19% for VGG16, DenseNet121, and ResNet50, respectively.

- **Summary**: Linear attention mechanisms have gained prominence in causal language models due to their linear computational complexity and enhanced speed. However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for generating high-quality images from textual descriptions. Despite their successes, these models often exhibit limited diversity in the sampled images, particularly when sampling with a high classifier-free guidance weight. To address this issue, we present Kaleido, a novel approach that enhances the diversity of samples by incorporating autoregressive latent priors. Kaleido integrates an autoregressive language model that encodes the original caption and generates latent variables, serving as abstract and intermediary representations for guiding and facilitating the image generation process. In this paper, we explore a variety of discrete latent representations, including textual descriptions, detection bounding boxes, object blobs, and visual tokens. These representations diversify and enrich the input conditions to the diffusion models, enabling more diverse outputs. Our experimental results demonstrate that Kaleido effectively broadens the diversity of the generated image samples from a given textual description while maintaining high image quality. Furthermore, we show that Kaleido adheres closely to the guidance provided by the generated latent variables, demonstrating its capability to effectively control and direct the image generation process.

- **Summary**: Adapting large-scale pre-trained generative models in a parameter-efficient manner is gaining traction. Traditional methods like low rank adaptation achieve parameter efficiency by imposing constraints but may not be optimal for tasks requiring high representation capacity. We propose a novel spectrum-aware adaptation framework for generative models. Our method adjusts both singular values and their basis vectors of pretrained weights. Using the Kronecker product and efficient Stiefel optimizers, we achieve parameter-efficient adaptation of orthogonal matrices. We introduce Spectral Orthogonal Decomposition Adaptation (SODA), which balances computational efficiency and representation capacity. Extensive evaluations on text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate SODA's effectiveness, offering a spectrum-aware alternative to existing fine-tuning methods.

- **Summary**: Previous work has demonstrated that, in the Variance Preserving (VP) scenario, the nascent Directly Denoising Diffusion Models (DDDM) can generate high-quality images in one step while achieving even better performance in multistep sampling. However, the Pseudo-LPIPS loss used in DDDM leads to concerns about the bias in assessment. Here, we propose a unified DDDM (uDDDM) framework that generates images in one-step/multiple steps for both Variance Preserving (VP) and Variance Exploding (VE) cases. We provide theoretical proofs of the existence and uniqueness of the model's solution paths, as well as the non-intersecting property of the sampling paths. Additionally, we propose an adaptive Pseudo-Huber loss function to balance the convergence to the true solution and the stability of convergence process.Through a comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that uDDDMs achieve FID scores comparable to the best-performing methods available for CIFAR-10 in both VP and VE. Specifically, uDDDM achieves one-step generation on CIFAR10 with FID of 2.63 and 2.53 for VE and VP respectively. By extending the sampling to 1000 steps, we further reduce FID score to 1.71 and 1.65 for VE and VP respectively, setting state-of-the-art performance in both cases.

- **Summary**: Realistic conditional 3D scene synthesis significantly enhances and accelerates the creation of virtual environments, which can also provide extensive training data for computer vision and robotics research among other applications. Diffusion models have shown great performance in related applications, e.g., making precise arrangements of unordered sets. However, these models have not been fully explored in floor-conditioned scene synthesis problems. We present MiDiffusion, a novel mixed discrete-continuous diffusion model architecture, designed to synthesize plausible 3D indoor scenes from given room types, floor plans, and potentially pre-existing objects. We represent a scene layout by a 2D floor plan and a set of objects, each defined by its category, location, size, and orientation. Our approach uniquely implements structured corruption across the mixed discrete semantic and continuous geometric domains, resulting in a better conditioned problem for the reverse denoising step. We evaluate our approach on the 3D-FRONT dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that MiDiffusion substantially outperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive and diffusion models in floor-conditioned 3D scene synthesis. In addition, our models can handle partial object constraints via a corruption-and-masking strategy without task specific training. We show MiDiffusion maintains clear advantages over existing approaches in scene completion and furniture arrangement experiments.

- **Summary**: Severe data imbalance naturally exists among web-scale vision-language datasets. Despite this, we find CLIP pre-trained thereupon exhibits notable robustness to the data imbalance compared to supervised learning, and demonstrates significant effectiveness in learning generalizable representations. With an aim to investigate the reasons behind this finding, we conduct controlled experiments to study various underlying factors, and reveal that CLIP's pretext task forms a dynamic classification problem wherein only a subset of classes is present in training. This isolates the bias from dominant classes and implicitly balances the learning signal. Furthermore, the robustness and discriminability of CLIP improve with more descriptive language supervision, larger data scale, and broader open-world concepts, which are inaccessible to supervised learning. Our study not only uncovers the mechanisms behind CLIP's generalizability beyond data imbalance but also provides transferable insights for the research community. The findings are validated in both supervised and self-supervised learning, enabling models trained on imbalanced data to achieve CLIP-level performance on diverse recognition tasks.

- **Summary**: Image relighting is the task of showing what a scene from a source image would look like if illuminated differently. Inverse graphics schemes recover an explicit representation of geometry and a set of chosen intrinsics, then relight with some form of renderer. However error control for inverse graphics is difficult, and inverse graphics methods can represent only the effects of the chosen intrinsics. This paper describes a relighting method that is entirely data-driven, where intrinsics and lighting are each represented as latent variables. Our approach produces SOTA relightings of real scenes, as measured by standard metrics. We show that albedo can be recovered from our latent intrinsics without using any example albedos, and that the albedos recovered are competitive with SOTA methods.

- **Summary**: In the quest for artificial general intelligence, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a focal point in recent advancements. However, the predominant focus remains on developing their capabilities in static image understanding. The potential of MLLMs in processing sequential visual data is still insufficiently explored, highlighting the absence of a comprehensive, high-quality assessment of their performance. In this paper, we introduce Video-MME, the first-ever full-spectrum, Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark of MLLMs in Video analysis. Our work distinguishes from existing benchmarks through four key features: 1) Diversity in video types, spanning 6 primary visual domains with 30 subfields to ensure broad scenario generalizability; 2) Duration in temporal dimension, encompassing both short-, medium-, and long-term videos, ranging from 11 seconds to 1 hour, for robust contextual dynamics; 3) Breadth in data modalities, integrating multi-modal inputs besides video frames, including subtitles and audios, to unveil the all-round capabilities of MLLMs; 4) Quality in annotations, utilizing rigorous manual labeling by expert annotators to facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. 900 videos with a total of 256 hours are manually selected and annotated by repeatedly viewing all the video content, resulting in 2,700 question-answer pairs. With Video-MME, we extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT-4 series and Gemini 1.5 Pro, as well as open-source image models like InternVL-Chat-V1.5 and video models like LLaVA-NeXT-Video. Our experiments reveal that Gemini 1.5 Pro is the best-performing commercial model, significantly outperforming the open-source models. Our dataset along with these findings underscores the need for further improvements in handling longer sequences and multi-modal data. Project Page: https://video-mme.github.io
