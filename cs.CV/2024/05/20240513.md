- **Summary**: In the high-stakes world of baseball, every nuance of a pitcher's mechanics holds the key to maximizing performance and minimizing runs. Traditional analysis methods often rely on pre-recorded offline numerical data, hindering their application in the dynamic environment of live games. Broadcast video analysis, while seemingly ideal, faces significant challenges due to factors like motion blur and low resolution. To address these challenges, we introduce PitcherNet, an end-to-end automated system that analyzes pitcher kinematics directly from live broadcast video, thereby extracting valuable pitch statistics including velocity, release point, pitch position, and release extension. This system leverages three key components: (1) Player tracking and identification by decoupling actions from player kinematics; (2) Distribution and depth-aware 3D human modeling; and (3) Kinematic-driven pitch statistics. Experimental validation demonstrates that PitcherNet achieves robust analysis results with 96.82% accuracy in pitcher tracklet identification, reduced joint position error by 1.8mm and superior analytics compared to baseline methods. By enabling performance-critical kinematic analysis from broadcast video, PitcherNet paves the way for the future of baseball analytics by optimizing pitching strategies, preventing injuries, and unlocking a deeper understanding of pitcher mechanics, forever transforming the game.

- **Summary**: Medical images are often more difficult to acquire than natural images due to the specialism of the equipment and technology, which leads to less medical image datasets. So it is hard to train a strong pretrained medical vision model. How to make the best of natural pretrained vision model and adapt in medical domain still pends. For image classification, a popular method is linear probe (LP). However, LP only considers the output after feature extraction. Yet, there exists a gap between input medical images and natural pretrained vision model. We introduce visual prompting (VP) to fill in the gap, and analyze the strategies of coupling between LP and VP. We design a joint learning loss function containing categorisation loss and discrepancy loss, which describe the variance of prompted and plain images, naming this joint training strategy MoVL (Mixture of Visual Prompting and Linear Probe). We experiment on 4 medical image classification datasets, with two mainstream architectures, ResNet and CLIP. Results shows that without changing the parameters and architecture of backbone model and with less parameters, there is potential for MoVL to achieve full finetune (FF) accuracy (on four medical datasets, average 90.91% for MoVL and 91.13% for FF). On out of distribution medical dataset, our method(90.33%) can outperform FF (85.15%) with absolute 5.18 % lead.

- **Summary**: Hand-drawn cartoon animation employs sketches and flat-color segments to create the illusion of motion. While recent advancements like CLIP, SVD, and Sora show impressive results in understanding and generating natural video by scaling large models with extensive datasets, they are not as effective for cartoons. Through our empirical experiments, we argue that this ineffectiveness stems from a notable bias in hand-drawn cartoons that diverges from the distribution of natural videos. Can we harness the success of the scaling paradigm to benefit cartoon research? Unfortunately, until now, there has not been a sizable cartoon dataset available for exploration. In this research, we propose the Sakuga-42M Dataset, the first large-scale cartoon animation dataset. Sakuga-42M comprises 42 million keyframes covering various artistic styles, regions, and years, with comprehensive semantic annotations including video-text description pairs, anime tags, content taxonomies, etc. We pioneer the benefits of such a large-scale cartoon dataset on comprehension and generation tasks by finetuning contemporary foundation models like Video CLIP, Video Mamba, and SVD, achieving outstanding performance on cartoon-related tasks. Our motivation is to introduce large-scaling to cartoon research and foster generalization and robustness in future cartoon applications. Dataset, Code, and Pretrained Models will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Text-to-video generation task has witnessed a notable progress, with the generated outcomes reflecting the text prompts with high fidelity and impressive visual qualities. However, current text-to-video generation models are invariably focused on conveying the visual elements of a single scene, and have so far been indifferent to another important potential of the medium, namely a storytelling. In this paper, we examine text-to-video generation from a storytelling perspective, which has been hardly investigated, and make empirical remarks that spotlight the limitations of current text-to-video generation scheme. We also propose an evaluation framework for storytelling aspects of videos, and discuss the potential future directions.

- **Summary**: In the character animation field, modern supervised keyframe interpolation models have demonstrated exceptional performance in constructing natural human motions from sparse pose definitions. As supervised models, large motion datasets are necessary to facilitate the learning process; however, since motion is represented with fixed hierarchical skeletons, such datasets are incompatible for skeletons outside the datasets' native configurations. Consequently, the expected availability of a motion dataset for desired skeletons severely hinders the feasibility of learned interpolation in practice. To combat this limitation, we propose Point Cloud-based Motion Representation Learning (PC-MRL), an unsupervised approach to enabling cross-compatibility between skeletons for motion interpolation learning. PC-MRL consists of a skeleton obfuscation strategy using temporal point cloud sampling, and an unsupervised skeleton reconstruction method from point clouds. We devise a temporal point-wise K-nearest neighbors loss for unsupervised learning. Moreover, we propose First-frame Offset Quaternion (FOQ) and Rest Pose Augmentation (RPA) strategies to overcome necessary limitations of our unsupervised point cloud-to-skeletal motion process. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PC-MRL in motion interpolation for desired skeletons without supervision from native datasets.



### CLIP-Powered TASS: Target-Aware Single-Stream Network for Audio-Visual Question Answering

- **Summary**: While vision-language pretrained models (VLMs) excel in various multimodal understanding tasks, their potential in fine-grained audio-visual reasoning, particularly for audio-visual question answering (AVQA), remains largely unexplored. AVQA presents specific challenges for VLMs due to the requirement of visual understanding at the region level and seamless integration with audio modality. Previous VLM-based AVQA methods merely used CLIP as a feature encoder but underutilized its knowledge, and mistreated audio and video as separate entities in a dual-stream framework as most AVQA methods. This paper proposes a new CLIP-powered target-aware single-stream (TASS) network for AVQA using the image-text matching knowledge of the pretrained model through the audio-visual matching characteristic of nature. It consists of two key components: the target-aware spatial grounding module (TSG+) and the single-stream joint temporal grounding module (JTG). Specifically, we propose a TSG+ module to transfer the image-text matching knowledge from CLIP models to our region-text matching process without corresponding ground-truth labels. Moreover, unlike previous separate dual-stream networks that still required an additional audio-visual fusion module, JTG unifies audio-visual fusion and question-aware temporal grounding in a simplified single-stream architecture. It treats audio and video as a cohesive entity and further extends the pretrained image-text knowledge to audio-text matching by preserving their temporal correlation with our proposed cross-modal synchrony (CMS) loss. Extensive experiments conducted on the MUSIC-AVQA benchmark verified the effectiveness of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Text-based person retrieval (TPR) aims to retrieve images of a person from an extensive array of candidates based on a given textual description. The core challenge lies in mapping visual and textual data into a unified latent space. While existing TPR methods concentrate on recognizing explicit and positive characteristics, they often neglect the critical influence of negative descriptors, resulting in potential false positives that fulfill positive criteria but could be excluded by negative descriptors. To alleviate these issues, we introduce DualFocus, a unified framework for integrating positive and negative descriptors to enhance the interpretative accuracy of vision-language foundational models regarding textual queries. DualFocus employs Dual (Positive/Negative) Attribute Prompt Learning (DAPL), which integrates Dual Image-Attribute Contrastive (DIAC) Learning and Sensitive Image-Attributes Matching (SIAM) Learning. This way DualFocus enhances the detection of unseen attributes, thereby boosting retrieval precision. To further achieve a balance between coarse and fine-grained alignment of visual and textual embeddings, we propose the Dynamic Tokenwise Similarity (DTS) loss, which refines the representation of both matching and non-matching descriptions, thereby enhancing the matching process through a detailed and adaptable similarity assessment. By focusing on token-level comparisons, DualFocus significantly outperforms existing techniques in both precision and robustness. The experiment results highlight DualFocus's superior performance on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid.

- **Summary**: The increasing prominence of e-commerce has underscored the importance of Virtual Try-On (VTON). However, previous studies predominantly focus on the 2D realm and rely heavily on extensive data for training. Research on 3D VTON primarily centers on garment-body shape compatibility, a topic extensively covered in 2D VTON. Thanks to advances in 3D scene editing, a 2D diffusion model has now been adapted for 3D editing via multi-viewpoint editing. In this work, we propose GaussianVTON, an innovative 3D VTON pipeline integrating Gaussian Splatting (GS) editing with 2D VTON. To facilitate a seamless transition from 2D to 3D VTON, we propose, for the first time, the use of only images as editing prompts for 3D editing. To further address issues, e.g., face blurring, garment inaccuracy, and degraded viewpoint quality during editing, we devise a three-stage refinement strategy to gradually mitigate potential issues. Furthermore, we introduce a new editing strategy termed Edit Recall Reconstruction (ERR) to tackle the limitations of previous editing strategies in leading to complex geometric changes. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GaussianVTON, offering a novel perspective on 3D VTON while also establishing a novel starting point for image-prompting 3D scene editing.

- **Summary**: Significant progress has been made in scene text detection models since the rise of deep learning, but scene text layout analysis, which aims to group detected text instances as paragraphs, has not kept pace. Previous works either treated text detection and grouping using separate models, or train a model from scratch while using a unified one. All of them have not yet made full use of the already well-trained text detectors and easily obtainable detection datasets. In this paper, we present Text Grouping Adapter (TGA), a module that can enable the utilization of various pre-trained text detectors to learn layout analysis, allowing us to adopt a well-trained text detector right off the shelf or just fine-tune it efficiently. Designed to be compatible with various text detector architectures, TGA takes detected text regions and image features as universal inputs to assemble text instance features. To capture broader contextual information for layout analysis, we propose to predict text group masks from text instance features by one-to-many assignment. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, even with frozen pre-trained models, incorporating our TGA into various pre-trained text detectors and text spotters can achieve superior layout analysis performance, simultaneously inheriting generalized text detection ability from pre-training. In the case of full parameter fine-tuning, we can further improve layout analysis performance.

- **Summary**: Transportation of samples across different domains is a central task in several machine learning problems. A sensible requirement for domain transfer tasks in computer vision and language domains is the sparsity of the transportation map, i.e., the transfer algorithm aims to modify the least number of input features while transporting samples across the source and target domains. In this work, we propose Elastic Net Optimal Transport (ENOT) to address the sparse distribution transfer problem. The ENOT framework utilizes the $L_1$-norm and $L_2$-norm regularization mechanisms to find a sparse and stable transportation map between the source and target domains. To compute the ENOT transport map, we consider the dual formulation of the ENOT optimization task and prove that the sparsified gradient of the optimal potential function in the ENOT's dual representation provides the ENOT transport map. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of the ENOT framework to perform feature selection for sparse domain transfer. We present the numerical results of applying ENOT to several domain transfer problems for synthetic Gaussian mixtures and real image and text data. Our empirical results indicate the success of the ENOT framework in identifying a sparse domain transport map.

- **Summary**: Class incremental learning consists in training discriminative models to classify an increasing number of classes over time. However, doing so using only the newly added class data leads to the known problem of catastrophic forgetting of the previous classes. Recently, dynamic deep learning architectures have been shown to exhibit a better stability-plasticity trade-off by dynamically adding new feature extractors to the model in order to learn new classes followed by a compression step to scale the model back to its original size, thus avoiding a growing number of parameters. In this context, we propose a new algorithm that enhances the compression of previous class knowledge by cutting and mixing patches of previous class samples with the new images during compression using our Rehearsal-CutMix method. We show that this new data augmentation reduces catastrophic forgetting by specifically targeting past class information and improving its compression. Extensive experiments performed on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets under diverse incremental learning evaluation protocols demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art . The code will be made available upon publication of our work.



### Support-Query Prototype Fusion Network for Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation

- **Summary**: In recent years, deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has achieved remarkable success in many applications. However, their heavy reliance on extensive labeled data and limited generalization ability to unseen classes pose challenges to their suitability for medical image processing tasks. Few-shot learning, which utilizes a small amount of labeled data to generalize to unseen classes, has emerged as a critical research area, attracting substantial attention. Currently, most studies employ a prototype-based approach, in which prototypical networks are used to construct prototypes from the support set, guiding the processing of the query set to obtain the final results. While effective, this approach heavily relies on the support set while neglecting the query set, resulting in notable disparities within the model classes. To mitigate this drawback, we propose a novel Support-Query Prototype Fusion Network (SQPFNet). SQPFNet initially generates several support prototypes for the foreground areas of the support images, thus producing a coarse segmentation mask. Subsequently, a query prototype is constructed based on the coarse segmentation mask, additionally exploiting pattern information in the query set. Thus, SQPFNet constructs high-quality support-query fused prototypes, upon which the query image is segmented to obtain the final refined query mask. Evaluation results on two public datasets, SABS and CMR, show that SQPFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: High-quality images are crucial in remote sensing and UAV applications, but atmospheric haze can severely degrade image quality, making image dehazing a critical research area. Since the introduction of deep convolutional neural networks, numerous approaches have been proposed, and even more have emerged with the development of vision transformers and contrastive/few-shot learning. Simultaneously, papers describing dehazing architectures applicable to various Remote Sensing (RS) domains are also being published. This review goes beyond the traditional focus on benchmarked haze datasets, as we also explore the application of dehazing techniques to remote sensing and UAV datasets, providing a comprehensive overview of both deep learning and prior-based approaches in these domains. We identify key challenges, including the lack of large-scale RS datasets and the need for more robust evaluation metrics, and outline potential solutions and future research directions to address them. This review is the first, to our knowledge, to provide comprehensive discussions on both existing and very recent dehazing approaches (as of 2024) on benchmarked and RS datasets, including UAV-based imagery.

- **Summary**: Colonoscopy is a common and practical method for detecting and treating polyps. Segmenting polyps from colonoscopy image is useful for diagnosis and surgery progress. Nevertheless, achieving excellent segmentation performance is still difficult because of polyp characteristics like shape, color, condition, and obvious non-distinction from the surrounding context. This work presents a new novel architecture namely Adaptation of Distinct Semantics for Uncertain Areas in Polyp Segmentation (ADSNet), which modifies misclassified details and recovers weak features having the ability to vanish and not be detected at the final stage. The architecture consists of a complementary trilateral decoder to produce an early global map. A continuous attention module modifies semantics of high-level features to analyze two separate semantics of the early global map. The suggested method is experienced on polyp benchmarks in learning ability and generalization ability, experimental results demonstrate the great correction and recovery ability leading to better segmentation performance compared to the other state of the art in the polyp image segmentation task. Especially, the proposed architecture could be experimented flexibly for other CNN-based encoders, Transformer-based encoders, and decoder backbones.

- **Summary**: Deep image hashing aims to map input images into simple binary hash codes via deep neural networks and thus enable effective large-scale image retrieval. Recently, hybrid networks that combine convolution and Transformer have achieved superior performance on various computer tasks and have attracted extensive attention from researchers. Nevertheless, the potential benefits of such hybrid networks in image retrieval still need to be verified. To this end, we propose a hybrid convolutional and self-attention deep hashing method known as HybridHash. Specifically, we propose a backbone network with stage-wise architecture in which the block aggregation function is introduced to achieve the effect of local self-attention and reduce the computational complexity. The interaction module has been elaborately designed to promote the communication of information between image blocks and to enhance the visual representations. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on three widely used datasets: CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE and IMAGENET. The experimental results demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper has superior performance with respect to state-of-the-art deep hashing methods.

- **Summary**: High-resolution road representations are a key factor for the success of (highly) automated driving functions. These representations, for example, high-definition (HD) maps, contain accurate information on a multitude of factors, among others: road geometry, lane information, and traffic signs. Through the growing complexity and functionality of automated driving functions, also the requirements on testing and evaluation grow continuously. This leads to an increasing interest in virtual test drives for evaluation purposes. As roads play a crucial role in traffic flow, accurate real-world representations are needed, especially when deriving realistic driving behavior data. This paper proposes a novel approach to generate realistic road representations based solely on point cloud information, independent of the LiDAR sensor, mounting position, and without the need for odometry data, multi-sensor fusion, machine learning, or highly-accurate calibration. As the primary use case is simulation, we use the OpenDRIVE format for evaluation.

- **Summary**: Berry picking has long-standing traditions in Finland, yet it is challenging and can potentially be dangerous. The integration of drones equipped with advanced imaging techniques represents a transformative leap forward, optimising harvests and promising sustainable practices. We propose WildBe, the first image dataset of wild berries captured in peatlands and under the canopy of Finnish forests using drones. Unlike previous and related datasets, WildBe includes new varieties of berries, such as bilberries, cloudberries, lingonberries, and crowberries, captured under severe light variations and in cluttered environments. WildBe features 3,516 images, including a total of 18,468 annotated bounding boxes. We carry out a comprehensive analysis of WildBe using six popular object detectors, assessing their effectiveness in berry detection across different forest regions and camera types. We will release WildBe publicly.

- **Summary**: Tattoos have been used effectively as soft biometrics to assist law enforcement in the identification of offenders and victims, as they contain discriminative information, and are a useful indicator to locate members of a criminal gang or organisation. Due to various privacy issues in the acquisition of images containing tattoos, only a limited number of databases exists. This lack of databases has delayed the development of new methods to effectively retrieve a potential suspect's tattoo images from a candidate gallery. To mitigate this issue, in our work, we use an unsupervised generative approach to create a balanced database consisting of 28,550 semi-synthetic images with tattooed subjects from 571 tattoo categories. Further, we introduce a novel Tattoo Template Reconstruction Network (TattTRN), which learns to map the input tattoo sample to its respective tattoo template to enhance the distinguishing attributes of the final feature embedding. Experimental results with real data, i.e., WebTattoo and BIVTatt databases, demonstrate the soundness of the presented approach: an accuracy of up to 99% is achieved for checking at most the first 20 entries of the candidate list.

- **Summary**: Current multi-modality driving frameworks normally fuse representation by utilizing attention between single-modality branches. However, the existing networks still suppress the driving performance as the Image and LiDAR branches are independent and lack a unified observation representation. Thus, this paper proposes MaskFuser, which tokenizes various modalities into a unified semantic feature space and provides a joint representation for further behavior cloning in driving contexts. Given the unified token representation, MaskFuser is the first work to introduce cross-modality masked auto-encoder training. The masked training enhances the fusion representation by reconstruction on masked tokens. Architecturally, a hybrid-fusion network is proposed to combine advantages from both early and late fusion: For the early fusion stage, modalities are fused by performing monotonic-to-BEV translation attention between branches; Late fusion is performed by tokenizing various modalities into a unified token space with shared encoding on it. MaskFuser respectively reaches a driving score of 49.05 and route completion of 92.85% on the CARLA LongSet6 benchmark evaluation, which improves the best of previous baselines by 1.74 and 3.21%. The introduced masked fusion increases driving stability under damaged sensory inputs. MaskFuser outperforms the best of previous baselines on driving score by 6.55 (27.8%), 1.53 (13.8%), 1.57 (30.9%), respectively given sensory masking ratios 25%, 50%, and 75%.

- **Summary**: Unveiling the real appearance of retouched faces to prevent malicious users from deceptive advertising and economic fraud has been an increasing concern in the era of digital economics. This article makes the first attempt to investigate the face retouching reversal (FRR) problem. We first collect an FRR dataset, named deepFRR, which contains 50,000 StyleGAN-generated high-resolution (1024*1024) facial images and their corresponding retouched ones by a commercial online API. To our best knowledge, deepFRR is the first FRR dataset tailored for training the deep FRR models. Then, we propose a novel diffusion-based FRR approach (FRRffusion) for the FRR task. Our FRRffusion consists of a coarse-to-fine two-stage network: A diffusion-based Facial Morpho-Architectonic Restorer (FMAR) is constructed to generate the basic contours of low-resolution faces in the first stage, while a Transformer-based Hyperrealistic Facial Detail Generator (HFDG) is designed to create high-resolution facial details in the second stage. Tested on deepFRR, our FRRffusion surpasses the GP-UNIT and Stable Diffusion methods by a large margin in four widespread quantitative metrics. Especially, the de-retouched images by our FRRffusion are visually much closer to the raw face images than both the retouched face images and those restored by the GP-UNIT and Stable Diffusion methods in terms of qualitative evaluation with 85 subjects. These results sufficiently validate the efficacy of our work, bridging the recently-standing gap between the FRR and generic image restoration tasks. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/GZHU-DVL/FRRffusion.

- **Summary**: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task for estimating rigid transformations between point clouds. Previous studies have used geometric information for extracting features, matching and estimating transformation. Recently, owing to the advancement of RGB-D sensors, researchers have attempted to utilize visual information to improve registration performance. However, these studies focused on extracting distinctive features by deep feature fusion, which cannot effectively solve the negative effects of each feature's weakness, and cannot sufficiently leverage the valid information. In this paper, we propose a new feature combination framework, which applies a looser but more effective fusion and can achieve better performance. An explicit filter based on transformation consistency is designed for the combination framework, which can overcome each feature's weakness. And an adaptive threshold determined by the error distribution is proposed to extract more valid information from the two types of features. Owing to the distinctive design, our proposed framework can estimate more accurate correspondences and is applicable to both hand-crafted and learning-based feature descriptors. Experiments on ScanNet show that our method achieves a state-of-the-art performance and the rotation accuracy of 99.1%.



### Environmental Matching Attack Against Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Object Detection

- **Summary**: Object detection techniques for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) rely on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Nonetheless, adversarial patches generated by existing algorithms in the UAV domain pay very little attention to the naturalness of adversarial patches. Moreover, imposing constraints directly on adversarial patches makes it difficult to generate patches that appear natural to the human eye while ensuring a high attack success rate. We notice that patches are natural looking when their overall color is consistent with the environment. Therefore, we propose a new method named Environmental Matching Attack(EMA) to address the issue of optimizing the adversarial patch under the constraints of color. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to consider natural patches in the domain of UAVs. The EMA method exploits strong prior knowledge of a pretrained stable diffusion to guide the optimization direction of the adversarial patch, where the text guidance can restrict the color of the patch. To better match the environment, the contrast and brightness of the patch are appropriately adjusted. Instead of optimizing the adversarial patch itself, we optimize an adversarial perturbation patch which initializes to zero so that the model can better trade off attacking performance and naturalness. Experiments conducted on the DroneVehicle and Carpk datasets have shown that our work can reach nearly the same attack performance in the digital attack(no greater than 2 in mAP$\%$), surpass the baseline method in the physical specific scenarios, and exhibit a significant advantage in terms of naturalness in visualization and color difference with the environment.

- **Summary**: The deep neural network (DNN) models are widely used for object detection in automated driving systems (ADS). Yet, such models are prone to errors which can have serious safety implications. Introspection and self-assessment models that aim to detect such errors are therefore of paramount importance for the safe deployment of ADS. Current research on this topic has focused on techniques to monitor the integrity of the perception mechanism in ADS. Existing introspection models in the literature, however, largely concentrate on detecting perception errors by assigning equal importance to all parts of the input data frame to the perception module. This generic approach overlooks the varying safety significance of different objects within a scene, which obscures the recognition of safety-critical errors, posing challenges in assessing the reliability of perception in specific, crucial instances. Motivated by this shortcoming of state of the art, this paper proposes a novel method integrating raw activation patterns of the underlying DNNs, employed by the perception module, analysis with spatial filtering techniques. This novel approach enhances the accuracy of runtime introspection of the DNN-based 3D object detections by selectively focusing on an area of interest in the data, thereby contributing to the safety and efficacy of ADS perception self-assessment processes.

- **Summary**: Existing Blind image Super-Resolution (BSR) methods focus on estimating either kernel or degradation information, but have long overlooked the essential content details. In this paper, we propose a novel BSR approach, Content-aware Degradation-driven Transformer (CDFormer), to capture both degradation and content representations. However, low-resolution images cannot provide enough content details, and thus we introduce a diffusion-based module $CDFormer_{diff}$ to first learn Content Degradation Prior (CDP) in both low- and high-resolution images, and then approximate the real distribution given only low-resolution information. Moreover, we apply an adaptive SR network $CDFormer_{SR}$ that effectively utilizes CDP to refine features. Compared to previous diffusion-based SR methods, we treat the diffusion model as an estimator that can overcome the limitations of expensive sampling time and excessive diversity. Experiments show that CDFormer can outperform existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks under blind settings. Codes and models will be available at \href{https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/CDFormer}{https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/CDFormer}.

- **Summary**: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) require large amounts of annotated training data for a good performance. Often this data is generated using manual labeling (error-prone and time-consuming) or rendering (requiring geometry and material information). Both approaches make it difficult or uneconomic to apply them to many small-scale applications. A fast and straightforward approach of acquiring the necessary training data would allow the adoption of deep learning to even the smallest of applications. Chroma keying is the process of replacing a color (usually blue or green) with another background. Instead of chroma keying, we propose luminance keying for fast and straightforward training image acquisition. We deploy a black screen with high light absorption (99.99\%) to record roughly 1-minute long videos of our target objects, circumventing typical problems of chroma keying, such as color bleeding or color overlap between background color and object color. Next we automatically mask our objects using simple brightness thresholding, saving the need for manual annotation. Finally, we automatically place the objects on random backgrounds and train a 2D object detector. We do extensive evaluation of the performance on the widely-used YCB-V object set and compare favourably to other conventional techniques such as rendering, without needing 3D meshes, materials or any other information of our target objects and in a fraction of the time needed for other approaches. Our work demonstrates highly accurate training data acquisition allowing to start training state-of-the-art networks within minutes.



### Quality-aware Selective Fusion Network for V-D-T Salient Object Detection

- **Summary**: Depth images and thermal images contain the spatial geometry information and surface temperature information, which can act as complementary information for the RGB modality. However, the quality of the depth and thermal images is often unreliable in some challenging scenarios, which will result in the performance degradation of the two-modal based salient object detection (SOD). Meanwhile, some researchers pay attention to the triple-modal SOD task, where they attempt to explore the complementarity of the RGB image, the depth image, and the thermal image. However, existing triple-modal SOD methods fail to perceive the quality of depth maps and thermal images, which leads to performance degradation when dealing with scenes with low-quality depth and thermal images. Therefore, we propose a quality-aware selective fusion network (QSF-Net) to conduct VDT salient object detection, which contains three subnets including the initial feature extraction subnet, the quality-aware region selection subnet, and the region-guided selective fusion subnet. Firstly, except for extracting features, the initial feature extraction subnet can generate a preliminary prediction map from each modality via a shrinkage pyramid architecture. Then, we design the weakly-supervised quality-aware region selection subnet to generate the quality-aware maps. Concretely, we first find the high-quality and low-quality regions by using the preliminary predictions, which further constitute the pseudo label that can be used to train this subnet. Finally, the region-guided selective fusion subnet purifies the initial features under the guidance of the quality-aware maps, and then fuses the triple-modal features and refines the edge details of prediction maps through the intra-modality and inter-modality attention (IIA) module and the edge refinement (ER) module, respectively. Extensive experiments are performed on VDT-2048

- **Summary**: Sign Language Production (SLP) is a challenging task, given the limited resources available and the inherent diversity within sign data. As a result, previous works have suffered from the problem of regression to the mean, leading to under-articulated and incomprehensible signing. In this paper, we propose using dictionary examples and a learnt codebook of facial expressions to create expressive sign language sequences. However, simply concatenating signs and adding the face creates robotic and unnatural sequences. To address this we present a 7-step approach to effectively stitch sequences together. First, by normalizing each sign into a canonical pose, cropping, and stitching we create a continuous sequence. Then, by applying filtering in the frequency domain and resampling each sign, we create cohesive natural sequences that mimic the prosody found in the original data. We leverage a SignGAN model to map the output to a photo-realistic signer and present a complete Text-to-Sign (T2S) SLP pipeline. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach, showcasing state-of-the-art performance across all datasets. Finally, a user evaluation shows our approach outperforms the baseline model and is capable of producing realistic sign language sequences.

- **Summary**: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), a highly infectious respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as an unprecedented healthcare crisis. The pandemic had a devastating impact on the health, well-being, and economy of the global population. Early screening and diagnosis of symptomatic patients plays crucial role in isolation of patient to help stop community transmission as well as providing early treatment helping in reducing the mortality rate. Although, the RT-PCR test is the gold standard for COVID-19 testing, it is a manual, laborious, time consuming, uncomfortable, and invasive process. Due to its accessibility, availability, lower-cost, ease of sanitisation, and portable setup, chest X-Ray imaging can serve as an effective screening and diagnostic tool. In this study, we first highlight limitations of existing datasets and studies in terms of data quality, data imbalance, and evaluation strategy. Second, we curated a large-scale COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset from many publicly available COVID-19 imaging databases and proposed a pre-processing pipeline to improve quality of the dataset. We proposed CoVScreen, an CNN architecture to train and test the curated dataset. The experimental results applying different classification scenarios on the curated dataset in terms of various evaluation metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed methodology in the screening of COVID-19 infection.

- **Summary**: The development of generative artificial intelligence for human motion generation has expanded rapidly, necessitating a unified evaluation framework. This paper presents a detailed review of eight evaluation metrics for human motion generation, highlighting their unique features and shortcomings. We propose standardized practices through a unified evaluation setup to facilitate consistent model comparisons. Additionally, we introduce a novel metric that assesses diversity in temporal distortion by analyzing warping diversity, thereby enhancing the evaluation of temporal data. We also conduct experimental analyses of three generative models using a publicly available dataset, offering insights into the interpretation of each metric in specific case scenarios. Our goal is to offer a clear, user-friendly evaluation framework for newcomers, complemented by publicly accessible code.

- **Summary**: Monocular 3D object detection aims for precise 3D localization and identification of objects from a single-view image. Despite its recent progress, it often struggles while handling pervasive object occlusions that tend to complicate and degrade the prediction of object dimensions, depths, and orientations. We design MonoMAE, a monocular 3D detector inspired by Masked Autoencoders that addresses the object occlusion issue by masking and reconstructing objects in the feature space. MonoMAE consists of two novel designs. The first is depth-aware masking that selectively masks certain parts of non-occluded object queries in the feature space for simulating occluded object queries for network training. It masks non-occluded object queries by balancing the masked and preserved query portions adaptively according to the depth information. The second is lightweight query completion that works with the depth-aware masking to learn to reconstruct and complete the masked object queries. With the proposed object occlusion and completion, MonoMAE learns enriched 3D representations that achieve superior monocular 3D detection performance qualitatively and quantitatively for both occluded and non-occluded objects. Additionally, MonoMAE learns generalizable representations that can work well in new domains.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving systems require a quick and robust perception of the nearby environment to carry out their routines effectively. With the aim to avoid collisions and drive safely, autonomous driving systems rely heavily on object detection. However, 2D object detections alone are insufficient; more information, such as relative velocity and distance, is required for safer planning. Monocular 3D object detectors try to solve this problem by directly predicting 3D bounding boxes and object velocities given a camera image. Recent research estimates time-to-contact in a per-pixel manner and suggests that it is more effective measure than velocity and depth combined. However, per-pixel time-to-contact requires object detection to serve its purpose effectively and hence increases overall computational requirements as two different models need to run. To address this issue, we propose per-object time-to-contact estimation by extending object detection models to additionally predict the time-to-contact attribute for each object. We compare our proposed approach with existing time-to-contact methods and provide benchmarking results on well-known datasets. Our proposed approach achieves higher precision compared to prior art while using a single image.

- **Summary**: Integrating the different data modalities of cancer patients can significantly improve the predictive performance of patient survival. However, most existing methods ignore the simultaneous utilization of rich semantic features at different scales in pathology images. When collecting multimodal data and extracting features, there is a likelihood of encountering intra-modality missing data, introducing noise into the multimodal data. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new end-to-end framework, FORESEE, for robustly predicting patient survival by mining multimodal information. Specifically, the cross-fusion transformer effectively utilizes features at the cellular level, tissue level, and tumor heterogeneity level to correlate prognosis through a cross-scale feature cross-fusion method. This enhances the ability of pathological image feature representation. Secondly, the hybrid attention encoder (HAE) uses the denoising contextual attention module to obtain the contextual relationship features and local detail features of the molecular data. HAE's channel attention module obtains global features of molecular data. Furthermore, to address the issue of missing information within modalities, we propose an asymmetrically masked triplet masked autoencoder to reconstruct lost information within modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets in both complete and missing settings.

- **Summary**: Co-speech gesturing is an important modality in conversation, providing context and social cues. In character animation, appropriate and synchronised gestures add realism, and can make interactive agents more engaging. Historically, methods for automatically generating gestures were predominantly audio-driven, exploiting the prosodic and speech-related content that is encoded in the audio signal. In this paper we instead experiment with using LLM features for gesture generation that are extracted from text using LLAMA2. We compare against audio features, and explore combining the two modalities in both objective tests and a user study. Surprisingly, our results show that LLAMA2 features on their own perform significantly better than audio features and that including both modalities yields no significant difference to using LLAMA2 features in isolation. We demonstrate that the LLAMA2 based model can generate both beat and semantic gestures without any audio input, suggesting LLMs can provide rich encodings that are well suited for gesture generation.

- **Summary**: We focus on the problem of recognising the end state of an action in an image, which is critical for understanding what action is performed and in which manner. We study this focusing on the task of predicting the coarseness of a cut, i.e., deciding whether an object was cut "coarsely" or "finely". No dataset with these annotated end states is available, so we propose an augmentation method to synthesise training data. We apply this method to cutting actions extracted from an existing action recognition dataset. Our method is object agnostic, i.e., it presupposes the location of the object but not its identity. Starting from less than a hundred images of a whole object, we can generate several thousands images simulating visually diverse cuts of different coarseness. We use our synthetic data to train a model based on UNet and test it on real images showing coarsely/finely cut objects. Results demonstrate that the model successfully recognises the end state of the cutting action despite the domain gap between training and testing, and that the model generalises well to unseen objects.

- **Summary**: The study of associations between an individual's age and imaging and non-imaging data is an active research area that attempts to aid understanding of the effects and patterns of aging. In this work we have conducted a supervoxel-wise association study between both volumetric and tissue density features in coronary computed tomography angiograms and the chronological age of a subject, to understand the localized changes in morphology and tissue density with age. To enable a supervoxel-wise study of volume and tissue density, we developed a novel method based on image segmentation, inter-subject image registration, and robust supervoxel-based correlation analysis, to achieve a statistical association study between the images and age. We evaluate the registration methodology in terms of the Dice coefficient for the heart chambers and myocardium, and the inverse consistency of the transformations, showing that the method works well in most cases with high overlap and inverse consistency. In a sex-stratified study conducted on a subset of $n=1388$ images from the SCAPIS study, the supervoxel-wise analysis was able to find localized associations with age outside of the commonly segmented and analyzed sub-regions, and several substantial differences between the sexes in association of age and volume.

- **Summary**: In recent years, diffusion models (DMs) have become a popular method for generating synthetic data. By achieving samples of higher quality, they quickly became superior to generative adversarial networks (GANs) and the current state-of-the-art method in generative modeling. However, their potential has not yet been exploited in radar, where the lack of available training data is a long-standing problem. In this work, a specific type of DMs, namely denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is adapted to the SAR domain. We investigate the network choice and specific diffusion parameters for conditional and unconditional SAR image generation. In our experiments, we show that DDPM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based methods for SAR image generation. Finally, we show that DDPM profits from pretraining on largescale clutter data, generating SAR images of even higher quality.

- **Summary**: Mainstream approaches to spectral reconstruction (SR) primarily focus on designing Convolution- and Transformer-based architectures. However, CNN methods often face challenges in handling long-range dependencies, whereas Transformers are constrained by computational efficiency limitations. Recent breakthroughs in state-space model (e.g., Mamba) has attracted significant attention due to its near-linear computational efficiency and superior performance, prompting our investigation into its potential for SR problem. To this end, we propose the Gradient-guided Mamba for Spectral Reconstruction from RGB Images, dubbed GMSR-Net. GMSR-Net is a lightweight model characterized by a global receptive field and linear computational complexity. Its core comprises multiple stacked Gradient Mamba (GM) blocks, each featuring a tri-branch structure. In addition to benefiting from efficient global feature representation by Mamba block, we further innovatively introduce spatial gradient attention and spectral gradient attention to guide the reconstruction of spatial and spectral cues. GMSR-Net demonstrates a significant accuracy-efficiency trade-off, achieving state-of-the-art performance while markedly reducing the number of parameters and computational burdens. Compared to existing approaches, GMSR-Net slashes parameters and FLOPS by substantial margins of 10 times and 20 times, respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/wxy11-27/GMSR.



### Harnessing Hierarchical Label Distribution Variations in Test Agnostic Long-tail Recognition

- **Summary**: This paper explores test-agnostic long-tail recognition, a challenging long-tail task where the test label distributions are unknown and arbitrarily imbalanced. We argue that the variation in these distributions can be broken down hierarchically into global and local levels. The global ones reflect a broad range of diversity, while the local ones typically arise from milder changes, often focused on a particular neighbor. Traditional methods predominantly use a Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) approach, targeting a few fixed test label distributions that exhibit substantial global variations. However, the local variations are left unconsidered. To address this issue, we propose a new MoE strategy, $\mathsf{DirMixE}$, which assigns experts to different Dirichlet meta-distributions of the label distribution, each targeting a specific aspect of local variations. Additionally, the diversity among these Dirichlet meta-distributions inherently captures global variations. This dual-level approach also leads to a more stable objective function, allowing us to sample different test distributions better to quantify the mean and variance of performance outcomes. Theoretically, we show that our proposed objective benefits from enhanced generalization by virtue of the variance-based regularization. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of $\mathsf{DirMixE}$. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/scongl/DirMixE}.

- **Summary**: Generating human motions from textual descriptions has gained growing research interest due to its wide range of applications. However, only a few works consider human-scene interactions together with text conditions, which is crucial for visual and physical realism. This paper focuses on the task of generating human motions in 3D indoor scenes given text descriptions of the human-scene interactions. This task presents challenges due to the multi-modality nature of text, scene, and motion, as well as the need for spatial reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose a new approach that decomposes the complex problem into two more manageable sub-problems: (1) language grounding of the target object and (2) object-centric motion generation. For language grounding of the target object, we leverage the power of large language models. For motion generation, we design an object-centric scene representation for the generative model to focus on the target object, thereby reducing the scene complexity and facilitating the modeling of the relationship between human motions and the object. Experiments demonstrate the better motion quality of our approach compared to baselines and validate our design choices.

- **Summary**: This paper undertakes an empirical study to revisit the latest advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): Video Assistant. This study, namely FreeVA, aims to extend existing image-based MLLM to the video domain in a training-free manner. The study provides an essential, yet must-know baseline, and reveals several surprising findings: 1) FreeVA, leveraging only offline image-based MLLM without additional training, excels in zero-shot video question-answering (e.g., MSVD-QA, ActivityNet-QA, and MSRVTT-QA), even surpassing state-of-the-art methods that involve video instruction tuning. 2) While mainstream video-based MLLMs typically initialize with an image-based MLLM (e.g., LLaVA) and then fine-tune using video instruction tuning, the study indicates that utilizing the widely adopted VideoInstruct-100K for video instruction tuning doesn't actually lead to better performance compared to not training at all. 3) The commonly used evaluation metrics in existing works are significantly influenced by changes in the GPT API version over time. If ignored, this could affect the fairness and uniformity of comparisons between different methods and impact the analysis and judgment of researchers in the field. The advancement of MLLMs is currently thriving, drawing numerous researchers into the field. We aim for this work to serve as a plug-and-play, simple yet effective baseline, encouraging the direct evaluation of existing MLLMs in video domain while also standardizing the field of video conversational models to a certain extent. Also, we encourage researchers to reconsider: Have current video MLLM methods truly acquired knowledge beyond image MLLM? Code is available at https://github.com/whwu95/FreeVA

- **Summary**: Object pose estimation is a fundamental computer vision problem with broad applications in augmented reality and robotics. Over the past decade, deep learning models, due to their superior accuracy and robustness, have increasingly supplanted conventional algorithms reliant on engineered point pair features. Nevertheless, several challenges persist in contemporary methods, including their dependency on labeled training data, model compactness, robustness under challenging conditions, and their ability to generalize to novel unseen objects. A recent survey discussing the progress made on different aspects of this area, outstanding challenges, and promising future directions, is missing. To fill this gap, we discuss the recent advances in deep learning-based object pose estimation, covering all three formulations of the problem, i.e., instance-level, category-level, and unseen object pose estimation. Our survey also covers multiple input data modalities, degrees-of-freedom of output poses, object properties, and downstream tasks, providing readers with a holistic understanding of this field. Additionally, it discusses training paradigms of different domains, inference modes, application areas, evaluation metrics, and benchmark datasets, as well as reports the performance of current state-of-the-art methods on these benchmarks, thereby facilitating readers in selecting the most suitable method for their application. Finally, the survey identifies key challenges, reviews prevailing trends along with their pros and cons, and identifies promising directions for future research. We also keep tracing the latest works at https://github.com/CNJianLiu/Awesome-Object-Pose-Estimation.

- **Summary**: Model merging and task arithmetic have emerged as promising scalable approaches to merge multiple single-task checkpoints to one multi-task model, but their applicability is reduced by significant performance loss. Previous works have linked these drops to interference in the weight space and erasure of important task-specific features. Instead, in this work we show that the information required to solve each task is still preserved after merging as different tasks mostly use non-overlapping sets of weights. We propose TALL-masks, a method to identify these task supports given a collection of task vectors and show that one can retrieve >99% of the single task accuracy by applying our masks to the multi-task vector, effectively compressing the individual checkpoints. We study the statistics of intersections among constructed masks and reveal the existence of selfish and catastrophic weights, i.e., parameters that are important exclusively to one task and irrelevant to all tasks but detrimental to multi-task fusion. For this reason, we propose Consensus Merging, an algorithm that eliminates such weights and improves the general performance of existing model merging approaches. Our experiments in vision and NLP benchmarks with up to 20 tasks, show that Consensus Merging consistently improves existing approaches. Furthermore, our proposed compression scheme reduces storage from 57Gb to 8.2Gb while retaining 99.7% of original performance.

- **Summary**: Many aging individuals encounter challenges in effectively tracking their dietary intake, exacerbating their susceptibility to nutrition-related health complications. Self-reporting methods are often inaccurate and suffer from substantial bias; however, leveraging intelligent prediction methods can automate and enhance precision in this process. Recent work has explored using computer vision prediction systems to predict nutritional information from food images. Still, these methods are often tailored to specific situations, require other inputs in addition to a food image, or do not provide comprehensive nutritional information.   This paper aims to enhance the efficacy of dietary intake estimation by leveraging various neural network architectures to directly predict a meal's nutritional content from its image. Through comprehensive experimentation and evaluation, we present NutritionVerse-Direct, a model utilizing a vision transformer base architecture with three fully connected layers that lead to five regression heads predicting calories (kcal), mass (g), protein (g), fat (g), and carbohydrates (g) present in a meal. NutritionVerse-Direct yields a combined mean average error score on the NutritionVerse-Real dataset of 412.6, an improvement of 25.5% over the Inception-ResNet model, demonstrating its potential for improving dietary intake estimation accuracy.

- **Summary**: Detecting an ingestion environment is an important aspect of monitoring dietary intake. It provides insightful information for dietary assessment. However, it is a challenging problem where human-based reviewing can be tedious, and algorithm-based review suffers from data imbalance and perceptual aliasing problems. To address these issues, we propose a neural network-based method with a two-stage training framework that tactfully combines fine-tuning and transfer learning techniques. Our method is evaluated on a newly collected dataset called ``UA Free Living Study", which uses an egocentric wearable camera, AIM-2 sensor, to simulate food consumption in free-living conditions. The proposed training framework is applied to common neural network backbones, combined with approaches in the general imbalanced classification field. Experimental results on the collected dataset show that our proposed method for automatic ingestion environment recognition successfully addresses the challenging data imbalance problem in the dataset and achieves a promising overall classification accuracy of 96.63%.

- **Summary**: As ground-based all-sky astronomical surveys will gather millions of images in the coming years, a critical requirement emerges for the development of fast deconvolution algorithms capable of efficiently improving the spatial resolution of these images. By successfully recovering clean and high-resolution images from these surveys, our objective is to help deepen our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution through accurate photometric measurements. We introduce a two-step deconvolution framework using a Swin Transformer architecture. Our study reveals that the deep learning-based solution introduces a bias, constraining the scope of scientific analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a novel third step relying on the active coefficients in the sparsity wavelet framework. By conducting a performance comparison between our deep learning-based method and Firedec, a classical deconvolution algorithm, we analyze a subset of the EDisCS cluster samples. We demonstrate the advantage of our method in terms of resolution recovery, generalization to different noise properties, and computational efficiency. Not only does the analysis of this cluster sample assess the efficiency of our method, but it also enables us to quantify the number of clumps within these galaxies in relation to their disc colour. This robust technique holds promise for identifying structures in the distant universe from ground-based images.



### Multi-Task Learning for Fatigue Detection and Face Recognition of Drivers via Tree-Style Space-Channel Attention Fusion Network

- **Summary**: In driving scenarios, automobile active safety systems are increasingly incorporating deep learning technology. These systems typically need to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, such as detecting fatigue driving and recognizing the driver's identity. However, the traditional parallel-style approach of combining multiple single-task models tends to waste resources when dealing with similar tasks. Therefore, we propose a novel tree-style multi-task modeling approach for multi-task learning, which rooted at a shared backbone, more dedicated separate module branches are appended as the model pipeline goes deeper. Following the tree-style approach, we propose a multi-task learning model for simultaneously performing driver fatigue detection and face recognition for identifying a driver. This model shares a common feature extraction backbone module, with further separated feature extraction and classification module branches. The dedicated branches exploit and combine spatial and channel attention mechanisms to generate space-channel fused-attention enhanced features, leading to improved detection performance. As only single-task datasets are available, we introduce techniques including alternating updation and gradient accumulation for training our multi-task model using only the single-task datasets. The effectiveness of our tree-style multi-task learning model is verified through extensive validations.

- **Summary**: We present SceneFactory, a workflow-centric and unified framework for incremental scene modeling, that supports conveniently a wide range of applications, such as (unposed and/or uncalibrated) multi-view depth estimation, LiDAR completion, (dense) RGB-D/RGB-L/Mono//Depth-only reconstruction and SLAM. The workflow-centric design uses multiple blocks as the basis for building different production lines. The supported applications, i.e., productions avoid redundancy in their designs. Thus, the focus is on each block itself for independent expansion. To support all input combinations, our implementation consists of four building blocks in SceneFactory: (1) Mono-SLAM, (2) depth estimation, (3) flexion and (4) scene reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose an unposed & uncalibrated multi-view depth estimation model (U2-MVD) to estimate dense geometry. U2-MVD exploits dense bundle adjustment for solving for poses, intrinsics, and inverse depth. Then a semantic-awared ScaleCov step is introduced to complete the multi-view depth. Relying on U2-MVD, SceneFactory both supports user-friendly 3D creation (with just images) and bridges the applications of Dense RGB-D and Dense Mono. For high quality surface and color reconstruction, we propose due-purpose Multi-resolutional Neural Points (DM-NPs) for the first surface accessible Surface Color Field design, where we introduce Improved Point Rasterization (IPR) for point cloud based surface query.   We implement and experiment with SceneFactory to demonstrate its broad practicability and high flexibility. Its quality also competes or exceeds the tightly-coupled state of the art approaches in all tasks. We contribute the code to the community (https://jarrome.github.io/).

- **Summary**: In 2020, 685,000 deaths across the world were attributed to breast cancer, underscoring the critical need for innovative and effective breast cancer treatment. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has recently gained popularity as a promising treatment strategy for breast cancer, attributed to its efficacy in shrinking large tumors and leading to pathologic complete response. However, the current process to recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy relies on the subjective evaluation of medical experts which contain inherent biases and significant uncertainty. A recent study, utilizing volumetric deep radiomic features extracted from synthetic correlated diffusion imaging (CDI$^s$), demonstrated significant potential in noninvasive breast cancer pathologic complete response prediction. Inspired by the positive outcomes of optimizing CDI$^s$ for prostate cancer delineation, this research investigates the application of optimized CDI$^s$ to enhance breast cancer pathologic complete response prediction. Using multiparametric MRI that fuses optimized CDI$^s$ with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), we obtain a leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy of 93.28%, over 5.5% higher than that previously reported.

- **Summary**: The multi-plane representation has been highlighted for its fast training and inference across static and dynamic neural radiance fields. This approach constructs relevant features via projection onto learnable grids and interpolating adjacent vertices. However, it has limitations in capturing low-frequency details and tends to overuse parameters for low-frequency features due to its bias toward fine details, despite its multi-resolution concept. This phenomenon leads to instability and inefficiency when training poses are sparse. In this work, we propose a method that synergistically integrates multi-plane representation with a coordinate-based network known for strong bias toward low-frequency signals. The coordinate-based network is responsible for capturing low-frequency details, while the multi-plane representation focuses on capturing fine-grained details. We demonstrate that using residual connections between them seamlessly preserves their own inherent properties. Additionally, the proposed progressive training scheme accelerates the disentanglement of these two features. We empirically show that the proposed method achieves comparable results to explicit encoding with fewer parameters, and particularly, it outperforms others for the static and dynamic NeRFs under sparse inputs.

- **Summary**: Breast cancer was diagnosed for over 7.8 million women between 2015 to 2020. Grading plays a vital role in breast cancer treatment planning. However, the current tumor grading method involves extracting tissue from patients, leading to stress, discomfort, and high medical costs. A recent paper leveraging volumetric deep radiomic features from synthetic correlated diffusion imaging (CDI$^s$) for breast cancer grade prediction showed immense promise for noninvasive methods for grading. Motivated by the impact of CDI$^s$ optimization for prostate cancer delineation, this paper examines using optimized CDI$^s$ to improve breast cancer grade prediction. We fuse the optimized CDI$^s$ signal with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to create a multiparametric MRI for each patient. Using a larger patient cohort and training across all the layers of a pretrained MONAI model, we achieve a leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy of 95.79%, over 8% higher compared to that previously reported.

- **Summary**: The scale-up of autonomous vehicles depends heavily on their ability to deal with anomalies, such as rare objects on the road. In order to handle such situations, it is necessary to detect anomalies in the first place. Anomaly detection for autonomous driving has made great progress in the past years but suffers from poorly designed benchmarks with a strong focus on camera data. In this work, we propose AnoVox, the largest benchmark for ANOmaly detection in autonomous driving to date. AnoVox incorporates large-scale multimodal sensor data and spatial VOXel ground truth, allowing for the comparison of methods independent of their used sensor. We propose a formal definition of normality and provide a compliant training dataset. AnoVox is the first benchmark to contain both content and temporal anomalies.

- **Summary**: Can web-based image processing and visualization tools easily integrate into existing websites without significant time and effort? Our Boostlet.js library addresses this challenge by providing an open-source, JavaScript-based web framework to enable additional image processing functionalities. Boostlet examples include kernel filtering, image captioning, data visualization, segmentation, and web-optimized machine-learning models. To achieve this, Boostlet.js uses a browser bookmark to inject a user-friendly plugin selection tool called PowerBoost into any host website. Boostlet also provides on-site access to a standard API independent of any visualization framework for pixel data and scene manipulation. Web-based Boostlets provide a modular architecture and client-side processing capabilities to apply advanced image-processing techniques using consumer-level hardware. The code is open-source and available.

- **Summary**: In 2020, prostate cancer saw a staggering 1.4 million new cases, resulting in over 375,000 deaths. The accurate identification of clinically significant prostate cancer is crucial for delivering effective treatment to patients. Consequently, there has been a surge in research exploring the application of deep neural networks to predict clinical significance based on magnetic resonance images. However, these networks demand extensive datasets to attain optimal performance. Recently, transfer learning emerged as a technique that leverages acquired features from a domain with richer data to enhance the performance of a domain with limited data. In this paper, we investigate the improvement of clinically significant prostate cancer prediction in T2-weighted images through transfer learning from breast cancer. The results demonstrate a remarkable improvement of over 30% in leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy.

- **Summary**: Breast cancer is a significant cause of death from cancer in women globally, highlighting the need for improved diagnostic imaging to enhance patient outcomes. Accurate tumour identification is essential for diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring, emphasizing the importance of advanced imaging technologies that provide detailed views of tumour characteristics and disease. Synthetic correlated diffusion imaging (CDI$^s$) is a recent method that has shown promise for prostate cancer delineation compared to current MRI images. In this paper, we explore tuning the coefficients in the computation of CDI$^s$ for breast cancer tumour delineation by maximizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) using a Nelder-Mead simplex optimization strategy. We show that the best AUC is achieved by the CDI$^s$ - Optimized modality, outperforming the best gold-standard modality by 0.0044. Notably, the optimized CDI$^s$ modality also achieves AUC values over 0.02 higher than the Unoptimized CDI$^s$ value, demonstrating the importance of optimizing the CDI$^s$ exponents for the specific cancer application.

- **Summary**: Pathology is the study of microscopic inspection of tissue, and a pathology diagnosis is often the medical gold standard to diagnose disease. Pathology images provide a unique challenge for computer-vision-based analysis: a single pathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) is gigapixel-sized and often contains hundreds of thousands to millions of objects of interest across multiple resolutions. In this work, we propose PathoLogy Universal TransfOrmer (PLUTO): a light-weight pathology FM that is pre-trained on a diverse dataset of 195 million image tiles collected from multiple sites and extracts meaningful representations across multiple WSI scales that enable a large variety of downstream pathology tasks. In particular, we design task-specific adaptation heads that utilize PLUTO's output embeddings for tasks which span pathology scales ranging from subcellular to slide-scale, including instance segmentation, tile classification, and slide-level prediction. We compare PLUTO's performance to other state-of-the-art methods on a diverse set of external and internal benchmarks covering multiple biologically relevant tasks, tissue types, resolutions, stains, and scanners. We find that PLUTO matches or outperforms existing task-specific baselines and pathology-specific foundation models, some of which use orders-of-magnitude larger datasets and model sizes when compared to PLUTO. Our findings present a path towards a universal embedding to power pathology image analysis, and motivate further exploration around pathology foundation models in terms of data diversity, architectural improvements, sample efficiency, and practical deployability in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image generative models have become a prominent and powerful tool that excels at generating high-resolution realistic images. However, guiding the generative process of these models to consider detailed forms of conditioning reflecting style and/or structure information remains an open problem. In this paper, we present LoRAdapter, an approach that unifies both style and structure conditioning under the same formulation using a novel conditional LoRA block that enables zero-shot control. LoRAdapter is an efficient, powerful, and architecture-agnostic approach to condition text-to-image diffusion models, which enables fine-grained control conditioning during generation and outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address two critical challenges in the domain of flood detection: the computational expense of large-scale time series change detection and the lack of interpretable decision-making processes on explainable AI (XAI). To overcome these challenges, we proposed an interpretable multi-stage approach to flood detection, IMAFD has been proposed. It provides an automatic, efficient and interpretable solution suitable for large-scale remote sensing tasks and offers insight into the decision-making process. The proposed IMAFD approach combines the analysis of the dynamic time series image sequences to identify images with possible flooding with the static, within-image semantic segmentation. It combines anomaly detection (at both image and pixel level) with semantic segmentation. The flood detection problem is addressed through four stages: (1) at a sequence level: identifying the suspected images (2) at a multi-image level: detecting change within suspected images (3) at an image level: semantic segmentation of images into Land, Water or Cloud class (4) decision making. Our contributions are two folder. First, we efficiently reduced the number of frames to be processed for dense change detection by providing a multi-stage holistic approach to flood detection. Second, the proposed semantic change detection method (stage 3) provides human users with an interpretable decision-making process, while most of the explainable AI (XAI) methods provide post hoc explanations. The evaluation of the proposed IMAFD framework was performed on three datasets, WorldFloods, RavAEn and MediaEval. For all the above datasets, the proposed framework demonstrates a competitive performance compared to other methods offering also interpretability and insight.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks for image super-resolution have shown significant advantages over traditional approaches like interpolation. However, they are often criticized as `black boxes' compared to traditional approaches which have solid mathematical foundations. In this paper, we attempt to interpret the behavior of deep neural networks using theories from signal processing theories. We first report an intriguing phenomenon, referred to as `the sinc phenomenon,' which occurs when an impulse input is fed to a neural network. Building on this observation, we propose a method named Hybird Response Analysis (HyRA) to analyze the behavior of neural networks in image super-resolution tasks. In details, HyRA decomposes a neural network into a parallel connection of a linear system and a non-linear system, demonstrating that the linear system functions as a low-pass filter, while the non-linear system injects high-frequency information. Furthermore, to quantify the injected high-frequency information, we introduce a metric for image-to-image tasks called Frequency Spectrum Distribution Similarity (FSDS). FSDS reflects the distribution similarity of different frequency components, capturing nuances that traditional metrics may overlook.

- **Summary**: Going beyond mere fine-tuning of vision-language models (VLMs), learnable prompt tuning has emerged as a promising, resource-efficient alternative. Despite their potential, effectively learning prompts faces the following challenges: (i) training in a low-shot scenario results in overfitting, limiting adaptability and yielding weaker performance on newer classes or datasets; (ii) prompt-tuning's efficacy heavily relies on the label space, with decreased performance in large class spaces, signaling potential gaps in bridging image and class concepts. In this work, we ask the question if better text semantics can help address these concerns. In particular, we introduce a prompt-tuning method that leverages class descriptions obtained from large language models (LLMs). Our approach constructs part-level description-guided views of both image and text features, which are subsequently aligned to learn more generalizable prompts. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across 11 benchmark datasets, outperform established methods, demonstrating substantial improvements.

- **Summary**: Learning from multiple modalities, such as audio and video, offers opportunities for leveraging complementary information, enhancing robustness, and improving contextual understanding and performance. However, combining such modalities presents challenges, especially when modalities differ in data structure, predictive contribution, and the complexity of their learning processes. It has been observed that one modality can potentially dominate the learning process, hindering the effective utilization of information from other modalities and leading to sub-optimal model performance. To address this issue the vast majority of previous works suggest to assess the unimodal contributions and dynamically adjust the training to equalize them. We improve upon previous work by introducing a multi-loss objective and further refining the balancing process, allowing it to dynamically adjust the learning pace of each modality in both directions, acceleration and deceleration, with the ability to phase out balancing effects upon convergence. We achieve superior results across three audio-video datasets: on CREMA-D, models with ResNet backbone encoders surpass the previous best by 1.9% to 12.4%, and Conformer backbone models deliver improvements ranging from 2.8% to 14.1% across different fusion methods. On AVE, improvements range from 2.7% to 7.7%, while on UCF101, gains reach up to 6.1%.

- **Summary**: The authentic 3D hand avatar with every identifiable information, such as hand shapes and textures, is necessary for immersive experiences in AR/VR. In this paper, we present a universal hand model (UHM), which 1) can universally represent high-fidelity 3D hand meshes of arbitrary identities (IDs) and 2) can be adapted to each person with a short phone scan for the authentic hand avatar. For effective universal hand modeling, we perform tracking and modeling at the same time, while previous 3D hand models perform them separately. The conventional separate pipeline suffers from the accumulated errors from the tracking stage, which cannot be recovered in the modeling stage. On the other hand, ours does not suffer from the accumulated errors while having a much more concise overall pipeline. We additionally introduce a novel image matching loss function to address a skin sliding during the tracking and modeling, while existing works have not focused on it much. Finally, using learned priors from our UHM, we effectively adapt our UHM to each person's short phone scan for the authentic hand avatar.

- **Summary**: Place recognition is the foundation for enabling autonomous systems to achieve independent decision-making and safe operations. It is also crucial in tasks such as loop closure detection and global localization within SLAM. Previous methods utilize mundane point cloud representations as input and deep learning-based LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) approaches employing different point cloud image inputs with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or transformer architectures. However, the recently proposed Mamba deep learning model, combined with state space models (SSMs), holds great potential for long sequence modeling. Therefore, we developed OverlapMamba, a novel network for place recognition, which represents input range views (RVs) as sequences. In a novel way, we employ a stochastic reconstruction approach to build shift state space models, compressing the visual representation. Evaluated on three different public datasets, our method effectively detects loop closures, showing robustness even when traversing previously visited locations from different directions. Relying on raw range view inputs, it outperforms typical LiDAR and multi-view combination methods in time complexity and speed, indicating strong place recognition capabilities and real-time efficiency.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot anomaly segmentation using pre-trained foundation models is a promising approach that enables effective algorithms without expensive, domain-specific training or fine-tuning. Ensuring that these methods work across various environmental conditions and are robust to distribution shifts is an open problem. We investigate the performance of WinCLIP [14] zero-shot anomaly segmentation algorithm by perturbing test data using three semantic transformations: bounded angular rotations, bounded saturation shifts, and hue shifts. We empirically measure a lower performance bound by aggregating across per-sample worst-case perturbations and find that average performance drops by up to 20% in area under the ROC curve and 40% in area under the per-region overlap curve. We find that performance is consistently lowered on three CLIP backbones, regardless of model architecture or learning objective, demonstrating a need for careful performance evaluation.

- **Summary**: Achieving expressive 3D motion reconstruction and automatic generation for isolated sign words can be challenging, due to the lack of real-world 3D sign-word data, the complex nuances of signing motions, and the cross-modal understanding of sign language semantics. To address these challenges, we introduce SignAvatar, a framework capable of both word-level sign language reconstruction and generation. SignAvatar employs a transformer-based conditional variational autoencoder architecture, effectively establishing relationships across different semantic modalities. Additionally, this approach incorporates a curriculum learning strategy to enhance the model's robustness and generalization, resulting in more realistic motions. Furthermore, we contribute the ASL3DWord dataset, composed of 3D joint rotation data for the body, hands, and face, for unique sign words. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SignAvatar through extensive experiments, showcasing its superior reconstruction and automatic generation capabilities. The code and dataset are available on the project page.

- **Summary**: As humans, we aspire to create media content that is both freely willed and readily controlled. Thanks to the prominent development of generative techniques, we now can easily utilize 2D diffusion methods to synthesize images controlled by raw sketch or designated human poses, and even progressively edit/regenerate local regions with masked inpainting. However, similar workflows in 3D modeling tasks are still unavailable due to the lack of controllability and efficiency in 3D generation. In this paper, we present a novel controllable and interactive 3D assets modeling framework, named Coin3D. Coin3D allows users to control the 3D generation using a coarse geometry proxy assembled from basic shapes, and introduces an interactive generation workflow to support seamless local part editing while delivering responsive 3D object previewing within a few seconds. To this end, we develop several techniques, including the 3D adapter that applies volumetric coarse shape control to the diffusion model, proxy-bounded editing strategy for precise part editing, progressive volume cache to support responsive preview, and volume-SDS to ensure consistent mesh reconstruction. Extensive experiments of interactive generation and editing on diverse shape proxies demonstrate that our method achieves superior controllability and flexibility in the 3D assets generation task.

- **Summary**: We argue that representations in AI models, particularly deep networks, are converging. First, we survey many examples of convergence in the literature: over time and across multiple domains, the ways by which different neural networks represent data are becoming more aligned. Next, we demonstrate convergence across data modalities: as vision models and language models get larger, they measure distance between datapoints in a more and more alike way. We hypothesize that this convergence is driving toward a shared statistical model of reality, akin to Plato's concept of an ideal reality. We term such a representation the platonic representation and discuss several possible selective pressures toward it. Finally, we discuss the implications of these trends, their limitations, and counterexamples to our analysis.

- **Summary**: Current medical artificial intelligence systems are often limited to narrow applications, hindering their widespread adoption in clinical practice. To address this limitation, we propose MedVersa, a generalist learner that enables flexible learning and tasking for medical image interpretation. By leveraging a large language model as a learnable orchestrator, MedVersa can learn from both visual and linguistic supervision, support multimodal inputs, and perform real-time task specification. This versatility allows MedVersa to adapt to various clinical scenarios and perform multifaceted medical image analysis. We introduce MedInterp, the largest multimodal dataset to date for medical image interpretation, consisting of over 13 million annotated instances spanning 11 tasks across 3 modalities, to support the development of MedVersa. Our experiments demonstrate that MedVersa achieves state-of-the-art performance in 9 tasks, sometimes outperforming specialist counterparts by over 10%. MedVersa is the first to showcase the viability of multimodal generative medical AI in implementing multimodal outputs, inputs, and dynamic task specification, highlighting its potential as a multifunctional system for comprehensive medical image analysis. This generalist approach to medical image interpretation paves the way for more adaptable and efficient AI-assisted clinical decision-making.

- **Summary**: The remarkable progress of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has attracted significant attention due to their superior performance in visual contexts. However, their capabilities in turning visual figure to executable code, have not been evaluated thoroughly. To address this, we introduce Plot2Code, a comprehensive visual coding benchmark designed for a fair and in-depth assessment of MLLMs. We carefully collect 132 manually selected high-quality matplotlib plots across six plot types from publicly available matplotlib galleries. For each plot, we carefully offer its source code, and an descriptive instruction summarized by GPT-4. This approach enables Plot2Code to extensively evaluate MLLMs' code capabilities across various input modalities. Furthermore, we propose three automatic evaluation metrics, including code pass rate, text-match ratio, and GPT-4V overall rating, for a fine-grained assessment of the output code and rendered images. Instead of simply judging pass or fail, we employ GPT-4V to make an overall judgement between the generated and reference images, which has been shown to be consistent with human evaluation. The evaluation results, which include analyses of 14 MLLMs such as the proprietary GPT-4V, Gemini-Pro, and the open-sourced Mini-Gemini, highlight the substantial challenges presented by Plot2Code. With Plot2Code, we reveal that most existing MLLMs struggle with visual coding for text-dense plots, heavily relying on textual instruction. We hope that the evaluation results from Plot2Code on visual coding will guide the future development of MLLMs. All data involved with Plot2Code are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/TencentARC/Plot2Code.

- **Summary**: While there has been remarkable progress recently in the fields of manipulation and locomotion, mobile manipulation remains a long-standing challenge. Compared to locomotion or static manipulation, a mobile system must make a diverse range of long-horizon tasks feasible in unstructured and dynamic environments. While the applications are broad and interesting, there are a plethora of challenges in developing these systems such as coordination between the base and arm, reliance on onboard perception for perceiving and interacting with the environment, and most importantly, simultaneously integrating all these parts together. Prior works approach the problem using disentangled modular skills for mobility and manipulation that are trivially tied together. This causes several limitations such as compounding errors, delays in decision-making, and no whole-body coordination. In this work, we present a reactive mobile manipulation framework that uses an active visual system to consciously perceive and react to its environment. Similar to how humans leverage whole-body and hand-eye coordination, we develop a mobile manipulator that exploits its ability to move and see, more specifically -- to move in order to see and to see in order to move. This allows it to not only move around and interact with its environment but also, choose "when" to perceive "what" using an active visual system. We observe that such an agent learns to navigate around complex cluttered scenarios while displaying agile whole-body coordination using only ego-vision without needing to create environment maps.

- **Summary**: Generating diverse and high-quality 3D assets automatically poses a fundamental yet challenging task in 3D computer vision. Despite extensive efforts in 3D generation, existing optimization-based approaches struggle to produce large-scale 3D assets efficiently. Meanwhile, feed-forward methods often focus on generating only a single category or a few categories, limiting their generalizability. Therefore, we introduce a diffusion-based feed-forward framework to address these challenges with a single model. To handle the large diversity and complexity in geometry and texture across categories efficiently, we 1) adopt improved triplane to guarantee efficiency; 2) introduce the 3D-aware transformer to aggregate the generalized 3D knowledge with specialized 3D features; and 3) devise the 3D-aware encoder/decoder to enhance the generalized 3D knowledge. Building upon our 3D-aware Diffusion model with TransFormer, DiffTF, we propose a stronger version for 3D generation, i.e., DiffTF++. It boils down to two parts: multi-view reconstruction loss and triplane refinement. Specifically, we utilize multi-view reconstruction loss to fine-tune the diffusion model and triplane decoder, thereby avoiding the negative influence caused by reconstruction errors and improving texture synthesis. By eliminating the mismatch between the two stages, the generative performance is enhanced, especially in texture. Additionally, a 3D-aware refinement process is introduced to filter out artifacts and refine triplanes, resulting in the generation of more intricate and reasonable details. Extensive experiments on ShapeNet and OmniObject3D convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules and the state-of-the-art 3D object generation performance with large diversity, rich semantics, and high quality.

- **Summary**: Mamba, an architecture with RNN-like token mixer of state space model (SSM), was recently introduced to address the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism and subsequently applied to vision tasks. Nevertheless, the performance of Mamba for vision is often underwhelming when compared with convolutional and attention-based models. In this paper, we delve into the essence of Mamba, and conceptually conclude that Mamba is ideally suited for tasks with long-sequence and autoregressive characteristics. For vision tasks, as image classification does not align with either characteristic, we hypothesize that Mamba is not necessary for this task; Detection and segmentation tasks are also not autoregressive, yet they adhere to the long-sequence characteristic, so we believe it is still worthwhile to explore Mamba's potential for these tasks. To empirically verify our hypotheses, we construct a series of models named MambaOut through stacking Mamba blocks while removing their core token mixer, SSM. Experimental results strongly support our hypotheses. Specifically, our MambaOut model surpasses all visual Mamba models on ImageNet image classification, indicating that Mamba is indeed unnecessary for this task. As for detection and segmentation, MambaOut cannot match the performance of state-of-the-art visual Mamba models, demonstrating the potential of Mamba for long-sequence visual tasks.

- **Summary**: Synthesizing high-quality photorealistic images with textual descriptions as a condition is very challenging. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the classical model for this task, frequently suffer from low consistency between image and text descriptions and insufficient richness in synthesized images. Recently, conditional affine transformations (CAT), such as conditional batch normalization and instance normalization, have been applied to different layers of GAN to control content synthesis in images. CAT is a multi-layer perceptron that independently predicts data based on batch statistics between neighboring layers, with global textual information unavailable to other layers. To address this issue, we first model CAT and a recurrent neural network (RAT) to ensure that different layers can access global information. We then introduce shuffle attention between RAT to mitigate the characteristic of information forgetting in recurrent neural networks. Moreover, both our generator and discriminator utilize the powerful pre-trained model, Clip, which has been extensively employed for establishing associations between text and images through the learning of multimodal representations in latent space. The discriminator utilizes CLIP's ability to comprehend complex scenes to accurately assess the quality of the generated images. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the CUB, Oxford, and CelebA-tiny datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over current state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation provides accurate positioning with global coverage, making it a reliable option in open areas with unobstructed sky views. However, signal degradation may occur in indoor spaces and urban canyons. In contrast, Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) consist of gyroscopes and accelerometers that offer relative motion information such as acceleration and rotational changes. Unlike GPS, IMUs do not rely on external signals, making them useful in GPS-denied environments. Nonetheless, IMUs suffer from drift over time due to the accumulation of errors while integrating acceleration to determine velocity and position. Therefore, fusing the GPS and IMU is crucial for enhancing the reliability and precision of navigation systems in autonomous vehicles, especially in environments where GPS signals are compromised. To ensure smooth navigation and overcome the limitations of each sensor, the proposed method fuses GPS and IMU data. This sensor fusion uses the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) Bayesian filtering technique. The proposed navigation system is designed to be robust, delivering continuous and accurate positioning critical for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, particularly in GPS-denied environments. This project uses KITTI GNSS and IMU datasets for experimental validation, showing that the GNSS-IMU fusion technique reduces GNSS-only data's RMSE. The RMSE decreased from 13.214, 13.284, and 13.363 to 4.271, 5.275, and 0.224 for the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis, respectively. The experimental result using UKF shows promising direction in improving autonomous vehicle navigation using GPS and IMU sensor fusion using the best of two sensors in GPS-denied environments.

- **Summary**: Histology slide digitization is becoming essential for telepathology (remote consultation), knowledge sharing (education), and using the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms (augmented/automated end-to-end clinical workflows). However, the cumulative costs of digital multi-slide high-speed brightfield scanners, cloud/on-premises storage, and personnel (IT and technicians) make the current slide digitization workflows out-of-reach for limited-resource settings, further widening the health equity gap; even single-slide manual scanning commercial solutions are costly due to hardware requirements (high-resolution cameras, high-spec PC/workstation, and support for only high-end microscopes). In this work, we present a new cloud slide digitization workflow for creating scanner-quality whole-slide images (WSIs) from uploaded low-quality videos, acquired from cheap and inexpensive microscopes with built-in cameras. Specifically, we present a pipeline to create stitched WSIs while automatically deblurring out-of-focus regions, upsampling input 10X images to 40X resolution, and reducing brightness/contrast and light-source illumination variations. We demonstrate the WSI creation efficacy from our workflow on World Health Organization-declared neglected tropical disease, Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (prevalent only in the poorest regions of the world and only diagnosed by sub-specialist dermatopathologists, rare in poor countries), as well as other common pathologies on core biopsies of breast, liver, duodenum, stomach and lymph node. The code and pretrained models will be accessible via our GitHub (https://github.com/nadeemlab/DeepLIIF), and the cloud platform will be available at https://deepliif.org for uploading microscope videos and downloading/viewing WSIs with shareable links (no sign-in required) for telepathology and knowledge sharing.

- **Summary**: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) plays a crucial role in pathology as it detects the over-expression of protein in tissue samples. However, there are still fewer machine learning model studies on IHC's impact on accurate cancer grading. We discovered that IHC and H\&E possess distinct advantages and disadvantages while possessing certain complementary qualities. Building on this observation, we developed a two-stage multi-modal bilinear model with a feature pooling module. This model aims to maximize the potential of both IHC and HE's feature representation, resulting in improved performance compared to their individual use. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating IHC data into machine learning models, alongside H\&E stained images, leads to superior predictive results for cancer grading. The proposed framework achieves an impressive ACC higher of 0.953 on the public dataset BCI.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel spatiotemporal transformer network that introduces several original components to detect actions in untrimmed videos. First, the multi-feature selective semantic attention model calculates the correlations between spatial and motion features to model spatiotemporal interactions between different action semantics properly. Second, the motion-aware network encodes the locations of action semantics in video frames utilizing the motion-aware 2D positional encoding algorithm. Such a motion-aware mechanism memorizes the dynamic spatiotemporal variations in action frames that current methods cannot exploit. Third, the sequence-based temporal attention model captures the heterogeneous temporal dependencies in action frames. In contrast to standard temporal attention used in natural language processing, primarily aimed at finding similarities between linguistic words, the proposed sequence-based temporal attention is designed to determine both the differences and similarities between video frames that jointly define the meaning of actions. The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions on four spatiotemporal action datasets: AVA 2.2, AVA 2.1, UCF101-24, and EPIC-Kitchens.

- **Summary**: As training datasets become increasingly drawn from unstructured, uncontrolled environments such as the web, researchers and industry practitioners have increasingly relied upon data filtering techniques to "filter out the noise" of web-scraped data. While datasets have been widely shown to reflect the biases and values of their creators, in this paper we contribute to an emerging body of research that assesses the filters used to create these datasets. We show that image-text data filtering also has biases and is value-laden, encoding specific notions of what is counted as "high-quality" data. In our work, we audit a standard approach of image-text CLIP-filtering on the academic benchmark DataComp's CommonPool by analyzing discrepancies of filtering through various annotation techniques across multiple modalities of image, text, and website source. We find that data relating to several imputed demographic groups -- such as LGBTQ+ people, older women, and younger men -- are associated with higher rates of exclusion. Moreover, we demonstrate cases of exclusion amplification: not only are certain marginalized groups already underrepresented in the unfiltered data, but CLIP-filtering excludes data from these groups at higher rates. The data-filtering step in the machine learning pipeline can therefore exacerbate representation disparities already present in the data-gathering step, especially when existing filters are designed to optimize a specifically-chosen downstream performance metric like zero-shot image classification accuracy. Finally, we show that the NSFW filter fails to remove sexually-explicit content from CommonPool, and that CLIP-filtering includes several categories of copyrighted content at high rates. Our conclusions point to a need for fundamental changes in dataset creation and filtering practices.

- **Summary**: We present Infinite Texture, a method for generating arbitrarily large texture images from a text prompt. Our approach fine-tunes a diffusion model on a single texture, and learns to embed that statistical distribution in the output domain of the model. We seed this fine-tuning process with a sample texture patch, which can be optionally generated from a text-to-image model like DALL-E 2. At generation time, our fine-tuned diffusion model is used through a score aggregation strategy to generate output texture images of arbitrary resolution on a single GPU. We compare synthesized textures from our method to existing work in patch-based and deep learning texture synthesis methods. We also showcase two applications of our generated textures in 3D rendering and texture transfer.
