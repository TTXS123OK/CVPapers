- **Summary**: Prototype learning is widely used in face recognition, which takes the row vectors of coefficient matrix in the last linear layer of the feature extraction model as the prototypes for each class. When the prototypes are updated using the facial sample feature gradients in the model training, they are prone to being pulled away from the class center by the hard samples, resulting in decreased overall model performance. In this paper, we explicitly define prototypes as the expectations of sample features in each class and design the empirical prototypes using the existing samples in the dataset. We then devise a strategy to adaptively update these empirical prototypes during the model training based on the similarity between the sample features and the empirical prototypes. Furthermore, we propose an empirical prototype learning (EPL) method, which utilizes an adaptive margin parameter with respect to sample features. EPL assigns larger margins to the normal samples and smaller margins to the hard samples, allowing the learned empirical prototypes to better reflect the class center dominated by the normal samples and finally pull the hard samples towards the empirical prototypes through the learning. The extensive experiments on MFR, IJB-C, LFW, CFP-FP, AgeDB, and MegaFace demonstrate the effectiveness of EPL.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there has been a significant increase in applications of multimodal signal processing and analysis, largely driven by the increased availability of multimodal datasets and the rapid progress in multimodal learning systems. Well-known examples include autonomous vehicles, audiovisual generative systems, vision-language systems, and so on. Such systems integrate multiple signal modalities: text, speech, images, video, LiDAR, etc., to perform various tasks. A key issue for understanding such systems is the relationship between various modalities and how it impacts task performance. In this paper, we employ the concept of mutual information (MI) to gain insight into this issue. Taking advantage of the recent progress in entropy modeling and estimation, we develop a system called InfoMeter to estimate MI between modalities in a multimodal learning system. We then apply InfoMeter to analyze a multimodal 3D object detection system over a large-scale dataset for autonomous driving. Our experiments on this system suggest that a lower MI between modalities is beneficial for detection accuracy. This new insight may facilitate improvements in the development of future multimodal learning systems.

- **Summary**: Creating scenes for captured motions that achieve realistic human-scene interaction is crucial for 3D animation in movies or video games. As character motion is often captured in a blue-screened studio without real furniture or objects in place, there may be a discrepancy between the planned motion and the captured one. This gives rise to the need for automatic scene layout generation to relieve the burdens of selecting and positioning furniture and objects. Previous approaches cannot avoid artifacts like penetration and floating due to the lack of physical constraints. Furthermore, some heavily rely on specific data to learn the contact affordances, restricting the generalization ability to different motions. In this work, we present a physics-based approach that simultaneously optimizes a scene layout generator and simulates a moving human in a physics simulator. To attain plausible and realistic interaction motions, our method explicitly introduces physical constraints. To automatically recover and generate the scene layout, we minimize the motion tracking errors to identify the objects that can afford interaction. We use reinforcement learning to perform a dual-optimization of both the character motion imitation controller and the scene layout generator. To facilitate the optimization, we reshape the tracking rewards and devise pose prior guidance obtained from our estimated pseudo-contact labels. We evaluate our method using motions from SAMP and PROX, and demonstrate physically plausible scene layout reconstruction compared with the previous kinematics-based method.



### WorldAfford: Affordance Grounding based on Natural Language Instructions

- **Summary**: Affordance grounding aims to localize the interaction regions for the manipulated objects in the scene image according to given instructions. A critical challenge in affordance grounding is that the embodied agent should understand human instructions and analyze which tools in the environment can be used, as well as how to use these tools to accomplish the instructions. Most recent works primarily supports simple action labels as input instructions for localizing affordance regions, failing to capture complex human objectives. Moreover, these approaches typically identify affordance regions of only a single object in object-centric images, ignoring the object context and struggling to localize affordance regions of multiple objects in complex scenes for practical applications. To address this concern, for the first time, we introduce a new task of affordance grounding based on natural language instructions, extending it from previously using simple labels for complex human instructions. For this new task, we propose a new framework, WorldAfford. We design a novel Affordance Reasoning Chain-of-Thought Prompting to reason about affordance knowledge from LLMs more precisely and logically. Subsequently, we use SAM and CLIP to localize the objects related to the affordance knowledge in the image. We identify the affordance regions of the objects through an affordance region localization module. To benchmark this new task and validate our framework, an affordance grounding dataset, LLMaFF, is constructed. We conduct extensive experiments to verify that WorldAfford performs state-of-the-art on both the previous AGD20K and the new LLMaFF dataset. In particular, WorldAfford can localize the affordance regions of multiple objects and provide an alternative when objects in the environment cannot fully match the given instruction.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Accurate phenotypic analysis in aquaculture breeding necessitates the quantification of subtle morphological phenotypes. Existing datasets suffer from limitations such as small scale, limited species coverage, and inadequate annotation of keypoints for measuring refined and complex morphological phenotypes of fish body parts. To address this gap, we introduce FishPhenoKey, a comprehensive dataset comprising 23,331 high-resolution images spanning six fish species. Notably, FishPhenoKey includes 22 phenotype-oriented annotations, enabling the capture of intricate morphological phenotypes. Motivated by the nuanced evaluation of these subtle morphologies, we also propose a new evaluation metric, Percentage of Measured Phenotype (PMP). It is designed to assess the accuracy of individual keypoint positions and is highly sensitive to the phenotypes measured using the corresponding keypoints. To enhance keypoint detection accuracy, we further propose a novel loss, Anatomically-Calibrated Regularization (ACR), that can be integrated into keypoint detection models, leveraging biological insights to refine keypoint localization. Our contributions set a new benchmark in fish phenotype analysis, addressing the challenges of precise morphological quantification and opening new avenues for research in sustainable aquaculture and genetic studies.

- **Summary**: Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently made progress in 3D human reconstruction, it primarily relies on 2D pixel-level supervision, overlooking the geometric complexity and topological relationships of different body parts. To address this gap, we introduce the Hierarchical Graph Human Gaussian Control (HUGS) framework for achieving high-fidelity 3D human reconstruction. Our approach involves leveraging explicitly semantic priors of body parts to ensure the consistency of geometric topology, thereby enabling the capture of the complex geometrical and topological associations among body parts. Additionally, we disentangle high-frequency features from global human features to refine surface details in body parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits superior performance in human body reconstruction, particularly in enhancing surface details and accurately reconstructing body part junctions.

### 3DSS-Mamba: 3D-Spectral-Spatial Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification constitutes the fundamental research in remote sensing fields. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have demonstrated impressive capability in capturing spectral-spatial contextual dependencies. However, these architectures suffer from limited receptive fields and quadratic computational complexity, respectively. Fortunately, recent Mamba architectures built upon the State Space Model integrate the advantages of long-range sequence modeling and linear computational efficiency, exhibiting substantial potential in low-dimensional scenarios. Motivated by this, we propose a novel 3D-Spectral-Spatial Mamba (3DSS-Mamba) framework for HSI classification, allowing for global spectral-spatial relationship modeling with greater computational efficiency. Technically, a spectral-spatial token generation (SSTG) module is designed to convert the HSI cube into a set of 3D spectral-spatial tokens. To overcome the limitations of traditional Mamba, which is confined to modeling causal sequences and inadaptable to high-dimensional scenarios, a 3D-Spectral-Spatial Selective Scanning (3DSS) mechanism is introduced, which performs pixel-wise selective scanning on 3D hyperspectral tokens along the spectral and spatial dimensions. Five scanning routes are constructed to investigate the impact of dimension prioritization. The 3DSS scanning mechanism combined with conventional mapping operations forms the 3D-spectral-spatial mamba block (3DMB), enabling the extraction of global spectral-spatial semantic representations. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on HSI classification benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Existing solutions to image editing tasks suffer from several issues. Though achieving remarkably satisfying generated results, some supervised methods require huge amounts of paired training data, which greatly limits their usages. The other unsupervised methods take full advantage of large-scale pre-trained priors, thus being strictly restricted to the domains where the priors are trained on and behaving badly in out-of-distribution cases. The task we focus on is how to enable the users to customize their desired effects through only few image pairs. In our proposed framework, a novel few-shot learning mechanism based on the directional transformations among samples is introduced and expands the learnable space exponentially. Adopting a diffusion model pipeline, we redesign the condition calculating modules in our model and apply several technical improvements. Experimental results demonstrate the capabilities of our method in various cases.

- **Summary**: Road lanes are integral components of the visual perception systems in intelligent vehicles, playing a pivotal role in safe navigation. In lane detection tasks, balancing accuracy with real-time performance is essential, yet existing methods often sacrifice one for the other. To address this trade-off, we introduce CLRKDNet, a streamlined model that balances detection accuracy with real-time performance. The state-of-the-art model CLRNet has demonstrated exceptional performance across various datasets, yet its computational overhead is substantial due to its Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and muti-layer detection head architecture. Our method simplifies both the FPN structure and detection heads, redesigning them to incorporate a novel teacher-student distillation process alongside a newly introduced series of distillation losses. This combination reduces inference time by up to 60% while maintaining detection accuracy comparable to CLRNet. This strategic balance of accuracy and speed makes CLRKDNet a viable solution for real-time lane detection tasks in autonomous driving applications.

- **Summary**: In the animation industry, 3D modelers typically rely on front and back non-overlapped concept designs to guide the 3D modeling of anime characters. However, there is currently a lack of automated approaches for generating anime characters directly from these 2D designs. In light of this, we explore a novel task of reconstructing anime characters from non-overlapped views. This presents two main challenges: existing multi-view approaches cannot be directly applied due to the absence of overlapping regions, and there is a scarcity of full-body anime character data and standard benchmarks. To bridge the gap, we present Non-Overlapped Views for 3D \textbf{A}nime Character Reconstruction (NOVA-3D), a new framework that implements a method for view-aware feature fusion to learn 3D-consistent features effectively and synthesizes full-body anime characters from non-overlapped front and back views directly. To facilitate this line of research, we collected the NOVA-Human dataset, which comprises multi-view images and accurate camera parameters for 3D anime characters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline approaches, achieving superior reconstruction of anime characters with exceptional detail fidelity. In addition, to further verify the effectiveness of our method, we applied it to the animation head reconstruction task and improved the state-of-the-art baseline to 94.453 in SSIM, 7.726 in LPIPS, and 19.575 in PSNR on average.

- **Summary**: Accurately detecting active objects undergoing state changes is essential for comprehending human interactions and facilitating decision-making. The existing methods for active object detection (AOD) primarily rely on visual appearance of the objects within input, such as changes in size, shape and relationship with hands. However, these visual changes can be subtle, posing challenges, particularly in scenarios with multiple distracting no-change instances of the same category. We observe that the state changes are often the result of an interaction being performed upon the object, thus propose to use informed priors about object related plausible interactions (including semantics and visual appearance) to provide more reliable cues for AOD. Specifically, we propose a knowledge aggregation procedure to integrate the aforementioned informed priors into oracle queries within the teacher decoder, offering more object affordance commonsense to locate the active object. To streamline the inference process and reduce extra knowledge inputs, we propose a knowledge distillation approach that encourages the student decoder to mimic the detection capabilities of the teacher decoder using the oracle query by replicating its predictions and attention. Our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets, namely Ego4D, Epic-Kitchens, MECCANO, and 100DOH, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in improving AOD.

- **Summary**: Optical flow estimation is one of the fundamental tasks in low-level computer vision, which describes the pixel-wise displacement and can be used in many other tasks. From the apparent aspect, the optical flow can be viewed as the correlation between the pixels in consecutive frames, so continuously refining the correlation volume can achieve an outstanding performance. However, it will make the method have a catastrophic computational complexity. Not only that, the error caused by the occlusion regions of the successive frames will be amplified through the inaccurate warp operation. These challenges can not be solved only from the apparent view, so this paper rethinks the optical flow estimation from the kinetics viewpoint.We propose a method combining the apparent and kinetics information from this motivation. The proposed method directly predicts the optical flow from the feature extracted from images instead of building the correlation volume, which will improve the efficiency of the whole network. Meanwhile, the proposed method involves a new differentiable warp operation that simultaneously considers the warping and occlusion. Moreover, the proposed method blends the kinetics feature with the apparent feature through the novel self-supervised loss function. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments and ablation studies prove that the proposed novel insight into how to predict the optical flow can achieve the better performance of the state-of-the-art methods, and in some metrics, the proposed method outperforms the correlation-based method, especially in situations containing occlusion and fast moving. The code will be public.

- **Summary**: Machine unlearning empowers individuals with the `right to be forgotten' by removing their private or sensitive information encoded in machine learning models. However, it remains uncertain whether MU can be effectively applied to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly in scenarios of forgetting the leaked visual data of concepts. To overcome the challenge, we propose an efficient method, Single Image Unlearning (SIU), to unlearn the visual recognition of a concept by fine-tuning a single associated image for few steps. SIU consists of two key aspects: (i) Constructing Multifaceted fine-tuning data. We introduce four targets, based on which we construct fine-tuning data for the concepts to be forgotten; (ii) Jointly training loss. To synchronously forget the visual recognition of concepts and preserve the utility of MLLMs, we fine-tune MLLMs through a novel Dual Masked KL-divergence Loss combined with Cross Entropy loss. Alongside our method, we establish MMUBench, a new benchmark for MU in MLLMs and introduce a collection of metrics for its evaluation. Experimental results on MMUBench show that SIU completely surpasses the performance of existing methods. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that SIU can avoid invasive membership inference attacks and jailbreak attacks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore MU in MLLMs. We will release the code and benchmark in the near future.

- **Summary**: Textual image generation spans diverse fields like advertising, education, product packaging, social media, information visualization, and branding. Despite recent strides in language-guided image synthesis using diffusion models, current models excel in image generation but struggle with accurate text rendering and offer limited control over font attributes. In this paper, we aim to enhance the synthesis of high-quality images with precise text customization, thereby contributing to the advancement of image generation models. We call our proposed method CustomText. Our implementation leverages a pre-trained TextDiffuser model to enable control over font color, background, and types. Additionally, to address the challenge of accurately rendering small-sized fonts, we train the ControlNet model for a consistency decoder, significantly enhancing text-generation performance. We assess the performance of CustomText in comparison to previous methods of textual image generation on the publicly available CTW-1500 dataset and a self-curated dataset for small-text generation, showcasing superior results.

- **Summary**: Recent years have witnessed an increasing global population affected by neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), which traditionally require extensive healthcare resources and human effort for medical diagnosis and monitoring. As a crucial disease-related motor symptom, human gait can be exploited to characterize different NDs. The current advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models enable automatic gait analysis for NDs identification and classification, opening a new avenue to facilitate faster and more cost-effective diagnosis of NDs. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on recent progress of machine learning and deep learning based AI techniques applied to diagnosis of five typical NDs through gait. We provide an overview of the process of AI-assisted NDs diagnosis, and present a systematic taxonomy of existing gait data and AI models. Through an extensive review and analysis of 164 studies, we identify and discuss the challenges, potential solutions, and future directions in this field. Finally, we envision the prospective utilization of 3D skeleton data for human gait representation and the development of more efficient AI models for NDs diagnosis. We provide a public resource repository to track and facilitate developments in this emerging field: https://github.com/Kali-Hac/AI4NDD-Survey.

- **Summary**: The development of Urdu scene text detection, recognition, and Visual Question Answering (VQA) technologies is crucial for advancing accessibility, information retrieval, and linguistic diversity in digital content, facilitating better understanding and interaction with Urdu-language visual data. This initiative seeks to bridge the gap between textual and visual comprehension. We propose a new multi-task Urdu scene text dataset comprising over 1000 natural scene images, which can be used for text detection, recognition, and VQA tasks. We provide fine-grained annotations for text instances, addressing the limitations of previous datasets for facing arbitrary-shaped texts. By incorporating additional annotation points, this dataset facilitates the development and assessment of methods that can handle diverse text layouts, intricate shapes, and non-standard orientations commonly encountered in real-world scenarios. Besides, the VQA annotations make it the first benchmark for the Urdu Text VQA method, which can prompt the development of Urdu scene text understanding.

- **Summary**: For visual content generation, discrepancies between user intentions and the generated content have been a longstanding problem. This discrepancy arises from two main factors. First, user intentions are inherently complex, with subtle details not fully captured by input prompts. The absence of such details makes it challenging for generative models to accurately reflect the intended meaning, leading to a mismatch between the desired and generated output. Second, generative models trained on visual-label pairs lack the comprehensive knowledge to accurately represent all aspects of the input data in their generated outputs. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge-enhanced iterative refinement framework for visual content generation. We begin by analyzing and identifying the key challenges faced by existing generative models. Then, we introduce various knowledge sources, including human insights, pre-trained models, logic rules, and world knowledge, which can be leveraged to address these challenges. Furthermore, we propose a novel visual generation framework that incorporates a knowledge-based feedback module to iteratively refine the generation process. This module gradually improves the alignment between the generated content and user intentions. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework through preliminary results, highlighting the potential of knowledge-enhanced generative models for intention-aligned content generation.

- **Summary**: Current methods for Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) struggle to align complex situations involving specific environmental details, character descriptions, and action narratives. To tackle this issue, we propose a Large Language Model-guided Moment Retrieval (LMR) approach that employs the extensive knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve video context representation as well as cross-modal alignment, facilitating accurate localization of target moments. Specifically, LMR introduces a context enhancement technique with LLMs to generate crucial target-related context semantics. These semantics are integrated with visual features for producing discriminative video representations. Finally, a language-conditioned transformer is designed to decode free-form language queries, on the fly, using aligned video representations for moment retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LMR achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming the nearest competitor by up to 3.28\% and 4.06\% on the challenging QVHighlights and Charades-STA benchmarks, respectively. More importantly, the performance gains are significantly higher for localization of complex queries.

- **Summary**: Few-shot learning aims to generalize the recognizer from seen categories to an entirely novel scenario. With only a few support samples, several advanced methods initially introduce class names as prior knowledge for identifying novel classes. However, obstacles still impede achieving a comprehensive understanding of how to harness the mutual advantages of visual and textual knowledge. In this paper, we propose a coherent Bidirectional Knowledge Permeation strategy called BiKop, which is grounded in a human intuition: A class name description offers a general representation, whereas an image captures the specificity of individuals. BiKop primarily establishes a hierarchical joint general-specific representation through bidirectional knowledge permeation. On the other hand, considering the bias of joint representation towards the base set, we disentangle base-class-relevant semantics during training, thereby alleviating the suppression of potential novel-class-relevant information. Experiments on four challenging benchmarks demonstrate the remarkable superiority of BiKop. Our code will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: This research introduces an innovative approach to explore the cognitive and biologically inspired underpinnings of feature vector splitting for analyzing the significance of different attributes in e-security biometric signature recognition applications. Departing from traditional methods of concatenating features into an extended set, we employ multiple splitting strategies, aligning with cognitive principles, to preserve control over the relative importance of each feature subset. Our methodology is applied to three diverse databases (MCYT100, MCYT300,and SVC) using two classifiers (vector quantization and dynamic time warping with one and five training samples). Experimentation demonstrates that the fusion of pressure data with spatial coordinates (x and y) consistently enhances performance. However, the inclusion of pen-tip angles in the same feature set yields mixed results, with performance improvements observed in select cases. This work delves into the cognitive aspects of feature fusion,shedding light on the cognitive relevance of feature vector splitting in e-security biometric applications.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in pre-trained large foundation models (LFM) have yielded significant breakthroughs across various domains, including natural language processing and computer vision. These models have been particularly impactful in the domain of medical diagnostic tasks. With abundant unlabeled data, an LFM has been developed for fundus images using the Vision Transformer (VIT) and a self-supervised learning framework. This LFM has shown promising performance in fundus disease diagnosis across multiple datasets. On the other hand, deep learning models have long been challenged by dataset quality issues, such as image quality and dataset bias. To investigate the influence of data quality on LFM, we conducted explorations in two fundus diagnosis tasks using datasets of varying quality. Specifically, we explored the following questions: Is LFM more robust to image quality? Is LFM affected by dataset bias? Can fine-tuning techniques alleviate these effects? Our investigation found that LFM exhibits greater resilience to dataset quality issues, including image quality and dataset bias, compared to typical convolutional networks. Furthermore, we discovered that overall fine-tuning is an effective adapter for LFM to mitigate the impact of dataset quality issues.

- **Summary**: LiDAR-based 3D object detection has made impressive progress recently, yet most existing models are black-box, lacking interpretability. Previous explanation approaches primarily focus on analyzing image-based models and are not readily applicable to LiDAR-based 3D detectors. In this paper, we propose a feature factorization activation map (FFAM) to generate high-quality visual explanations for 3D detectors. FFAM employs non-negative matrix factorization to generate concept activation maps and subsequently aggregates these maps to obtain a global visual explanation. To achieve object-specific visual explanations, we refine the global visual explanation using the feature gradient of a target object. Additionally, we introduce a voxel upsampling strategy to align the scale between the activation map and input point cloud. We qualitatively and quantitatively analyze FFAM with multiple detectors on several datasets. Experimental results validate the high-quality visual explanations produced by FFAM. The Code will be available at \url{https://github.com/Say2L/FFAM.git}.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing dynamic articulated objects from a singular monocular video is challenging, requiring joint estimation of shape, motion, and camera parameters from limited views. Current methods typically demand extensive computational resources and training time, and require additional human annotations such as predefined parametric models, camera poses, and key points, limiting their generalizability. We propose Synergistic Shape and Skeleton Optimization (S3O), a novel two-phase method that forgoes these prerequisites and efficiently learns parametric models including visible shapes and underlying skeletons. Conventional strategies typically learn all parameters simultaneously, leading to interdependencies where a single incorrect prediction can result in significant errors. In contrast, S3O adopts a phased approach: it first focuses on learning coarse parametric models, then progresses to motion learning and detail addition. This method substantially lowers computational complexity and enhances robustness in reconstruction from limited viewpoints, all without requiring additional annotations. To address the current inadequacies in 3D reconstruction from monocular video benchmarks, we collected the PlanetZoo dataset. Our experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks and the PlanetZoo dataset affirm that S3O provides more accurate 3D reconstruction, and plausible skeletons, and reduces the training time by approximately 60% compared to the state-of-the-art, thus advancing the state of the art in dynamic object reconstruction.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a new algorithm to estimate absolute camera pose given an axis of the camera's rotation matrix. Current algorithms solve the problem via algebraic solutions on limited input domains. This paper shows that the problem can be solved efficiently by finding the intersection points of a hyperbola and the unit circle. The solution can flexibly accommodate combinations of point and line features in minimal and overconstrained configurations. In addition, the two special cases of planar and minimal configurations are identified to yield simpler closed-form solutions. Extensive experiments validate the approach.

- **Summary**: Scene graph generation (SGG) is an important task in image understanding because it represents the relationships between objects in an image as a graph structure, making it possible to understand the semantic relationships between objects intuitively. Previous SGG studies used a message-passing neural networks (MPNN) to update features, which can effectively reflect information about surrounding objects. However, these studies have failed to reflect the co-occurrence of objects during SGG generation. In addition, they only addressed the long-tail problem of the training dataset from the perspectives of sampling and learning methods. To address these two problems, we propose CooK, which reflects the Co-occurrence Knowledge between objects, and the learnable term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-l-IDF) to solve the long-tail problem. We applied the proposed model to the SGG benchmark dataset, and the results showed a performance improvement of up to 3.8% compared with existing state-of-the-art models in SGGen subtask. The proposed method exhibits generalization ability from the results obtained, showing uniform performance improvement for all MPNN models.

- **Summary**: Affective Image Manipulation (AIM) seeks to modify user-provided images to evoke specific emotional responses. This task is inherently complex due to its twofold objective: significantly evoking the intended emotion, while preserving the original image composition. Existing AIM methods primarily adjust color and style, often failing to elicit precise and profound emotional shifts. Drawing on psychological insights, we extend AIM by incorporating content modifications to enhance emotional impact. We introduce EmoEdit, a novel two-stage framework comprising emotion attribution and image editing. In the emotion attribution stage, we leverage a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to create hierarchies of semantic factors that represent abstract emotions. In the image editing stage, the VLM identifies the most relevant factors for the provided image, and guides a generative editing model to perform affective modifications. A ranking technique that we developed selects the best edit, balancing between emotion fidelity and structure integrity. To validate EmoEdit, we assembled a dataset of 416 images, categorized into positive, negative, and neutral classes. Our method is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we showcase EmoEdit's potential in various manipulation tasks, including emotion-oriented and semantics-oriented editing.

- **Summary**: Creating and customizing a 3D clothed avatar from textual descriptions is a critical and challenging task. Traditional methods often treat the human body and clothing as inseparable, limiting users' ability to freely mix and match garments. In response to this limitation, we present LAyered Gaussian Avatar (LAGA), a carefully designed framework enabling the creation of high-fidelity decomposable avatars with diverse garments. By decoupling garments from avatar, our framework empowers users to conviniently edit avatars at the garment level. Our approach begins by modeling the avatar using a set of Gaussian points organized in a layered structure, where each layer corresponds to a specific garment or the human body itself. To generate high-quality garments for each layer, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy for diverse garment generation and a novel dual-SDS loss function to maintain coherence between the generated garments and avatar components, including the human body and other garments. Moreover, we introduce three regularization losses to guide the movement of Gaussians for garment transfer, allowing garments to be freely transferred to various avatars. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that our approach surpasses existing methods in the generation of 3D clothed humans.

- **Summary**: Wrinkle defects were found widely exist in the field of industrial products, i.e. wind turbine blades and filament-wound composite pressure vessels. The magnitude of wrinkle wavelength varies from several millimeters to over one hundred millimeters. Locating the wrinkle defects and measuring their responses are very important to the assessment of the structures that containing wrinkle defects. A meso-mechanical modeling is presented based on the homogenization method to obtain the effective stiffness of a graded wrinkle. The finite element simulation predicts the trans-scale response of out-of-plane displacement of wrinkled laminates, where the maximum displacement ranges from nanoscale to millimeter scale. Such trans-scale effect requires different measurement approaches to observe the displacement responses. Here we employed Shearography (Speckle Pattern Shearing Interferometry) and fringe projection profilometry (FPP) method respectively according to the different magnitude of displacement. In FPP method, a displacement extraction algorithm was presented to obtain the out-of-plane displacement. The measurement sensitivity and accuracy of Shearography and FPP are compared, which provides a quantitative reference for industrial non-destructive test.

- **Summary**: In the field of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) landing, conventional approaches fall short in delivering not only the required precision but also the resilience against environmental disturbances. Yet, learning-based algorithms can offer promising solutions by leveraging their ability to learn the intelligent behaviour from data. On one hand, this paper introduces a novel multimodal transformer-based Deep Learning detector, that can provide reliable positioning for precise autonomous landing. It surpasses standard approaches by addressing individual sensor limitations, achieving high reliability even in diverse weather and sensor failure conditions. It was rigorously validated across varying environments, achieving optimal true positive rates and average precisions of up to 90%. On the other hand, it is proposed a Reinforcement Learning (RL) decision-making model, based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN) rationale. Initially trained in sumlation, its adaptive behaviour is successfully transferred and validated in a real outdoor scenario. Furthermore, this approach demonstrates rapid inference times of approximately 5ms, validating its applicability on edge devices.

- **Summary**: Signature verification is a critical task in many applications, including forensic science, legal judgments, and financial markets. However, current signature verification systems are often difficult to explain, which can limit their acceptance in these applications. In this paper, we propose a novel explainable offline automatic signature verifier (ASV) to support forensic handwriting examiners. Our ASV is based on a universal background model (UBM) constructed from offline signature images. It allows us to assign a questioned signature to the UBM and to a reference set of known signatures using simple distance measures. This makes it possible to explain the verifier's decision in a way that is understandable to non experts. We evaluated our ASV on publicly available databases and found that it achieves competitive performance with state of the art ASVs, even when challenging 1 versus 1 comparison are considered. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to develop an explainable ASV that is also competitive in terms of performance. We believe that our ASV has the potential to improve the acceptance of signature verification in critical applications such as forensic science and legal judgments.

- **Summary**: This work addresses the need for a balanced approach between performance and efficiency in scalable production environments for visually-rich document understanding (VDU) tasks. Currently, there is a reliance on large document foundation models that offer advanced capabilities but come with a heavy computational burden. In this paper, we propose a multimodal early exit (EE) model design that incorporates various training strategies, exit layer types and placements. Our goal is to achieve a Pareto-optimal balance between predictive performance and efficiency for multimodal document image classification. Through a comprehensive set of experiments, we compare our approach with traditional exit policies and showcase an improved performance-efficiency trade-off. Our multimodal EE design preserves the model's predictive capabilities, enhancing both speed and latency. This is achieved through a reduction of over 20% in latency, while fully retaining the baseline accuracy. This research represents the first exploration of multimodal EE design within the VDU community, highlighting as well the effectiveness of calibration in improving confidence scores for exiting at different layers. Overall, our findings contribute to practical VDU applications by enhancing both performance and efficiency.

- **Summary**: In this article, we propose the detection of crowd anomalies through the extraction of information in the form of time series from video format using a multimodal approach. Through pattern recognition algorithms and segmentation, informative measures of the number of people and image occupancy are extracted at regular intervals, which are then analyzed to obtain trends and anomalous behaviors. Specifically, through temporal decomposition and residual analysis, intervals or specific situations of unusual behaviors are identified, which can be used in decision-making and improvement of actions in sectors related to human movement such as tourism or security.   The application of this methodology on the webcam of Turisme Comunitat Valenciana in the town of Morella (Comunitat Valenciana, Spain) has provided excellent results. It is shown to correctly detect specific anomalous situations and unusual overall increases during the previous weekend and during the festivities in October 2023. These results have been obtained while preserving the confidentiality of individuals at all times by using measures that maximize anonymity, without trajectory recording or person recognition.

- **Summary**: Adapting large-scale image-text pre-training models, e.g., CLIP, to the video domain represents the current state-of-the-art for text-video retrieval. The primary approaches involve transferring text-video pairs to a common embedding space and leveraging cross-modal interactions on specific entities for semantic alignment. Though effective, these paradigms entail prohibitive computational costs, leading to inefficient retrieval. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, Global-Local Semantic Consistent Learning (GLSCL), which capitalizes on latent shared semantics across modalities for text-video retrieval. Specifically, we introduce a parameter-free global interaction module to explore coarse-grained alignment. Then, we devise a shared local interaction module that employs several learnable queries to capture latent semantic concepts for learning fine-grained alignment. Furthermore, an Inter-Consistency Loss (ICL) is devised to accomplish the concept alignment between the visual query and corresponding textual query, and an Intra-Diversity Loss (IDL) is developed to repulse the distribution within visual (textual) queries to generate more discriminative concepts. Extensive experiments on five widely used benchmarks (i.e., MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and ActivityNet) substantiate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance with SOTA as well as being nearly 220 times faster in terms of computational cost. Code is available at: https://github.com/zchoi/GLSCL.

- **Summary**: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to match people with the same identity between visible and infrared modalities. VI-ReID is a challenging task due to the large differences in individual appearance under different modalities. Existing methods generally try to bridge the cross-modal differences at image or feature level, which lacks exploring the discriminative embeddings. Effectively minimizing these cross-modal discrepancies relies on obtaining representations that are guided by identity and consistent across modalities, while also filtering out representations that are irrelevant to identity. To address these challenges, we introduce a dynamic identity-guided attention network (DIAN) to mine identity-guided and modality-consistent embeddings, facilitating effective bridging the gap between different modalities. Specifically, in DIAN, to pursue a semantically richer representation, we first use orthogonal projection to fuse the features from two connected coarse and fine layers. Furthermore, we first use dynamic convolution kernels to mine identity-guided and modality-consistent representations. More notably, a cross embedding balancing loss is introduced to effectively bridge cross-modal discrepancies by above embeddings. Experimental results on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets show that DIAN achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, for indoor search on SYSU-MM01, our method achieves 86.28% rank-1 accuracy and 87.41% mAP, respectively. Our code will be available soon.

- **Summary**: As a representative of a new generation of biometrics, vein identification technology offers a high level of security and convenience. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a prominent class of deep learning architectures, have been extensively utilized for vein identification. Since their performance and robustness are limited by small Effective Receptive Fields (e.g. 3$\times$3 kernels) and insufficient training samples, however, they are unable to extract global feature representations from vein images in an effective manner. To address these issues, we propose StarLKNet, a large kernel convolution-based palm-vein identification network, with the Mixup approach. Our StarMix learns effectively the distribution of vein features to expand samples. To enable CNNs to capture comprehensive feature representations from palm-vein images, we explored the effect of convolutional kernel size on the performance of palm-vein identification networks and designed LaKNet, a network leveraging large kernel convolution and gating mechanism. In light of the current state of knowledge, this represents an inaugural instance of the deployment of a CNN with large kernels in the domain of vein identification. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the performance of StarLKNet on two public palm-vein datasets. The results demonstrated that StarMix provided superior augmentation, and LakNet exhibited more stable performance gains compared to mainstream approaches, resulting in the highest recognition accuracy and lowest identification error.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing 3D human bodies from realistic motion sequences remains a challenge due to pervasive and complex occlusions. Current methods struggle to capture the dynamics of occluded body parts, leading to model penetration and distorted motion. RemoCap leverages Spatial Disentanglement (SD) and Motion Disentanglement (MD) to overcome these limitations. SD addresses occlusion interference between the target human body and surrounding objects. It achieves this by disentangling target features along the dimension axis. By aligning features based on their spatial positions in each dimension, SD isolates the target object's response within a global window, enabling accurate capture despite occlusions. The MD module employs a channel-wise temporal shuffling strategy to simulate diverse scene dynamics. This process effectively disentangles motion features, allowing RemoCap to reconstruct occluded parts with greater fidelity. Furthermore, this paper introduces a sequence velocity loss that promotes temporal coherence. This loss constrains inter-frame velocity errors, ensuring the predicted motion exhibits realistic consistency. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on benchmark datasets demonstrate RemoCap's superior performance in 3D human body reconstruction. On the 3DPW dataset, RemoCap surpasses all competitors, achieving the best results in MPVPE (81.9), MPJPE (72.7), and PA-MPJPE (44.1) metrics.

- **Summary**: Model quantization is widely used to compress and accelerate deep neural networks. However, recent studies have revealed the feasibility of weaponizing model quantization via implanting quantization-conditioned backdoors (QCBs). These special backdoors stay dormant on released full-precision models but will come into effect after standard quantization. Due to the peculiarity of QCBs, existing defenses have minor effects on reducing their threats or are even infeasible. In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth analysis of QCBs. We reveal that the activation of existing QCBs primarily stems from the nearest rounding operation and is closely related to the norms of neuron-wise truncation errors (i.e., the difference between the continuous full-precision weights and its quantized version). Motivated by these insights, we propose Error-guided Flipped Rounding with Activation Preservation (EFRAP), an effective and practical defense against QCBs. Specifically, EFRAP learns a non-nearest rounding strategy with neuron-wise error norm and layer-wise activation preservation guidance, flipping the rounding strategies of neurons crucial for backdoor effects but with minimal impact on clean accuracy. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our EFRAP can defeat state-of-the-art QCB attacks under various settings.

- **Summary**: We address the estimation of the 6D pose of an unknown target spacecraft relative to a monocular camera, a key step towards the autonomous rendezvous and proximity operations required by future Active Debris Removal missions. We present a novel method that enables an "off-the-shelf" spacecraft pose estimator, which is supposed to known the target CAD model, to be applied on an unknown target. Our method relies on an in-the wild NeRF, i.e., a Neural Radiance Field that employs learnable appearance embeddings to represent varying illumination conditions found in natural scenes. We train the NeRF model using a sparse collection of images that depict the target, and in turn generate a large dataset that is diverse both in terms of viewpoint and illumination. This dataset is then used to train the pose estimation network. We validate our method on the Hardware-In-the-Loop images of SPEED+ that emulate lighting conditions close to those encountered on orbit. We demonstrate that our method successfully enables the training of an off-the-shelf spacecraft pose estimation network from a sparse set of images. Furthermore, we show that a network trained using our method performs similarly to a model trained on synthetic images generated using the CAD model of the target.

- **Summary**: Pedestrians are among the most endangered traffic participants in road traffic. While pedestrian detection in nominal conditions is well established, the sensor and, therefore, the pedestrian detection performance degrades under adverse weather conditions. Understanding the influences of rain and fog on a specific radar and lidar sensor requires extensive testing, and if the sensors' specifications are altered, a retesting effort is required. These challenges are addressed in this paper, firstly by conducting comprehensive measurements collecting empirical data of pedestrian detection performance under varying rain and fog intensities in a controlled environment, and secondly, by introducing a dedicated Weather Filter (WF) model that predicts the effects of rain and fog on a user-specified radar and lidar on pedestrian detection performance. We use a state-of-the-art baseline model representing the physical relation of sensor specifications, which, however, lacks the representation of secondary weather effects, e.g., changes in pedestrian reflectivity or droplets on a sensor, and adjust it with empirical data to account for such. We find that our measurement results are in agreement with existent literature related to weather degredation and our WF outperforms the baseline model in predicting weather effects on pedestrian detection while only requiring a minimal testing effort.

- **Summary**: Creative story illustration requires a consistent interplay of multiple characters or objects. However, conventional text-to-image models face significant challenges while producing images featuring multiple personalized subjects. For example, they distort the subject rendering, or the text descriptions fail to render coherent subject interactions. We present Multi-Subject Personalization (MSP) to alleviate some of these challenges. We implement MSP using Stable Diffusion and assess our approach against other text-to-image models, showcasing its consistent generation of good-quality images representing intended subjects and interactions.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Instruction Tuning (VLIT) is a critical training phase for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). With the improving capabilities of open-source LVLMs, researchers have increasingly turned to generate VLIT data by using open-source LVLMs and achieved significant progress. However, such data generation approaches are bottlenecked by the following challenges: 1) Since multi-modal models tend to be influenced by prior language knowledge, directly using LVLMs to generate VLIT data would inevitably lead to low content relevance between generated data and images. 2) To improve the ability of the models to generate VLIT data, previous methods have incorporated an additional training phase to boost the generative capacity. This process hurts the generalization of the models to unseen inputs (i.e., "exposure bias" problem). In this paper, we propose a new Content Correlated VLIT data generation via Contrastive Learning (C3L). Specifically, we design a new content relevance module which enhances the content relevance between VLIT data and images by computing Image Instruction Correspondence Scores S(I2C). Moreover, a contrastive learning module is introduced to further boost the VLIT data generation capability of the LVLMs. A large number of automatic measures on four benchmarks show the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: The visual pathway of human brain includes two sub-pathways, ie, the ventral pathway and the dorsal pathway, which focus on object identification and dynamic information modeling, respectively. Both pathways comprise multi-layer structures, with each layer responsible for processing different aspects of visual information. Inspired by visual information processing mechanism of the human brain, we propose the Brain Inspired Masked Modeling (BIMM) framework, aiming to learn comprehensive representations from videos. Specifically, our approach consists of ventral and dorsal branches, which learn image and video representations, respectively. Both branches employ the Vision Transformer (ViT) as their backbone and are trained using masked modeling method. To achieve the goals of different visual cortices in the brain, we segment the encoder of each branch into three intermediate blocks and reconstruct progressive prediction targets with light weight decoders. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from the information-sharing mechanism in the visual pathways, we propose a partial parameter sharing strategy between the branches during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BIMM achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Gated cameras flood-illuminate a scene and capture the time-gated impulse response of a scene. By employing nanosecond-scale gates, existing sensors are capable of capturing mega-pixel gated images, delivering dense depth improving on today's LiDAR sensors in spatial resolution and depth precision. Although gated depth estimation methods deliver a million of depth estimates per frame, their resolution is still an order below existing RGB imaging methods. In this work, we combine high-resolution stereo HDR RCCB cameras with gated imaging, allowing us to exploit depth cues from active gating, multi-view RGB and multi-view NIR sensing -- multi-view and gated cues across the entire spectrum. The resulting capture system consists only of low-cost CMOS sensors and flood-illumination. We propose a novel stereo-depth estimation method that is capable of exploiting these multi-modal multi-view depth cues, including the active illumination that is measured by the RCCB camera when removing the IR-cut filter. The proposed method achieves accurate depth at long ranges, outperforming the next best existing method by 39% for ranges of 100 to 220m in MAE on accumulated LiDAR ground-truth.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised pre-training has emerged as a transformative paradigm, displaying remarkable advancements in various domains. However, the susceptibility to domain shift, where pre-training data distribution differs from fine-tuning, poses a significant obstacle. To address this, we augment the Swin Transformer to learn from different medical imaging modalities, enhancing downstream performance. Our model, dubbed SwinFUSE (Swin Multi-Modal Fusion for UnSupervised Enhancement), offers three key advantages: (i) it learns from both Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) during pre-training, resulting in complementary feature representations; (ii) a domain-invariance module (DIM) that effectively highlights salient input regions, enhancing adaptability; (iii) exhibits remarkable generalizability, surpassing the confines of tasks it was initially pre-trained on. Our experiments on two publicly available 3D segmentation datasets show a modest 1-2% performance trade-off compared to single-modality models, yet significant out-performance of up to 27% on out-of-distribution modality. This substantial improvement underscores our proposed approach's practical relevance and real-world applicability. Code is available at: https://github.com/devalab/SwinFUSE

- **Summary**: Inpainting lesions within different normal backgrounds is a potential method of addressing the generalization problem, which is crucial for polyp segmentation models. However, seamlessly introducing polyps into complex endoscopic environments while simultaneously generating accurate pseudo-masks remains a challenge for current inpainting methods. To address these issues, we first leverage the pre-trained Stable Diffusion Inpaint and ControlNet, to introduce a robust generative model capable of inpainting polyps across different backgrounds. Secondly, we utilize the prior that synthetic polyps are confined to the inpainted region, to establish an inpainted region-guided pseudo-mask refinement network. We also propose a sample selection strategy that prioritizes well-aligned and hard synthetic cases for further model fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our inpainting model outperformed baseline methods both qualitatively and quantitatively in inpainting quality. Moreover, our data augmentation strategy significantly enhances the performance of polyp segmentation models on external datasets, achieving or surpassing the level of fully supervised training benchmarks in that domain.

- **Summary**: Anticipating object state changes in images and videos is a challenging problem whose solution has important implications in vision-based scene understanding, automated monitoring systems, and action planning. In this work, we propose the first method for solving this problem. The proposed method predicts object state changes that will occur in the near future as a result of yet unseen human actions. To address this new problem, we propose a novel framework that integrates learnt visual features that represent the recent visual information, with natural language (NLP) features that represent past object state changes and actions. Leveraging the extensive and challenging Ego4D dataset which provides a large-scale collection of first-person perspective videos across numerous interaction scenarios, we introduce new curated annotation data for the object state change anticipation task (OSCA), noted as Ego4D-OSCA. An extensive experimental evaluation was conducted that demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method in predicting object state changes in dynamic scenarios. The proposed work underscores the potential of integrating video and linguistic cues to enhance the predictive performance of video understanding systems. Moreover, it lays the groundwork for future research on the new task of object state change anticipation. The source code and the new annotation data (Ego4D-OSCA) will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Objective: In medical imaging, it is often crucial to accurately assess and correct movement during image-guided therapy. Deformable image registration (DIR) consists in estimating the required spatial transformation to align a moving image with a fixed one. However, it is acknowledged that, boundary conditions applied to the solution are critical in preventing mis-registration. Despite the extensive research on registration techniques, relatively few have addressed the issue of boundary conditions in the context of medical DIR. Our aim is a step towards customizing boundary conditions to suit the diverse registration tasks at hand.   Approach: We propose a generic, locally adaptive, Robin-type condition enabling to balance between Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, depending on incoming/outgoing flow fields on the image boundaries. The proposed framework is entirely automatized through the determination of a reduced set of hyperparameters optimized via energy minimization.   Main results: The proposed approach was tested on a mono-modal CT thorax registration task and an abdominal CT to MRI registration task. For the first task, we observed a relative improvement in terms of target registration error of up to 12% (mean 4%), compared to homogeneous Dirichlet and homogeneous Neumann. For the second task, the automatic framework provides results closed to the best achievable.   Significance: This study underscores the importance of tailoring the registration problem at the image boundaries. In this research, we introduce a novel method to adapt the boundary conditions on a voxel-by-voxel basis, yielding optimized results in two distinct tasks: mono-modal CT thorax registration and abdominal CT to MRI registration. The proposed framework enables optimized boundary conditions in image registration without any a priori assumptions regarding the images or the motion.

- **Summary**: Generating customized content in videos has received increasing attention recently. However, existing works primarily focus on customized text-to-video generation for single subject, suffering from subject-missing and attribute-binding problems when the video is expected to contain multiple subjects. Furthermore, existing models struggle to assign the desired actions to the corresponding subjects (action-binding problem), failing to achieve satisfactory multi-subject generation performance. To tackle the problems, in this paper, we propose DisenStudio, a novel framework that can generate text-guided videos for customized multiple subjects, given few images for each subject. Specifically, DisenStudio enhances a pretrained diffusion-based text-to-video model with our proposed spatial-disentangled cross-attention mechanism to associate each subject with the desired action. Then the model is customized for the multiple subjects with the proposed motion-preserved disentangled finetuning, which involves three tuning strategies: multi-subject co-occurrence tuning, masked single-subject tuning, and multi-subject motion-preserved tuning. The first two strategies guarantee the subject occurrence and preserve their visual attributes, and the third strategy helps the model maintain the temporal motion-generation ability when finetuning on static images. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate our proposed DisenStudio significantly outperforms existing methods in various metrics. Additionally, we show that DisenStudio can be used as a powerful tool for various controllable generation applications.

- **Summary**: Single-view clothed human reconstruction holds a central position in virtual reality applications, especially in contexts involving intricate human motions. It presents notable challenges in achieving realistic clothing deformation. Current methodologies often overlook the influence of motion on surface deformation, resulting in surfaces lacking the constraints imposed by global motion. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an innovative framework, Motion-Based 3D Clothed Humans Synthesis (MOSS), which employs kinematic information to achieve motion-aware Gaussian split on the human surface. Our framework consists of two modules: Kinematic Gaussian Locating Splatting (KGAS) and Surface Deformation Detector (UID). KGAS incorporates matrix-Fisher distribution to propagate global motion across the body surface. The density and rotation factors of this distribution explicitly control the Gaussians, thereby enhancing the realism of the reconstructed surface. Additionally, to address local occlusions in single-view, based on KGAS, UID identifies significant surfaces, and geometric reconstruction is performed to compensate for these deformations. Experimental results demonstrate that MOSS achieves state-of-the-art visual quality in 3D clothed human synthesis from monocular videos. Notably, we improve the Human NeRF and the Gaussian Splatting by 33.94% and 16.75% in LPIPS* respectively. Codes are available at https://wanghongsheng01.github.io/MOSS/.

- **Summary**: In real-world road scenes, diverse material properties lead to complex light reflection phenomena, making accurate color reproduction crucial for enhancing the realism and safety of simulated driving environments. However, existing methods often struggle to capture the full spectrum of lighting effects, particularly in dynamic scenarios where viewpoint changes induce significant material color variations. To address this challenge, we introduce NieR (Normal-Based Lighting Scene Rendering), a novel framework that takes into account the nuances of light reflection on diverse material surfaces, leading to more precise rendering. To simulate the lighting synthesis process, we present the LD (Light Decomposition) module, which captures the lighting reflection characteristics on surfaces. Furthermore, to address dynamic lighting scenes, we propose the HNGD (Hierarchical Normal Gradient Densification) module to overcome the limitations of sparse Gaussian representation. Specifically, we dynamically adjust the Gaussian density based on normal gradients. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of visual quality and exhibits significant advantages in performance indicators.

- **Summary**: Embodied perception is essential for intelligent vehicles and robots, enabling more natural interaction and task execution. However, these advancements currently embrace vision level, rarely focusing on using 3D modeling sensors, which limits the full understanding of surrounding objects with multi-granular characteristics. Recently, as a promising automotive sensor with affordable cost, 4D Millimeter-Wave radar provides denser point clouds than conventional radar and perceives both semantic and physical characteristics of objects, thus enhancing the reliability of perception system. To foster the development of natural language-driven context understanding in radar scenes for 3D grounding, we construct the first dataset, Talk2Radar, which bridges these two modalities for 3D Referring Expression Comprehension. Talk2Radar contains 8,682 referring prompt samples with 20,558 referred objects. Moreover, we propose a novel model, T-RadarNet for 3D REC upon point clouds, achieving state-of-the-art performances on Talk2Radar dataset compared with counterparts, where Deformable-FPN and Gated Graph Fusion are meticulously designed for efficient point cloud feature modeling and cross-modal fusion between radar and text features, respectively. Further, comprehensive experiments are conducted to give a deep insight into radar-based 3D REC. We release our project at https://github.com/GuanRunwei/Talk2Radar.

- **Summary**: Automatic radiology report generation can alleviate the workload for physicians and minimize regional disparities in medical resources, therefore becoming an important topic in the medical image analysis field. It is a challenging task, as the computational model needs to mimic physicians to obtain information from multi-modal input data (i.e., medical images, clinical information, medical knowledge, etc.), and produce comprehensive and accurate reports. Recently, numerous works emerged to address this issue using deep learning-based methods, such as transformers, contrastive learning, and knowledge-base construction. This survey summarizes the key techniques developed in the most recent works and proposes a general workflow for deep learning-based report generation with five main components, including multi-modality data acquisition, data preparation, feature learning, feature fusion/interaction, and report generation. The state-of-the-art methods for each of these components are highlighted. Additionally, training strategies, public datasets, evaluation methods, current challenges, and future directions in this field are summarized. We have also conducted a quantitative comparison between different methods under the same experimental setting. This is the most up-to-date survey that focuses on multi-modality inputs and data fusion for radiology report generation. The aim is to provide comprehensive and rich information for researchers interested in automatic clinical report generation and medical image analysis, especially when using multimodal inputs, and assist them in developing new algorithms to advance the field.

- **Summary**: Robotic Process Automation (RPA) systems face challenges in handling complex processes and diverse screen layouts that require advanced human-like decision-making capabilities. These systems typically rely on pixel-level encoding through drag-and-drop or automation frameworks such as Selenium to create navigation workflows, rather than visual understanding of screen elements. In this context, we present SmartFlow, an AI-based RPA system that uses pre-trained large language models (LLMs) coupled with deep-learning based image understanding. Our system can adapt to new scenarios, including changes in the user interface and variations in input data, without the need for human intervention. SmartFlow uses computer vision and natural language processing to perceive visible elements on the graphical user interface (GUI) and convert them into a textual representation. This information is then utilized by LLMs to generate a sequence of actions that are executed by a scripting engine to complete an assigned task. To assess the effectiveness of SmartFlow, we have developed a dataset that includes a set of generic enterprise applications with diverse layouts, which we are releasing for research use. Our evaluations on this dataset demonstrate that SmartFlow exhibits robustness across different layouts and applications. SmartFlow can automate a wide range of business processes such as form filling, customer service, invoice processing, and back-office operations. SmartFlow can thus assist organizations in enhancing productivity by automating an even larger fraction of screen-based workflows. The demo-video and dataset are available at https://smartflow-4c5a0a.webflow.io/.

- **Summary**: Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of death in women, and brachytherapy is currently the primary treatment method. However, it is important to precisely define the extent of paracervical tissue invasion to improve cancer diagnosis and treatment options. The fusion of the information characteristics of both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) modalities may be useful in achieving a precise outline of the extent of paracervical tissue invasion. Registration is the initial step in information fusion. However, when aligning multimodal images with varying depths, manual alignment is prone to large errors and is time-consuming. Furthermore, the variations in the size of the Region of Interest (ROI) and the shape of multimodal images pose a significant challenge for achieving accurate registration.In this paper, we propose a preliminary spatial alignment algorithm and a weakly supervised multimodal registration network. The spatial position alignment algorithm efficiently utilizes the limited annotation information in the two modal images provided by the doctor to automatically align multimodal images with varying depths. By utilizing aligned multimodal images for weakly supervised registration and incorporating pyramidal features and cost volume to estimate the optical flow, the results indicate that the proposed method outperforms traditional volume rendering alignment methods and registration networks in various evaluation metrics. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our model in multimodal image registration.

- **Summary**: Leveraging complementary relationships across modalities has recently drawn a lot of attention in multimodal emotion recognition. Most of the existing approaches explored cross-attention to capture the complementary relationships across the modalities. However, the modalities may also exhibit weak complementary relationships, which may deteriorate the cross-attended features, resulting in poor multimodal feature representations. To address this problem, we propose Inconsistency-Aware Cross-Attention (IACA), which can adaptively select the most relevant features on-the-fly based on the strong or weak complementary relationships across audio and visual modalities. Specifically, we design a two-stage gating mechanism that can adaptively select the appropriate relevant features to deal with weak complementary relationships. Extensive experiments are conducted on the challenging Aff-Wild2 dataset to show the robustness of the proposed model.

- **Summary**: Computer vision techniques are on the rise for industrial applications, like process supervision and autonomous agents, e.g., in the healthcare domain and dangerous environments. While the general usability of these techniques is high, there are still challenging real-world use-cases. Especially transparent structures, which can appear in the form of glass doors, protective casings or everyday objects like glasses, pose a challenge for computer vision methods. This paper evaluates the combination of transparent objects in conjunction with (naturally occurring) contamination through environmental effects like hazing. We introduce a novel publicly available dataset containing 489 images incorporating three grades of water droplet contamination on transparent structures and examine the resulting influence on transparency handling. Our findings show, that contaminated transparent objects are easier to segment and that we are able to distinguish between different severity levels of contamination with a current state-of-the art machine-learning model. This in turn opens up the possibility to enhance computer vision systems regarding resilience against, e.g., datashifts through contaminated protection casings or implement an automated cleaning alert.

- **Summary**: Semantic Image Segmentation facilitates a multitude of real-world applications ranging from autonomous driving over industrial process supervision to vision aids for human beings. These models are usually trained in a supervised fashion using example inputs. Distribution Shifts between these examples and the inputs in operation may cause erroneous segmentations. The robustness of semantic segmentation models against distribution shifts caused by differing camera or lighting setups, lens distortions, adversarial inputs and image corruptions has been topic of recent research. However, robustness against spatially varying radial distortion effects that can be caused by uneven glass structures (e.g. windows) or the chaotic refraction in heated air has not been addressed by the research community yet. We propose a method to synthetically augment existing datasets with spatially varying distortions. Our experiments show, that these distortion effects degrade the performance of state-of-the-art segmentation models. Pretraining and enlarged model capacities proof to be suitable strategies for mitigating performance degradation to some degree, while fine-tuning on distorted images only leads to marginal performance improvements.

- **Summary**: Medical anomaly detection is a critical research area aimed at recognizing abnormal images to aid in diagnosis.Most existing methods adopt synthetic anomalies and image restoration on normal samples to detect anomaly. The unlabeled data consisting of both normal and abnormal data is not well explored. We introduce a novel Spatial-aware Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) for one-class semi-supervised generation of health images.Our core insight is the utilization of position encoding and attention to accurately focus on restoring abnormal regions and preserving normal regions. To fully utilize the unlabelled data, SAGAN relaxes the cyclic consistency requirement of the existing unpaired image-to-image conversion methods, and generates high-quality health images corresponding to unlabeled data, guided by the reconstruction of normal images and restoration of pseudo-anomaly images.Subsequently, the discrepancy between the generated healthy image and the original image is utilized as an anomaly score.Extensive experiments on three medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed SAGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing image change captioning (RSICC) aims at generating human-like language to describe the semantic changes between bi-temporal remote sensing image pairs. It provides valuable insights into environmental dynamics and land management. Unlike conventional change captioning task, RSICC involves not only retrieving relevant information across different modalities and generating fluent captions, but also mitigating the impact of pixel-level differences on terrain change localization. The pixel problem due to long time span decreases the accuracy of generated caption. Inspired by the remarkable generative power of diffusion model, we propose a probabilistic diffusion model for RSICC to solve the aforementioned problems. In training process, we construct a noise predictor conditioned on cross modal features to learn the distribution from the real caption distribution to the standard Gaussian distribution under the Markov chain. Meanwhile, a cross-mode fusion and a stacking self-attention module are designed for noise predictor in the reverse process. In testing phase, the well-trained noise predictor helps to estimate the mean value of the distribution and generate change captions step by step. Extensive experiments on the LEVIR-CC dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our Diffusion-RSCC and its individual components. The quantitative results showcase superior performance over existing methods across both traditional and newly augmented metrics. The code and materials will be available online at https://github.com/Fay-Y/Diffusion-RSCC.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel lightweight computational framework for enhancing images under low-light conditions, utilizing advanced machine learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Traditional enhancement techniques often fail to adequately address issues like noise, color distortion, and detail loss in challenging lighting environments. Our approach leverages insights from the Retinex theory and recent advances in image restoration networks to develop a streamlined model that efficiently processes illumination components and integrates context-sensitive enhancements through optimized convolutional blocks. This results in significantly improved image clarity and color fidelity, while avoiding over-enhancement and unnatural color shifts. Crucially, our model is designed to be lightweight, ensuring low computational demand and suitability for real-time applications on standard consumer hardware. Performance evaluations confirm that our model not only surpasses existing methods in enhancing low-light images but also maintains a minimal computational footprint.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present the local patch mesh representation for neural signed distance fields. This technique allows to discretize local regions of the level sets of an input SDF by projecting and deforming flat patch meshes onto the level set surface, using exclusively the SDF information and its gradient. Our analysis reveals this method to be more accurate than the standard marching cubes algorithm for approximating the implicit surface. Then, we apply this representation in the setting of handle-guided deformation: we introduce two distinct pipelines, which make use of 3D neural fields to compute As-Rigid-As-Possible deformations of both high-resolution meshes and neural fields under a given set of constraints. We run a comprehensive evaluation of our method and various baselines for neural field and mesh deformation which show both pipelines achieve impressive efficiency and notable improvements in terms of quality of results and robustness. With our novel pipeline, we introduce a scalable approach to solve a well-established geometry processing problem on high-resolution meshes, and pave the way for extending other geometric tasks to the domain of implicit surfaces via local patch meshing.

- **Summary**: One critical prerequisite for faithful text-to-image generation is the accurate understanding of text inputs. Existing methods leverage the text encoder of the CLIP model to represent input prompts. However, the pre-trained CLIP model can merely encode English with a maximum token length of 77. Moreover, the model capacity of the text encoder from CLIP is relatively limited compared to Large Language Models (LLMs), which offer multilingual input, accommodate longer context, and achieve superior text representation. In this paper, we investigate LLMs as the text encoder to improve the language understanding in text-to-image generation. Unfortunately, training text-to-image generative model with LLMs from scratch demands significant computational resources and data. To this end, we introduce a three-stage training pipeline that effectively and efficiently integrates the existing text-to-image model with LLMs. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter that enables fast training of the text-to-image model using the textual representations from LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model supports not only multilingual but also longer input context with superior image generation quality.

- **Summary**: Image registration is a classical problem in machine vision which seeks methods to align discrete images of the same scene to subpixel accuracy in general situations. As with all estimation problems, the underlying difficulty is the partial information available about the ground truth. We consider a basic and idealized one-dimensional image registration problem motivated by questions about measurement and about quantization, and we demonstrate that the extent to which subinterval/subpixel inferences can be made in this setting depends on a type of complexity associated with the function of interest, the relationship between the function and the pixel size, and the number of distinct sampling count observations available.

- **Summary**: The alarming decline in global biodiversity, driven by various factors, underscores the urgent need for large-scale wildlife monitoring. In response, scientists have turned to automated deep learning methods for data processing in wildlife monitoring. However, applying these advanced methods in real-world scenarios is challenging due to their complexity and the need for specialized knowledge, primarily because of technical challenges and interdisciplinary barriers.   To address these challenges, we introduce Pytorch-Wildlife, an open-source deep learning platform built on PyTorch. It is designed for creating, modifying, and sharing powerful AI models. This platform emphasizes usability and accessibility, making it accessible to individuals with limited or no technical background. It also offers a modular codebase to simplify feature expansion and further development. Pytorch-Wildlife offers an intuitive, user-friendly interface, accessible through local installation or Hugging Face, for animal detection and classification in images and videos. As two real-world applications, Pytorch-Wildlife has been utilized to train animal classification models for species recognition in the Amazon Rainforest and for invasive opossum recognition in the Galapagos Islands. The Opossum model achieves 98% accuracy, and the Amazon model has 92% recognition accuracy for 36 animals in 90% of the data. As Pytorch-Wildlife evolves, we aim to integrate more conservation tasks, addressing various environmental challenges. Pytorch-Wildlife is available at https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps.

- **Summary**: Multispectral pedestrian detection has been shown to be effective in improving performance within complex illumination scenarios. However, prevalent double-stream networks in multispectral detection employ two separate feature extraction branches for multi-modal data, leading to nearly double the inference time compared to single-stream networks utilizing only one feature extraction branch. This increased inference time has hindered the widespread employment of multispectral pedestrian detection in embedded devices for autonomous systems. To address this limitation, various knowledge distillation methods have been proposed. However, traditional distillation methods focus only on the fusion features and ignore the large amount of information in the original multi-modal features, thereby restricting the student network's performance. To tackle the challenge, we introduce the Adaptive Modal Fusion Distillation (AMFD) framework, which can fully utilize the original modal features of the teacher network. Specifically, a Modal Extraction Alignment (MEA) module is utilized to derive learning weights for student networks, integrating focal and global attention mechanisms. This methodology enables the student network to acquire optimal fusion strategies independent from that of teacher network without necessitating an additional feature fusion module. Furthermore, we present the SMOD dataset, a well-aligned challenging multispectral dataset for detection. Extensive experiments on the challenging KAIST, LLVIP and SMOD datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of AMFD. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both reducing log-average Miss Rate and improving mean Average Precision.

- **Summary**: Background: This research aims to improve glioblastoma survival prediction by integrating MR images, clinical and molecular-pathologic data in a transformer-based deep learning model, addressing data heterogeneity and performance generalizability. Method: We propose and evaluate a transformer-based non-linear and non-proportional survival prediction model. The model employs self-supervised learning techniques to effectively encode the high-dimensional MRI input for integration with non-imaging data using cross-attention. To demonstrate model generalizability, the model is assessed with the time-dependent concordance index (Cdt) in two training setups using three independent public test sets: UPenn-GBM, UCSF-PDGM, and RHUH-GBM, each comprising 378, 366, and 36 cases, respectively. Results: The proposed transformer model achieved promising performance for imaging as well as non-imaging data, effectively integrating both modalities for enhanced performance (UPenn-GBM test-set, imaging Cdt 0.645, multimodal Cdt 0.707) while outperforming state-of-the-art late-fusion 3D-CNN-based models. Consistent performance was observed across the three independent multicenter test sets with Cdt values of 0.707 (UPenn-GBM, internal test set), 0.672 (UCSF-PDGM, first external test set) and 0.618 (RHUH-GBM, second external test set). The model achieved significant discrimination between patients with favorable and unfavorable survival for all three datasets (logrank p 1.9\times{10}^{-8}, 9.7\times{10}^{-3}, and 1.2\times{10}^{-2}). Conclusions: The proposed transformer-based survival prediction model integrates complementary information from diverse input modalities, contributing to improved glioblastoma survival prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods. Consistent performance was observed across institutions supporting model generalizability.

- **Summary**: Current face reenactment and swapping methods mainly rely on GAN frameworks, but recent focus has shifted to pre-trained diffusion models for their superior generation capabilities. However, training these models is resource-intensive, and the results have not yet achieved satisfactory performance levels. To address this issue, we introduce Face-Adapter, an efficient and effective adapter designed for high-precision and high-fidelity face editing for pre-trained diffusion models. We observe that both face reenactment/swapping tasks essentially involve combinations of target structure, ID and attribute. We aim to sufficiently decouple the control of these factors to achieve both tasks in one model. Specifically, our method contains: 1) A Spatial Condition Generator that provides precise landmarks and background; 2) A Plug-and-play Identity Encoder that transfers face embeddings to the text space by a transformer decoder. 3) An Attribute Controller that integrates spatial conditions and detailed attributes. Face-Adapter achieves comparable or even superior performance in terms of motion control precision, ID retention capability, and generation quality compared to fully fine-tuned face reenactment/swapping models. Additionally, Face-Adapter seamlessly integrates with various StableDiffusion models.

- **Summary**: Biomedical image analysis is fundamental for biomedical discovery in cell biology, pathology, radiology, and many other biomedical domains. Holistic image analysis comprises interdependent subtasks such as segmentation, detection, and recognition of relevant objects. Here, we propose BiomedParse, a biomedical foundation model for imaging parsing that can jointly conduct segmentation, detection, and recognition for 82 object types across 9 imaging modalities. Through joint learning, we can improve accuracy for individual tasks and enable novel applications such as segmenting all relevant objects in an image through a text prompt, rather than requiring users to laboriously specify the bounding box for each object. We leveraged readily available natural-language labels or descriptions accompanying those datasets and use GPT-4 to harmonize the noisy, unstructured text information with established biomedical object ontologies. We created a large dataset comprising over six million triples of image, segmentation mask, and textual description. On image segmentation, we showed that BiomedParse is broadly applicable, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on 102,855 test image-mask-label triples across 9 imaging modalities (everything). On object detection, which aims to locate a specific object of interest, BiomedParse again attained state-of-the-art performance, especially on objects with irregular shapes (everywhere). On object recognition, which aims to identify all objects in a given image along with their semantic types, we showed that BiomedParse can simultaneously segment and label all biomedical objects in an image (all at once). In summary, BiomedParse is an all-in-one tool for biomedical image analysis by jointly solving segmentation, detection, and recognition for all major biomedical image modalities, paving the path for efficient and accurate image-based biomedical discovery.

- **Summary**: We present personalized residuals and localized attention-guided sampling for efficient concept-driven generation using text-to-image diffusion models. Our method first represents concepts by freezing the weights of a pretrained text-conditioned diffusion model and learning low-rank residuals for a small subset of the model's layers. The residual-based approach then directly enables application of our proposed sampling technique, which applies the learned residuals only in areas where the concept is localized via cross-attention and applies the original diffusion weights in all other regions. Localized sampling therefore combines the learned identity of the concept with the existing generative prior of the underlying diffusion model. We show that personalized residuals effectively capture the identity of a concept in ~3 minutes on a single GPU without the use of regularization images and with fewer parameters than previous models, and localized sampling allows using the original model as strong prior for large parts of the image.

- **Summary**: The image matching field has been witnessing a continuous emergence of novel learnable feature matching techniques, with ever-improving performance on conventional benchmarks. However, our investigation shows that despite these gains, their potential for real-world applications is restricted by their limited generalization capabilities to novel image domains. In this paper, we introduce OmniGlue, the first learnable image matcher that is designed with generalization as a core principle. OmniGlue leverages broad knowledge from a vision foundation model to guide the feature matching process, boosting generalization to domains not seen at training time. Additionally, we propose a novel keypoint position-guided attention mechanism which disentangles spatial and appearance information, leading to enhanced matching descriptors. We perform comprehensive experiments on a suite of $7$ datasets with varied image domains, including scene-level, object-centric and aerial images. OmniGlue's novel components lead to relative gains on unseen domains of $20.9\%$ with respect to a directly comparable reference model, while also outperforming the recent LightGlue method by $9.5\%$ relatively.Code and model can be found at https://hwjiang1510.github.io/OmniGlue

- **Summary**: The objective of image captioning models is to bridge the gap between the visual and linguistic modalities by generating natural language descriptions that accurately reflect the content of input images. In recent years, researchers have leveraged deep learning-based models and made advances in the extraction of visual features and the design of multimodal connections to tackle this task. This work presents a novel approach towards developing image captioning models that utilize an external kNN memory to improve the generation process. Specifically, we propose two model variants that incorporate a knowledge retriever component that is based on visual similarities, a differentiable encoder to represent input images, and a kNN-augmented language model to predict tokens based on contextual cues and text retrieved from the external memory. We experimentally validate our approach on COCO and nocaps datasets and demonstrate that incorporating an explicit external memory can significantly enhance the quality of captions, especially with a larger retrieval corpus. This work provides valuable insights into retrieval-augmented captioning models and opens up new avenues for improving image captioning at a larger scale.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In this study, we address the limitations inherent in most existing vehicle trajectory prediction methodologies that indiscriminately incorporate all agents within a predetermined proximity when accounting for inter-agent interactions. These approaches commonly employ attention-based architecture or graph neural networks for encoding interactions, which introduces three challenges: (i) The indiscriminate selection of all nearby agents substantially escalates the computational demands of the model, particularly in those interaction-rich scenarios. (ii) Moreover, the simplistic feature extraction of current time agents falls short of adequately capturing the nuanced dynamics of interactions. (iii) Compounded by the inherently low interpretability of attention mechanism and graph neural networks, there is a propensity for the model to allocate unreliable correlation coefficients to certain agents, adversely impacting the accuracy of trajectory predictions. To mitigate these issues, we introduce ASPILin, a novel approach that enhances the selection of interacting agents by considering their current and future lanes, extending this consideration across all historical frames. Utilizing the states of the agents, we estimate the nearest future distance between agents and the time needed to reach this distance. Then, combine these with their current distances to derive a physical correlation coefficient to encode interactions. Experiments conducted on popular trajectory prediction datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In the field of deep point cloud understanding, KPConv is a unique architecture that uses kernel points to locate convolutional weights in space, instead of relying on Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) encodings. While it initially achieved success, it has since been surpassed by recent MLP networks that employ updated designs and training strategies. Building upon the kernel point principle, we present two novel designs: KPConvD (depthwise KPConv), a lighter design that enables the use of deeper architectures, and KPConvX, an innovative design that scales the depthwise convolutional weights of KPConvD with kernel attention values. Using KPConvX with a modern architecture and training strategy, we are able to outperform current state-of-the-art approaches on the ScanObjectNN, Scannetv2, and S3DIS datasets. We validate our design choices through ablation studies and release our code and models.

- **Summary**: We extend multimodal transformers to include 3D camera motion as a conditioning signal for the task of video generation. Generative video models are becoming increasingly powerful, thus focusing research efforts on methods of controlling the output of such models. We propose to add virtual 3D camera controls to generative video methods by conditioning generated video on an encoding of three-dimensional camera movement over the course of the generated video. Results demonstrate that we are (1) able to successfully control the camera during video generation, starting from a single frame and a camera signal, and (2) we demonstrate the accuracy of the generated 3D camera paths using traditional computer vision methods.

- **Summary**: The recognition of sea ice is of great significance for reflecting climate change and ensuring the safety of ship navigation. Recently, many deep learning based methods have been proposed and applied to segment and recognize sea ice regions. However, the diverse scales of sea ice areas, the zigzag and fine edge contours, and the difficulty in distinguishing different types of sea ice pose challenges to existing sea ice recognition models. In this paper, a Global-Local Detail Guided Transformer (GDGT) method is proposed for sea ice recognition in optical remote sensing images. In GDGT, a global-local feature fusiont mechanism is designed to fuse global structural correlation features and local spatial detail features. Furthermore, a detail-guided decoder is developed to retain more high-resolution detail information during feature reconstruction for improving the performance of sea ice recognition. Experiments on the produced sea ice dataset demonstrated the effectiveness and advancement of GDGT.

- **Summary**: The emergence of tau PET imaging over the last decade has enabled Alzheimer's disease (AD) researchers to examine tau pathology in vivo and more effectively characterize the disease trajectories of AD. Current tau PET analysis methods, however, typically perform inferences on large cortical ROIs and are limited in the detection of localized tau pathology that varies across subjects. Furthermore, a high-resolution MRI is required to carry out conventional tau PET analysis, which is not commonly acquired in clinical practices and may not be acquired for many elderly patients with dementia due to strong motion artifacts, claustrophobia, or certain metal implants. In this work, we propose a novel conditional diffusion model to perform MRI-free anomaly detection from tau PET imaging data. By including individualized conditions and two complementary loss maps from pseudo-healthy and pseudo-unhealthy reconstructions, our model computes an anomaly map across the entire brain area that allows simply training a support vector machine (SVM) for classifying disease severity. We train our model on ADNI subjects (n=534) and evaluate its performance on a separate dataset from the preclinical subjects of the A4 clinical trial (n=447). We demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline generative models and the conventional Z-score-based method in anomaly localization without mis-detecting off-target bindings in sub-cortical and out-of-brain areas. By classifying the A4 subjects according to their anomaly map using the SVM trained on ADNI data, we show that our method can successfully group preclinical subjects with significantly different cognitive functions, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in capturing biologically relevant anomaly in tau PET imaging.

- **Summary**: The 3D object detection capabilities in urban environments have been enormously improved by recent developments in Light Detection and Range (LiDAR) technology. This paper presents a novel framework that transforms the detection and analysis of 3D objects in traffic scenarios by utilizing the power of elevated LiDAR sensors. We are presenting our methodology's remarkable capacity to collect complex 3D point cloud data, which allows us to accurately and in detail capture the dynamics of urban traffic. Due to the limitation in obtaining real-world traffic datasets, we utilize the simulator to generate 3D point cloud for specific scenarios. To support our experimental analysis, we firstly simulate various 3D point cloud traffic-related objects. Then, we use this dataset as a basis for training and evaluating our 3D object detection models, in identifying and monitoring both vehicles and pedestrians in simulated urban traffic environments. Next, we fine tune the Point Voxel-Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (PV-RCNN) architecture, making it more suited to handle and understand the massive volumes of point cloud data generated by our urban traffic simulations. Our results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution in accurately detecting objects in traffic scenes and highlight the role of LiDAR in improving urban safety and advancing intelligent transportation systems.

- **Summary**: In this work, we focus on a special group of human body language -- the micro-gesture (MG), which differs from the range of ordinary illustrative gestures in that they are not intentional behaviors performed to convey information to others, but rather unintentional behaviors driven by inner feelings. This characteristic introduces two novel challenges regarding micro-gestures that are worth rethinking. The first is whether strategies designed for other action recognition are entirely applicable to micro-gestures. The second is whether micro-gestures, as supplementary data, can provide additional insights for emotional understanding. In recognizing micro-gestures, we explored various augmentation strategies that take into account the subtle spatial and brief temporal characteristics of micro-gestures, often accompanied by repetitiveness, to determine more suitable augmentation methods. Considering the significance of temporal domain information for micro-gestures, we introduce a simple and efficient plug-and-play spatiotemporal balancing fusion method. We not only studied our method on the considered micro-gesture dataset but also conducted experiments on mainstream action datasets. The results show that our approach performs well in micro-gesture recognition and on other datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to previous micro-gesture recognition methods. For emotional understanding based on micro-gestures, we construct complex emotional reasoning scenarios. Our evaluation, conducted with large language models, shows that micro-gestures play a significant and positive role in enhancing comprehensive emotional understanding. The scenarios we developed can be extended to other micro-gesture-based tasks such as deception detection and interviews. We confirm that our new insights contribute to advancing research in micro-gesture and emotional artificial intelligence.

- **Summary**: Nearly every recent image synthesis approach, including diffusion, masked-token prediction, and next-token prediction, uses a Transformer network architecture. Despite this common backbone, there has been no direct, compute controlled comparison of how these approaches affect performance and efficiency. We analyze the scalability of each approach through the lens of compute budget measured in FLOPs. We find that token prediction methods, led by next-token prediction, significantly outperform diffusion on prompt following. On image quality, while next-token prediction initially performs better, scaling trends suggest it is eventually matched by diffusion. We compare the inference compute efficiency of each approach and find that next token prediction is by far the most efficient. Based on our findings we recommend diffusion for applications targeting image quality and low latency; and next-token prediction when prompt following or throughput is more important.

- **Summary**: The extreme popularity over the years for railway transportation urges the necessity to maintain efficient railway management systems around the globe. Even though, at present, there exist a large collection of Computer Aided Designed Railway Technical Maps (RTMs) but available only in the portable document format (PDF). Using Deep Learning and Optical Character Recognition techniques, this research work proposes a generic system to digitize the relevant map component data from a given input image and create a formatted text file per image. Out of YOLOv3, SSD and Faster-RCNN object detection models used, Faster-RCNN yields the highest mean Average Precision (mAP) and the highest F1 score values 0.68 and 0.76 respectively. Further it is proven from the results obtained that, one can improve the results with OCR when the text containing image is being sent through a sophisticated pre-processing pipeline to remove distortions.

- **Summary**: Accurately localizing two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound (US) fetal brain images in the 3D brain, using minimal computational resources, is an important task for automated US analysis of fetal growth and development. We propose an uncertainty-aware deep learning model for automated 3D plane localization in 2D fetal brain images. Specifically, a multi-head network is trained to jointly regress 3D plane pose from 2D images in terms of different geometric transformations. The model explicitly learns to predict uncertainty to allocate higher weight to inputs with low variances across different transformations to improve performance. Our proposed method, QAERTS, demonstrates superior pose estimation accuracy than the state-of-the-art and most of the uncertainty-based approaches, leading to 9% improvement on plane angle (PA) for localization accuracy, and 8% on normalized cross-correlation (NCC) for sampled image quality. QAERTS also demonstrates efficiency, containing 5$\times$ fewer parameters than ensemble-based approach, making it advantageous in resource-constrained settings. In addition, QAERTS proves to be more robust to noise effects observed in freehand US scanning by leveraging rotational discontinuities and explicit output uncertainties.

- **Summary**: Accurate characterization of suspicious microcalcifications is critical to determine whether these calcifications are associated with invasive disease. Our overarching objective is to enable the joint characterization of microcalcifications and surrounding breast tissue using mammography images and digital histopathology images. Towards this goal, we investigate a template matching-based approach that utilizes microcalcifications as landmarks to match radiographs taken of biopsy core specimens to groups of calcifications that are visible on mammography. Our approach achieved a high negative predictive value (0.98) but modest precision (0.66) and recall (0.58) in identifying the mammographic region where microcalcifications were taken during a core needle biopsy.
