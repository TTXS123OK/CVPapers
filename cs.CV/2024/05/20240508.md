- **Summary**: HiRISE (High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) is a camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance orbiter responsible for photographing vast areas of the Martian surface in unprecedented detail. It can capture millions of incredible closeup images in minutes. However, Mars suffers from frequent regional and local dust storms hampering this data-collection process, and pipeline, resulting in loss of effort and crucial flight time. Removing these images manually requires a large amount of manpower. I filter out these images obstructed by atmospheric dust automatically by using a Dust Image Classifier fine-tuned on Resnet-50 with an accuracy of 94.05%. To further facilitate the seamless filtering of Images I design a prediction pipeline that classifies and stores these dusty patches. I also denoise partially obstructed images using an Auto Encoder-based denoiser and Pix2Pix GAN with 0.75 and 0.99 SSIM Index respectively.

- **Summary**: In Re-identification (ReID), recent advancements yield noteworthy progress in both unimodal and cross-modal retrieval tasks. However, the challenge persists in developing a unified framework that could effectively handle varying multimodal data, including RGB, infrared, sketches, and textual information. Additionally, the emergence of large-scale models shows promising performance in various vision tasks but the foundation model in ReID is still blank. In response to these challenges, a novel multimodal learning paradigm for ReID is introduced, referred to as All-in-One (AIO), which harnesses a frozen pre-trained big model as an encoder, enabling effective multimodal retrieval without additional fine-tuning. The diverse multimodal data in AIO are seamlessly tokenized into a unified space, allowing the modality-shared frozen encoder to extract identity-consistent features comprehensively across all modalities. Furthermore, a meticulously crafted ensemble of cross-modality heads is designed to guide the learning trajectory. AIO is the \textbf{first} framework to perform all-in-one ReID, encompassing four commonly used modalities. Experiments on cross-modal and multimodal ReID reveal that AIO not only adeptly handles various modal data but also excels in challenging contexts, showcasing exceptional performance in zero-shot and domain generalization scenarios.

- **Summary**: In today's interconnected world, achieving reliable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection poses a significant challenge for machine learning models. While numerous studies have introduced improved approaches for multi-class OOD detection tasks, the investigation into multi-label OOD detection tasks has been notably limited. We introduce Spectral Normalized Joint Energy (SNoJoE), a method that consolidates label-specific information across multiple labels through the theoretically justified concept of an energy-based function. Throughout the training process, we employ spectral normalization to manage the model's feature space, thereby enhancing model efficacy and generalization, in addition to bolstering robustness. Our findings indicate that the application of spectral normalization to joint energy scores notably amplifies the model's capability for OOD detection. We perform OOD detection experiments utilizing PASCAL-VOC as the in-distribution dataset and ImageNet-22K or Texture as the out-of-distribution datasets. Our experimental results reveal that, in comparison to prior top performances, SNoJoE achieves 11% and 54% relative reductions in FPR95 on the respective OOD datasets, thereby defining the new state of the art in this field of study.

- **Summary**: To build a cross-modal latent space between 3D human motion and language, acquiring large-scale and high-quality human motion data is crucial. However, unlike the abundance of image data, the scarcity of motion data has limited the performance of existing motion-language models. To counter this, we introduce "motion patches", a new representation of motion sequences, and propose using Vision Transformers (ViT) as motion encoders via transfer learning, aiming to extract useful knowledge from the image domain and apply it to the motion domain. These motion patches, created by dividing and sorting skeleton joints based on body parts in motion sequences, are robust to varying skeleton structures, and can be regarded as color image patches in ViT. We find that transfer learning with pre-trained weights of ViT obtained through training with 2D image data can boost the performance of motion analysis, presenting a promising direction for addressing the issue of limited motion data. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed motion patches, used jointly with ViT, achieve state-of-the-art performance in the benchmarks of text-to-motion retrieval, and other novel challenging tasks, such as cross-skeleton recognition, zero-shot motion classification, and human interaction recognition, which are currently impeded by the lack of data.



### Teacher-Student Network for Real-World Face Super-Resolution with Progressive Embedding of Edge Information

- **Summary**: Traditional face super-resolution (FSR) methods trained on synthetic datasets usually have poor generalization ability for real-world face images. Recent work has utilized complex degradation models or training networks to simulate the real degradation process, but this limits the performance of these methods due to the domain differences that still exist between the generated low-resolution images and the real low-resolution images. Moreover, because of the existence of a domain gap, the semantic feature information of the target domain may be affected when synthetic data and real data are utilized to train super-resolution models simultaneously. In this study, a real-world face super-resolution teacher-student model is proposed, which considers the domain gap between real and synthetic data and progressively includes diverse edge information by using the recurrent network's intermediate outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in obtaining high-quality face images for real-world FSR.



### Dual-Image Enhanced CLIP for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection

- **Summary**: Image Anomaly Detection has been a challenging task in Computer Vision field. The advent of Vision-Language models, particularly the rise of CLIP-based frameworks, has opened new avenues for zero-shot anomaly detection. Recent studies have explored the use of CLIP by aligning images with normal and prompt descriptions. However, the exclusive dependence on textual guidance often falls short, highlighting the critical importance of additional visual references. In this work, we introduce a Dual-Image Enhanced CLIP approach, leveraging a joint vision-language scoring system. Our methods process pairs of images, utilizing each as a visual reference for the other, thereby enriching the inference process with visual context. This dual-image strategy markedly enhanced both anomaly classification and localization performances. Furthermore, we have strengthened our model with a test-time adaptation module that incorporates synthesized anomalies to refine localization capabilities. Our approach significantly exploits the potential of vision-language joint anomaly detection and demonstrates comparable performance with current SOTA methods across various datasets.



### DiffMatch: Visual-Language Guidance Makes Better Semi-supervised Change Detector

- **Summary**: Change Detection (CD) aims to identify pixels with semantic changes between images. However, annotating massive numbers of pixel-level images is labor-intensive and costly, especially for multi-temporal images, which require pixel-wise comparisons by human experts. Considering the excellent performance of visual language models (VLMs) for zero-shot, open-vocabulary, etc. with prompt-based reasoning, it is promising to utilize VLMs to make better CD under limited labeled data. In this paper, we propose a VLM guidance-based semi-supervised CD method, namely DiffMatch. The insight of DiffMatch is to synthesize free change labels using VLMs to provide additional supervision signals for unlabeled data. However, almost all current VLMs are designed for single-temporal images and cannot be directly applied to bi- or multi-temporal images. Motivated by this, we first propose a VLM-based mixed change event generation (CEG) strategy to yield pseudo labels for unlabeled CD data. Since the additional supervised signals provided by these VLM-driven pseudo labels may conflict with the pseudo labels from the consistency regularization paradigm (e.g. FixMatch), we propose the dual projection head for de-entangling different signal sources. Further, we explicitly decouple the bi-temporal images semantic representation through two auxiliary segmentation decoders, which are also guided by VLM. Finally, to make the model more adequately capture change representations, we introduce metric-aware supervision by feature-level contrastive loss in auxiliary branches. Extensive experiments show the advantage of DiffMatch. For instance, DiffMatch improves the FixMatch baseline by +5.3 IoU on WHU-CD and by +2.4 IoU on LEVIR-CD with 5% labels. In addition, our CEG strategy, in an un-supervised manner, can achieve performance far superior to state-of-the-art un-supervised CD methods.

- **Summary**: Satellite imagery has played an increasingly important role in post-disaster building damage assessment. Unfortunately, current methods still rely on manual visual interpretation, which is often time-consuming and can cause very low accuracy. To address the limitations of manual interpretation, there has been a significant increase in efforts to automate the process. We present a solution that performs the two most important tasks in building damage assessment, segmentation and classification, through deep-learning models. We show our results submitted as part of the xView2 Challenge, a competition to design better models for identifying buildings and their damage level after exposure to multiple kinds of natural disasters. Our best model couples a building identification semantic segmentation convolutional neural network (CNN) to a building damage classification CNN, with a combined F1 score of 0.66, surpassing the xView2 challenge baseline F1 score of 0.28. We find that though our model was able to identify buildings with relatively high accuracy, building damage classification across various disaster types is a difficult task due to the visual similarity between different damage levels and different damage distribution between disaster types, highlighting the fact that it may be important to have a probabilistic prior estimate regarding disaster damage in order to obtain accurate predictions.

- **Summary**: Transformers models have become the backbone of the current state-of-the-art models in language, vision, and multimodal domains. These models, at their core, utilize multi-head self-attention to selectively aggregate context, generating dynamic contextual embeddings and modeling long-range dependencies for a clear contextual understanding. Lixi et al. \cite{zhou2022serving} proposed a method to use relational databases for deploying large-scale deep learning models and created an open-source implementation called NetsDB for the same. We build upon the previous work of these authors by creating an end-to-end implementation of the Encoder part of the transformer for model serving in NetsDB. Specifically, we construct a two-block encoder that includes Multi-Head Attention and its accompanying self-attention mechanism, Layer-Norm, Dropout, FeedForward Layers, and the necessary residual connections. We load out weights from our model for distributed processing, deployment, and efficient inferencing. To prove the efficacy of our implementation, we conduct a comprehensive performance analysis by comparing it with existing implementations in PyTorch, Tensorflow, Flax, and MxNet across key metrics such as inference time and model size.

- **Summary**: In the realm of robotics, the quest for achieving real-world autonomy, capable of executing large-scale and long-term operations, has positioned place recognition (PR) as a cornerstone technology. Despite the PR community's remarkable strides over the past two decades, garnering attention from fields like computer vision and robotics, the development of PR methods that sufficiently support real-world robotic systems remains a challenge. This paper aims to bridge this gap by highlighting the crucial role of PR within the framework of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) 2.0. This new phase in robotic navigation calls for scalable, adaptable, and efficient PR solutions by integrating advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. For this goal, we provide a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) advancements in PR, alongside the remaining challenges, and underscore its broad applications in robotics.   This paper begins with an exploration of PR's formulation and key research challenges. We extensively review literature, focusing on related methods on place representation and solutions to various PR challenges. Applications showcasing PR's potential in robotics, key PR datasets, and open-source libraries are discussed. We also emphasizes our open-source package, aimed at new development and benchmark for general PR. We conclude with a discussion on PR's future directions, accompanied by a summary of the literature covered and access to our open-source library, available to the robotics community at: https://github.com/MetaSLAM/GPRS.

- **Summary**: The PD-L1 rate, the number of PD-L1 positive tumor cells over the total number of all tumor cells, is an important metric for immunotherapy. This metric is recorded as diagnostic information with pathological images. In this paper, we propose a proportion estimation method with a small amount of cell-level annotation and proportion annotation, which can be easily collected. Since the PD-L1 rate is calculated from only `tumor cells' and not using `non-tumor cells', we first detect tumor cells with a detection model. Then, we estimate the PD-L1 proportion by introducing a masking technique to `learning from label proportion.' In addition, we propose a weighted focal proportion loss to address data imbalance problems. Experiments using clinical data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our method achieved the best performance in comparisons.

- **Summary**: Controllable text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models generate images conditioned on both text prompts and semantic inputs of other modalities like edge maps. Nevertheless, current controllable T2I methods commonly face challenges related to efficiency and faithfulness, especially when conditioning on multiple inputs from either the same or diverse modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel Flexible and Efficient method, FlexEControl, for controllable T2I generation. At the core of FlexEControl is a unique weight decomposition strategy, which allows for streamlined integration of various input types. This approach not only enhances the faithfulness of the generated image to the control, but also significantly reduces the computational overhead typically associated with multimodal conditioning. Our approach achieves a reduction of 41% in trainable parameters and 30% in memory usage compared with Uni-ControlNet. Moreover, it doubles data efficiency and can flexibly generate images under the guidance of multiple input conditions of various modalities.

- **Comment**: Accepted as ICML2024 main conference paper
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Rooting in the scarcity of most attributes, realistic pedestrian attribute datasets exhibit unduly skewed data distribution, from which two types of model failures are delivered: (1) label imbalance: model predictions lean greatly towards the side of majority labels; (2) semantics imbalance: model is easily overfitted on the under-represented attributes due to their insufficient semantic diversity. To render perfect label balancing, we propose a novel framework that successfully decouples label-balanced data re-sampling from the curse of attributes co-occurrence, i.e., we equalize the sampling prior of an attribute while not biasing that of the co-occurred others. To diversify the attributes semantics and mitigate the feature noise, we propose a Bayesian feature augmentation method to introduce true in-distribution novelty. Handling both imbalances jointly, our work achieves best accuracy on various popular benchmarks, and importantly, with minimal computational budget.

- **Summary**: The increasing demand for computational photography and imaging on mobile platforms has led to the widespread development and integration of advanced image sensors with novel algorithms in camera systems. However, the scarcity of high-quality data for research and the rare opportunity for in-depth exchange of views from industry and academia constrain the development of mobile intelligent photography and imaging (MIPI). Building on the achievements of the previous MIPI Workshops held at ECCV 2022 and CVPR 2023, we introduce our third MIPI challenge including three tracks focusing on novel image sensors and imaging algorithms. In this paper, we summarize and review the Nighttime Flare Removal track on MIPI 2024. In total, 170 participants were successfully registered, and 14 teams submitted results in the final testing phase. The developed solutions in this challenge achieved state-of-the-art performance on Nighttime Flare Removal. More details of this challenge and the link to the dataset can be found at https://mipi-challenge.org/MIPI2024/.

- **Summary**: Unified multi-model representation spaces are the foundation of multimodal understanding and generation. However, the billions of model parameters and catastrophic forgetting problems make it challenging to further enhance pre-trained unified spaces. In this work, we propose Molecule-Space, an idea that treats multimodal representation spaces as "molecules", and augments pre-trained unified space by integrating knowledge from extra expert spaces via "molecules space reactions". Specifically, we introduce two kinds of basic space reactions: 1) Space Displacement Reaction and 2) Space Combination Reaction. Based on these defined basic reactions, we design Complex Sequential & Parallel Reactions to effectively integrate multiple spaces simultaneously. Benefiting from the modularization concept, we further propose a coarse-to-fine customized inference strategy to flexibly adjust the enhanced unified space for different purposes. Experimentally, we fuse the audio-image-text space of ImageBind with the image-text and audio-text expert spaces. The resulting space outperforms ImageBind on 5 downstream tasks across 9 datasets. Moreover, via customized inference, it even surpasses the used image-text and audio-text expert spaces.

- **Summary**: The search for refining 3D LiDAR data has attracted growing interest motivated by recent techniques such as supervised learning or generative model-based methods. Existing approaches have shown the possibilities for using diffusion models to generate refined LiDAR data with high fidelity, although the performance and speed of such methods have been limited. These limitations make it difficult to execute in real-time, causing the approaches to struggle in real-world tasks such as autonomous navigation and human-robot interaction. In this work, we introduce a novel approach based on conditional diffusion models for fast and high-quality sparse-to-dense upsampling of 3D scene point clouds through an image representation. Our method employs denoising diffusion probabilistic models trained with conditional inpainting masks, which have been shown to give high performance on image completion tasks. We introduce a series of experiments, including multiple datasets, sampling steps, and conditional masks, to determine the ideal configuration, striking a balance between performance and inference speed. This paper illustrates that our method outperforms the baselines in sampling speed and quality on upsampling tasks using the KITTI-360 dataset. Furthermore, we illustrate the generalization ability of our approach by simultaneously training on real-world and synthetic datasets, introducing variance in quality and environments.

- **Summary**: For autonomous robotics applications, it is crucial that robots are able to accurately measure their potential state and perceive their environment, including other agents within it (e.g., cobots interacting with humans). The redundancy of these measurements is important, as it allows for planning and execution of recovery protocols in the event of sensor failure or external disturbances. Visual estimation can provide this redundancy through the use of low-cost sensors and server as a standalone source of proprioception when no encoder-based sensing is available. Therefore, we estimate the configuration of the robot jointly with its pose, which provides a complete spatial understanding of the observed robot. We present GISR - a method for deep configuration and robot-to-camera pose estimation that prioritizes real-time execution. GISR is comprised of two modules: (i) a geometric initialization module, efficiently computing an approximate robot pose and configuration, and (ii) an iterative silhouette-based refinement module that refines the initial solution in only a few iterations. We evaluate our method on a publicly available dataset and show that GISR performs competitively with existing state-of-the-art approaches, while being significantly faster compared to existing methods of the same class. Our code is available at https://github.com/iwhitey/GISR-robot.

- **Summary**: Emotion recognition is an important part of affective computing. Extracting emotional cues from human gaits yields benefits such as natural interaction, a nonintrusive nature, and remote detection. Recently, the introduction of self-supervised learning techniques offers a practical solution to the issues arising from the scarcity of labeled data in the field of gait-based emotion recognition. However, due to the limited diversity of gaits and the incompleteness of feature representations for skeletons, the existing contrastive learning methods are usually inefficient for the acquisition of gait emotions. In this paper, we propose a contrastive learning framework utilizing selective strong augmentation (SSA) for self-supervised gait-based emotion representation, which aims to derive effective representations from limited labeled gait data. First, we propose an SSA method for the gait emotion recognition task, which includes upper body jitter and random spatiotemporal mask. The goal of SSA is to generate more diverse and targeted positive samples and prompt the model to learn more distinctive and robust feature representations. Then, we design a complementary feature fusion network (CFFN) that facilitates the integration of cross-domain information to acquire topological structural and global adaptive features. Finally, we implement the distributional divergence minimization loss to supervise the representation learning of the generally and strongly augmented queries. Our approach is validated on the Emotion-Gait (E-Gait) and Emilya datasets and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under different evaluation protocols.

- **Summary**: Medical Image Synthesis (MIS) plays an important role in the intelligent medical field, which greatly saves the economic and time costs of medical diagnosis. However, due to the complexity of medical images and similar characteristics of different tissue cells, existing methods face great challenges in meeting their biological consistency. To this end, we propose the Hybrid Augmented Generative Adversarial Network (HAGAN) to maintain the authenticity of structural texture and tissue cells. HAGAN contains Attention Mixed (AttnMix) Generator, Hierarchical Discriminator and Reverse Skip Connection between Discriminator and Generator. The AttnMix consistency differentiable regularization encourages the perception in structural and textural variations between real and fake images, which improves the pathological integrity of synthetic images and the accuracy of features in local areas. The Hierarchical Discriminator introduces pixel-by-pixel discriminant feedback to generator for enhancing the saliency and discriminance of global and local details simultaneously. The Reverse Skip Connection further improves the accuracy for fine details by fusing real and synthetic distribution features. Our experimental evaluations on three datasets of different scales, i.e., COVID-CT, ACDC and BraTS2018, demonstrate that HAGAN outperforms the existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both high-resolution and low-resolution.

- **Summary**: Predicting the future trajectories of dynamic traffic actors is a cornerstone task in autonomous driving. Though existing notable efforts have resulted in impressive performance improvements, a gap persists in scene cognitive and understanding of the complex traffic semantics. This paper proposes Traj-LLM, the first to investigate the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) without explicit prompt engineering to generate future motion from agents' past/observed trajectories and scene semantics. Traj-LLM starts with sparse context joint coding to dissect the agent and scene features into a form that LLMs understand. On this basis, we innovatively explore LLMs' powerful comprehension abilities to capture a spectrum of high-level scene knowledge and interactive information. Emulating the human-like lane focus cognitive function and enhancing Traj-LLM's scene comprehension, we introduce lane-aware probabilistic learning powered by the pioneering Mamba module. Finally, a multi-modal Laplace decoder is designed to achieve scene-compliant multi-modal predictions. Extensive experiments manifest that Traj-LLM, fortified by LLMs' strong prior knowledge and understanding prowess, together with lane-aware probability learning, outstrips state-of-the-art methods across evaluation metrics. Moreover, the few-shot analysis further substantiates Traj-LLM's performance, wherein with just 50% of the dataset, it outperforms the majority of benchmarks relying on complete data utilization. This study explores equipping the trajectory prediction task with advanced capabilities inherent in LLMs, furnishing a more universal and adaptable solution for forecasting agent motion in a new way.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) aims at learning a semantic segmentation model with only image-level tags. Despite intensive research on deep learning approaches over a decade, there is still a significant performance gap between WSSS and full semantic segmentation. Most current WSSS methods always focus on a limited single image (pixel-wise) information while ignoring the valuable inter-image (semantic-wise) information. From this perspective, a novel end-to-end WSSS framework called DSCNet is developed along with two innovations: i) pixel-wise group contrast and semantic-wise graph contrast are proposed and introduced into the WSSS framework; ii) a novel dual-stream contrastive learning (DSCL) mechanism is designed to jointly handle pixel-wise and semantic-wise context information for better WSSS performance. Specifically, the pixel-wise group contrast learning (PGCL) and semantic-wise graph contrast learning (SGCL) tasks form a more comprehensive solution. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks verify the superiority of DSCNet over SOTA approaches and baseline models.

- **Summary**: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to acquire knowledge from novel classes with limited samples while retaining information about base classes. Existing methods address catastrophic forgetting and overfitting by freezing the feature extractor during novel-class learning. However, these methods usually tend to cause the confusion between base and novel classes, i.e., classifying novel-class samples into base classes. In this paper, we delve into this phenomenon to study its cause and solution. We first interpret the confusion as the collision between the novel-class and the base-class region in the feature space. Then, we find the collision is caused by the label-irrelevant redundancies within the base-class feature and pixel space. Through qualitative and quantitative experiments, we identify this redundancy as the shortcut in the base-class training, which can be decoupled to alleviate the collision. Based on this analysis, to alleviate the collision between base and novel classes, we propose a method for FSCIL named Redundancy Decoupling and Integration (RDI). RDI first decouples redundancies from base-class space to shrink the intra-base-class feature space. Then, it integrates the redundancies as a dummy class to enlarge the inter-base-class feature space. This process effectively compresses the base-class feature space, creating buffer space for novel classes and alleviating the model's confusion between the base and novel classes. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-100, miniImageNet, and CUB-200-2011 demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image person re-identification (ReID) retrieves pedestrian images according to textual descriptions. Manually annotating textual descriptions is time-consuming, restricting the scale of existing datasets and therefore the generalization ability of ReID models. As a result, we study the transferable text-to-image ReID problem, where we train a model on our proposed large-scale database and directly deploy it to various datasets for evaluation. We obtain substantial training data via Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Moreover, we identify and address two key challenges in utilizing the obtained textual descriptions. First, an MLLM tends to generate descriptions with similar structures, causing the model to overfit specific sentence patterns. Thus, we propose a novel method that uses MLLMs to caption images according to various templates. These templates are obtained using a multi-turn dialogue with a Large Language Model (LLM). Therefore, we can build a large-scale dataset with diverse textual descriptions. Second, an MLLM may produce incorrect descriptions. Hence, we introduce a novel method that automatically identifies words in a description that do not correspond with the image. This method is based on the similarity between one text and all patch token embeddings in the image. Then, we mask these words with a larger probability in the subsequent training epoch, alleviating the impact of noisy textual descriptions. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods significantly boost the direct transfer text-to-image ReID performance. Benefiting from the pre-trained model weights, we also achieve state-of-the-art performance in the traditional evaluation settings.

- **Summary**: Facial feature tracking is essential in imaging ballistocardiography for accurate heart rate estimation and enables motor degradation quantification in Parkinson's disease through skin feature tracking. While deep convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable accuracy in tracking tasks, they typically require extensive labeled data for supervised training. Our proposed pipeline employs a convolutional stacked autoencoder to match image crops with a reference crop containing the target feature, learning deep feature encodings specific to the object category in an unsupervised manner, thus reducing data requirements. To overcome edge effects making the performance dependent on crop size, we introduced a Gaussian weight on the residual errors of the pixels when calculating the loss function. Training the autoencoder on facial images and validating its performance on manually labeled face and hand videos, our Deep Feature Encodings (DFE) method demonstrated superior tracking accuracy with a mean error ranging from 0.6 to 3.3 pixels, outperforming traditional methods like SIFT, SURF, Lucas Kanade, and the latest transformers like PIPs++ and CoTracker. Overall, our unsupervised learning approach excels in tracking various skin features under significant motion conditions, providing superior feature descriptors for tracking, matching, and image registration compared to both traditional and state-of-the-art supervised learning methods.

- **Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved impressive success in visual understanding and reasoning, remarkably improving the performance of mathematical reasoning in a visual context. Yet, a challenging type of visual math lies in the multimodal graph theory problem, which demands that LMMs understand the graphical structures accurately and perform multi-step reasoning on the visual graph. Additionally, exploring multimodal graph theory problems will lead to more effective strategies in fields like biology, transportation, and robotics planning. To step forward in this direction, we are the first to design a benchmark named VisionGraph, used to explore the capabilities of advanced LMMs in solving multimodal graph theory problems. It encompasses eight complex graph problem tasks, from connectivity to shortest path problems. Subsequently, we present a Description-Program-Reasoning (DPR) chain to enhance the logical accuracy of reasoning processes through graphical structure description generation and algorithm-aware multi-step reasoning. Our extensive study shows that 1) GPT-4V outperforms Gemini Pro in multi-step graph reasoning; 2) All LMMs exhibit inferior perception accuracy for graphical structures, whether in zero/few-shot settings or with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which further affects problem-solving performance; 3) DPR significantly improves the multi-step graph reasoning capabilities of LMMs and the GPT-4V (DPR) agent achieves SOTA performance.

- **Summary**: Automating visual inspection in industrial production lines is essential for increasing product quality across various industries. Anomaly detection (AD) methods serve as robust tools for this purpose. However, existing public datasets primarily consist of images without anomalies, limiting the practical application of AD methods in production settings. To address this challenge, we present (1) the Valeo Anomaly Dataset (VAD), a novel real-world industrial dataset comprising 5000 images, including 2000 instances of challenging real defects across more than 20 subclasses. Acknowledging that traditional AD methods struggle with this dataset, we introduce (2) Segmentation-based Anomaly Detector (SegAD). First, SegAD leverages anomaly maps as well as segmentation maps to compute local statistics. Next, SegAD uses these statistics and an optional supervised classifier score as input features for a Boosted Random Forest (BRF) classifier, yielding the final anomaly score. Our SegAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on both VAD (+2.1% AUROC) and the VisA dataset (+0.4% AUROC). The code and the models are publicly available.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of alterfactual explanations for black box image classifiers. Traditional explanation mechanisms from the field of Counterfactual Thinking are a widely-used paradigm for Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), as they follow a natural way of reasoning that humans are familiar with. However, most common approaches from this field are based on communicating information about features or characteristics that are especially important for an AI's decision. However, to fully understand a decision, not only knowledge about relevant features is needed, but the awareness of irrelevant information also highly contributes to the creation of a user's mental model of an AI system. To this end, a novel approach for explaining AI systems called alterfactual explanations was recently proposed on a conceptual level. It is based on showing an alternative reality where irrelevant features of an AI's input are altered. By doing so, the user directly sees which input data characteristics can change arbitrarily without influencing the AI's decision. In this paper, we show for the first time that it is possible to apply this idea to black box models based on neural networks. To this end, we present a GAN-based approach to generate these alterfactual explanations for binary image classifiers. Further, we present a user study that gives interesting insights on how alterfactual explanations can complement counterfactual explanations.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Recent progress in remote sensing image (RSI) super-resolution (SR) has exhibited remarkable performance using deep neural networks, e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformers. However, existing SR methods often suffer from either a limited receptive field or quadratic computational overhead, resulting in sub-optimal global representation and unacceptable computational costs in large-scale RSI. To alleviate these issues, we develop the first attempt to integrate the Vision State Space Model (Mamba) for RSI-SR, which specializes in processing large-scale RSI by capturing long-range dependency with linear complexity. To achieve better SR reconstruction, building upon Mamba, we devise a Frequency-assisted Mamba framework, dubbed FMSR, to explore the spatial and frequent correlations. In particular, our FMSR features a multi-level fusion architecture equipped with the Frequency Selection Module (FSM), Vision State Space Module (VSSM), and Hybrid Gate Module (HGM) to grasp their merits for effective spatial-frequency fusion. Recognizing that global and local dependencies are complementary and both beneficial for SR, we further recalibrate these multi-level features for accurate feature fusion via learnable scaling adaptors. Extensive experiments on AID, DOTA, and DIOR benchmarks demonstrate that our FMSR outperforms state-of-the-art Transformer-based methods HAT-L in terms of PSNR by 0.11 dB on average, while consuming only 28.05% and 19.08% of its memory consumption and complexity, respectively.

- **Summary**: Collaborative perception empowers each agent to improve its perceptual ability through the exchange of perceptual messages with other agents. It inherently results in a fundamental trade-off between perception ability and communication cost. To address this bottleneck issue, our core idea is to optimize the collaborative messages from two key aspects: representation and selection. The proposed codebook-based message representation enables the transmission of integer codes, rather than high-dimensional feature maps. The proposed information-filling-driven message selection optimizes local messages to collectively fill each agent's information demand, preventing information overflow among multiple agents. By integrating these two designs, we propose CodeFilling, a novel communication-efficient collaborative perception system, which significantly advances the perception-communication trade-off and is inclusive to both homogeneous and heterogeneous collaboration settings. We evaluate CodeFilling in both a real-world dataset, DAIR-V2X, and a new simulation dataset, OPV2VH+. Results show that CodeFilling outperforms previous SOTA Where2comm on DAIR-V2X/OPV2VH+ with 1,333/1,206 times lower communication volume.

- **Summary**: In the field of computer vision, self-supervised learning has emerged as a method to extract robust features from unlabeled data, where models derive labels autonomously from the data itself, without the need for manual annotation. This paper provides a comprehensive review of discriminative approaches of self-supervised learning within the domain of computer vision, examining their evolution and current status. Through an exploration of various methods including contrastive, self-distillation, knowledge distillation, feature decorrelation, and clustering techniques, we investigate how these approaches leverage the abundance of unlabeled data. Finally, we have comparison of self-supervised learning methods on the standard ImageNet classification benchmark.

- **Summary**: Table detection, a pivotal task in document analysis, aims to precisely recognize and locate tables within document images. Although deep learning has shown remarkable progress in this realm, it typically requires an extensive dataset of labeled data for proficient training. Current CNN-based semi-supervised table detection approaches use the anchor generation process and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) in their detection process, limiting training efficiency. Meanwhile, transformer-based semi-supervised techniques adopted a one-to-one match strategy that provides noisy pseudo-labels, limiting overall efficiency. This study presents an innovative transformer-based semi-supervised table detector. It improves the quality of pseudo-labels through a novel matching strategy combining one-to-one and one-to-many assignment techniques. This approach significantly enhances training efficiency during the early stages, ensuring superior pseudo-labels for further training. Our semi-supervised approach is comprehensively evaluated on benchmark datasets, including PubLayNet, ICADR-19, and TableBank. It achieves new state-of-the-art results, with a mAP of 95.7% and 97.9% on TableBank (word) and PubLaynet with 30% label data, marking a 7.4 and 7.6 point improvement over previous semi-supervised table detection approach, respectively. The results clearly show the superiority of our semi-supervised approach, surpassing all existing state-of-the-art methods by substantial margins. This research represents a significant advancement in semi-supervised table detection methods, offering a more efficient and accurate solution for practical document analysis tasks.

- **Summary**: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have exhibited significant effectiveness in computer vision tasks, particularly in image generation. However, their notable performance heavily relies on labelled datasets, which limits their application in medical images due to the associated high-cost annotations. Current DPM-related methods for lesion detection in medical imaging, which can be categorized into two distinct approaches, primarily rely on image-level annotations. The first approach, based on anomaly detection, involves learning reference healthy brain representations and identifying anomalies based on the difference in inference results. In contrast, the second approach, resembling a segmentation task, employs only the original brain multi-modalities as prior information for generating pixel-level annotations. In this paper, our proposed model - discrepancy distribution medical diffusion (DDMD) - for lesion detection in brain MRI introduces a novel framework by incorporating distinctive discrepancy features, deviating from the conventional direct reliance on image-level annotations or the original brain modalities. In our method, the inconsistency in image-level annotations is translated into distribution discrepancies among heterogeneous samples while preserving information within homogeneous samples. This property retains pixel-wise uncertainty and facilitates an implicit ensemble of segmentation, ultimately enhancing the overall detection performance. Thorough experiments conducted on the BRATS2020 benchmark dataset containing multimodal MRI scans for brain tumour detection demonstrate the great performance of our approach in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Over the past few years, deep neural models have made considerable advances in image quality assessment (IQA). However, the underlying reasons for their success remain unclear, owing to the complex nature of deep neural networks. IQA aims to describe how the human visual system (HVS) works and to create its efficient approximations. On the other hand, Saliency Prediction task aims to emulate HVS via determining areas of visual interest. Thus, we believe that saliency plays a crucial role in human perception. In this work, we conduct an empirical study that reveals the relation between IQA and Saliency Prediction tasks, demonstrating that the former incorporates knowledge of the latter. Moreover, we introduce a novel SACID dataset of saliency-aware compressed images and conduct a large-scale comparison of classic and neural-based IQA methods. All supplementary code and data will be available at the time of publication.

- **Summary**: In noisy label learning, estimating noisy class posteriors plays a fundamental role for developing consistent classifiers, as it forms the basis for estimating clean class posteriors and the transition matrix. Existing methods typically learn noisy class posteriors by training a classification model with noisy labels. However, when labels are incorrect, these models may be misled to overemphasize the feature parts that do not reflect the instance characteristics, resulting in significant errors in estimating noisy class posteriors. To address this issue, this paper proposes to augment the supervised information with part-level labels, encouraging the model to focus on and integrate richer information from various parts. Specifically, our method first partitions features into distinct parts by cropping instances, yielding part-level labels associated with these various parts. Subsequently, we introduce a novel single-to-multiple transition matrix to model the relationship between the noisy and part-level labels, which incorporates part-level labels into a classifier-consistent framework. Utilizing this framework with part-level labels, we can learn the noisy class posteriors more precisely by guiding the model to integrate information from various parts, ultimately improving the classification performance. Our method is theoretically sound, while experiments show that it is empirically effective in synthetic and real-world noisy benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated excellent performance on super-resolution visual tasks, surpassing conventional convolutional neural networks. However, existing work typically restricts self-attention computation to non-overlapping windows to save computational costs. This means that Transformer-based networks can only use input information from a limited spatial range. Therefore, a novel Hybrid Multi-Axis Aggregation network (HMA) is proposed in this paper to exploit feature potential information better. HMA is constructed by stacking Residual Hybrid Transformer Blocks(RHTB) and Grid Attention Blocks(GAB). On the one side, RHTB combines channel attention and self-attention to enhance non-local feature fusion and produce more attractive visual results. Conversely, GAB is used in cross-domain information interaction to jointly model similar features and obtain a larger perceptual field. For the super-resolution task in the training phase, a novel pre-training method is designed to enhance the model representation capabilities further and validate the proposed model's effectiveness through many experiments. The experimental results show that HMA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark dataset. We provide code and models at https://github.com/korouuuuu/HMA.

- **Summary**: There is currently strong interest in improving visual object tracking by augmenting the RGB modality with the output of a visual event camera that is particularly informative about the scene motion. However, existing approaches perform event feature extraction for RGB-E tracking using traditional appearance models, which have been optimised for RGB only tracking, without adapting it for the intrinsic characteristics of the event data. To address this problem, we propose an Event backbone (Pooler), designed to obtain a high-quality feature representation that is cognisant of the innate characteristics of the event data, namely its sparsity. In particular, Multi-Scale Pooling is introduced to capture all the motion feature trends within event data through the utilisation of diverse pooling kernel sizes. The association between the derived RGB and event representations is established by an innovative module performing adaptive Mutually Guided Fusion (MGF). Extensive experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art trackers on two widely used RGB-E tracking datasets, including VisEvent and COESOT, where the precision and success rates on COESOT are improved by 4.9% and 5.2%, respectively. Our code will be available at https://github.com/SSSpc333/TENet.

- **Summary**: Automatic medical image segmentation technology has the potential to expedite pathological diagnoses, thereby enhancing the efficiency of patient care. However, medical images often have complex textures and structures, and the models often face the problem of reduced image resolution and information loss due to downsampling. To address this issue, we propose HC-Mamba, a new medical image segmentation model based on the modern state space model Mamba. Specifically, we introduce the technique of dilated convolution in the HC-Mamba model to capture a more extensive range of contextual information without increasing the computational cost by extending the perceptual field of the convolution kernel. In addition, the HC-Mamba model employs depthwise separable convolutions, significantly reducing the number of parameters and the computational power of the model. By combining dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolutions, HC-Mamba is able to process large-scale medical image data at a much lower computational cost while maintaining a high level of performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments on segmentation tasks including skin lesion, and conduct extensive experiments on ISIC17 and ISIC18 to demonstrate the potential of the HC-Mamba model in medical image segmentation. The experimental results show that HC-Mamba exhibits competitive performance on all these datasets, thereby proving its effectiveness and usefulness in medical image segmentation.

- **Summary**: Neural fields (NeRF) have emerged as a promising approach for representing continuous 3D scenes. Nevertheless, the lack of semantic encoding in NeRFs poses a significant challenge for scene decomposition. To address this challenge, we present a single model, Multi-Modal Decomposition NeRF (${M^2D}$NeRF), that is capable of both text-based and visual patch-based edits. Specifically, we use multi-modal feature distillation to integrate teacher features from pretrained visual and language models into 3D semantic feature volumes, thereby facilitating consistent 3D editing. To enforce consistency between the visual and language features in our 3D feature volumes, we introduce a multi-modal similarity constraint. We also introduce a patch-based joint contrastive loss that helps to encourage object-regions to coalesce in the 3D feature space, resulting in more precise boundaries. Experiments on various real-world scenes show superior performance in 3D scene decomposition tasks compared to prior NeRF-based methods.

- **Summary**: Entropy minimization (EM) is frequently used to increase the accuracy of classification models when they're faced with new data at test time. EM is a self-supervised learning method that optimizes classifiers to assign even higher probabilities to their top predicted classes. In this paper, we analyze why EM works when adapting a model for a few steps and why it eventually fails after adapting for many steps. We show that, at first, EM causes the model to embed test images close to training images, thereby increasing model accuracy. After many steps of optimization, EM makes the model embed test images far away from the embeddings of training images, which results in a degradation of accuracy. Building upon our insights, we present a method for solving a practical problem: estimating a model's accuracy on a given arbitrary dataset without having access to its labels. Our method estimates accuracy by looking at how the embeddings of input images change as the model is optimized to minimize entropy. Experiments on 23 challenging datasets show that our method sets the SoTA with a mean absolute error of $5.75\%$, an improvement of $29.62\%$ over the previous SoTA on this task.

- **Summary**: Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) relying on multiple cameras are increasingly prevalent in vehicle technology. Yet, conventional imaging sensors struggle to capture clear images in conditions with intense illumination contrast, such as tunnel exits, due to their limited dynamic range. Introducing high dynamic range (HDR) sensors addresses this issue. However, the process of converting HDR content to a displayable range via tone mapping often leads to inefficient computations, when performed directly on pixel data. In this paper, we focus on HDR image tone mapping using a lightweight neural network applied on image histogram data. Our proposed TinyML-based global tone mapping method, termed as TGTM, operates at 9,000 FLOPS per RGB image of any resolution. Additionally, TGTM offers a generic approach that can be incorporated to any classical tone mapping method. Experimental results demonstrate that TGTM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real HDR camera images by up to 5.85 dB higher PSNR with orders of magnitude less computations.

- **Summary**: We present StyleMamba, an efficient image style transfer framework that translates text prompts into corresponding visual styles while preserving the content integrity of the original images. Existing text-guided stylization requires hundreds of training iterations and takes a lot of computing resources. To speed up the process, we propose a conditional State Space Model for Efficient Text-driven Image Style Transfer, dubbed StyleMamba, that sequentially aligns the image features to the target text prompts. To enhance the local and global style consistency between text and image, we propose masked and second-order directional losses to optimize the stylization direction to significantly reduce the training iterations by 5 times and the inference time by 3 times. Extensive experiments and qualitative evaluation confirm the robust and superior stylization performance of our methods compared to the existing baselines.

- **Summary**: Mitigating bias in machine learning models is a critical endeavor for ensuring fairness and equity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address bias by leveraging pixel image attributions to identify and regularize regions of images containing significant information about bias attributes. Our method utilizes a model-agnostic approach to extract pixel attributions by employing a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier trained on small image patches. By training the classifier to predict a property of the entire image using only a single patch, we achieve region-based attributions that provide insights into the distribution of important information across the image. We propose utilizing these attributions to introduce targeted noise into datasets with confounding attributes that bias the data, thereby constraining neural networks from learning these biases and emphasizing the primary attributes. Our approach demonstrates its efficacy in enabling the training of unbiased classifiers on heavily biased datasets.

- **Summary**: This paper offers a comprehensive review of artificial intelligence (AI) research in the context of real camera content acquisition for entertainment purposes and is aimed at both researchers and cinematographers. Considering the breadth of computer vision research and the lack of review papers tied to intelligent cinematography (IC), this review introduces a holistic view of the IC landscape while providing the technical insight for experts across across disciplines. We preface the main discussion with technical background on generative AI, object detection, automated camera calibration and 3-D content acquisition, and link explanatory articles to assist non-technical readers. The main discussion categorizes work by four production types: General Production, Virtual Production, Live Production and Aerial Production. Note that for Virtual Production we do not discuss research relating to virtual content acquisition, including work on automated video generation, like Stable Diffusion. Within each section, we (1) sub-classify work by the technical field of research - reflected by the subsections, and (2) evaluate the trends and challenge w.r.t to each type of production. In the final chapter, we present our concluding remarks on the greater scope of IC research and outline work that we believe has significant potential to influence the whole industry. We find that work relating to virtual production has the greatest potential to impact other mediums of production, driven by the growing interest in LED volumes/stages for in-camera virtual effects (ICVFX) and automated 3-D capture for a virtual modelling of real world scenes and actors. This is the first piece of literature to offer a structured and comprehensive examination of IC research. Consequently, we address ethical and legal concerns regarding the use of creative AI involving artists, actors and the general public, in the...

- **Summary**: Wound healing is a complex process involving changes in collagen fibers. Accurate monitoring of these changes is crucial for assessing the progress of wound healing and has significant implications for guiding clinical treatment strategies and drug screening. However, traditional quantitative analysis methods focus on spatial characteristics such as collagen fiber alignment and variance, lacking threshold standards to differentiate between different stages of wound healing. To address this issue, we propose an innovative approach based on deep learning to predict the progression of wound healing by analyzing collagen fiber features in histological images of wound tissue. Leveraging the unique learning capabilities of deep learning models, our approach captures the feature variations of collagen fibers in histological images from different categories and classifies them into various stages of wound healing. To overcome the limited availability of histological image data, we employ a transfer learning strategy. Specifically, we fine-tune a VGG16 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset to adapt it to the classification task of histological images of wounds. Through this process, our model achieves 82% accuracy in classifying six stages of wound healing. Furthermore, to enhance the interpretability of the model, we employ a class activation mapping technique called LayerCAM. LayerCAM reveals the image regions on which the model relies when making predictions, providing transparency to the model's decision-making process. This visualization not only helps us understand how the model identifies and evaluates collagen fiber features but also enhances trust in the model's prediction results. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed model is the first deep learning-based classification model used for predicting wound healing stages.

- **Summary**: Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is a numerical method that seeks to fit timeseries data to a linear dynamical system. In doing so, DMD decomposes dynamic data into spatially coherent modes that evolve in time according to exponential growth/decay or with a fixed frequency of oscillation. A prolific application of DMD has been to video, where one interprets the high-dimensional pixel space evolving through time as the video plays. In this work, we propose a simple and interpretable motion detection algorithm for streaming video data rooted in DMD. Our method leverages the fact that there exists a correspondence between the evolution of important video features, such as foreground motion, and the eigenvalues of the matrix which results from applying DMD to segments of video. We apply the method to a database of test videos which emulate security footage under varying realistic conditions. Effectiveness is analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curves, while we use cross-validation to optimize the threshold parameter that identifies movement.

- **Summary**: Initialization-free bundle adjustment (BA) remains largely uncharted. While Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is the golden method to solve the BA problem, it generally relies on a good initialization. In contrast, the under-explored Variable Projection algorithm (VarPro) exhibits a wide convergence basin even without initialization. Coupled with object space error formulation, recent works have shown its ability to solve (small-scale) initialization-free bundle adjustment problem. We introduce Power Variable Projection (PoVar), extending a recent inverse expansion method based on power series. Importantly, we link the power series expansion to Riemannian manifold optimization. This projective framework is crucial to solve large-scale bundle adjustment problem without initialization. Using the real-world BAL dataset, we experimentally demonstrate that our solver achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of speed and accuracy. In particular, our work is the first, to our knowledge, that addresses the scalability of BA without initialization and opens new venues for initialization-free Structure-from-Motion.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an analysis of properties of two hybrid discretization methods for Gaussian derivatives, based on convolutions with either the normalized sampled Gaussian kernel or the integrated Gaussian kernel followed by central differences. The motivation for studying these discretization methods is that in situations when multiple spatial derivatives of different order are needed at the same scale level, they can be computed significantly more efficiently compared to more direct derivative approximations based on explicit convolutions with either sampled Gaussian kernels or integrated Gaussian kernels.   While these computational benefits do also hold for the genuinely discrete approach for computing discrete analogues of Gaussian derivatives, based on convolution with the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel followed by central differences, the underlying mathematical primitives for the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, in terms of modified Bessel functions of integer order, may not be available in certain frameworks for image processing, such as when performing deep learning based on scale-parameterized filters in terms of Gaussian derivatives, with learning of the scale levels.   In this paper, we present a characterization of the properties of these hybrid discretization methods, in terms of quantitative performance measures concerning the amount of spatial smoothing that they imply, as well as the relative consistency of scale estimates obtained from scale-invariant feature detectors with automatic scale selection, with an emphasis on the behaviour for very small values of the scale parameter, which may differ significantly from corresponding results obtained from the fully continuous scale-space theory, as well as between different types of discretization methods.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised multimodal violence detection aims to learn a violence detection model by leveraging multiple modalities such as RGB, optical flow, and audio, while only video-level annotations are available. In the pursuit of effective multimodal violence detection (MVD), information redundancy, modality imbalance, and modality asynchrony are identified as three key challenges. In this work, we propose a new weakly supervised MVD method that explicitly addresses these challenges. Specifically, we introduce a multi-scale bottleneck transformer (MSBT) based fusion module that employs a reduced number of bottleneck tokens to gradually condense information and fuse each pair of modalities and utilizes a bottleneck token-based weighting scheme to highlight more important fused features. Furthermore, we propose a temporal consistency contrast loss to semantically align pairwise fused features. Experiments on the largest-scale XD-Violence dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/shengyangsun/MSBT.

- **Summary**: Buildings, as fundamental man-made structures in urban environments, serve as crucial indicators for understanding various city function zones. Rapid urbanization has raised an urgent need for efficiently surveying building footprints and functions. In this study, we proposed a semi-supervised framework to identify every building's function in large-scale urban areas with multi-modality remote-sensing data. In detail, optical images, building height, and nighttime-light data are collected to describe the morphological attributes of buildings. Then, the area of interest (AOI) and building masks from the volunteered geographic information (VGI) data are collected to form sparsely labeled samples. Furthermore, the multi-modality data and weak labels are utilized to train a segmentation model with a semi-supervised strategy. Finally, results are evaluated by 20,000 validation points and statistical survey reports from the government. The evaluations reveal that the produced function maps achieve an OA of 82% and Kappa of 71% among 1,616,796 buildings in Shanghai, China. This study has the potential to support large-scale urban management and sustainable urban development. All collected data and produced maps are open access at https://github.com/LiZhuoHong/BuildingMap.

- **Summary**: In selective classification (SC), a classifier abstains from making predictions that are likely to be wrong to avoid excessive errors. To deploy imperfect classifiers -- imperfect either due to intrinsic statistical noise of data or for robustness issue of the classifier or beyond -- in high-stakes scenarios, SC appears to be an attractive and necessary path to follow. Despite decades of research in SC, most previous SC methods still focus on the ideal statistical setting only, i.e., the data distribution at deployment is the same as that of training, although practical data can come from the wild. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose an SC framework that takes into account distribution shifts, termed generalized selective classification, that covers label-shifted (or out-of-distribution) and covariate-shifted samples, in addition to typical in-distribution samples, the first of its kind in the SC literature. We focus on non-training-based confidence-score functions for generalized SC on deep learning (DL) classifiers and propose two novel margin-based score functions. Through extensive analysis and experiments, we show that our proposed score functions are more effective and reliable than the existing ones for generalized SC on a variety of classification tasks and DL classifiers.

- **Summary**: Millimetre wave (mmWave) radar is a non-intrusive privacy and relatively convenient and inexpensive device, which has been demonstrated to be applicable in place of RGB cameras in human indoor pose estimation tasks. However, mmWave radar relies on the collection of reflected signals from the target, and the radar signals containing information is difficult to be fully applied. This has been a long-standing hindrance to the improvement of pose estimation accuracy. To address this major challenge, this paper introduces a probability map guided multi-format feature fusion model, ProbRadarM3F. This is a novel radar feature extraction framework using a traditional FFT method in parallel with a probability map based positional encoding method. ProbRadarM3F fuses the traditional heatmap features and the positional features, then effectively achieves the estimation of 14 keypoints of the human body. Experimental evaluation on the HuPR dataset proves the effectiveness of the model proposed in this paper, outperforming other methods experimented on this dataset with an AP of 69.9 %. The emphasis of our study is focusing on the position information that is not exploited before in radar singal. This provides direction to investigate other potential non-redundant information from mmWave rader.

- **Summary**: Digital watermarking is the process of embedding secret information by altering images in a way that is undetectable to the human eye. To increase the robustness of the model, many deep learning-based watermarking methods use the encoder-decoder architecture by adding different noises to the noise layer. The decoder then extracts the watermarked information from the distorted image. However, this method can only resist weak noise attacks. To improve the robustness of the algorithm against stronger noise, this paper proposes to introduce a denoise module between the noise layer and the decoder. The module is aimed at reducing noise and recovering some of the information lost during an attack. Additionally, the paper introduces the SE module to fuse the watermarking information pixel-wise and channel dimensions-wise, improving the encoder's efficiency. Experimental results show that our proposed method is comparable to existing models and outperforms state-of-the-art under different noise intensities. In addition, ablation experiments show the superiority of our proposed module.

- **Summary**: 3D occupancy perception technology aims to observe and understand dense 3D environments for autonomous vehicles. Owing to its comprehensive perception capability, this technology is emerging as a trend in autonomous driving perception systems, and is attracting significant attention from both industry and academia. Similar to traditional bird's-eye view (BEV) perception, 3D occupancy perception has the nature of multi-source input and the necessity for information fusion. However, the difference is that it captures vertical structures that are ignored by 2D BEV. In this survey, we review the most recent works on 3D occupancy perception, and provide in-depth analyses of methodologies with various input modalities. Specifically, we summarize general network pipelines, highlight information fusion techniques, and discuss effective network training. We evaluate and analyze the occupancy perception performance of the state-of-the-art on the most popular datasets. Furthermore, challenges and future research directions are discussed. We hope this report will inspire the community and encourage more research work on 3D occupancy perception. A comprehensive list of studies in this survey is available in an active repository that continuously collects the latest work: https://github.com/HuaiyuanXu/3D-Occupancy-Perception.

- **Summary**: The 3D Human Pose Estimation (3D HPE) task uses 2D images or videos to predict human joint coordinates in 3D space. Despite recent advancements in deep learning-based methods, they mostly ignore the capability of coupling accessible texts and naturally feasible knowledge of humans, missing out on valuable implicit supervision to guide the 3D HPE task. Moreover, previous efforts often study this task from the perspective of the whole human body, neglecting fine-grained guidance hidden in different body parts. To this end, we present a new Fine-Grained Prompt-Driven Denoiser based on a diffusion model for 3D HPE, named \textbf{FinePOSE}. It consists of three core blocks enhancing the reverse process of the diffusion model: (1) Fine-grained Part-aware Prompt learning (FPP) block constructs fine-grained part-aware prompts via coupling accessible texts and naturally feasible knowledge of body parts with learnable prompts to model implicit guidance. (2) Fine-grained Prompt-pose Communication (FPC) block establishes fine-grained communications between learned part-aware prompts and poses to improve the denoising quality. (3) Prompt-driven Timestamp Stylization (PTS) block integrates learned prompt embedding and temporal information related to the noise level to enable adaptive adjustment at each denoising step. Extensive experiments on public single-human pose estimation datasets show that FinePOSE outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We further extend FinePOSE to multi-human pose estimation. Achieving 34.3mm average MPJPE on the EgoHumans dataset demonstrates the potential of FinePOSE to deal with complex multi-human scenarios.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models are a powerful generative framework, but come with expensive inference. Existing acceleration methods often compromise image quality or fail under complex conditioning when operating in an extremely low-step regime. In this work, we propose a novel distillation framework tailored to enable high-fidelity, diverse sample generation using just one to three steps. Our approach comprises three key components: (i) Backward Distillation, which mitigates training-inference discrepancies by calibrating the student on its own backward trajectory; (ii) Shifted Reconstruction Loss that dynamically adapts knowledge transfer based on the current time step; and (iii) Noise Correction, an inference-time technique that enhances sample quality by addressing singularities in noise prediction. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing competitors in quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Remarkably, it achieves performance comparable to the teacher model using only three denoising steps, enabling efficient high-quality generation.

- **Summary**: The diagnosis and treatment of chest diseases play a crucial role in maintaining human health. X-ray examination has become the most common clinical examination means due to its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Artificial intelligence analysis methods for chest X-ray images are limited by insufficient annotation data and varying levels of annotation, resulting in weak generalization ability and difficulty in clinical dissemination. Here we present EVA-X, an innovative foundational model based on X-ray images with broad applicability to various chest disease detection tasks. EVA-X is the first X-ray image based self-supervised learning method capable of capturing both semantic and geometric information from unlabeled images for universal X-ray image representation. Through extensive experimentation, EVA-X has demonstrated exceptional performance in chest disease analysis and localization, becoming the first model capable of spanning over 20 different chest diseases and achieving leading results in over 11 different detection tasks in the medical field. Additionally, EVA-X significantly reduces the burden of data annotation in the medical AI field, showcasing strong potential in the domain of few-shot learning. The emergence of EVA-X will greatly propel the development and application of foundational medical models, bringing about revolutionary changes in future medical research and clinical practice.

- **Summary**: Advances in underwater imaging enable the collection of extensive seafloor image datasets that are necessary for monitoring important benthic ecosystems. The ability to collect seafloor imagery has outpaced our capacity to analyze it, hindering expedient mobilization of this crucial environmental information. Recent machine learning approaches provide opportunities to increase the efficiency with which seafloor image datasets are analyzed, yet large and consistent datasets necessary to support development of such approaches are scarce. Here we present BenthicNet: a global compilation of seafloor imagery designed to support the training and evaluation of large-scale image recognition models. An initial set of over 11.4 million images was collected and curated to represent a diversity of seafloor environments using a representative subset of 1.3 million images. These are accompanied by 2.6 million annotations translated to the CATAMI scheme, which span 190,000 of the images. A large deep learning model was trained on this compilation and preliminary results suggest it has utility for automating large and small-scale image analysis tasks. The compilation and model are made openly available for use by the scientific community at https://doi.org/10.20383/103.0614.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Models (DMs) have exhibited superior performance in generating high-quality and diverse images. However, this exceptional performance comes at the cost of expensive architectural design, particularly due to the attention module heavily used in leading models. Existing works mainly adopt a retraining process to enhance DM efficiency. This is computationally expensive and not very scalable. To this end, we introduce the Attention-driven Training-free Efficient Diffusion Model (AT-EDM) framework that leverages attention maps to perform run-time pruning of redundant tokens, without the need for any retraining. Specifically, for single-denoising-step pruning, we develop a novel ranking algorithm, Generalized Weighted Page Rank (G-WPR), to identify redundant tokens, and a similarity-based recovery method to restore tokens for the convolution operation. In addition, we propose a Denoising-Steps-Aware Pruning (DSAP) approach to adjust the pruning budget across different denoising timesteps for better generation quality. Extensive evaluations show that AT-EDM performs favorably against prior art in terms of efficiency (e.g., 38.8% FLOPs saving and up to 1.53x speed-up over Stable Diffusion XL) while maintaining nearly the same FID and CLIP scores as the full model.

- **Summary**: Mitigating hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) remains an open problem. Recent benchmarks do not address hallucinations in open-ended free-form responses, which we term "Type I hallucinations". Instead, they focus on hallucinations responding to very specific question formats -- typically a multiple-choice response regarding a particular object or attribute -- which we term "Type II hallucinations". Additionally, such benchmarks often require external API calls to models which are subject to change. In practice, we observe that a reduction in Type II hallucinations does not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations but rather that the two forms of hallucinations are often anti-correlated. To address this, we propose THRONE, a novel object-based automatic framework for quantitatively evaluating Type I hallucinations in LVLM free-form outputs. We use public language models (LMs) to identify hallucinations in LVLM responses and compute informative metrics. By evaluating a large selection of recent LVLMs using public datasets, we show that an improvement in existing metrics do not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations, and that established benchmarks for measuring Type I hallucinations are incomplete. Finally, we provide a simple and effective data augmentation method to reduce Type I and Type II hallucinations as a strong baseline.

- **Summary**: Efficient data utilization is crucial for advancing 3D scene understanding in autonomous driving, where reliance on heavily human-annotated LiDAR point clouds challenges fully supervised methods. Addressing this, our study extends into semi-supervised learning for LiDAR semantic segmentation, leveraging the intrinsic spatial priors of driving scenes and multi-sensor complements to augment the efficacy of unlabeled datasets. We introduce LaserMix++, an evolved framework that integrates laser beam manipulations from disparate LiDAR scans and incorporates LiDAR-camera correspondences to further assist data-efficient learning. Our framework is tailored to enhance 3D scene consistency regularization by incorporating multi-modality, including 1) multi-modal LaserMix operation for fine-grained cross-sensor interactions; 2) camera-to-LiDAR feature distillation that enhances LiDAR feature learning; and 3) language-driven knowledge guidance generating auxiliary supervisions using open-vocabulary models. The versatility of LaserMix++ enables applications across LiDAR representations, establishing it as a universally applicable solution. Our framework is rigorously validated through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on popular driving perception datasets. Results demonstrate that LaserMix++ markedly outperforms fully supervised alternatives, achieving comparable accuracy with five times fewer annotations and significantly improving the supervised-only baselines. This substantial advancement underscores the potential of semi-supervised approaches in reducing the reliance on extensive labeled data in LiDAR-based 3D scene understanding systems.

- **Summary**: Event-based semantic segmentation (ESS) is a fundamental yet challenging task for event camera sensing. The difficulties in interpreting and annotating event data limit its scalability. While domain adaptation from images to event data can help to mitigate this issue, there exist data representational differences that require additional effort to resolve. In this work, for the first time, we synergize information from image, text, and event-data domains and introduce OpenESS to enable scalable ESS in an open-world, annotation-efficient manner. We achieve this goal by transferring the semantically rich CLIP knowledge from image-text pairs to event streams. To pursue better cross-modality adaptation, we propose a frame-to-event contrastive distillation and a text-to-event semantic consistency regularization. Experimental results on popular ESS benchmarks showed our approach outperforms existing methods. Notably, we achieve 53.93% and 43.31% mIoU on DDD17 and DSEC-Semantic without using either event or frame labels.

- **Summary**: Despite their effectiveness, current deep learning models face challenges with images coming from different domains with varying appearance and content. We introduce SegCLR, a versatile framework designed to segment volumetric images across different domains, employing supervised and contrastive learning simultaneously to effectively learn from both labeled and unlabeled data. We demonstrate the superior performance of SegCLR through a comprehensive evaluation involving three diverse clinical datasets of retinal fluid segmentation in 3D Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), various network configurations, and verification across 10 different network initializations. In an unsupervised domain adaptation context, SegCLR achieves results on par with a supervised upper-bound model trained on the intended target domain. Notably, we discover that the segmentation performance of SegCLR framework is marginally impacted by the abundance of unlabeled data from the target domain, thereby we also propose an effective zero-shot domain adaptation extension of SegCLR, eliminating the need for any target domain information. This shows that our proposed addition of contrastive loss in standard supervised training for segmentation leads to superior models, inherently more generalizable to both in- and out-of-domain test data. We additionally propose a pragmatic solution for SegCLR deployment in realistic scenarios with multiple domains containing labeled data. Accordingly, our framework pushes the boundaries of deep-learning based segmentation in multi-domain applications, regardless of data availability - labeled, unlabeled, or nonexistent.

- **Summary**: Recognizing driving behaviors is important for downstream tasks such as reasoning, planning, and navigation. Existing video recognition approaches work well for common behaviors (e.g. "drive straight", "brake", "turn left/right"). However, the performance is sub-par for underrepresented/rare behaviors typically found in tail of the behavior class distribution. To address this shortcoming, we propose Transfer-LMR, a modular training routine for improving the recognition performance across all driving behavior classes. We extensively evaluate our approach on METEOR and HDD datasets that contain rich yet heavy-tailed distribution of driving behaviors and span diverse traffic scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, especially for recognizing underrepresented/rare driving behaviors.

- **Summary**: Multi-view stereo omnidirectional distance estimation usually needs to build a cost volume with many hypothetical distance candidates. The cost volume building process is often computationally heavy considering the limited resources a mobile robot has. We propose a new geometry-informed way of distance candidates selection method which enables the use of a very small number of candidates and reduces the computational cost. We demonstrate the use of the geometry-informed candidates in a set of model variants. We find that by adjusting the candidates during robot deployment, our geometry-informed distance candidates also improve a pre-trained model's accuracy if the extrinsics or the number of cameras changes. Without any re-training or fine-tuning, our models outperform models trained with evenly distributed distance candidates. Models are also released as hardware-accelerated versions with a new dedicated large-scale dataset. The project page, code, and dataset can be found at https://theairlab.org/gicandidates/ .

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present LOC-ZSON, a novel Language-driven Object-Centric image representation for object navigation task within complex scenes. We propose an object-centric image representation and corresponding losses for visual-language model (VLM) fine-tuning, which can handle complex object-level queries. In addition, we design a novel LLM-based augmentation and prompt templates for stability during training and zero-shot inference. We implement our method on Astro robot and deploy it in both simulated and real-world environments for zero-shot object navigation. We show that our proposed method can achieve an improvement of 1.38 - 13.38% in terms of text-to-image recall on different benchmark settings for the retrieval task. For object navigation, we show the benefit of our approach in simulation and real world, showing 5% and 16.67% improvement in terms of navigation success rate, respectively.

- **Summary**: Interpretability is the study of explaining models in understandable terms to humans. At present, interpretability is divided into two paradigms: the intrinsic paradigm, which believes that only models designed to be explained can be explained, and the post-hoc paradigm, which believes that black-box models can be explained. At the core of this debate is how each paradigm ensures its explanations are faithful, i.e., true to the model's behavior. This is important, as false but convincing explanations lead to unsupported confidence in artificial intelligence (AI), which can be dangerous. This paper's position is that we should think about new paradigms while staying vigilant regarding faithfulness. First, by examining the history of paradigms in science, we see that paradigms are constantly evolving. Then, by examining the current paradigms, we can understand their underlying beliefs, the value they bring, and their limitations. Finally, this paper presents 3 emerging paradigms for interpretability. The first paradigm designs models such that faithfulness can be easily measured. Another optimizes models such that explanations become faithful. The last paradigm proposes to develop models that produce both a prediction and an explanation.

- **Summary**: Precise, pixel-wise geolocalization of astronaut photography is critical to unlocking the potential of this unique type of remotely sensed Earth data, particularly for its use in disaster management and climate change research. Recent works have established the Astronaut Photography Localization task, but have either proved too costly for mass deployment or generated too coarse a localization. Thus, we present EarthMatch, an iterative homography estimation method that produces fine-grained localization of astronaut photographs while maintaining an emphasis on speed. We refocus the astronaut photography benchmark, AIMS, on the geolocalization task itself, and prove our method's efficacy on this dataset. In addition, we offer a new, fair method for image matcher comparison, and an extensive evaluation of different matching models within our localization pipeline. Our method will enable fast and accurate localization of the 4.5 million and growing collection of astronaut photography of Earth.

- **Summary**: Skeleton-based motion visualization is a rising field in computer vision, especially in the case of virtual reality (VR). With further advancements in human-pose estimation and skeleton extracting sensors, more and more applications that utilize skeleton data have come about. These skeletons may appear to be anonymous but they contain embedded personally identifiable information (PII). In this paper we present a new anonymization technique that is based on motion retargeting, utilizing adversary classifiers to further remove PII embedded in the skeleton. Motion retargeting is effective in anonymization as it transfers the movement of the user onto the a dummy skeleton. In doing so, any PII linked to the skeleton will be based on the dummy skeleton instead of the user we are protecting. We propose a Privacy-centric Deep Motion Retargeting model (PMR) which aims to further clear the retargeted skeleton of PII through adversarial learning. In our experiments, PMR achieves motion retargeting utility performance on par with state of the art models while also reducing the performance of privacy attacks.

- **Summary**: The 3D Gaussian splatting methods are getting popular. However, they work directly on the signal, leading to a dense representation of the signal. Even with some techniques such as pruning or distillation, the results are still dense. In this paper, we propose to model the gradient of the original signal. The gradients are much sparser than the original signal. Therefore, the gradients use much less Gaussian splats, leading to the more efficient storage and thus higher computational performance during both training and rendering. Thanks to the sparsity, during the view synthesis, only a small mount of pixels are needed, leading to much higher computational performance ($100\sim 1000\times$ faster). And the 2D image can be recovered from the gradients via solving a Poisson equation with linear computation complexity. Several experiments are performed to confirm the sparseness of the gradients and the computation performance of the proposed method. The method can be applied various applications, such as human body modeling and indoor environment modeling.
