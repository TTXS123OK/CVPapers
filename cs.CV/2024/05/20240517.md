- **Summary**: In the facial expression recognition task, researchers always get low accuracy of expression classification due to a small amount of training samples. In order to solve this kind of problem, we proposes a new data augmentation method named MixCut. In this method, we firstly interpolate the two original training samples at the pixel level in a random ratio to generate new samples. Then, pixel removal is performed in random square regions on the new samples to generate the final training samples. We evaluated the MixCut method on Fer2013Plus and RAF-DB. With MixCut, we achieved 85.63% accuracy in eight-label classification on Fer2013Plus and 87.88% accuracy in seven-label classification on RAF-DB, effectively improving the classification accuracy of facial expression image recognition. Meanwhile, on Fer2013Plus, MixCut achieved performance improvements of +0.59%, +0.36%, and +0.39% compared to the other three data augmentation methods: CutOut, Mixup, and CutMix, respectively. MixCut improves classification accuracy on RAF-DB by +0.22%, +0.65%, and +0.5% over these three data augmentation methods.

- **Summary**: Street-view image has been widely applied as a crucial mobile mapping data source. The inpainting of street-view images is a critical step for street-view image processing, not only for the privacy protection, but also for the urban environment mapping applications. This paper presents a novel Deep Neural Network (DNN), multi-scale semantic prior Feature guided image inpainting Network (MFN) for inpainting street-view images, which generate static street-view images without moving objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles). To enhance global context understanding, a semantic prior prompter is introduced to learn rich semantic priors from large pre-trained model. We design the prompter by stacking multiple Semantic Pyramid Aggregation (SPA) modules, capturing a broad range of visual feature patterns. A semantic-enhanced image generator with a decoder is proposed that incorporates a novel cascaded Learnable Prior Transferring (LPT) module at each scale level. For each decoder block, an attention transfer mechanism is applied to capture long-term dependencies, and the semantic prior features are fused with the image features to restore plausible structure in an adaptive manner. Additionally, a background-aware data processing scheme is adopted to prevent the generation of hallucinated objects within holes. Experiments on Apolloscapes and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate better performance than state-of-the-art methods, with MAE, and LPIPS showing improvements of about 9.5% and 41.07% respectively. Visual comparison survey among multi-group person is also conducted to provide performance evaluation, and the results suggest that the proposed MFN offers a promising solution for privacy protection and generate more reliable scene for urban applications with street-view images.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we explore the existing challenges in 3D artistic scene generation by introducing ART3D, a novel framework that combines diffusion models and 3D Gaussian splatting techniques. Our method effectively bridges the gap between artistic and realistic images through an innovative image semantic transfer algorithm. By leveraging depth information and an initial artistic image, we generate a point cloud map, addressing domain differences. Additionally, we propose a depth consistency module to enhance 3D scene consistency. Finally, the 3D scene serves as initial points for optimizing Gaussian splats. Experimental results demonstrate ART3D's superior performance in both content and structural consistency metrics when compared to existing methods. ART3D significantly advances the field of AI in art creation by providing an innovative solution for generating high-quality 3D artistic scenes.

- **Summary**: Decoding remote sensing images to achieve high perceptual quality, particularly at low bitrates, remains a significant challenge. To address this problem, we propose the invertible neural network-based remote sensing image compression (INN-RSIC) method. Specifically, we capture compression distortion from an existing image compression algorithm and encode it as a set of Gaussian-distributed latent variables via INN. This ensures that the compression distortion in the decoded image becomes independent of the ground truth. Therefore, by leveraging the inverse mapping of INN, we can input the decoded image along with a set of randomly resampled Gaussian distributed variables into the inverse network, effectively generating enhanced images with better perception quality. To effectively learn compression distortion, channel expansion, Haar transformation, and invertible blocks are employed to construct the INN. Additionally, we introduce a quantization module (QM) to mitigate the impact of format conversion, thus enhancing the framework's generalization and improving the perceptual quality of enhanced images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our INN-RSIC significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art traditional and deep learning-based image compression methods in terms of perception quality.

- **Summary**: Large language models have become increasingly prominent, also signaling a shift towards multimodality as the next frontier in artificial intelligence, where their embeddings are harnessed as prompts to generate textual content. Vision-language models (VLMs) stand at the forefront of this advancement, offering innovative ways to combine visual and textual data for enhanced understanding and interaction. However, this integration also enlarges the attack surface. Patch-based adversarial attack is considered the most realistic threat model in physical vision applications, as demonstrated in many existing literature. In this paper, we propose to address patched visual prompt injection, where adversaries exploit adversarial patches to generate target content in VLMs. Our investigation reveals that patched adversarial prompts exhibit sensitivity to pixel-wise randomization, a trait that remains robust even against adaptive attacks designed to counteract such defenses. Leveraging this insight, we introduce SmoothVLM, a defense mechanism rooted in smoothing techniques, specifically tailored to protect VLMs from the threat of patched visual prompt injectors. Our framework significantly lowers the attack success rate to a range between 0% and 5.0% on two leading VLMs, while achieving around 67.3% to 95.0% context recovery of the benign images, demonstrating a balance between security and usability.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Due to the large-scale image size and object variations, current CNN-based and Transformer-based approaches for remote sensing image semantic segmentation are suboptimal for capturing the long-range dependency or limited to the complex computational complexity. In this paper, we propose CM-UNet, comprising a CNN-based encoder for extracting local image features and a Mamba-based decoder for aggregating and integrating global information, facilitating efficient semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. Specifically, a CSMamba block is introduced to build the core segmentation decoder, which employs channel and spatial attention as the gate activation condition of the vanilla Mamba to enhance the feature interaction and global-local information fusion. Moreover, to further refine the output features from the CNN encoder, a Multi-Scale Attention Aggregation (MSAA) module is employed to merge the different scale features. By integrating the CSMamba block and MSAA module, CM-UNet effectively captures the long-range dependencies and multi-scale global contextual information of large-scale remote-sensing images. Experimental results obtained on three benchmarks indicate that the proposed CM-UNet outperforms existing methods in various performance metrics.

- **Summary**: We investigate the learning of implicit neural representation (INR) using an overparameterized multilayer perceptron (MLP) via a novel nonparametric teaching perspective. The latter offers an efficient example selection framework for teaching nonparametrically defined (viz. non-closed-form) target functions, such as image functions defined by 2D grids of pixels. To address the costly training of INRs, we propose a paradigm called Implicit Neural Teaching (INT) that treats INR learning as a nonparametric teaching problem, where the given signal being fitted serves as the target function. The teacher then selects signal fragments for iterative training of the MLP to achieve fast convergence. By establishing a connection between MLP evolution through parameter-based gradient descent and that of function evolution through functional gradient descent in nonparametric teaching, we show for the first time that teaching an overparameterized MLP is consistent with teaching a nonparametric learner. This new discovery readily permits a convenient drop-in of nonparametric teaching algorithms to broadly enhance INR training efficiency, demonstrating 30%+ training time savings across various input modalities.

- **Summary**: Advances in endoscopy use in surgeries face challenges like inadequate lighting. Deep learning, notably the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), holds promise for low-light image enhancement in the medical field. However, DDPMs are computationally demanding and slow, limiting their practical medical applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a lightweight DDPM, dubbed LighTDiff. It adopts a T-shape model architecture to capture global structural information using low-resolution images and gradually recover the details in subsequent denoising steps. We further prone the model to significantly reduce the model size while retaining performance. While discarding certain downsampling operations to save parameters leads to instability and low efficiency in convergence during the training, we introduce a Temporal Light Unit (TLU), a plug-and-play module, for more stable training and better performance. TLU associates time steps with denoised image features, establishing temporal dependencies of the denoising steps and improving denoising outcomes. Moreover, while recovering images using the diffusion model, potential spectral shifts were noted. We further introduce a Chroma Balancer (CB) to mitigate this issue. Our LighTDiff outperforms many competitive LLIE methods with exceptional computational efficiency.

Our approach NeRO uses encoding techniques based on MLPs, significantly improving the performance of the complex details, speeding up the training speed, and reducing neural network size. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through its superior performance, which indicates a promising direction for rendering road surfaces with semantics applications, particularly in applications demanding visualization of road conditions, 4D labeling, and semantic groupings.

- **Summary**: Estimating the 6D pose of an object from a single RGB image is a critical task that becomes additionally challenging when dealing with symmetric objects. Recent approaches typically establish one-to-one correspondences between image pixels and 3D object surface vertices. However, the utilization of one-to-one correspondences introduces ambiguity for symmetric objects. To address this, we propose SymCode, a symmetry-aware surface encoding that encodes the object surface vertices based on one-to-many correspondences, eliminating the problem of one-to-one correspondence ambiguity. We also introduce SymNet, a fast end-to-end network that directly regresses the 6D pose parameters without solving a PnP problem. We demonstrate faster runtime and comparable accuracy achieved by our method on the T-LESS and IC-BIN benchmarks of mostly symmetric objects. Our source code will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Single image super-resolution (SR) is an established pixel-level vision task aimed at reconstructing a high-resolution image from its degraded low-resolution counterpart. Despite the notable advancements achieved by leveraging deep neural networks for SR, most existing deep learning architectures feature an extensive number of layers, leading to high computational complexity and substantial memory demands. These issues become particularly pronounced in the context of infrared image SR, where infrared devices often have stringent storage and computational constraints. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a novel, efficient, and precise single infrared image SR model, termed the Lightweight Information Split Network (LISN). The LISN comprises four main components: shallow feature extraction, deep feature extraction, dense feature fusion, and high-resolution infrared image reconstruction. A key innovation within this model is the introduction of the Lightweight Information Split Block (LISB) for deep feature extraction. The LISB employs a sequential process to extract hierarchical features, which are then aggregated based on the relevance of the features under consideration. By integrating channel splitting and shift operations, the LISB successfully strikes an optimal balance between enhanced SR performance and a lightweight framework. Comprehensive experimental evaluations reveal that the proposed LISN achieves superior performance over contemporary state-of-the-art methods in terms of both SR quality and model complexity, affirming its efficacy for practical deployment in resource-constrained infrared imaging applications.

- **Summary**: In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the 2024 RoboDrive Challenge Robust Map Segmentation Track. The Robust Map Segmentation track focuses on the segmentation of complex driving scene elements in BEV maps under varied driving conditions. Semantic map segmentation provides abundant and precise static environmental information crucial for autonomous driving systems' planning and navigation. While current methods excel in ideal circumstances, e.g., clear daytime conditions and fully functional sensors, their resilience to real-world challenges like adverse weather and sensor failures remains unclear, raising concerns about system safety. In this paper, we explored several methods to improve the robustness of the map segmentation task. The details are as follows: 1) Robustness analysis of utilizing temporal information; 2) Robustness analysis of utilizing different backbones; and 3) Data Augmentation to boost corruption robustness. Based on the evaluation results, we draw several important findings including 1) The temporal fusion module is effective in improving the robustness of the map segmentation model; 2) A strong backbone is effective for improving the corruption robustness; and 3) Some data augmentation methods are effective in improving the robustness of map segmentation models. These novel findings allowed us to achieve promising results in the 2024 RoboDrive Challenge-Robust Map Segmentation Track.

- **Summary**: Automated driving fundamentally requires knowledge about the surrounding geometry of the scene. Modern approaches use only captured images to predict occupancy maps that represent the geometry. Training these approaches requires accurate data that may be acquired with the help of LiDAR scanners. We show that the techniques used for current benchmarks and training datasets to convert LiDAR scans into occupancy grid maps yield very low quality, and subsequently present a novel approach using evidence theory that yields more accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that these are superior by a large margin, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and that we additionally obtain meaningful uncertainty estimates. When converting the occupancy maps back to depth estimates and comparing them with the raw LiDAR measurements, our method yields a MAE improvement of 30% to 52% on nuScenes and 53% on Waymo over other occupancy ground-truth data. Finally, we use the improved occupancy maps to train a state-of-the-art occupancy prediction method and demonstrate that it improves the MAE by 25% on nuScenes.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in multi-view camera-only 3D object detection either rely on an accurate reconstruction of bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D features or on traditional 2D perspective view (PV) image features. While both have their own pros and cons, few have found a way to stitch them together in order to benefit from "the best of both worlds". To this end, we explore a duo space (i.e., BEV and PV) 3D perception framework, in conjunction with some useful duo space fusion strategies that allow effective aggregation of the two feature representations. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed method, DuoSpaceNet, is the first to leverage two distinct feature spaces and achieves the state-of-the-art 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation results on nuScenes dataset.

- **Summary**: Crowd counting and localization have become increasingly important in computer vision due to their wide-ranging applications. While point-based strategies have been widely used in crowd counting methods, they face a significant challenge, i.e., the lack of an effective learning strategy to guide the matching process. This deficiency leads to instability in matching point proposals to target points, adversely affecting overall performance. To address this issue, we introduce an effective approach to stabilize the proposal-target matching in point-based methods. We propose Auxiliary Point Guidance (APG) to provide clear and effective guidance for proposal selection and optimization, addressing the core issue of matching uncertainty. Additionally, we develop Implicit Feature Interpolation (IFI) to enable adaptive feature extraction in diverse crowd scenarios, further enhancing the model's robustness and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing significant improvements in crowd counting and localization performance, particularly under challenging conditions. The source codes and trained models will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: 3D occupancy perception holds a pivotal role in recent vision-centric autonomous driving systems by converting surround-view images into integrated geometric and semantic representations within dense 3D grids. Nevertheless, current models still encounter two main challenges: modeling depth accurately in the 2D-3D view transformation stage, and overcoming the lack of generalizability issues due to sparse LiDAR supervision. To address these issues, this paper presents GEOcc, a Geometric-Enhanced Occupancy network tailored for vision-only surround-view perception. Our approach is three-fold: 1) Integration of explicit lift-based depth prediction and implicit projection-based transformers for depth modeling, enhancing the density and robustness of view transformation. 2) Utilization of mask-based encoder-decoder architecture for fine-grained semantic predictions; 3) Adoption of context-aware self-training loss functions in the pertaining stage to complement LiDAR supervision, involving the re-rendering of 2D depth maps from 3D occupancy features and leveraging image reconstruction loss to obtain denser depth supervision besides sparse LiDAR ground-truths. Our approach achieves State-Of-The-Art performance on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset with the least image resolution needed and the most weightless image backbone compared with current models, marking an improvement of 3.3% due to our proposed contributions. Comprehensive experimentation also demonstrates the consistent superiority of our method over baselines and alternative approaches.

- **Summary**: Object-Centric Learning (OCL) seeks to enable Neural Networks to identify individual objects in visual scenes, which is crucial for interpretable visual comprehension and reasoning. Most existing OCL models adopt auto-encoding structures and learn to decompose visual scenes through specially designed inductive bias, which causes the model to miss small objects during reconstruction. Reverse hierarchy theory proposes that human vision corrects perception errors through a top-down visual pathway that returns to bottom-level neurons and acquires more detailed information, inspired by which we propose Reverse Hierarchy Guided Network (RHGNet) that introduces a top-down pathway that works in different ways in the training and inference processes. This pathway allows for guiding bottom-level features with top-level object representations during training, as well as encompassing information from bottom-level features into perception during inference. Our model achieves SOTA performance on several commonly used datasets including CLEVR, CLEVRTex and MOVi-C. We demonstrate with experiments that our method promotes the discovery of small objects and also generalizes well on complex real-world scenes.

- **Summary**: The crux of Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) lies in modeling dense text-video relations to associate abstract linguistic concepts with dynamic visual contents at pixel-level. Current RVOS methods typically use vision and language models pre-trained independently as backbones. As images and texts are mapped to uncoupled feature spaces, they face the arduous task of learning Vision-Language~(VL) relation modeling from scratch. Witnessing the success of Vision-Language Pre-trained (VLP) models, we propose to learn relation modeling for RVOS based on their aligned VL feature space. Nevertheless, transferring VLP models to RVOS is a deceptively challenging task due to the substantial gap between the pre-training task (image/region-level prediction) and the RVOS task (pixel-level prediction in videos). In this work, we introduce a framework named VLP-RVOS to address this transfer challenge. We first propose a temporal-aware prompt-tuning method, which not only adapts pre-trained representations for pixel-level prediction but also empowers the vision encoder to model temporal clues. We further propose to perform multi-stage VL relation modeling while and after feature extraction for comprehensive VL understanding. Besides, we customize a cube-frame attention mechanism for spatial-temporal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms and exhibits strong generalization abilities.

- **Summary**: Given the power of vision transformers, a new learning paradigm, pre-training and then prompting, makes it more efficient and effective to address downstream visual recognition tasks. In this paper, we identify a novel security threat towards such a paradigm from the perspective of backdoor attacks. Specifically, an extra prompt token, called the switch token in this work, can turn the backdoor mode on, i.e., converting a benign model into a backdoored one. Once under the backdoor mode, a specific trigger can force the model to predict a target class. It poses a severe risk to the users of cloud API, since the malicious behavior can not be activated and detected under the benign mode, thus making the attack very stealthy. To attack a pre-trained model, our proposed attack, named SWARM, learns a trigger and prompt tokens including a switch token. They are optimized with the clean loss which encourages the model always behaves normally even the trigger presents, and the backdoor loss that ensures the backdoor can be activated by the trigger when the switch is on. Besides, we utilize the cross-mode feature distillation to reduce the effect of the switch token on clean samples. The experiments on diverse visual recognition tasks confirm the success of our switchable backdoor attack, i.e., achieving 95%+ attack success rate, and also being hard to be detected and removed.

- **Summary**: With impressive achievements made, artificial intelligence is on the path forward to artificial general intelligence. Sora, developed by OpenAI, which is capable of minute-level world-simulative abilities can be considered as a milestone on this developmental path. However, despite its notable successes, Sora still encounters various obstacles that need to be resolved. In this survey, we embark from the perspective of disassembling Sora in text-to-video generation, and conducting a comprehensive review of literature, trying to answer the question, \textit{From Sora What We Can See}. Specifically, after basic preliminaries regarding the general algorithms are introduced, the literature is categorized from three mutually perpendicular dimensions: evolutionary generators, excellent pursuit, and realistic panorama. Subsequently, the widely used datasets and metrics are organized in detail. Last but more importantly, we identify several challenges and open problems in this domain and propose potential future directions for research and development.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) methods aim to detect audible-only, visible-only, and audible-visible events using only video-level labels. Existing approaches tackle this by leveraging unimodal and cross-modal contexts. However, we argue that while cross-modal learning is beneficial for detecting audible-visible events, in the weakly supervised scenario, it negatively impacts unaligned audible or visible events by introducing irrelevant modality information. In this paper, we propose CoLeaF, a novel learning framework that optimizes the integration of cross-modal context in the embedding space such that the network explicitly learns to combine cross-modal information for audible-visible events while filtering them out for unaligned events. Additionally, as videos often involve complex class relationships, modelling them improves performance. However, this introduces extra computational costs into the network. Our framework is designed to leverage cross-class relationships during training without incurring additional computations at inference. Furthermore, we propose new metrics to better evaluate a method's capabilities in performing AVVP. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CoLeaF significantly improves the state-of-the-art results by an average of 1.9% and 2.4% F-score on the LLP and UnAV-100 datasets, respectively.

- **Summary**: The infant brain undergoes rapid development in the first few years after birth.Compared to cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies can depict the trajectories of infants brain development with higher accuracy, statistical power and flexibility.However, the collection of infant longitudinal magnetic resonance (MR) data suffers a notorious dropout problem, resulting in incomplete datasets with missing time points. This limitation significantly impedes subsequent neuroscience and clinical modeling. Yet, existing deep generative models are facing difficulties in missing brain image completion, due to sparse data and the nonlinear, dramatic contrast/geometric variations in the developing brain. We propose LoCI-DiffCom, a novel Longitudinal Consistency-Informed Diffusion model for infant brain image Completion,which integrates the images from preceding and subsequent time points to guide a diffusion model for generating high-fidelity missing data. Our designed LoCI module can work on highly sparse sequences, relying solely on data from two temporal points. Despite wide separation and diversity between age time points, our approach can extract individualized developmental features while ensuring context-aware consistency. Our experiments on a large infant brain MR dataset demonstrate its effectiveness with consistent performance on missing infant brain MR completion even in big gap scenarios, aiding in better delineation of early developmental trajectories.

- **Summary**: The classification of statements provided by individuals during police interviews is a complex and significant task within the domain of natural language processing (NLP) and legal informatics. The lack of extensive domain-specific datasets raises challenges to the advancement of NLP methods in the field. This paper aims to address some of the present challenges by introducing a novel dataset tailored for classification of statements made during police interviews, prior to court proceedings. Utilising the curated dataset for training and evaluation, we introduce a fine-tuned DistilBERT model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in distinguishing truthful from deceptive statements. To enhance interpretability, we employ explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to offer explainability through saliency maps, that interpret the model's decision-making process. Lastly, we present an XAI interface that empowers both legal professionals and non-specialists to interact with and benefit from our system. Our model achieves an accuracy of 86%, and is shown to outperform a custom transformer architecture in a comparative study. This holistic approach advances the accessibility, transparency, and effectiveness of statement analysis, with promising implications for both legal practice and research.

- **Summary**: Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) is one of the gold standards in vascular disease diagnosing. With the help of contrast agent, time-resolved 2D DSA images deliver comprehensive insights into blood flow information and can be utilized to reconstruct 3D vessel structures. Current commercial DSA systems typically demand hundreds of scanning views to perform reconstruction, resulting in substantial radiation exposure. However, sparse-view DSA reconstruction, aimed at reducing radiation dosage, is still underexplored in the research community. The dynamic blood flow and insufficient input of sparse-view DSA images present significant challenges to the 3D vessel reconstruction task. In this study, we propose to use a time-agnostic vessel probability field to solve this problem effectively. Our approach, termed as vessel probability guided attenuation learning, represents the DSA imaging as a complementary weighted combination of static and dynamic attenuation fields, with the weights derived from the vessel probability field. Functioning as a dynamic mask, vessel probability provides proper gradients for both static and dynamic fields adaptive to different scene types. This mechanism facilitates a self-supervised decomposition between static backgrounds and dynamic contrast agent flow, and significantly improves the reconstruction quality. Our model is trained by minimizing the disparity between synthesized projections and real captured DSA images. We further employ two training strategies to improve our reconstruction quality: (1) coarse-to-fine progressive training to achieve better geometry and (2) temporal perturbed rendering loss to enforce temporal consistency. Experimental results have demonstrated superior quality on both 3D vessel reconstruction and 2D view synthesis.

- **Summary**: Referring image segmentation (RIS) aims to locate the particular region corresponding to the language expression. Existing methods incorporate features from different modalities in a \emph{bottom-up} manner. This design may get some unnecessary image-text pairs, which leads to an inaccurate segmentation mask. In this paper, we propose a referring image segmentation method called HARIS, which introduces the Human-Like Attention mechanism and uses the parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework. To be specific, the Human-Like Attention gets a \emph{feedback} signal from multi-modal features, which makes the network center on the specific objects and discard the irrelevant image-text pairs. Besides, we introduce the PEFT framework to preserve the zero-shot ability of pre-trained encoders. Extensive experiments on three widely used RIS benchmarks and the PhraseCut dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and great zero-shot ability.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce the first comprehensive multilingual sign language dataset named Prompt2Sign, which builds from public data including American Sign Language (ASL) and seven others. Our dataset transforms a vast array of videos into a streamlined, model-friendly format, optimized for training with translation models like seq2seq and text2text. Building on this new dataset, we propose SignLLM, the first multilingual Sign Language Production (SLP) model, which includes two novel multilingual SLP modes that allow for the generation of sign language gestures from input text or prompt. Both of the modes can use a new loss and a module based on reinforcement learning, which accelerates the training by enhancing the model's capability to autonomously sample high-quality data. We present benchmark results of SignLLM, which demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on SLP tasks across eight sign languages.

- **Summary**: Modern diffusion MRI sequences commonly acquire a large number of volumes with diffusion sensitization gradients of differing strengths or directions. Such sequences rely on echo-planar imaging (EPI) to achieve reasonable scan duration. However, EPI is vulnerable to off-resonance effects, leading to tissue susceptibility and eddy-current induced distortions. The latter is particularly problematic because it causes misalignment between volumes, disrupting downstream modelling and analysis. The essential correction of eddy distortions is typically done post-acquisition, with image registration. However, this is non-trivial because correspondence between volumes can be severely disrupted due to volume-specific signal attenuations induced by varying directions and strengths of the applied gradients. This challenge has been successfully addressed by the popular FSL~Eddy tool but at considerable computational cost. We propose an alternative approach, leveraging recent advances in image processing enabled by deep learning (DL). It consists of two convolutional neural networks: 1) An image translator to restore correspondence between images; 2) A registration model to align the translated images. Results demonstrate comparable distortion estimates to FSL~Eddy, while requiring only modest training sample sizes. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to tackle this problem with deep learning. Together with recently developed DL-based susceptibility correction techniques, they pave the way for real-time preprocessing of diffusion MRI, facilitating its wider uptake in the clinic.

One of these topics can be software-related and programming questions. In this work, we focus on the questions which need the understanding of images in addition to the question itself. We introduce the StackOverflowVQA dataset, which includes questions from StackOverflow that have one or more accompanying images. This is the first VQA dataset that focuses on software-related questions and contains multiple human-generated full-sentence answers. Additionally, we provide a baseline for answering the questions with respect to images in the introduced dataset using the GIT model.

- **Summary**: In the past year, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in tasks such as visual question answering, visual understanding and reasoning. However, the extensive model size and high training and inference costs have hindered the widespread application of MLLMs in academia and industry. Thus, studying efficient and lightweight MLLMs has enormous potential, especially in edge computing scenarios. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and systematic review of the current state of efficient MLLMs. Specifically, we summarize the timeline of representative efficient MLLMs, research state of efficient structures and strategies, and the applications. Finally, we discuss the limitations of current efficient MLLM research and promising future directions.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have become a successful approach for solving various image inverse problems by providing a powerful diffusion prior. Many studies tried to combine the measurement into diffusion by score function replacement, matrix decomposition, or optimization algorithms, but it is hard to balance the data consistency and realness. The slow sampling speed is also a main obstacle to its wide application. To address the challenges, we propose Deep Data Consistency (DDC) to update the data consistency step with a deep learning model when solving inverse problems with diffusion models. By analyzing existing methods, the variational bound training objective is used to maximize the conditional posterior and reduce its impact on the diffusion process. In comparison with state-of-the-art methods in linear and non-linear tasks, DDC demonstrates its outstanding performance of both similarity and realness metrics in generating high-quality solutions with only 5 inference steps in 0.77 seconds on average. In addition, the robustness of DDC is well illustrated in the experiments across datasets, with large noise and the capacity to solve multiple tasks in only one pre-trained model.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we aim to reconstruct an n-dimensional real vector from m phaseless measurements corrupted by an additive noise. We extend the noiseless framework developed in [15], based on mirror descent (or Bregman gradient descent), to deal with noisy measurements and prove that the procedure is stable to (small enough) additive noise. In the deterministic case, we show that mirror descent converges to a critical point of the phase retrieval problem, and if the algorithm is well initialized and the noise is small enough, the critical point is near the true vector up to a global sign change. When the measurements are i.i.d Gaussian and the signal-to-noise ratio is large enough, we provide global convergence guarantees that ensure that with high probability, mirror descent converges to a global minimizer near the true vector (up to a global sign change), as soon as the number of measurements m is large enough. The sample complexity bound can be improved if a spectral method is used to provide a good initial guess. We complement our theoretical study with several numerical results showing that mirror descent is both a computationally and statistically efficient scheme to solve the phase retrieval problem.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are among the most widely used machine learning models for computer vision tasks, such as image classification. To improve the efficiency of CNNs, many CNNs compressing approaches have been developed. Low-rank methods approximate the original convolutional kernel with a sequence of smaller convolutional kernels, which leads to reduced storage and time complexities. In this study, we propose a novel low-rank CNNs compression method that is based on reduced storage direct tensor ring decomposition (RSDTR). The proposed method offers a higher circular mode permutation flexibility, and it is characterized by large parameter and FLOPS compression rates, while preserving a good classification accuracy of the compressed network. The experiments, performed on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, clearly demonstrate the efficiency of RSDTR in comparison to other state-of-the-art CNNs compression approaches.

- **Summary**: Earlier diagnosis of Leukemia can save thousands of lives annually. The prognosis of leukemia is challenging without the morphological information of White Blood Cells (WBC) and relies on the accessibility of expensive microscopes and the availability of hematologists to analyze Peripheral Blood Samples (PBS). Deep Learning based methods can be employed to assist hematologists. However, these algorithms require a large amount of labeled data, which is not readily available. To overcome this limitation, we have acquired a realistic, generalized, and large dataset. To collect this comprehensive dataset for real-world applications, two microscopes from two different cost spectrums (high-cost HCM and low-cost LCM) are used for dataset capturing at three magnifications (100x, 40x, 10x) through different sensors (high-end camera for HCM, middle-level camera for LCM and mobile-phone camera for both). The high-sensor camera is 47 times more expensive than the middle-level camera and HCM is 17 times more expensive than LCM. In this collection, using HCM at high resolution (100x), experienced hematologists annotated 10.3k WBC types (14) and artifacts, having 55k morphological labels (Cell Size, Nuclear Chromatin, Nuclear Shape, etc.) from 2.4k images of several PBS leukemia patients. Later on, these annotations are transferred to other 2 magnifications of HCM, and 3 magnifications of LCM, and on each camera captured images. Along with the LeukemiaAttri dataset, we provide baselines over multiple object detectors and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) strategies, along with morphological information-based attribute prediction. The dataset will be publicly available after publication to facilitate the research in this direction.

- **Summary**: Spatio-temporal action detection (STAD) is an important fine-grained video understanding task. Current methods require box and label supervision for all action classes in advance. However, in real-world applications, it is very likely to come across new action classes not seen in training because the action category space is large and hard to enumerate. Also, the cost of data annotation and model training for new classes is extremely high for traditional methods, as we need to perform detailed box annotations and re-train the whole network from scratch. In this paper, we propose a new challenging setting by performing open-vocabulary STAD to better mimic the situation of action detection in an open world. Open-vocabulary spatio-temporal action detection (OV-STAD) requires training a model on a limited set of base classes with box and label supervision, which is expected to yield good generalization performance on novel action classes. For OV-STAD, we build two benchmarks based on the existing STAD datasets and propose a simple but effective method based on pretrained video-language models (VLM). To better adapt the holistic VLM for the fine-grained action detection task, we carefully fine-tune it on the localized video region-text pairs. This customized fine-tuning endows the VLM with better motion understanding, thus contributing to a more accurate alignment between video regions and texts. Local region feature and global video feature fusion before alignment is adopted to further improve the action detection performance by providing global context. Our method achieves a promising performance on novel classes.

- **Summary**: Background and purpose: Deep Learning (DL) has been widely explored for Organs at Risk (OARs) segmentation; however, most studies have focused on a single modality, either CT or MRI, not both simultaneously. This study presents a high-performing DL pipeline for segmentation of 30 OARs from MRI and CT scans of Head and Neck (H&N) cancer patients.   Materials and methods: Paired CT and MRI-T1 images from 42 H&N cancer patients alongside annotation for 30 OARs from the H&N OAR CT & MR segmentation challenge dataset were used to develop a segmentation pipeline. After cropping irrelevant regions, rigid followed by non-rigid registration of CT and MRI volumes was performed. Two versions of the CT volume, representing soft tissues and bone anatomy, were stacked with the MRI volume and used as input to an nnU-Net pipeline. Modality Dropout was used during the training to force the model to learn from the different modalities. Segmentation masks were predicted with the trained model for an independent set of 14 new patients. The mean Dice Score (DS) and Hausdorff Distance (HD) were calculated for each OAR across these patients to evaluate the pipeline.   Results: This resulted in an overall mean DS and HD of 0.777 +- 0.118 and 3.455 +- 1.679, respectively, establishing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) for this challenge at the time of submission.   Conclusion: The proposed pipeline achieved the best DS and HD among all participants of the H&N OAR CT and MR segmentation challenge and sets a new SOTA for automated segmentation of H&N OARs.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in text-to-image generation using diffusion models have significantly improved the quality of generated images and expanded the ability to depict a wide range of objects. However, ensuring that these models adhere closely to the text prompts remains a considerable challenge. This issue is particularly pronounced when trying to generate photorealistic images of humans. Without significant prompt engineering efforts models often produce unrealistic images and typically fail to incorporate the full extent of the prompt information. This limitation can be largely attributed to the nature of captions accompanying the images used in training large scale diffusion models, which typically prioritize contextual information over details related to the person's appearance. In this paper we address this issue by introducing a training-free pipeline designed to generate accurate appearance descriptions from images of people. We apply this method to create approximately 250,000 captions for publicly available face datasets. We then use these synthetic captions to fine-tune a text-to-image diffusion model. Our results demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the model's ability to generate high-quality, realistic human faces and enhances adherence to the given prompts, compared to the baseline model. We share our synthetic captions, pretrained checkpoints and training code.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel approach to the digital signing of electronic documents through the use of a camera-based interaction system, single-finger tracking for sign recognition, and multi commands executing hand gestures. The proposed solution, referred to as "Air Signature," involves writing the signature in front of the camera, rather than relying on traditional methods such as mouse drawing or physically signing on paper and showing it to a web camera. The goal is to develop a state-of-the-art method for detecting and tracking gestures and objects in real-time. The proposed methods include applying existing gesture recognition and object tracking systems, improving accuracy through smoothing and line drawing, and maintaining continuity during fast finger movements. An evaluation of the fingertip detection, sketching, and overall signing process is performed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed solution. The secondary objective of this research is to develop a model that can effectively recognize the unique signature of a user. This type of signature can be verified by neural cores that analyze the movement, speed, and stroke pixels of the signing in real time. The neural cores use machine learning algorithms to match air signatures to the individual's stored signatures, providing a secure and efficient method of verification. Our proposed System does not require sensors or any hardware other than the camera.

- **Summary**: Objectives: This work aims to explore the impact of multicenter data heterogeneity on deep learning brain metastases (BM) autosegmentation performance, and assess the efficacy of an incremental transfer learning technique, namely learning without forgetting (LWF), to improve model generalizability without sharing raw data.   Materials and methods: A total of six BM datasets from University Hospital Erlangen (UKER), University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Stanford, UCSF, NYU and BraTS Challenge 2023 on BM segmentation were used for this evaluation. First, the multicenter performance of a convolutional neural network (DeepMedic) for BM autosegmentation was established for exclusive single-center training and for training on pooled data, respectively. Subsequently bilateral collaboration was evaluated, where a UKER pretrained model is shared to another center for further training using transfer learning (TL) either with or without LWF.   Results: For single-center training, average F1 scores of BM detection range from 0.625 (NYU) to 0.876 (UKER) on respective single-center test data. Mixed multicenter training notably improves F1 scores at Stanford and NYU, with negligible improvement at other centers. When the UKER pretrained model is applied to USZ, LWF achieves a higher average F1 score (0.839) than naive TL (0.570) and single-center training (0.688) on combined UKER and USZ test data. Naive TL improves sensitivity and contouring accuracy, but compromises precision. Conversely, LWF demonstrates commendable sensitivity, precision and contouring accuracy. When applied to Stanford, similar performance was observed.   Conclusion: Data heterogeneity results in varying performance in BM autosegmentation, posing challenges to model generalizability. LWF is a promising approach to peer-to-peer privacy-preserving model training.

- **Summary**: Glioblastoma is the most common primary adult brain tumor, with a grim prognosis - median survival of 12-18 months following treatment, and 4 months otherwise. Glioblastoma is widely infiltrative in the cerebral hemispheres and well-defined by heterogeneous molecular and micro-environmental histopathologic profiles, which pose a major obstacle in treatment. Correctly diagnosing these tumors and assessing their heterogeneity is crucial for choosing the precise treatment and potentially enhancing patient survival rates. In the gold-standard histopathology-based approach to tumor diagnosis, detecting various morpho-pathological features of distinct histology throughout digitized tissue sections is crucial. Such "features" include the presence of cellular tumor, geographic necrosis, pseudopalisading necrosis, areas abundant in microvascular proliferation, infiltration into the cortex, wide extension in subcortical white matter, leptomeningeal infiltration, regions dense with macrophages, and the presence of perivascular or scattered lymphocytes. With these features in mind and building upon the main aim of the BraTS Cluster of Challenges https://www.synapse.org/brats2024, the goal of the BraTS-Path challenge is to provide a systematically prepared comprehensive dataset and a benchmarking environment to develop and fairly compare deep-learning models capable of identifying tumor sub-regions of distinct histologic profile. These models aim to further our understanding of the disease and assist in the diagnosis and grading of conditions in a consistent manner.

- **Summary**: The goal of image registration is to establish spatial correspondence between two or more images, traditionally through dense displacement fields (DDFs) or parametric transformations (e.g., rigid, affine, and splines). Rethinking the existing paradigms of achieving alignment via spatial transformations, we uncover an alternative but more intuitive correspondence representation: a set of corresponding regions-of-interest (ROI) pairs, which we demonstrate to have sufficient representational capability as other correspondence representation methods.Further, it is neither necessary nor sufficient for these ROIs to hold specific anatomical or semantic significance. In turn, we formulate image registration as searching for the same set of corresponding ROIs from both moving and fixed images - in other words, two multi-class segmentation tasks on a pair of images. For a general-purpose and practical implementation, we integrate the segment anything model (SAM) into our proposed algorithms, resulting in a SAM-enabled registration (SAMReg) that does not require any training data, gradient-based fine-tuning or engineered prompts. We experimentally show that the proposed SAMReg is capable of segmenting and matching multiple ROI pairs, which establish sufficiently accurate correspondences, in three clinical applications of registering prostate MR, cardiac MR and abdominal CT images. Based on metrics including Dice and target registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration outperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and DDF-predicting learning-based networks, even yielding competitive performance with weakly-supervised registration which requires fully-segmented training data.

- **Summary**: Most existing methods often rely on complex models to predict scene depth with high accuracy, resulting in slow inference that is not conducive to deployment. To better balance precision and speed, we first designed SmallDepth based on sparsity. Second, to enhance the feature representation ability of SmallDepth during training under the condition of equal complexity during inference, we propose an equivalent transformation module(ETM). Third, to improve the ability of each layer in the case of a fixed SmallDepth to perceive different context information and improve the robustness of SmallDepth to the left-right direction and illumination changes, we propose pyramid loss. Fourth, to further improve the accuracy of SmallDepth, we utilized the proposed function approximation loss (APX) to transfer knowledge in the pretrained HQDecv2, obtained by optimizing the previous HQDec to address grid artifacts in some regions, to SmallDepth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that each proposed component improves the precision of SmallDepth without changing the complexity of SmallDepth during inference, and the developed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on KITTI at an inference speed of more than 500 frames per second and with approximately 2 M parameters. The code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/fwucas/FA-Depth.

- **Summary**: In recent years, various large foundation models have been proposed for image segmentation. There models are often trained on large amounts of data corresponding to general computer vision tasks. Hence, these models do not perform well on medical data. There have been some attempts in the literature to perform parameter-efficient finetuning of such foundation models for medical image segmentation. However, these approaches assume that all the parameters of the model are available for adaptation. But, in many cases, these models are released as APIs or blackboxes, with no or limited access to the model parameters and data. In addition, finetuning methods also require a significant amount of compute, which may not be available for the downstream task. At the same time, medical data can't be shared with third-party agents for finetuning due to privacy reasons. To tackle these challenges, we pioneer a blackbox adaptation technique for prompted medical image segmentation, called BAPS. BAPS has two components - (i) An Image-Prompt decoder (IP decoder) module that generates visual prompts given an image and a prompt, and (ii) A Zero Order Optimization (ZOO) Method, called SPSA-GC that is used to update the IP decoder without the need for backpropagating through the foundation model. Thus, our method does not require any knowledge about the foundation model's weights or gradients. We test BAPS on four different modalities and show that our method can improve the original model's performance by around 4%.

- **Summary**: Modeling the shape of garments has received much attention, but most existing approaches assume the garments to be worn by someone, which constrains the range of shapes they can assume. In this work, we address shape recovery when garments are being manipulated instead of worn, which gives rise to an even larger range of possible shapes. To this end, we leverage the implicit sewing patterns (ISP) model for garment modeling and extend it by adding a diffusion-based deformation prior to represent these shapes. To recover 3D garment shapes from incomplete 3D point clouds acquired when the garment is folded, we map the points to UV space, in which our priors are learned, to produce partial UV maps, and then fit the priors to recover complete UV maps and 2D to 3D mappings. Experimental results demonstrate the superior reconstruction accuracy of our method compared to previous ones, especially when dealing with large non-rigid deformations arising from the manipulations.

- **Summary**: Self-distillation methods using Siamese networks are popular for self-supervised pre-training. DINO is one such method based on a cross-entropy loss between $K$-dimensional probability vectors, obtained by applying a softmax function to the dot product between representations and learnt prototypes. Given the fact that the learned representations are $L^2$-normalized, we show that DINO and its derivatives, such as iBOT, can be interpreted as a mixture model of von Mises-Fisher components. With this interpretation, DINO assumes equal precision for all components when the prototypes are also $L^2$-normalized. Using this insight we propose DINO-vMF, that adds appropriate normalization constants when computing the cluster assignment probabilities. Unlike DINO, DINO-vMF is stable also for the larger ViT-Base model with unnormalized prototypes. We show that the added flexibility of the mixture model is beneficial in terms of better image representations. The DINO-vMF pre-trained model consistently performs better than DINO on a range of downstream tasks. We obtain similar improvements for iBOT-vMF vs iBOT and thereby show the relevance of our proposed modification also for other methods derived from DINO.

- **Summary**: 3D urban scene reconstruction and modelling is a crucial research area in remote sensing with numerous applications in academia, commerce, industry, and administration. Recent advancements in view synthesis models have facilitated photorealistic 3D reconstruction solely from 2D images. Leveraging Google Earth imagery, we construct a 3D Gaussian Splatting model of the Waterloo region centered on the University of Waterloo and are able to achieve view-synthesis results far exceeding previous 3D view-synthesis results based on neural radiance fields which we demonstrate in our benchmark. Additionally, we retrieved the 3D geometry of the scene using the 3D point cloud extracted from the 3D Gaussian Splatting model which we benchmarked against our Multi- View-Stereo dense reconstruction of the scene, thereby reconstructing both the 3D geometry and photorealistic lighting of the large-scale urban scene through 3D Gaussian Splatting

- **Summary**: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a widely-used technique in the fields of bio-medicine, chemistry, and biology for the analysis of chemicals and proteins. The signals from NMR spectroscopy often have low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to acquisition noise, which poses significant challenges for subsequent analysis. Recent work has explored the potential of deep learning (DL) for NMR denoising, showing significant performance gains over traditional methods such as total variation (TV) denoising. This paper shows that the performance of DL denoising for NMR can be further improved by combining data-driven training with traditional TV denoising. The proposed TVCondNet method outperforms both traditional TV and DL methods by including the TV solution as a condition during DL training. Our validation on experimentally collected NMR data shows the superior denoising performance and faster inference speed of TVCondNet compared to existing methods.

- **Summary**: The primary objective of methods in continual learning is to learn tasks in a sequential manner over time from a stream of data, while mitigating the detrimental phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we focus on learning an optimal representation between previous class prototypes and newly encountered ones. We propose a prototypical network with a Bayesian learning-driven contrastive loss (BLCL) tailored specifically for class-incremental learning scenarios. Therefore, we introduce a contrastive loss that incorporates new classes into the latent representation by reducing the intra-class distance and increasing the inter-class distance. Our approach dynamically adapts the balance between the cross-entropy and contrastive loss functions with a Bayesian learning technique. Empirical evaluations conducted on both the CIFAR-10 dataset for image classification and images of a GNSS-based dataset for interference classification validate the efficacy of our method, showcasing its superiority over existing state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: We explore the field of wildlife re-identification by implementing an MLP from scratch using NumPy, A DCNN using Keras, and a binary classifier with LightGBM for the purpose of learning for an assignment. Analyzing the performance of multiple models on multiple datasets. We attempt to replicate prior research in metric learning for wildlife re-identification. Firstly, we find that the usage of MLPs trained for classification, then removing the output layer and using the second last layer as an embedding was not a successful strategy for similar learning; it seems like losses designed for embeddings such as triplet loss are required. The DCNNS performed well on some datasets but poorly on others, which did not align with findings in previous literature. The LightGBM classifier overfitted too heavily and was not significantly better than a constant model when trained and evaluated on all pairs using accuracy as a metric. The technical implementations used seem to match standards according to comparisons with documentation examples and good results on certain datasets. However, there is still more to explore in regards to being able to fully recreate past literature.

- **Summary**: Motion in-betweening, a fundamental task in character animation, consists of generating motion sequences that plausibly interpolate user-provided keyframe constraints. It has long been recognized as a labor-intensive and challenging process. We investigate the potential of diffusion models in generating diverse human motions guided by keyframes. Unlike previous inbetweening methods, we propose a simple unified model capable of generating precise and diverse motions that conform to a flexible range of user-specified spatial constraints, as well as text conditioning. To this end, we propose Conditional Motion Diffusion In-betweening (CondMDI) which allows for arbitrary dense-or-sparse keyframe placement and partial keyframe constraints while generating high-quality motions that are diverse and coherent with the given keyframes. We evaluate the performance of CondMDI on the text-conditioned HumanML3D dataset and demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of diffusion models for keyframe in-betweening. We further explore the use of guidance and imputation-based approaches for inference-time keyframing and compare CondMDI against these methods.
