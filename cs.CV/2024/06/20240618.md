- **Summary**: The last decade of computer vision has been dominated by Deep Learning architectures, thanks to their unparalleled success. Their performance, however, often comes at the cost of explainability owing to their highly non-linear nature. Consequently, a parallel field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has developed with the aim of generating insights regarding the decision making process of deep learning models. An important problem in XAI is that of the generation of saliency maps. These are regions in an input image which contributed most towards the model's final decision. Most work in this regard, however, has been focused on image classification, and image segmentation - despite being a ubiquitous task - has not received the same attention. In the present work, we propose MiSuRe (Minimally Sufficient Region) as an algorithm to generate saliency maps for image segmentation. The goal of the saliency maps generated by MiSuRe is to get rid of irrelevant regions, and only highlight those regions in the input image which are crucial to the image segmentation decision. We perform our analysis on 3 datasets: Triangle (artificially constructed), COCO-2017 (natural images), and the Synapse multi-organ (medical images). Additionally, we identify a potential usecase of these post-hoc saliency maps in order to perform post-hoc reliability of the segmentation model.

- **Summary**: Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies in the world. While deep learning has potential to further improve computer-aided prostate cancer detection on MRI, its efficacy hinges on the exhaustive curation of manually annotated images. We propose a novel methodology of semisupervised learning (SSL) guided by automatically extracted clinical information, specifically the lesion locations in radiology reports, allowing for use of unannotated images to reduce the annotation burden. By leveraging lesion locations, we refined pseudo labels, which were then used to train our location-based SSL model. We show that our SSL method can improve prostate lesion detection by utilizing unannotated images, with more substantial impacts being observed when larger proportions of unannotated images are used.

- **Summary**: Repetitive action counting quantifies the frequency of specific actions performed by individuals. However, existing action-counting datasets have limited action diversity, potentially hampering model performance on unseen actions. To address this issue, we propose a framework called First Cycle Annotated Repetitive Action Counting (FCA-RAC). This framework contains 4 parts: 1) a labeling technique that annotates each training video with the start and end of the first action cycle, along with the total action count. This technique enables the model to capture the correlation between the initial action cycle and subsequent actions; 2) an adaptive sampling strategy that maximizes action information retention by adjusting to the speed of the first annotated action cycle in videos; 3) a Multi-Temporal Granularity Convolution (MTGC) module, that leverages the muli-scale first action as a kernel to convolve across the entire video. This enables the model to capture action variations at different time scales within the video; 4) a strategy called Training Knowledge Augmentation (TKA) that exploits the annotated first action cycle information from the entire dataset. This allows the network to harness shared characteristics across actions effectively, thereby enhancing model performance and generalizability to unseen actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior outcomes on RepCount-A and related datasets, highlighting the efficacy of our framework in improving model performance on seen and unseen actions. Our paper makes significant contributions to the field of action counting by addressing the limitations of existing datasets and proposing novel techniques for improving model generalizability.

- **Summary**: Image-to-fMRI encoding is important for both neuroscience research and practical applications. However, such "Brain-Encoders" have been typically trained per-subject and per fMRI-dataset, thus restricted to very limited training data. In this paper we propose a Universal Brain-Encoder, which can be trained jointly on data from many different subjects/datasets/machines. What makes this possible is our new voxel-centric Encoder architecture, which learns a unique "voxel-embedding" per brain-voxel. Our Encoder trains to predict the response of each brain-voxel on every image, by directly computing the cross-attention between the brain-voxel embedding and multi-level deep image features. This voxel-centric architecture allows the functional role of each brain-voxel to naturally emerge from the voxel-image cross-attention. We show the power of this approach to (i) combine data from multiple different subjects (a "Crowd of Brains") to improve each individual brain-encoding, (ii) quick & effective Transfer-Learning across subjects, datasets, and machines (e.g., 3-Tesla, 7-Tesla), with few training examples, and (iii) use the learned voxel-embeddings as a powerful tool to explore brain functionality (e.g., what is encoded where in the brain).



### Unlocking the Potential of Early Epochs: Uncertainty-aware CT Metal Artifact Reduction

- **Summary**: In computed tomography (CT), the presence of metallic implants in patients often leads to disruptive artifacts in the reconstructed images, hindering accurate diagnosis. Recently, a large amount of supervised deep learning-based approaches have been proposed for metal artifact reduction (MAR). However, these methods neglect the influence of initial training weights. In this paper, we have discovered that the uncertainty image computed from the restoration result of initial training weights can effectively highlight high-frequency regions, including metal artifacts. This observation can be leveraged to assist the MAR network in removing metal artifacts. Therefore, we propose an uncertainty constraint (UC) loss that utilizes the uncertainty image as an adaptive weight to guide the MAR network to focus on the metal artifact region, leading to improved restoration. The proposed UC loss is designed to be a plug-and-play method, compatible with any MAR framework, and easily adoptable. To validate the effectiveness of the UC loss, we conduct extensive experiments on the public available Deeplesion and CLINIC-metal dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the UC loss further optimizes the network training process and significantly improves the removal of metal artifacts.

- **Summary**: Fine-tuning pre-trained language models, particularly large language models, demands extensive computing resources and can result in varying performance outcomes across different domains and datasets. This paper examines the approach of integrating multiple models from diverse training scenarios into a unified model. This unified model excels across various data domains and exhibits the ability to generalize well on out-of-domain data. We propose a knowledge fusion method named Evolver, inspired by evolutionary algorithms, which does not need further training or additional training data. Specifically, our method involves aggregating the weights of different language models into a population and subsequently generating offspring models through mutation and crossover operations. These offspring models are then evaluated against their parents, allowing for the preservation of those models that show enhanced performance on development datasets. Importantly, our model evolving strategy can be seamlessly integrated with existing model merging frameworks, offering a versatile tool for model enhancement. Experimental results on mainstream language models (i.e., encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder) reveal that Evolver outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by large margins. The code is publicly available at {https://github.com/duguodong7/model-evolution}.

- **Summary**: This report presents our team's 'PCIE_LAM' solution for the Ego4D Looking At Me Challenge at CVPR2024. The main goal of the challenge is to accurately determine if a person in the scene is looking at the camera wearer, based on a video where the faces of social partners have been localized. Our proposed solution, InternLSTM, consists of an InternVL image encoder and a Bi-LSTM network. The InternVL extracts spatial features, while the Bi-LSTM extracts temporal features. However, this task is highly challenging due to the distance between the person in the scene and the camera movement, which results in significant blurring in the face image. To address the complexity of the task, we implemented a Gaze Smoothing filter to eliminate noise or spikes from the output. Our approach achieved the 1st position in the looking at me challenge with 0.81 mAP and 0.93 accuracy rate. Code is available at https://github.com/KanokphanL/Ego4D_LAM_InternLSTM

- **Summary**: Driving systems often rely on high-definition (HD) maps for precise environmental information, which is crucial for planning and navigation. While current HD map constructors perform well under ideal conditions, their resilience to real-world challenges, \eg, adverse weather and sensor failures, is not well understood, raising safety concerns. This work introduces MapBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of HD map construction methods against various sensor corruptions. Our benchmark encompasses a total of 29 types of corruptions that occur from cameras and LiDAR sensors. Extensive evaluations across 31 HD map constructors reveal significant performance degradation of existing methods under adverse weather conditions and sensor failures, underscoring critical safety concerns. We identify effective strategies for enhancing robustness, including innovative approaches that leverage multi-modal fusion, advanced data augmentation, and architectural techniques. These insights provide a pathway for developing more reliable HD map construction methods, which are essential for the advancement of autonomous driving technology. The benchmark toolkit and affiliated code and model checkpoints have been made publicly accessible.

- **Summary**: Transformers have established themselves as the leading neural network model in natural language processing and are increasingly foundational in various domains. In vision, the MLP-Mixer model has demonstrated competitive performance, suggesting that attention mechanisms might not be indispensable. Inspired by this, recent research has explored replacing attention modules with other mechanisms, including those described by MetaFormers. However, the theoretical framework for these models remains underdeveloped. This paper proposes a novel perspective by integrating Krotov's hierarchical associative memory with MetaFormers, enabling a comprehensive representation of the entire Transformer block, encompassing token-/channel-mixing modules, layer normalization, and skip connections, as a single Hopfield network. This approach yields a parallelized MLP-Mixer derived from a three-layer Hopfield network, which naturally incorporates symmetric token-/channel-mixing modules and layer normalization. Empirical studies reveal that symmetric interaction matrices in the model hinder performance in image recognition tasks. Introducing symmetry-breaking effects transitions the performance of the symmetric parallelized MLP-Mixer to that of the vanilla MLP-Mixer. This indicates that during standard training, weight matrices of the vanilla MLP-Mixer spontaneously acquire a symmetry-breaking configuration, enhancing their effectiveness. These findings offer insights into the intrinsic properties of Transformers and MLP-Mixers and their theoretical underpinnings, providing a robust framework for future model design and optimization.

- **Comment**: CVPR2024 Foundational Few-Shot Object Detection Challenge
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: This report introduces an enhanced method for the Foundational Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) task, leveraging the vision-language model (VLM) for object detection. However, on specific datasets, VLM may encounter the problem where the detected targets are misaligned with the target concepts of interest. This misalignment hinders the zero-shot performance of VLM and the application of fine-tuning methods based on pseudo-labels. To address this issue, we propose the VLM+ framework, which integrates the multimodal large language model (MM-LLM). Specifically, we use MM-LLM to generate a series of referential expressions for each category. Based on the VLM predictions and the given annotations, we select the best referential expression for each category by matching the maximum IoU. Subsequently, we use these referential expressions to generate pseudo-labels for all images in the training set and then combine them with the original labeled data to fine-tune the VLM. Additionally, we employ iterative pseudo-label generation and optimization to further enhance the performance of the VLM. Our approach achieve 32.56 mAP in the final test.

- **Summary**: Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) stands at the intersection of computer vision and speech recognition, aiming to interpret spoken content from visual cues. A prominent challenge in VSR is the presence of homophenes-visually similar lip gestures that represent different phonemes. Prior approaches have sought to distinguish fine-grained visemes by aligning visual and auditory semantics, but often fell short of full synchronization. To address this, we present SyncVSR, an end-to-end learning framework that leverages quantized audio for frame-level crossmodal supervision. By integrating a projection layer that synchronizes visual representation with acoustic data, our encoder learns to generate discrete audio tokens from a video sequence in a non-autoregressive manner. SyncVSR shows versatility across tasks, languages, and modalities at the cost of a forward pass. Our empirical evaluations show that it not only achieves state-of-the-art results but also reduces data usage by up to ninefold.

- **Summary**: Towards open-ended Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), existing methods often exhibit biased detection when faced with challenging or unseen events and lack interpretability. To address these drawbacks, we propose Holmes-VAD, a novel framework that leverages precise temporal supervision and rich multimodal instructions to enable accurate anomaly localization and comprehensive explanations. Firstly, towards unbiased and explainable VAD system, we construct the first large-scale multimodal VAD instruction-tuning benchmark, i.e., VAD-Instruct50k. This dataset is created using a carefully designed semi-automatic labeling paradigm. Efficient single-frame annotations are applied to the collected untrimmed videos, which are then synthesized into high-quality analyses of both abnormal and normal video clips using a robust off-the-shelf video captioner and a large language model (LLM). Building upon the VAD-Instruct50k dataset, we develop a customized solution for interpretable video anomaly detection. We train a lightweight temporal sampler to select frames with high anomaly response and fine-tune a multimodal large language model (LLM) to generate explanatory content. Extensive experimental results validate the generality and interpretability of the proposed Holmes-VAD, establishing it as a novel interpretable technique for real-world video anomaly analysis. To support the community, our benchmark and model will be publicly available at https://github.com/pipixin321/HolmesVAD.

- **Comment**: Code is available in https://github.com/ByungKwanLee/TroL
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Large language and vision models (LLVMs) have been driven by the generalization power of large language models (LLMs) and the advent of visual instruction tuning. Along with scaling them up directly, these models enable LLVMs to showcase powerful vision language (VL) performances by covering diverse tasks via natural language instructions. However, existing open-source LLVMs that perform comparably to closed-source LLVMs such as GPT-4V are often considered too large (e.g., 26B, 34B, and 110B parameters), having a larger number of layers. These large models demand costly, high-end resources for both training and inference. To address this issue, we present a new efficient LLVM family with 1.8B, 3.8B, and 7B LLM model sizes, Traversal of Layers (TroL), which enables the reuse of layers in a token-wise manner. This layer traversing technique simulates the effect of looking back and retracing the answering stream while increasing the number of forward propagation layers without physically adding more layers. We demonstrate that TroL employs a simple layer traversing approach yet efficiently outperforms the open-source LLVMs with larger model sizes and rivals the performances of the closed-source LLVMs with substantial sizes.

- **Summary**: 2D single-slice abdominal computed tomography (CT) enables the assessment of body habitus and organ health with low radiation exposure. However, single-slice data necessitates the use of 2D networks for segmentation, but these networks often struggle to capture contextual information effectively. Consequently, even when trained on identical datasets, 3D networks typically achieve superior segmentation results. In this work, we propose a novel 3D-to-2D distillation framework, leveraging pre-trained 3D models to enhance 2D single-slice segmentation. Specifically, we extract the prediction distribution centroid from the 3D representations, to guide the 2D student by learning intra- and inter-class correlation. Unlike traditional knowledge distillation methods that require the same data input, our approach employs unpaired 3D CT scans with any contrast to guide the 2D student model. Experiments conducted on 707 subjects from the single-slice Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) dataset demonstrate that state-of-the-art 2D multi-organ segmentation methods can benefit from the 3D teacher model, achieving enhanced performance in single-slice multi-organ segmentation. Notably, our approach demonstrates considerable efficacy in low-data regimes, outperforming the model trained with all available training subjects even when utilizing only 200 training subjects. Thus, this work underscores the potential to alleviate manual annotation burdens.

- **Summary**: In this report, we present our champion solution for EPIC-KITCHENS-100 Multi-Instance Retrieval Challenge in CVPR 2024. Essentially, this challenge differs from traditional visual-text retrieval tasks by providing a correlation matrix that acts as a set of soft labels for video-text clip combinations. However, existing loss functions have not fully exploited this information. Motivated by this, we propose a novel loss function, Symmetric Multi-Similarity Loss, which offers a more precise learning objective. Together with tricks and ensemble learning, the model achieves 63.76% average mAP and 74.25% average nDCG on the public leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel perspective for enhancing anti-spoofing performance in zero-shot data domain generalization. Unlike traditional image classification tasks, face anti-spoofing datasets display unique generalization characteristics, necessitating novel zero-shot data domain generalization. One step forward to the previous frame-wise spoofing prediction, we introduce a nuanced metric calculation that aggregates frame-level probabilities for a video-wise prediction, to tackle the gap between the reported frame-wise accuracy and instability in real-world use-case. This approach enables the quantification of bias and variance in model predictions, offering a more refined analysis of model generalization. Our investigation reveals that simply scaling up the backbone of models does not inherently improve the mentioned instability, leading us to propose an ensembled backbone method from a Bayesian perspective. The probabilistically ensembled backbone both improves model robustness measured from the proposed metric and spoofing accuracy, and also leverages the advantages of measuring uncertainty, allowing for enhanced sampling during training that contributes to model generalization across new datasets. We evaluate the proposed method from the benchmark OMIC dataset and also the public CelebA-Spoof and SiW-Mv2. Our final model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across the datasets, showcasing advancements in Bias, Variance, HTER, and AUC metrics.

- **Summary**: The Agriculture-Vision Challenge at CVPR 2024 aims at leveraging semantic segmentation models to produce pixel level semantic segmentation labels within regions of interest for multi-modality satellite images. It is one of the most famous and competitive challenges for global researchers to break the boundary between computer vision and agriculture sectors. However, there is a serious class imbalance problem in the agriculture-vision dataset, which hinders the semantic segmentation performance. To solve this problem, firstly, we propose a mosaic data augmentation with a rare class sampling strategy to enrich long-tail class samples. Secondly, we employ an adaptive class weight scheme to suppress the contribution of the common classes while increasing the ones of rare classes. Thirdly, we propose a probability post-process to increase the predicted value of the rare classes. Our methodology achieved a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score of 0.547 on the test set, securing second place in this challenge.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various multi-modal tasks, but they are often bottlenecked by the limited context window and high computational cost of processing high-resolution image inputs and videos. Vision compression can alleviate this problem by reducing the vision token count. Previous approaches compress vision tokens with external modules and force LLMs to understand the compressed ones, leading to visual information loss. However, the LLMs' understanding paradigm of vision tokens is not fully utilised in the compression learning process. We propose VoCo-LLaMA, the first approach to compress vision tokens using LLMs. By introducing Vision Compression tokens during the vision instruction tuning phase and leveraging attention distillation, our method distill how LLMs comprehend vision tokens into their processing of VoCo tokens. VoCo-LLaMA facilitates effective vision compression and improves the computational efficiency during the inference stage. Specifically, our method achieves minimal performance loss with a compression ratio of 576$\times$, resulting in up to 94.8$\%$ fewer FLOPs and 69.6$\%$ acceleration in inference time. Furthermore, through continuous training using time-series compressed token sequences of video frames, VoCo-LLaMA demonstrates the ability to understand temporal correlations, outperforming previous methods on popular video question-answering benchmarks. Our approach presents a promising way to unlock the full potential of VLMs' contextual window, enabling more scalable multi-modal applications.

- **Summary**: The detection of small objects in aerial images is a fundamental task in the field of computer vision. Moving objects in aerial photography have problems such as different shapes and sizes, dense overlap, occlusion by the background, and object blur, however, the original YOLO algorithm has low overall detection accuracy due to its weak ability to perceive targets of different scales. In order to improve the detection accuracy of densely overlapping small targets and fuzzy targets, this paper proposes a dynamic-attention scale-sequence fusion algorithm (DASSF) for small target detection in aerial images. First, we propose a dynamic scale sequence feature fusion (DSSFF) module that improves the up-sampling mechanism and reduces computational load. Secondly, a x-small object detection head is specially added to enhance the detection capability of small targets. Finally, in order to improve the expressive ability of targets of different types and sizes, we use the dynamic head (DyHead). The model we proposed solves the problem of small target detection in aerial images and can be applied to multiple different versions of the YOLO algorithm, which is universal. Experimental results show that when the DASSF method is applied to YOLOv8, compared to YOLOv8n, on the VisDrone-2019 and DIOR datasets, the model shows an increase of 9.2% and 2.4% in the mean average precision (mAP), respectively, and outperforms the current mainstream methods.

- **Summary**: Designing for manufacturing poses significant challenges in part due to the computation bottleneck of Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) simulations. Although deep learning as an alternative offers fast inference, its performance is dependently bounded by the need for abundant training data. Representation learning, particularly through pre-training, offers promise for few-shot learning, aiding in manufacturability tasks where data can be limited. This work introduces VIRL, a Volume-Informed Representation Learning approach to pre-train a 3D geometric encoder. The pretrained model is evaluated across four manufacturability indicators obtained from CAM simulations: subtractive machining (SM) time, additive manufacturing (AM) time, residual von Mises stress, and blade collisions during Laser Power Bed Fusion process. Across all case studies, the model pre-trained by VIRL shows substantial enhancements on demonstrating improved generalizability with limited data and superior performance with larger datasets. Regarding deployment strategy, case-specific phenomenon exists where finetuning VIRL-pretrained models adversely affects AM tasks with limited data but benefits SM time prediction. Moreover, the efficacy of Low-rank adaptation (LoRA), which balances between probing and finetuning, is explored. LoRA shows stable performance akin to probing with limited data, while achieving a higher upper bound than probing as data size increases, without the computational costs of finetuning. Furthermore, static normalization of manufacturing indicators consistently performs well across tasks, while dynamic normalization enhances performance when a reliable task dependent input is available.

- **Summary**: The challenge of addressing mixed closed-set and open-set label noise in medical image classification remains largely unexplored. Unlike natural image classification where there is a common practice of segregation and separate processing of closed-set and open-set noisy samples from clean ones, medical image classification faces difficulties due to high inter-class similarity which complicates the identification of open-set noisy samples. Moreover, prevailing methods do not leverage the full potential of open-set noisy samples for label noise mitigation, often leading to their exclusion or application of uniform soft labels. To address these issues, we propose an Extended Noise-robust Contrastive and Open-set Feature Augmentation (ENCOFA) framework. ENCOFA includes the Extended Noise-robust Supervised Contrastive (ENSC) Loss, which aids in distinguishing features across classes. The ENSC loss regards open-set noisy samples as an extended class and mitigates label noise by weighting contrastive pairs with label reliability. Furthermore, we develop an Open-set Feature Augmentation (OSFeatAug) module that enriches the features of open-set samples, utilizing the model's extra capacity to prevent overfitting to noisy data. We conducted experiments on a synthetic noisy dataset and a real-world noisy dataset. Our results indicate the superiority of ENCOFA and the effectiveness of leveraging the open-set noisy samples to combat label noise.

- **Summary**: Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is an MRI phase-based post-processing technique to extract the distribution of tissue susceptibilities, demonstrating significant potential in studying neurological diseases. However, the ill-conditioned nature of dipole inversion makes QSM reconstruction from the tissue field prone to noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based IR2QSM method for QSM reconstruction. It is designed by iterating four times of a reverse concatenations and middle recurrent modules enhanced U-net, which could dramatically improve the efficiency of latent feature utilization. Simulated and in vivo experiments were conducted to compare IR2QSM with several traditional algorithms (MEDI and iLSQR) and state-of-the-art deep learning methods (U-net, xQSM, and LPCNN). The results indicated that IR2QSM was able to obtain QSM images with significantly increased accuracy and mitigated artifacts over other methods. Particularly, IR2QSM demonstrated on average the best NRMSE (27.59%) in simulated experiments, which is 15.48%, 7.86%, 17.24%, 9.26%, and 29.13% lower than iLSQR, MEDI, U-net, xQSM, LPCNN, respectively, and led to improved QSM results with fewer artifacts for the in vivo data.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we point out suboptimal noise-data mapping leads to slow training of diffusion models. During diffusion training, current methods diffuse each image across the entire noise space, resulting in a mixture of all images at every point in the noise layer. We emphasize that this random mixture of noise-data mapping complicates the optimization of the denoising function in diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the immiscible phenomenon in physics, we propose Immiscible Diffusion, a simple and effective method to improve the random mixture of noise-data mapping. In physics, miscibility can vary according to various intermolecular forces. Thus, immiscibility means that the mixing of the molecular sources is distinguishable. Inspired by this, we propose an assignment-then-diffusion training strategy. Specifically, prior to diffusing the image data into noise, we assign diffusion target noise for the image data by minimizing the total image-noise pair distance in a mini-batch. The assignment functions analogously to external forces to separate the diffuse-able areas of images, thus mitigating the inherent difficulties in diffusion training. Our approach is remarkably simple, requiring only one line of code to restrict the diffuse-able area for each image while preserving the Gaussian distribution of noise. This ensures that each image is projected only to nearby noise. To address the high complexity of the assignment algorithm, we employ a quantized-assignment method to reduce the computational overhead to a negligible level. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieve up to 3x faster training for consistency models and DDIM on the CIFAR dataset, and up to 1.3x faster on CelebA datasets for consistency models. Besides, we conduct thorough analysis about the Immiscible Diffusion, which sheds lights on how it improves diffusion training speed while improving the fidelity.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) with vision transformers (ViTs) has proven effective for representation learning as demonstrated by the impressive performance on various downstream tasks. Despite these successes, existing ViT-based SSL architectures do not fully exploit the ViT backbone, particularly the patch tokens of the ViT. In this paper, we introduce a novel Semantic Graph Consistency (SGC) module to regularize ViT-based SSL methods and leverage patch tokens effectively. We reconceptualize images as graphs, with image patches as nodes and infuse relational inductive biases by explicit message passing using Graph Neural Networks into the SSL framework. Our SGC loss acts as a regularizer, leveraging the underexploited patch tokens of ViTs to construct a graph and enforcing consistency between graph features across multiple views of an image. Extensive experiments on various datasets including ImageNet, RESISC and Food-101 show that our approach significantly improves the quality of learned representations, resulting in a 5-10\% increase in performance when limited labeled data is used for linear evaluation. These experiments coupled with a comprehensive set of ablations demonstrate the promise of our approach in various settings.

- **Summary**: The Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification (VI ReID) aims to match visible and infrared images of the same pedestrians across non-overlapped camera views. These two input modalities contain both invariant information, such as shape, and modality-specific details, such as color. An ideal model should utilize valuable information from both modalities during training for enhanced representational capability. However, the gap caused by modality-specific information poses substantial challenges for the VI ReID model to handle distinct modality inputs simultaneously. To address this, we introduce the Modality-aware and Instance-aware Visual Prompts (MIP) network in our work, designed to effectively utilize both invariant and specific information for identification. Specifically, our MIP model is built on the transformer architecture. In this model, we have designed a series of modality-specific prompts, which could enable our model to adapt to and make use of the specific information inherent in different modality inputs, thereby reducing the interference caused by the modality gap and achieving better identification. Besides, we also employ each pedestrian feature to construct a group of instance-specific prompts. These customized prompts are responsible for guiding our model to adapt to each pedestrian instance dynamically, thereby capturing identity-level discriminative clues for identification. Through extensive experiments on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets, the effectiveness of both our designed modules is evaluated. Additionally, our proposed MIP performs better than most state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Assessing the capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs) often requires the creation of ad-hoc evaluations. Currently, building new benchmarks requires tremendous amounts of manual work for each specific analysis. This makes the evaluation process tedious and costly. In this paper, we present APEx, Automatic Programming of Experiments, the first framework for automatic benchmarking of LMMs. Given a research question expressed in natural language, APEx leverages a large language model (LLM) and a library of pre-specified tools to generate a set of experiments for the model at hand, and progressively compile a scientific report. The report drives the testing procedure: based on the current status of the investigation, APEx chooses which experiments to perform and whether the results are sufficient to draw conclusions. Finally, the LLM refines the report, presenting the results to the user in natural language. Thanks to its modularity, our framework is flexible and extensible as new tools become available. Empirically, APEx reproduces the findings of existing studies while allowing for arbitrary analyses and hypothesis testing.

- **Summary**: Most existing deep learning-based registration methods are trained on single-type images to address same-domain tasks.However, cross-domain deformable registration remains challenging.We argue that the tailor-made matching criteria in traditional registration methods is one of the main reason they are applicable in different domains.Motivated by this, we devise a registration-oriented encoder to model the matching criteria of image features and structural features, which is beneficial to boost registration accuracy and adaptability.Specifically, a general feature encoder (Encoder-G) is proposed to capture comprehensive medical image features, while a structural feature encoder (Encoder-S) is designed to encode the structural self-similarity into the global representation.Extensive experiments on images from three different domains prove the efficacy of the proposed method. Moreover, by updating Encoder-S using one-shot learning, our method can effectively adapt to different domains.The code is publicly available at https://github.com/JuliusWang-7/EncoderReg.

- **Summary**: Gait recognition is a biometric technology that identifies individuals by using walking patterns. Due to the significant achievements of multimodal fusion in gait recognition, we consider employing LiDAR-camera fusion to obtain robust gait representations. However, existing methods often overlook intrinsic characteristics of modalities, and lack fine-grained fusion and temporal modeling. In this paper, we introduce a novel modality-sensitive network LiCAF for LiDAR-camera fusion, which employs an asymmetric modeling strategy. Specifically, we propose Asymmetric Cross-modal Channel Attention (ACCA) and Interlaced Cross-modal Temporal Modeling (ICTM) for cross-modal valuable channel information selection and powerful temporal modeling. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance (93.9% in Rank-1 and 98.8% in Rank-5) on the SUSTech1K dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates the efficacy of jointly optimizing content-specific post-processing filters to adapt a human oriented video/image codec into a codec suitable for machine vision tasks. By observing that artifacts produced by video/image codecs are content-dependent, we propose a novel training strategy based on competitive learning principles. This strategy assigns training samples to filters dynamically, in a fuzzy manner, which further optimizes the winning filter on the given sample. Inspired by simulated annealing optimization techniques, we employ a softmax function with a temperature variable as the weight allocation function to mitigate the effects of random initialization. Our evaluation, conducted on a system utilizing multiple post-processing filters within a Versatile Video Coding (VVC) codec framework, demonstrates the superiority of content-specific filters trained with our proposed strategies, specifically, when images are processed in blocks. Using VVC reference software VTM 12.0 as the anchor, experiments on the OpenImages dataset show an improvement in the BD-rate reduction from -41.3% and -44.6% to -42.3% and -44.7% for object detection and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, compared to independently trained filters. The statistics of the filter usage align with our hypothesis and underscore the importance of jointly optimizing filters for both content and reconstruction quality. Our findings pave the way for further improving the performance of video/image codecs.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces DiffMix, a new self-supervised learning (SSL) pre-training framework that combines real and synthetic images. Unlike traditional SSL methods that predominantly use real images, DiffMix uses a variant of Stable Diffusion to replace an augmented instance of a real image, facilitating the learning of cross real-synthetic image representations. The key insight is that while SSL methods trained solely on synthetic images underperform compared to those trained on real images, a blended training approach using both real and synthetic images leads to more robust and adaptable representations. Experiments demonstrate that DiffMix enhances the SSL methods SimCLR, BarlowTwins, and DINO, across various robustness datasets and domain transfer tasks. DiffMix boosts SimCLR's accuracy on ImageNet-1K by 4.56\%. These results challenge the notion that high-quality real images are crucial for SSL pre-training by showing that lower quality synthetic images can also produce strong representations. DiffMix also reduces the need for image augmentations in SSL, offering new optimization strategies.

- **Summary**: Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) focuses on the interpretation of a sequence of sign language gestures performed continually without pauses. In this study, we conduct an empirical evaluation of recent deep learning CSLR techniques and assess their performance across various datasets and sign languages. The models selected for analysis implement a range of approaches for extracting meaningful features and employ distinct training strategies. To determine their efficacy in modeling different sign languages, these models were evaluated using multiple datasets, specifically RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014, ArabSign, and GrSL, each representing a unique sign language. The performance of the models was further tested with unseen signers and sentences. The conducted experiments establish new benchmarks on the selected datasets and provide valuable insights into the robustness and generalization of the evaluated techniques under challenging scenarios.

- **Summary**: We introduce a new benchmark designed to advance the development of general-purpose, large-scale vision-language models for remote sensing images. Although several vision-language datasets in remote sensing have been proposed to pursue this goal, existing datasets are typically tailored to single tasks, lack detailed object information, or suffer from inadequate quality control. Exploring these improvement opportunities, we present a Versatile vision-language Benchmark for Remote Sensing image understanding, termed VRSBench. This benchmark comprises 29,614 images, with 29,614 human-verified detailed captions, 52,472 object references, and 123,221 question-answer pairs. It facilitates the training and evaluation of vision-language models across a broad spectrum of remote sensing image understanding tasks. We further evaluated state-of-the-art models on this benchmark for three vision-language tasks: image captioning, visual grounding, and visual question answering. Our work aims to significantly contribute to the development of advanced vision-language models in the field of remote sensing.

- **Summary**: Though current object detection models based on deep learning have achieved excellent results on many conventional benchmark datasets, their performance will dramatically decline on real-world images taken under extreme conditions. Existing methods either used image augmentation based on traditional image processing algorithms or applied customized and scene-limited image adaptation technologies for robust modeling. This study thus proposes a stylization data-driven neural-image-adaptive YOLO (SDNIA-YOLO), which improves the model's robustness by enhancing image quality adaptively and learning valuable information related to extreme weather conditions from images synthesized by neural style transfer (NST). Experiments show that the developed SDNIA-YOLOv3 achieves significant mAP@.5 improvements of at least 15% on the real-world foggy (RTTS) and lowlight (ExDark) test sets compared with the baseline model. Besides, the experiments also highlight the outstanding potential of stylization data in simulating extreme weather conditions. The developed SDNIA-YOLO remains excellent characteristics of the native YOLO to a great extent, such as end-to-end one-stage, data-driven, and fast.

- **Summary**: Creating geometric digital twins (gDT) for as-built roads still faces many challenges, such as low automation level and accuracy, limited asset types and shapes, and reliance on engineering experience. A novel scan-to-building information modeling (scan-to-BIM) framework is proposed for automatic road gDT creation based on semantically labeled point cloud data (PCD), which considers six asset types: Road Surface, Road Side (Slope), Road Lane (Marking), Road Sign, Road Light, and Guardrail. The framework first segments the semantic PCD into spatially independent instances or parts, then extracts the sectional polygon contours as their representative geometric information, stored in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files using a new data structure. Primitive gDTs are finally created from JSON files using corresponding conversion algorithms. The proposed method achieves an average distance error of 1.46 centimeters and a processing speed of 6.29 meters per second on six real-world road segments with a total length of 1,200 meters.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel method employing occupancy networks for the precise localization of 67 anatomical structures from single depth images captured from the exterior of the human body. This method considers the anatomical diversity across individuals. Our contributions include the application of occupancy networks for occluded structure localization, a robust method for estimating anatomical positions from depth images, and the creation of detailed, individualized 3D anatomical atlases. This approach promises improvements in medical imaging and automated diagnostic procedures by offering accurate, non-invasive localization of critical anatomical features.

- **Summary**: Generating realistic images to accurately predict changes in the structure of brain MRI is a crucial tool for clinicians. Such applications help assess patients' outcomes and analyze how diseases progress at the individual level. However, existing methods for this task present some limitations. Some approaches attempt to model the distribution of MRI scans directly by conditioning the model on patients' ages, but they fail to explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes in the brain and time intervals, especially on age-unbalanced datasets. Other approaches simply rely on interpolation between scans, which limits their clinical application as they do not predict future MRIs. To address these challenges, we propose a Temporally-Aware Diffusion Model (TADM), which introduces a novel approach to accurately infer progression in brain MRIs. TADM learns the distribution of structural changes in terms of intensity differences between scans and combines the prediction of these changes with the initial baseline scans to generate future MRIs. Furthermore, during training, we propose to leverage a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) to refine the model's training process, enhancing its ability to produce accurate MRIs that match the expected age gap between baseline and generated scans. Our assessment, conducted on the OASIS-3 dataset, uses similarity metrics and region sizes computed by comparing predicted and real follow-up scans on 3 relevant brain regions. TADM achieves large improvements over existing approaches, with an average decrease of 24% in region size error and an improvement of 4% in similarity metrics. These evaluations demonstrate the improvement of our model in mimicking temporal brain neurodegenerative progression compared to existing methods. Our approach will benefit applications, such as predicting patient outcomes or improving treatments for patients.

- **Summary**: Dynamic gestures enable the transfer of directive information to a robot. Moreover, the ability of a robot to recognize them from a long distance makes communication more effective and practical. However, current state-of-the-art models for dynamic gestures exhibit limitations in recognition distance, typically achieving effective performance only within a few meters. In this work, we propose a model for recognizing dynamic gestures from a long distance of up to 20 meters. The model integrates the SlowFast and Transformer architectures (SFT) to effectively process and classify complex gesture sequences captured in video frames. SFT demonstrates superior performance over existing models.

- **Summary**: Gesture is an important mean of non-verbal communication, with visual modality allows human to convey information during interaction, facilitating peoples and human-machine interactions. However, it is considered difficult to automatically recognise gestures. In this work, we explore three different means to recognise hand signs using deep learning: supervised learning based methods, self-supervised methods and visualisation based techniques applied to 3D moving skeleton data. Self-supervised learning used to train fully connected, CNN and LSTM method. Then, reconstruction method is applied to unlabelled data in simulated settings using CNN as a backbone where we use the learnt features to perform the prediction in the remaining labelled data. Lastly, Grad-CAM is applied to discover the focus of the models. Our experiments results show that supervised learning method is capable to recognise gesture accurately, with self-supervised learning increasing the accuracy in simulated settings. Finally, Grad-CAM visualisation shows that indeed the models focus on relevant skeleton joints on the associated gesture.

- **Summary**: Robot manipulation relying on learned object-centric descriptors became popular in recent years. Visual descriptors can easily describe manipulation task objectives, they can be learned efficiently using self-supervision, and they can encode actuated and even non-rigid objects. However, learning robust, view-invariant keypoints in a self-supervised approach requires a meticulous data collection approach involving precise calibration and expert supervision. In this paper we introduce Cycle-Correspondence Loss (CCL) for view-invariant dense descriptor learning, which adopts the concept of cycle-consistency, enabling a simple data collection pipeline and training on unpaired RGB camera views. The key idea is to autonomously detect valid pixel correspondences by attempting to use a prediction over a new image to predict the original pixel in the original image, while scaling error terms based on the estimated confidence. Our evaluation shows that we outperform other self-supervised RGB-only methods, and approach performance of supervised methods, both with respect to keypoint tracking as well as for a robot grasping downstream task.

- **Summary**: The emergence of clinical data warehouses (CDWs), which contain the medical data of millions of patients, has paved the way for vast data sharing for research. The quality of MRIs gathered in CDWs differs greatly from what is observed in research settings and reflects a certain clinical reality. Consequently, a significant proportion of these images turns out to be unusable due to their poor quality. Given the massive volume of MRIs contained in CDWs, the manual rating of image quality is impossible. Thus, it is necessary to develop an automated solution capable of effectively identifying corrupted images in CDWs. This study presents an innovative transfer learning method for automated quality control of 3D gradient echo T1-weighted brain MRIs within a CDW, leveraging artefact simulation. We first intentionally corrupt images from research datasets by inducing poorer contrast, adding noise and introducing motion artefacts. Subsequently, three artefact-specific models are pre-trained using these corrupted images to detect distinct types of artefacts. Finally, the models are generalised to routine clinical data through a transfer learning technique, utilising 3660 manually annotated images. The overall image quality is inferred from the results of the three models, each designed to detect a specific type of artefact. Our method was validated on an independent test set of 385 3D gradient echo T1-weighted MRIs. Our proposed approach achieved excellent results for the detection of bad quality MRIs, with a balanced accuracy of over 87%, surpassing our previous approach by 3.5 percent points. Additionally, we achieved a satisfactory balanced accuracy of 79% for the detection of moderate quality MRIs, outperforming our previous performance by 5 percent points. Our framework provides a valuable tool for exploiting the potential of MRIs in CDWs.

- **Summary**: Insects represent half of all global biodiversity, yet many of the world's insects are disappearing, with severe implications for ecosystems and agriculture. Despite this crisis, data on insect diversity and abundance remain woefully inadequate, due to the scarcity of human experts and the lack of scalable tools for monitoring. Ecologists have started to adopt camera traps to record and study insects, and have proposed computer vision algorithms as an answer for scalable data processing. However, insect monitoring in the wild poses unique challenges that have not yet been addressed within computer vision, including the combination of long-tailed data, extremely similar classes, and significant distribution shifts. We provide the first large-scale machine learning benchmarks for fine-grained insect recognition, designed to match real-world tasks faced by ecologists. Our contributions include a curated dataset of images from citizen science platforms and museums, and an expert-annotated dataset drawn from automated camera traps across multiple continents, designed to test out-of-distribution generalization under field conditions. We train and evaluate a variety of baseline algorithms and introduce a combination of data augmentation techniques that enhance generalization across geographies and hardware setups. Code and datasets are made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Quantitative MRI (qMRI) is an increasingly important tool for clinical assessment of cardiovascular diseases. Quantitative maps are derived by fitting a known signal model to a series of baseline images, while the quality of the map can be deteriorated by involuntary respiratory and cardiac motion. To correct motion, a template image is often needed to register all baseline images, but the choice of template is nontrivial, leading to inconsistent performance sensitive to image contrast. In this work, we propose a novel deep-learning-based groupwise registration framework, which omits the need for a template, and registers all baseline images simultaneously. We design two groupwise losses for this registration framework: the first is a linear principal component analysis (PCA) loss that enforces alignment of baseline images irrespective of the intensity variation, and the second is an auxiliary relaxometry loss that enforces adherence of intensity profile to the signal model. We extensively evaluated our method, termed ``PCA-Relax'', and other baseline methods on an in-house cardiac MRI dataset including both pre- and post-contrast $T_1$ sequences. All methods were evaluated under three distinct training-and-evaluation strategies, namely, standard, one-shot, and test-time-adaptation. The proposed PCA-Relax showed further improved performance of registration and mapping over well-established baselines. The proposed groupwise framework is generic and can be adapted to applications involving multiple images.

- **Summary**: Despite recent advancements in high-fidelity human reconstruction techniques, the requirements for densely captured images or time-consuming per-instance optimization significantly hinder their applications in broader scenarios. To tackle these issues, we present HumanSplat which predicts the 3D Gaussian Splatting properties of any human from a single input image in a generalizable manner. In particular, HumanSplat comprises a 2D multi-view diffusion model and a latent reconstruction transformer with human structure priors that adeptly integrate geometric priors and semantic features within a unified framework. A hierarchical loss that incorporates human semantic information is further designed to achieve high-fidelity texture modeling and better constrain the estimated multiple views. Comprehensive experiments on standard benchmarks and in-the-wild images demonstrate that HumanSplat surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in achieving photorealistic novel-view synthesis.

- **Summary**: Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in light field image super-resolution (LFSR) owing to the progress of modern neural networks. However, these methods often face challenges in capturing long-range dependencies (CNN-based) or encounter quadratic computational complexities (Transformer-based), which limit their performance. Recently, the State Space Model (SSM) with selective scanning mechanism (S6), exemplified by Mamba, has emerged as a superior alternative in various vision tasks compared to traditional CNN- and Transformer-based approaches, benefiting from its effective long-range sequence modeling capability and linear-time complexity. Therefore, integrating S6 into LFSR becomes compelling, especially considering the vast data volume of 4D light fields. However, the primary challenge lies in \emph{designing an appropriate scanning method for 4D light fields that effectively models light field features}. To tackle this, we employ SSMs on the informative 2D slices of 4D LFs to fully explore spatial contextual information, complementary angular information, and structure information. To achieve this, we carefully devise a basic SSM block characterized by an efficient SS2D mechanism that facilitates more effective and efficient feature learning on these 2D slices. Based on the above two designs, we further introduce an SSM-based network for LFSR termed LFMamba. Experimental results on LF benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of LFMamba. Furthermore, extensive ablation studies are conducted to validate the efficacy and generalization ability of our proposed method. We expect that our LFMamba shed light on effective representation learning of LFs with state space models.

- **Summary**: The remote sensing image intelligence understanding model is undergoing a new profound paradigm shift which has been promoted by multi-modal large language model (MLLM), i.e. from the paradigm learning a domain model (LaDM) shifts to paradigm learning a pre-trained general foundation model followed by an adaptive domain model (LaGD). Under the new LaGD paradigm, the old datasets, which have led to advances in RSI intelligence understanding in the last decade, are no longer suitable for fire-new tasks. We argued that a new dataset must be designed to lighten tasks with the following features: 1) Generalization: training model to learn shared knowledge among tasks and to adapt to different tasks; 2) Understanding complex scenes: training model to understand the fine-grained attribute of the objects of interest, and to be able to describe the scene with natural language; 3) Reasoning: training model to be able to realize high-level visual reasoning. In this paper, we designed a high-quality, diversified, and unified multimodal instruction-following dataset for RSI understanding produced by GPT-4V and existing datasets, which we called RS-GPT4V. To achieve generalization, we used a (Question, Answer) which was deduced from GPT-4V via instruction-following to unify the tasks such as captioning and localization; To achieve complex scene, we proposed a hierarchical instruction description with local strategy in which the fine-grained attributes of the objects and their spatial relationships are described and global strategy in which all the local information are integrated to yield detailed instruction descript; To achieve reasoning, we designed multiple-turn QA pair to provide the reasoning ability for a model. The empirical results show that the fine-tuned MLLMs by RS-GPT4V can describe fine-grained information. The dataset is available at: https://github.com/GeoX-Lab/RS-GPT4V.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation plays a key role in applications such as autonomous driving and medical image. Although existing real-time semantic segmentation models achieve a commendable balance between accuracy and speed, their multi-path blocks still affect overall speed. To address this issue, this study proposes a Reparameterizable Dual-Resolution Network (RDRNet) dedicated to real-time semantic segmentation. Specifically, RDRNet employs a two-branch architecture, utilizing multi-path blocks during training and reparameterizing them into single-path blocks during inference, thereby enhancing both accuracy and inference speed simultaneously. Furthermore, we propose the Reparameterizable Pyramid Pooling Module (RPPM) to enhance the feature representation of the pyramid pooling module without increasing its inference time. Experimental results on the Cityscapes, CamVid, and Pascal VOC 2012 datasets demonstrate that RDRNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of both performance and speed. The code is available at https://github.com/gyyang23/RDRNet.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of depth sensor, more and more RGB-D videos could be obtained. Identifying the foreground in RGB-D videos is a fundamental and important task. However, the existing salient object detection (SOD) works only focus on either static RGB-D images or RGB videos, ignoring the collaborating of RGB-D and video information. In this paper, we first collect a new annotated RGB-D video SOD (ViDSOD-100) dataset, which contains 100 videos within a total of 9,362 frames, acquired from diverse natural scenes. All the frames in each video are manually annotated to a high-quality saliency annotation. Moreover, we propose a new baseline model, named attentive triple-fusion network (ATF-Net), for RGB-D video salient object detection. Our method aggregates the appearance information from an input RGB image, spatio-temporal information from an estimated motion map, and the geometry information from the depth map by devising three modality-specific branches and a multi-modality integration branch. The modality-specific branches extract the representation of different inputs, while the multi-modality integration branch combines the multi-level modality-specific features by introducing the encoder feature aggregation (MEA) modules and decoder feature aggregation (MDA) modules. The experimental findings conducted on both our newly introduced ViDSOD-100 dataset and the well-established DAVSOD dataset highlight the superior performance of the proposed ATF-Net. This performance enhancement is demonstrated both quantitatively and qualitatively, surpassing the capabilities of current state-of-the-art techniques across various domains, including RGB-D saliency detection, video saliency detection, and video object segmentation.

- **Summary**: In human interaction, gestures serve various functions such as marking speech rhythm, highlighting key elements, and supplementing information. These gestures are also observed in explanatory contexts. However, the impact of gestures on explanations provided by virtual agents remains underexplored. A user study was carried out to investigate how different types of gestures influence perceived interaction quality and listener understanding. This study addresses the effect of gestures in explanation by developing an embodied virtual explainer integrating both beat gestures and iconic gestures to enhance its automatically generated verbal explanations. Our model combines beat gestures generated by a learned speech-driven synthesis module with manually captured iconic gestures, supporting the agent's verbal expressions about the board game Quarto! as an explanation scenario. Findings indicate that neither the use of iconic gestures alone nor their combination with beat gestures outperforms the baseline or beat-only conditions in terms of understanding. Nonetheless, compared to prior research, the embodied agent significantly enhances understanding.

- **Summary**: Racing autonomous cars faster than the best human drivers has been a longstanding grand challenge for the fields of Artificial Intelligence and robotics. Recently, an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning agent met this challenge in a high-fidelity racing simulator, Gran Turismo. However, this agent relied on global features that require instrumentation external to the car. This paper introduces, to the best of our knowledge, the first super-human car racing agent whose sensor input is purely local to the car, namely pixels from an ego-centric camera view and quantities that can be sensed from on-board the car, such as the car's velocity. By leveraging global features only at training time, the learned agent is able to outperform the best human drivers in time trial (one car on the track at a time) races using only local input features. The resulting agent is evaluated in Gran Turismo 7 on multiple tracks and cars. Detailed ablation experiments demonstrate the agent's strong reliance on visual inputs, making it the first vision-based super-human car racing agent.

- **Summary**: Automated cephalometric landmark detection is crucial in real-world orthodontic diagnosis. Current studies mainly focus on only adult subjects, neglecting the clinically crucial scenario presented by adolescents whose landmarks often exhibit significantly different appearances compared to adults. Hence, an open question arises about how to develop a unified and effective detection algorithm across various age groups, including adolescents and adults. In this paper, we propose CeLDA, the first work for Cephalometric Landmark Detection across Ages. Our method leverages a prototypical network for landmark detection by comparing image features with landmark prototypes. To tackle the appearance discrepancy of landmarks between age groups, we design new strategies for CeLDA to improve prototype alignment and obtain a holistic estimation of landmark prototypes from a large set of training images. Moreover, a novel prototype relation mining paradigm is introduced to exploit the anatomical relations between the landmark prototypes. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of CeLDA in detecting cephalometric landmarks on both adult and adolescent subjects. To our knowledge, this is the first effort toward developing a unified solution and dataset for cephalometric landmark detection across age groups. Our code and dataset will be made public on https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/Cephalometric-Landmark-Detection-across-Ages-with-Prototypical-Network

- **Summary**: Although there are many excellent solutions in image restoration, the fact that they are specifically designed for a single image restoration task may prevent them from being state-of-the-art (SOTA) in other types of image restoration tasks. While some approaches require considering multiple image restoration tasks, they are still not sufficient for the requirements of the real world and may suffer from the task confusion issue. In this work, we focus on designing a unified and effective solution for multiple image restoration tasks including deraining, desnowing, defogging, deblurring, denoising, and low-light enhancement. Based on the above purpose, we propose a Transformer network Restorer with U-Net architecture. In order to effectively deal with degraded information in multiple image restoration tasks, we need a more comprehensive attention mechanism. Thus, we design all-axis attention (AAA) through stereo embedding and 3D convolution, which can simultaneously model the long-range dependencies in both spatial and channel dimensions, capturing potential correlations among all axis. Moreover, we propose a Restorer based on textual prompts. Compared to previous methods that employ learnable queries, textual prompts bring explicit task priors to solve the task confusion issue arising from learnable queries and introduce interactivity. Based on these designs, Restorer demonstrates SOTA or comparable performance in multiple image restoration tasks compared to universal image restoration frameworks and methods specifically designed for these individual tasks. Meanwhile, Restorer is faster during inference. The above results along with the real-world test results show that Restorer has the potential to serve as a backbone for multiple real-world image restoration tasks.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we extend the study of concept ablation within pre-trained models as introduced in 'Ablating Concepts in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models' by (Kumari et al.,2022). Our work focuses on reproducing the results achieved by the different variants of concept ablation proposed and validated through predefined metrics. We also introduce a novel variant of concept ablation, namely 'trademark ablation'. This variant combines the principles of memorization and instance ablation to tackle the nuanced influence of proprietary or branded elements in model outputs. Further, our research contributions include an observational analysis of the model's limitations. Moreover, we investigate the model's behavior in response to ablation leakage-inducing prompts, which aim to indirectly ablate concepts, revealing insights into the model's resilience and adaptability. We also observe the model's performance degradation on images generated by concepts far from its target ablation concept, documented in the appendix.

- **Summary**: Processing histopathological Whole Slide Images (WSI) leads to massive storage requirements for clinics worldwide. Even after lossy image compression during image acquisition, additional lossy compression is frequently possible without substantially affecting the performance of deep learning-based (DL) downstream tasks. In this paper, we show that the commonly used JPEG algorithm is not best suited for further compression and we propose Stain Quantized Latent Compression (SQLC ), a novel DL based histopathology data compression approach. SQLC compresses staining and RGB channels before passing it through a compression autoencoder (CAE ) in order to obtain quantized latent representations for maximizing the compression. We show that our approach yields superior performance in a classification downstream task, compared to traditional approaches like JPEG, while image quality metrics like the Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM) is largely preserved. Our method is online available.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the safe deployment of neural networks. Existing CLIP-based approaches perform OOD detection by devising novel scoring functions or sophisticated fine-tuning methods. In this work, we propose SeTAR, a novel, training-free OOD detection method that leverages selective low-rank approximation of weight matrices in vision-language and vision-only models. SeTAR enhances OOD detection via post-hoc modification of the model's weight matrices using a simple greedy search algorithm. Based on SeTAR, we further propose SeTAR+FT, a fine-tuning extension optimizing model performance for OOD detection tasks. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet1K and Pascal-VOC benchmarks show SeTAR's superior performance, reducing the false positive rate by up to 18.95% and 36.80% compared to zero-shot and fine-tuning baselines. Ablation studies further validate our approach's effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability across different model backbones. Our work offers a scalable, efficient solution for OOD detection, setting a new state-of-the-art in this area.

- **Summary**: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterised by cognitive decline and biomarkers such as tau-proteins. Tau-positron emission tomography (tau-PET), which employs a radiotracer to selectively bind, detect, and visualise tau protein aggregates within the brain, is valuable for early AD diagnosis but is less accessible due to high costs, limited availability, and its invasive nature. Image synthesis with neural networks enables the generation of tau-PET images from more accessible T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. To ensure high-quality image synthesis, we propose a cyclic 2.5D perceptual loss combined with mean squared error and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) losses. The cyclic 2.5D perceptual loss sequentially calculates the axial 2D average perceptual loss for a specified number of epochs, followed by the coronal and sagittal planes for the same number of epochs. This sequence is cyclically performed, with intervals reducing as the cycles repeat. We conduct supervised synthesis of tau-PET images from T1w MRI images using 516 paired T1w MRI and tau-PET 3D images from the ADNI database. For the collected data, we perform preprocessing, including intensity standardisation for tau-PET images from each manufacturer. The proposed loss, applied to generative 3D U-Net and its variants, outperformed those with 2.5D and 3D perceptual losses in SSIM and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). In addition, including the cyclic 2.5D perceptual loss to the original losses of GAN-based image synthesis models such as CycleGAN and Pix2Pix improves SSIM and PSNR by at least 2% and 3%. Furthermore, by-manufacturer PET standardisation helps the models in synthesising high-quality images than min-max PET normalisation.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have shown powerful zero-shot inference ability via image-text matching and prove to be strong few-shot learners in various downstream tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, adapting CLIP to downstream tasks may encounter the following challenges: 1) data may exhibit long-tailed data distributions and might not have abundant samples for all the classes; 2) There might be emerging tasks with new classes that contain no samples at all. To overcome them, we propose a novel framework to achieve efficient and long-tailed generalization, which can be termed as Candle. During the training process, we propose compensating logit-adjusted loss to encourage large margins of prototypes and alleviate imbalance both within the base classes and between the base and new classes. For efficient adaptation, we treat the CLIP model as a black box and leverage the extracted features to obtain visual and textual prototypes for prediction. To make full use of multi-modal information, we also propose cross-modal attention to enrich the features from both modalities. For effective generalization, we introduce virtual prototypes for new classes to make up for their lack of training images. Candle achieves state-of-the-art performance over extensive experiments on 11 diverse datasets while substantially reducing the training time, demonstrating the superiority of our approach.

- **Summary**: The segmentation foundation model, e.g., Segment Anything Model (SAM), has attracted increasing interest in the medical image community. Early pioneering studies primarily concentrated on assessing and improving SAM's performance from the perspectives of overall accuracy and efficiency, yet little attention was given to the fairness considerations. This oversight raises questions about the potential for performance biases that could mirror those found in task-specific deep learning models like nnU-Net. In this paper, we explored the fairness dilemma concerning large segmentation foundation models. We prospectively curate a benchmark dataset of 3D MRI and CT scans of the organs including liver, kidney, spleen, lung and aorta from a total of 1056 healthy subjects with expert segmentations. Crucially, we document demographic details such as gender, age, and body mass index (BMI) for each subject to facilitate a nuanced fairness analysis. We test state-of-the-art foundation models for medical image segmentation, including the original SAM, medical SAM and SAT models, to evaluate segmentation efficacy across different demographic groups and identify disparities. Our comprehensive analysis, which accounts for various confounding factors, reveals significant fairness concerns within these foundational models. Moreover, our findings highlight not only disparities in overall segmentation metrics, such as the Dice Similarity Coefficient but also significant variations in the spatial distribution of segmentation errors, offering empirical evidence of the nuanced challenges in ensuring fairness in medical image segmentation.

- **Summary**: Vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a significant area of focus, particularly for their capacity to be jointly trained with large language models and to serve as robust vision foundation models. Yet, the development of trustworthy explanation methods for ViTs has lagged, particularly in the context of post-hoc interpretations of ViT predictions. Existing sub-image selection approaches, such as feature-attribution and conceptual models, fall short in this regard. This paper proposes five desiderata for explaining ViTs -- faithfulness, stability, sparsity, multi-level structure, and parsimony -- and demonstrates the inadequacy of current methods in meeting these criteria comprehensively. We introduce a variational Bayesian explanation framework, dubbed ProbAbilistic Concept Explainers (PACE), which models the distributions of patch embeddings to provide trustworthy post-hoc conceptual explanations. Our qualitative analysis reveals the distributions of patch-level concepts, elucidating the effectiveness of ViTs by modeling the joint distribution of patch embeddings and ViT's predictions. Moreover, these patch-level explanations bridge the gap between image-level and dataset-level explanations, thus completing the multi-level structure of PACE. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that PACE surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of the defined desiderata.

- **Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple machines to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing of private training data. Yet, especially for heterogeneous models, a key bottleneck remains the transfer of knowledge gained from each client model with the server. One popular method, FedDF, uses distillation to tackle this task with the use of a common, shared dataset on which predictions are exchanged. However, in many contexts such a dataset might be difficult to acquire due to privacy and the clients might not allow for storage of a large shared dataset. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a new method that improves this knowledge distillation method to only rely on a single shared image between clients and server. In particular, we propose a novel adaptive dataset pruning algorithm that selects the most informative crops generated from only a single image. With this, we show that federated learning with distillation under a limited shared dataset budget works better by using a single image compared to multiple individual ones. Finally, we extend our approach to allow for training heterogeneous client architectures by incorporating a non-uniform distillation schedule and client-model mirroring on the server side.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we aim to improve the performance of a deep learning model towards image classification tasks, proposing a novel anchor-based training methodology, named \textit{Online Anchor-based Training} (OAT). The OAT method, guided by the insights provided in the anchor-based object detection methodologies, instead of learning directly the class labels, proposes to train a model to learn percentage changes of the class labels with respect to defined anchors. We define as anchors the batch centers at the output of the model. Then, during the test phase, the predictions are converted back to the original class label space, and the performance is evaluated. The effectiveness of the OAT method is validated on four datasets.



### Do More Details Always Introduce More Hallucinations in LVLM-based Image Captioning?

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in integrating visual and linguistic contexts to produce detailed content, facilitating applications such as image captioning. However, using LVLMs to generate descriptions often faces the challenge of object hallucination (OH), where the output text misrepresents actual objects in the input image. While previous studies attribute the occurrence of OH to the inclusion of more details, our study finds technical flaws in existing metrics, leading to unreliable evaluations of models and conclusions about OH. This has sparked a debate on the question: Do more details always introduce more hallucinations in LVLM-based image captioning?   In this paper, we address this debate by proposing a novel decoding strategy, Differentiated Beam Decoding (DBD), along with a reliable new set of evaluation metrics: CLIP-Precision, CLIP-Recall, and CLIP-F1. DBD decodes the wealth of information hidden in visual input into distinct language representations called unit facts in parallel. This decoding is achieved via a well-designed differential score that guides the parallel search and candidate screening. The selected unit facts are then aggregated to generate the final caption. Our proposed metrics evaluate the comprehensiveness and accuracy of image captions by comparing the embedding groups of ground-truth image regions and generated text partitions. Extensive experiments on the Visual Genome dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating that it produces detailed descriptions while maintaining low hallucination levels.

- **Summary**: In this paper we deal with the task of Disturbing Image Detection (DID), exploiting knowledge encoded in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Specifically, we propose to exploit LMM knowledge in a two-fold manner: first by extracting generic semantic descriptions, and second by extracting elicited emotions. Subsequently, we use the CLIP's text encoder in order to obtain the text embeddings of both the generic semantic descriptions and LMM-elicited emotions. Finally, we use the aforementioned text embeddings along with the corresponding CLIP's image embeddings for performing the DID task. The proposed method significantly improves the baseline classification accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the augmented Disturbing Image Detection dataset.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in discriminative and generative pretraining have yielded geometry estimation models with strong generalization capabilities. While discriminative monocular geometry estimation methods rely on large-scale fine-tuning data to achieve zero-shot generalization, several generative-based paradigms show the potential of achieving impressive generalization performance on unseen scenes by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models and fine-tuning on even a small scale of synthetic training data. Frustratingly, these models are trained with different recipes on different datasets, making it hard to find out the critical factors that determine the evaluation performance. Besides, current geometry evaluation benchmarks have two main drawbacks that may prevent the development of the field, i.e., limited scene diversity and unfavorable label quality. To resolve the above issues, (1) we build fair and strong baselines in a unified codebase for evaluating and analyzing the geometry estimation models; (2) we evaluate monocular geometry estimators on more challenging benchmarks for geometry estimation task with diverse scenes and high-quality annotations. Our results reveal that pre-trained using large data, discriminative models such as DINOv2, can outperform generative counterparts with a small amount of high-quality synthetic data under the same training configuration, which suggests that fine-tuning data quality is a more important factor than the data scale and model architecture. Our observation also raises a question: if simply fine-tuning a general vision model such as DINOv2 using a small amount of synthetic depth data produces SOTA results, do we really need complex generative models for depth estimation? We believe this work can propel advancements in geometry estimation tasks as well as a wide range of downstream applications.

- **Summary**: Schizophrenia is a debilitating, chronic mental disorder that significantly impacts an individual's cognitive abilities, behavior, and social interactions. It is characterized by subtle morphological changes in the brain, particularly in the gray matter. These changes are often imperceptible through manual observation, demanding an automated approach to diagnosis. This study introduces a deep learning methodology for the classification of individuals with Schizophrenia. We achieve this by implementing a diversified attention mechanism known as Spatial Sequence Attention (SSA) which is designed to extract and emphasize significant feature representations from structural MRI (sMRI). Initially, we employ the transfer learning paradigm by leveraging pre-trained DenseNet to extract initial feature maps from the final convolutional block which contains morphological alterations associated with Schizophrenia. These features are further processed by the proposed SSA to capture and emphasize intricate spatial interactions and relationships across volumes within the brain. Our experimental studies conducted on a clinical dataset have revealed that the proposed attention mechanism outperforms the existing Squeeze & Excitation Network for Schizophrenia classification.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection deals with detecting deviations from established patterns within data. It has various applications like autonomous driving, predictive maintenance, and medical diagnosis. To improve anomaly detection accuracy, transfer learning can be applied to large, pre-trained models and adapt them to the specific application context. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for online-adaptive anomaly detection using transfer learning. The approach adapts to different environments by selecting visually similar training images and online fitting a normality model to EfficientNet features extracted from the training subset. Anomaly detection is then performed by computing the Mahalanobis distance between the normality model and the test image features. Different similarity measures (SIFT/FLANN, Cosine) and normality models (MVG, OCSVM) are employed and compared with each other. We evaluate the approach on different anomaly detection benchmarks and data collected in controlled laboratory settings. Experimental results showcase a detection accuracy exceeding 0.975, outperforming the state-of-the-art ET-NET approach.

- **Summary**: Self-portraits captured from a short distance might look unnatural or even unattractive due to heavy distortions making facial features malformed, and ill-placed head poses. In this paper, we propose SUPER, a novel method of eliminating distortions and adjusting head pose in a close-up face crop. We perform 3D GAN inversion for a facial image by optimizing camera parameters and face latent code, which gives a generated image. Besides, we estimate depth from the obtained latent code, create a depth-induced 3D mesh, and render it with updated camera parameters to obtain a warped portrait. Finally, we apply the visibility-based blending so that visible regions are reprojected, and occluded parts are restored with a generative model. Experiments on face undistortion benchmarks and on our self-collected Head Rotation dataset (HeRo), show that SUPER outperforms previous approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively, opening new possibilities for photorealistic selfie editing.

- **Summary**: We study the inverse problem of Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging (CASSI), which captures a spatial-spectral data cube using snapshot 2D measurements and uses algorithms to reconstruct 3D hyperspectral images (HSI). However, current methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) struggle to capture long-range dependencies and non-local similarities. The recently popular Transformer-based methods are poorly deployed on downstream tasks due to the high computational cost caused by self-attention. In this paper, we propose Coarse-Fine Spectral-Aware Deformable Convolution Network (CFSDCN), applying deformable convolutional networks (DCN) to this task for the first time. Considering the sparsity of HSI, we design a deformable convolution module that exploits its deformability to capture long-range dependencies and non-local similarities. In addition, we propose a new spectral information interaction module that considers both coarse-grained and fine-grained spectral similarities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CFSDCN significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both simulated and real HSI datasets.

- **Summary**: Collaborative perception has garnered considerable attention due to its capacity to address several inherent challenges in single-agent perception, including occlusion and out-of-range issues. However, existing collaborative perception systems heavily rely on precise localization systems to establish a consistent spatial coordinate system between agents. This reliance makes them susceptible to large pose errors or malicious attacks, resulting in substantial reductions in perception performance. To address this, we propose~$\mathtt{CoBEVGlue}$, a novel self-localized collaborative perception system, which achieves more holistic and robust collaboration without using an external localization system. The core of~$\mathtt{CoBEVGlue}$ is a novel spatial alignment module, which provides the relative poses between agents by effectively matching co-visible objects across agents. We validate our method on both real-world and simulated datasets. The results show that i) $\mathtt{CoBEVGlue}$ achieves state-of-the-art detection performance under arbitrary localization noises and attacks; and ii) the spatial alignment module can seamlessly integrate with a majority of previous methods, enhancing their performance by an average of $57.7\%$.

- **Summary**: Despite their great success across various multimodal tasks, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are facing a prevalent problem with object hallucinations, where the generated textual responses are inconsistent with ground-truth objects in the given image. This paper investigates various LVLMs and pinpoints attention deficiency toward discriminative local image features as one root cause of object hallucinations. Specifically, LVLMs predominantly attend to prompt-independent global image features, while failing to capture prompt-relevant local features, consequently undermining the visual grounding capacity of LVLMs and leading to hallucinations. To this end, we propose Assembly of Global and Local Attention (AGLA), a training-free and plug-and-play approach that mitigates object hallucinations by exploring an ensemble of global features for response generation and local features for visual discrimination simultaneously. Our approach exhibits an image-prompt matching scheme that captures prompt-relevant local features from images, leading to an augmented view of the input image where prompt-relevant content is reserved while irrelevant distractions are masked. With the augmented view, a calibrated decoding distribution can be derived by integrating generative global features from the original image and discriminative local features from the augmented image. Extensive experiments show that AGLA consistently mitigates object hallucinations and enhances general perception capability for LVLMs across various discriminative and generative benchmarks. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Lackel/AGLA.

- **Summary**: Skin cancer is one of the most common and deadliest types of cancer. Early diagnosis of skin cancer at a benign stage is critical to reducing cancer mortality. To detect skin cancer at an earlier stage an automated system is compulsory that can save the life of many patients. Many previous studies have addressed the problem of skin cancer diagnosis using various deep learning and transfer learning models. However, existing literature has limitations in its accuracy and time-consuming procedure. In this work, we applied five different pre-trained transfer learning approaches for binary classification of skin cancer detection at benign and malignant stages. To increase the accuracy of these models we fine-tune different layers and activation functions. We used a publicly available ISIC dataset to evaluate transfer learning approaches. For model stability, data augmentation techniques are applied to improve the randomness of the input dataset. These approaches are evaluated using different hyperparameters such as batch sizes, epochs, and optimizers. The experimental results show that the ResNet-50 model provides an accuracy of 0.935, F1-score of 0.86, and precision of 0.94.

- **Summary**: The Privacy-sensitive Object Identification (POI) task allocates bounding boxes for privacy-sensitive objects in a scene. The key to POI is settling an object's privacy class (privacy-sensitive or non-privacy-sensitive). In contrast to conventional object classes which are determined by the visual appearance of an object, one object's privacy class is derived from the scene contexts and is subject to various implicit factors beyond its visual appearance. That is, visually similar objects may be totally opposite in their privacy classes. To explicitly derive the objects' privacy class from the scene contexts, in this paper, we interpret the POI task as a visual reasoning task aimed at the privacy of each object in the scene. Following this interpretation, we propose the PrivacyGuard framework for POI. PrivacyGuard contains three stages. i) Structuring: an unstructured image is first converted into a structured, heterogeneous scene graph that embeds rich scene contexts. ii) Data Augmentation: a contextual perturbation oversampling strategy is proposed to create slightly perturbed privacy-sensitive objects in a scene graph, thereby balancing the skewed distribution of privacy classes. iii) Hybrid Graph Generation & Reasoning: the balanced, heterogeneous scene graph is then transformed into a hybrid graph by endowing it with extra "node-node" and "edge-edge" homogeneous paths. These homogeneous paths allow direct message passing between nodes or edges, thereby accelerating reasoning and facilitating the capturing of subtle context changes. Based on this hybrid graph... **For the full abstract, see the original paper.**

- **Summary**: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly broadened the scope of applications in natural language processing, with multi-modal LLMs extending these capabilities to integrate and interpret visual data. However, existing benchmarks for visual language models (VLMs) predominantly focus on single-image inputs, neglecting the crucial aspect of multi-image understanding. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-Image Relational Benchmark MIRB, designed to evaluate VLMs' ability to compare, analyze, and reason across multiple images. Our benchmark encompasses four categories: perception, visual world knowledge, reasoning, and multi-hop reasoning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of open-source and closed-source models, we demonstrate that while open-source VLMs were shown to approach the performance of GPT-4V in single-image tasks, a significant performance gap remains in multi-image reasoning tasks. Our findings also reveal that even the state-of-the-art GPT-4V model struggles with our benchmark, underscoring the need for further research and development in this area. We believe our contribution of MIRB could serve as a testbed for developing the next-generation multi-modal models.

- **Summary**: As diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) are being employed as mainstream models for generative artificial intelligence (AI), the study of their memorization of the raw training data has attracted growing attention. Existing works in this direction aim to establish an understanding of whether or to what extent DPMs learn by memorization. Such an understanding is crucial for identifying potential risks of data leakage and copyright infringement in diffusion models and, more importantly, for more controllable generation and trustworthy application of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). While previous works have made important observations of when DPMs are prone to memorization, these findings are mostly empirical, and the developed data extraction methods only work for conditional diffusion models. In this work, we aim to establish a theoretical understanding of memorization in DPMs with 1) a memorization metric for theoretical analysis, 2) an analysis of conditional memorization with informative and random labels, and 3) two better evaluation metrics for measuring memorization. Based on the theoretical analysis, we further propose a novel data extraction method called \textbf{Surrogate condItional Data Extraction (SIDE)} that leverages a classifier trained on generated data as a surrogate condition to extract training data directly from unconditional diffusion models. Our empirical results demonstrate that SIDE can extract training data from diffusion models where previous methods fail, and it is on average over 50\% more effective across different scales of the CelebA dataset.

- **Summary**: Machine Learning (ML) for Mineral Prospectivity Mapping (MPM) remains a challenging problem as it requires the analysis of associations between large-scale multi-modal geospatial data and few historical mineral commodity observations (positive labels). Recent MPM works have explored Deep Learning (DL) as a modeling tool with more representation capacity. However, these overparameterized methods may be more prone to overfitting due to their reliance on scarce labeled data. While a large quantity of unlabeled geospatial data exists, no prior MPM works have considered using such information in a self-supervised manner. Our MPM approach uses a masked image modeling framework to pretrain a backbone neural network in a self-supervised manner using unlabeled geospatial data alone. After pretraining, the backbone network provides feature extraction for downstream MPM tasks. We evaluated our approach alongside existing methods to assess mineral prospectivity of Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) and Clastic-Dominated (CD) Lead-Zinc deposits in North America and Australia. Our results demonstrate that self-supervision promotes robustness in learned features, improving prospectivity predictions. Additionally, we leverage explainable artificial intelligence techniques to demonstrate that individual predictions can be interpreted from a geological perspective.

- **Summary**: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to learn semantic primitives (attributes and objects) from seen compositions and recognize unseen attribute-object compositions. Existing CZSL datasets focus on single attributes, neglecting the fact that objects naturally exhibit multiple interrelated attributes. Real-world objects often possess multiple interrelated attributes, and current datasets' narrow attribute scope and single attribute labeling introduce annotation biases, undermining model performance and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-Attribute Composition (MAC) dataset, encompassing 18,217 images and 11,067 compositions with comprehensive, representative, and diverse attribute annotations. MAC includes an average of 30.2 attributes per object and 65.4 objects per attribute, facilitating better multi-attribute composition predictions. Our dataset supports deeper semantic understanding and higher-order attribute associations, providing a more realistic and challenging benchmark for the CZSL task. We also develop solutions for multi-attribute compositional learning and propose the MM-encoder to disentangling the attributes and objects.

- **Summary**: We introduce latent intuitive physics, a transfer learning framework for physics simulation that can infer hidden properties of fluids from a single 3D video and simulate the observed fluid in novel scenes. Our key insight is to use latent features drawn from a learnable prior distribution conditioned on the underlying particle states to capture the invisible and complex physical properties. To achieve this, we train a parametrized prior learner given visual observations to approximate the visual posterior of inverse graphics, and both the particle states and the visual posterior are obtained from a learned neural renderer. The converged prior learner is embedded in our probabilistic physics engine, allowing us to perform novel simulations on unseen geometries, boundaries, and dynamics without knowledge of the true physical parameters. We validate our model in three ways: (i) novel scene simulation with the learned visual-world physics, (ii) future prediction of the observed fluid dynamics, and (iii) supervised particle simulation. Our model demonstrates strong performance in all three tasks.

- **Summary**: Despite the high-quality results of text-to-image generation, stereotypical biases have been spotted in their generated contents, compromising the fairness of generative models. In this work, we propose to learn adaptive inclusive tokens to shift the attribute distribution of the final generative outputs. Unlike existing de-biasing approaches, our method requires neither explicit attribute specification nor prior knowledge of the bias distribution. Specifically, the core of our method is a lightweight adaptive mapping network, which can customize the inclusive tokens for the concepts to be de-biased, making the tokens generalizable to unseen concepts regardless of their original bias distributions. This is achieved by tuning the adaptive mapping network with a handful of balanced and inclusive samples using an anchor loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous bias mitigation methods without attribute specification while preserving the alignment between generative results and text descriptions. Moreover, our method achieves comparable performance to models that require specific attributes or editing directions for generation. Extensive experiments showcase the effectiveness of our adaptive inclusive tokens in mitigating stereotypical bias in text-to-image generation. The code will be available at https://github.com/itsmag11/AITTI.

- **Summary**: Histopathological analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has seen a surge in the utilization of deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, CNNs often fall short in capturing the intricate spatial dependencies inherent in WSIs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) present a promising alternative, adept at directly modeling pairwise interactions and effectively discerning the topological tissue and cellular structures within WSIs. Recognizing the pressing need for deep learning techniques that harness the topological structure of WSIs, the application of GNNs in histopathology has experienced rapid growth. In this comprehensive review, we survey GNNs in histopathology, discuss their applications, and explore emerging trends that pave the way for future advancements in the field. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of GNNs and their potential applications in histopathology. Leveraging quantitative literature analysis, we identify four emerging trends: Hierarchical GNNs, Adaptive Graph Structure Learning, Multimodal GNNs, and Higher-order GNNs. Through an in-depth exploration of these trends, we offer insights into the evolving landscape of GNNs in histopathological analysis. Based on our findings, we propose future directions to propel the field forward. Our analysis serves to guide researchers and practitioners towards innovative approaches and methodologies, fostering advancements in histopathological analysis through the lens of graph neural networks.

- **Summary**: Vision-enabled language models (VLMs) are now used to build autonomous multimodal agents capable of taking actions in real environments. In this paper, we show that multimodal agents raise new safety risks, even though attacking agents is more challenging than prior attacks due to limited access to and knowledge about the environment. Our attacks use adversarial text strings to guide gradient-based perturbation over one trigger image in the environment: (1) our captioner attack attacks white-box captioners if they are used to process images into captions as additional inputs to the VLM; (2) our CLIP attack attacks a set of CLIP models jointly, which can transfer to proprietary VLMs. To evaluate the attacks, we curated VisualWebArena-Adv, a set of adversarial tasks based on VisualWebArena, an environment for web-based multimodal agent tasks. Within an L-infinity norm of $16/256$ on a single image, the captioner attack can make a captioner-augmented GPT-4V agent execute the adversarial goals with a 75% success rate. When we remove the captioner or use GPT-4V to generate its own captions, the CLIP attack can achieve success rates of 21% and 43%, respectively. Experiments on agents based on other VLMs, such as Gemini-1.5, Claude-3, and GPT-4o, show interesting differences in their robustness. Further analysis reveals several key factors contributing to the attack's success, and we also discuss the implications for defenses as well.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models excel at creating visually-convincing images, but they often struggle to meet subtle constraints inherent in the training data. Such constraints could be physics-based (e.g., satisfying a PDE), geometric (e.g., respecting symmetry), or semantic (e.g., including a particular number of objects). When the training data all satisfy a certain constraint, enforcing this constraint on a diffusion model not only improves its distribution-matching accuracy but also makes it more reliable for generating valid synthetic data and solving constrained inverse problems. However, existing methods for constrained diffusion models are inflexible with different types of constraints. Recent work proposed to learn mirror diffusion models (MDMs) in an unconstrained space defined by a mirror map and to impose the constraint with an inverse mirror map, but analytical mirror maps are challenging to derive for complex constraints. We propose neural approximate mirror maps (NAMMs) for general constraints. Our approach only requires a differentiable distance function from the constraint set. We learn an approximate mirror map that pushes data into an unconstrained space and a corresponding approximate inverse that maps data back to the constraint set. A generative model, such as an MDM, can then be trained in the learned mirror space and its samples restored to the constraint set by the inverse map. We validate our approach on a variety of constraints, showing that compared to an unconstrained diffusion model, a NAMM-based MDM substantially improves constraint satisfaction. We also demonstrate how existing diffusion-based inverse-problem solvers can be easily applied in the learned mirror space to solve constrained inverse problems.

- **Summary**: Video editing stands as a cornerstone of digital media, from entertainment and education to professional communication. However, previous methods often overlook the necessity of comprehensively understanding both global and local contexts, leading to inaccurate and inconsistency edits in the spatiotemporal dimension, especially for long videos. In this paper, we introduce VIA, a unified spatiotemporal VIdeo Adaptation framework for global and local video editing, pushing the limits of consistently editing minute-long videos. First, to ensure local consistency within individual frames, the foundation of VIA is a novel test-time editing adaptation method, which adapts a pre-trained image editing model for improving consistency between potential editing directions and the text instruction, and adapts masked latent variables for precise local control. Furthermore, to maintain global consistency over the video sequence, we introduce spatiotemporal adaptation that adapts consistent attention variables in key frames and strategically applies them across the whole sequence to realize the editing effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to baseline methods, our VIA approach produces edits that are more faithful to the source videos, more coherent in the spatiotemporal context, and more precise in local control. More importantly, we show that VIA can achieve consistent long video editing in minutes, unlocking the potentials for advanced video editing tasks over long video sequences.

- **Summary**: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the object referred to by the query sentence throughout the entire video. Most existing methods require end-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which could be computation-consuming and less scalable. In this work, we aim to efficiently adapt foundation segmentation models for addressing RVOS from weak supervision with the proposed Grounded Prompting (GroPrompt) framework. More specifically, we propose Text-Aware Prompt Contrastive Learning (TAP-CL) to enhance the association between the position prompts and the referring sentences with only box supervisions, including Text-Contrastive Prompt Learning (TextCon) and Modality-Contrastive Prompt Learning (ModalCon) at frame level and video level, respectively. With the proposed TAP-CL, our GroPrompt framework can generate temporal-consistent yet text-aware position prompts describing locations and movements for the referred object from the video. The experimental results in the standard RVOS benchmarks (Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, A2D-Sentences, and JHMDB-Sentences) demonstrate the competitive performance of our proposed GroPrompt framework given only bounding box weak supervisions.

- **Summary**: Recent works show that reducing the number of layers in a convolutional neural network can enhance efficiency while maintaining the performance of the network. Existing depth compression methods remove redundant non-linear activation functions and merge the consecutive convolution layers into a single layer. However, these methods suffer from a critical drawback; the kernel size of the merged layers becomes larger, significantly undermining the latency reduction gained from reducing the depth of the network. We show that this problem can be addressed by jointly pruning convolution layers and activation functions. To this end, we propose LayerMerge, a novel depth compression method that selects which activation layers and convolution layers to remove, to achieve a desired inference speed-up while minimizing performance loss. Since the corresponding selection problem involves an exponential search space, we formulate a novel surrogate optimization problem and efficiently solve it via dynamic programming. Empirical results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing depth compression and layer pruning methods on various network architectures, both on image classification and generation tasks. We release the code at https://github.com/snu-mllab/LayerMerge.

- **Summary**: Existing methods for long video understanding primarily focus on videos only lasting tens of seconds, with limited exploration of techniques for handling longer videos. The increased number of frames in longer videos presents two main challenges: difficulty in locating key information and performing long-range reasoning. Thus, we propose DrVideo, a document-retrieval-based system designed for long video understanding. Our key idea is to convert the long-video understanding problem into a long-document understanding task so as to effectively leverage the power of large language models. Specifically, DrVideo transforms a long video into a text-based long document to initially retrieve key frames and augment the information of these frames, which is used this as the system's starting point. It then employs an agent-based iterative loop to continuously search for missing information, augment relevant data, and provide final predictions in a chain-of-thought manner once sufficient question-related information is gathered. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method. DrVideo outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods with +3.8 accuracy on EgoSchema benchmark (3 minutes), +17.9 in MovieChat-1K break mode, +38.0 in MovieChat-1K global mode (10 minutes), and +30.2 on the LLama-Vid QA dataset (over 60 minutes).

- **Summary**: Change detection in remote sensing images is essential for tracking environmental changes on the Earth's surface. Despite the success of vision transformers (ViTs) as backbones in numerous computer vision applications, they remain underutilized in change detection, where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) continue to dominate due to their powerful feature extraction capabilities. In this paper, our study uncovers ViTs' unique advantage in discerning large-scale changes, a capability where CNNs fall short. Capitalizing on this insight, we introduce ChangeViT, a framework that adopts a plain ViT backbone to enhance the performance of large-scale changes. This framework is supplemented by a detail-capture module that generates detailed spatial features and a feature injector that efficiently integrates fine-grained spatial information into high-level semantic learning. The feature integration ensures that ChangeViT excels in both detecting large-scale changes and capturing fine-grained details, providing comprehensive change detection across diverse scales. Without bells and whistles, ChangeViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular high-resolution datasets (i.e., LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and CLCD) and one low-resolution dataset (i.e., OSCD), which underscores the unleashed potential of plain ViTs for change detection. Furthermore, thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses validate the efficacy of the introduced modules, solidifying the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: Accurately estimating depth in 360-degree imagery is crucial for virtual reality, autonomous navigation, and immersive media applications. Existing depth estimation methods designed for perspective-view imagery fail when applied to 360-degree images due to different camera projections and distortions, whereas 360-degree methods perform inferior due to the lack of labeled data pairs. We propose a new depth estimation framework that utilizes unlabeled 360-degree data effectively. Our approach uses state-of-the-art perspective depth estimation models as teacher models to generate pseudo labels through a six-face cube projection technique, enabling efficient labeling of depth in 360-degree images. This method leverages the increasing availability of large datasets. Our approach includes two main stages: offline mask generation for invalid regions and an online semi-supervised joint training regime. We tested our approach on benchmark datasets such as Matterport3D and Stanford2D3D, showing significant improvements in depth estimation accuracy, particularly in zero-shot scenarios. Our proposed training pipeline can enhance any 360 monocular depth estimator and demonstrates effective knowledge transfer across different camera projections and data types.

- **Summary**: Deep learning approaches for animal re-identification have had a major impact on conservation, significantly reducing the time required for many downstream tasks, such as well-being monitoring. We propose a method called Recurrence over Video Frames (RoVF), which uses a recurrent head based on the Perceiver architecture to iteratively construct an embedding from a video clip. RoVF is trained using triplet loss based on the co-occurrence of individuals in the video frames, where the individual IDs are unavailable. We tested this method and various models based on the DINOv2 transformer architecture on a dataset of meerkats collected at the Wellington Zoo. Our method achieves a top-1 re-identification accuracy of $49\%$, which is higher than that of the best DINOv2 model ($42\%$). We found that the model can match observations of individuals where humans cannot, and our model (RoVF) performs better than the comparisons with minimal fine-tuning. In future work, we plan to improve these models by using pre-text tasks, apply them to animal behaviour classification, and perform a hyperparameter search to optimise the models further.

- **Summary**: Matching a target spectrum with known spectra in a spectral library is a common method for material identification in hyperspectral imaging research. Hyperspectral spectra exhibit precise absorption features across different wavelength segments, and the unique shapes and positions of these absorptions create distinct spectral signatures for each material, aiding in their identification. Therefore, only the specific positions can be considered for material identification. This study introduces the Weighted Sum of Segmented Correlation method, which calculates correlation indices between various segments of a library and a test spectrum, and derives a matching index, favoring positive correlations and penalizing negative correlations using assigned weights. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated for mineral identification in hyperspectral images from both Earth and Martian surfaces.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a review of the NTIRE 2024 challenge on night photography rendering. The goal of the challenge was to find solutions that process raw camera images taken in nighttime conditions, and thereby produce a photo-quality output images in the standard RGB (sRGB) space. Unlike the previous year's competition, the challenge images were collected with a mobile phone and the speed of algorithms was also measured alongside the quality of their output. To evaluate the results, a sufficient number of viewers were asked to assess the visual quality of the proposed solutions, considering the subjective nature of the task. There were 2 nominations: quality and efficiency. Top 5 solutions in terms of output quality were sorted by evaluation time (see Fig. 1). The top ranking participants' solutions effectively represent the state-of-the-art in nighttime photography rendering. More results can be found at https://nightimaging.org.

- **Summary**: In a world where more decisions are made using artificial intelligence, it is of utmost importance to ensure these decisions are well-grounded. Neural networks are the modern building blocks for artificial intelligence. Modern neural network-based computer vision models are often used for object classification tasks. Correctly classifying objects with \textit{certainty} has become of great importance in recent times. However, quantifying the inherent \textit{uncertainty} of the output from neural networks is a challenging task. Here we show a possible method to quantify and evaluate the uncertainty of the output of different computer vision models based on Shannon entropy. By adding perturbation of different levels, on different parts, ranging from the input to the parameters of the network, one introduces entropy to the system. By quantifying and evaluating the perturbed models on the proposed PI and PSI metrics, we can conclude that our theoretical framework can grant insight into the uncertainty of predictions of computer vision models. We believe that this theoretical framework can be applied to different applications for neural networks. We believe that Shannon entropy may eventually have a bigger role in the SOTA (State-of-the-art) methods to quantify uncertainty in artificial intelligence. One day we might be able to apply Shannon entropy to our neural systems.

- **Summary**: Climate change and other anthropogenic factors have led to a catastrophic decline in insects, endangering both biodiversity and the ecosystem services on which human society depends. Data on insect abundance, however, remains woefully inadequate. Camera traps, conventionally used for monitoring terrestrial vertebrates, are now being modified for insects, especially moths. We describe a complete, open-source machine learning-based software pipeline for automated monitoring of moths via camera traps, including object detection, moth/non-moth classification, fine-grained identification of moth species, and tracking individuals. We believe that our tools, which are already in use across three continents, represent the future of massively scalable data collection in entomology.

So we propose a application to help the visually Challenged people to identify the different types of Yemenian currencies through deep learning technique. As money has a significant role in daily life for any business transactions, real-time detection and recognition of banknotes become necessary for a person, especially blind or visually impaired, or for a system that sorts the data. This paper presents a real-time Yemeni currency detection system for visually impaired persons. The proposed system exploits the deep learning approach to facilitate the visually impaired people to prosperously recognize banknotes. For real-time recognition, we have deployed the system into a mobile application.

- **Summary**: As the significance of simulation in medical care and intervention continues to grow, it is anticipated that a simplified and low-cost platform can be set up to execute personalized diagnoses and treatments. 3D Slicer can not only perform medical image analysis and visualization but can also provide surgical navigation and surgical planning functions. In this paper, we have chosen 3D Slicer as our base platform and monocular cameras are used as sensors. Then, We used the neural radiance fields (NeRF) algorithm to complete the 3D model reconstruction of the human head. We compared the accuracy of the NeRF algorithm in generating 3D human head scenes and utilized the MarchingCube algorithm to generate corresponding 3D mesh models. The individual's head pose, obtained through single-camera vision, is transmitted in real-time to the scene created within 3D Slicer. The demonstrations presented in this paper include real-time synchronization of transformations between the human head model in the 3D Slicer scene and the detected head posture. Additionally, we tested a scene where a tool, marked with an ArUco Maker tracked by a single camera, synchronously points to the real-time transformation of the head posture. These demos indicate that our methodology can provide a feasible real-time simulation platform for nasopharyngeal swab collection or intubation.

- **Summary**: The entropy bottleneck introduced by Ball\'e et al. is a common component used in many learned compression models. It encodes a transformed latent representation using a static distribution whose parameters are learned during training. However, the actual distribution of the latent data may vary wildly across different inputs. The static distribution attempts to encompass all possible input distributions, thus fitting none of them particularly well. This unfortunate phenomenon, sometimes known as the amortization gap, results in suboptimal compression. To address this issue, we propose a method that dynamically adapts the encoding distribution to match the latent data distribution for a specific input. First, our model estimates a better encoding distribution for a given input. This distribution is then compressed and transmitted as an additional side-information bitstream. Finally, the decoder reconstructs the encoding distribution and uses it to decompress the corresponding latent data. Our method achieves a Bj{\o}ntegaard-Delta (BD)-rate gain of -7.10% on the Kodak test dataset when applied to the standard fully-factorized architecture. Furthermore, considering computational complexity, the transform used by our method is an order of magnitude cheaper in terms of Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations compared to related side-information methods such as the scale hyperprior.

- **Summary**: The exponential adoption of machine learning (ML) is propelling the world into a future of intelligent automation and data-driven solutions. However, the proliferation of malicious data manipulation attacks against ML, namely adversarial and backdoor attacks, jeopardizes its reliability in safety-critical applications. The existing detection methods against such attacks are built upon assumptions, limiting them in diverse practical scenarios. Thus, motivated by the need for a more robust and unified defense mechanism, we investigate the shared traits of adversarial and backdoor attacks and propose NoiSec that leverages solely the noise, the foundational root cause of such attacks, to detect any malicious data alterations. NoiSec is a reconstruction-based detector that disentangles the noise from the test input, extracts the underlying features from the noise, and leverages them to recognize systematic malicious manipulation. Experimental evaluations conducted on the CIFAR10 dataset demonstrate the efficacy of NoiSec, achieving AUROC scores exceeding 0.954 and 0.852 under white-box and black-box adversarial attacks, respectively, and 0.992 against backdoor attacks. Notably, NoiSec maintains a high detection performance, keeping the false positive rate within only 1\%. Comparative analyses against MagNet-based baselines reveal NoiSec's superior performance across various attack scenarios.

- **Summary**: Data augmentation is a powerful tool for improving deep learning-based image classifiers for plant stress identification and classification. However, selecting an effective set of augmentations from a large pool of candidates remains a key challenge, particularly in imbalanced and confounding datasets. We propose an approach for automated class-specific data augmentation using a genetic algorithm. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr] stress classification where symptoms are observed on leaves; a particularly challenging problem due to confounding classes in the dataset. Our approach yields substantial performance, achieving a mean-per-class accuracy of 97.61% and an overall accuracy of 98% on the soybean leaf stress dataset. Our method significantly improves the accuracy of the most challenging classes, with notable enhancements from 83.01% to 88.89% and from 85.71% to 94.05%, respectively.   A key observation we make in this study is that high-performing augmentation strategies can be identified in a computationally efficient manner. We fine-tune only the linear layer of the baseline model with different augmentations, thereby reducing the computational burden associated with training classifiers from scratch for each augmentation policy while achieving exceptional performance. This research represents an advancement in automated data augmentation strategies for plant stress classification, particularly in the context of confounding datasets. Our findings contribute to the growing body of research in tailored augmentation techniques and their potential impact on disease management strategies, crop yields, and global food security. The proposed approach holds the potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of deep learning-based tools for managing plant stresses in agriculture.

- **Summary**: We present a latent diffusion model over 3D scenes, that can be trained using only 2D image data. To achieve this, we first design an autoencoder that maps multi-view images to 3D Gaussian splats, and simultaneously builds a compressed latent representation of these splats. Then, we train a multi-view diffusion model over the latent space to learn an efficient generative model. This pipeline does not require object masks nor depths, and is suitable for complex scenes with arbitrary camera positions. We conduct careful experiments on two large-scale datasets of complex real-world scenes -- MVImgNet and RealEstate10K. We show that our approach enables generating 3D scenes in as little as 0.2 seconds, either from scratch, from a single input view, or from sparse input views. It produces diverse and high-quality results while running an order of magnitude faster than non-latent diffusion models and earlier NeRF-based generative models

- **Summary**: Many studies have been done to detect smokes from satellite imagery. However, these prior methods are not still effective in detecting various smokes in complex backgrounds. Smokes present challenges in detection due to variations in density, color, lighting, and backgrounds such as clouds, haze, and/or mist, as well as the contextual nature of thin smoke. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a new segmentation model called VTrUNet which consists of a virtual band construction module to capture spectral patterns and a transformer boosted UNet to capture long range contextual features. The model takes imagery of six bands: red, green, blue, near infrared, and two shortwave infrared bands as input. To show the advantages of the proposed model, the paper presents extensive results for various possible model architectures improving UNet and draws interesting conclusions including that adding more modules to a model does not always lead to a better performance. The paper also compares the proposed model with very recently proposed and related models for smoke segmentation and shows that the proposed model performs the best and makes significant improvements on prediction performances
