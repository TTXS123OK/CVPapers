- **Summary**: In recent years, the upstream of Large Language Models (LLM) has also encouraged the computer vision community to work on substantial multimodal datasets and train models on a scale in a self-/semi-supervised manner, resulting in Vision Foundation Models (VFM), as, e.g., Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP). The models generalize well and perform outstandingly on everyday objects or scenes, even on downstream tasks, tasks the model has not been trained on, while the application in specialized domains, as in an industrial context, is still an open research question. Here, fine-tuning the models or transfer learning on domain-specific data is unavoidable when objecting to adequate performance. In this work, we, on the one hand, introduce a pipeline to generate the Industrial Language-Image Dataset (ILID) based on web-crawled data; on the other hand, we demonstrate effective self-supervised transfer learning and discussing downstream tasks after training on the cheaply acquired ILID, which does not necessitate human labeling or intervention. With the proposed approach, we contribute by transferring approaches from state-of-the-art research around foundation models, transfer learning strategies, and applications to the industrial domain.

- **Summary**: While existing video benchmarks largely consider specialized downstream tasks like retrieval or question-answering (QA), contemporary multimodal AI systems must be capable of well-rounded common-sense reasoning akin to human visual understanding. A critical component of human temporal-visual perception is our ability to identify and cognitively model "things happening", or events. Historically, video benchmark tasks have implicitly tested for this ability (e.g., video captioning, in which models describe visual events with natural language), but they do not consider video event understanding as a task in itself. Recent work has begun to explore video analogues to textual event extraction but consists of competing task definitions and datasets limited to highly specific event types. Therefore, while there is a rich domain of event-centric video research spanning the past 10+ years, it is unclear how video event understanding should be framed and what resources we have to study it. In this paper, we survey 105 video datasets that require event understanding capability, consider how they contribute to the study of robust event understanding in video, and assess proposed video event extraction tasks in the context of this body of research. We propose suggestions informed by this survey for dataset curation and task framing, with an emphasis on the uniquely temporal nature of video events and ambiguity in visual content.

- **Summary**: Animal habitat surveys play a critical role in preserving the biodiversity of the land. One of the effective ways to gain insights into animal habitats involves identifying animal footprints, which offers valuable information about species distribution, abundance, and behavior. However, due to the scarcity of animal footprint images, there are no well-maintained public datasets, preventing recent advanced techniques in computer vision from being applied to animal tracking. In this paper, we introduce OpenAnimalTracks dataset, the first publicly available labeled dataset designed to facilitate the automated classification and detection of animal footprints. It contains various footprints from 18 wild animal species. Moreover, we build benchmarks for species classification and detection and show the potential of automated footprint identification with representative classifiers and detection models. We find SwinTransformer achieves a promising classification result, reaching 69.41% in terms of the averaged accuracy. Faster-RCNN achieves mAP of 0.295. We hope our dataset paves the way for automated animal tracking techniques, enhancing our ability to protect and manage biodiversity.

- **Summary**: Vector fields are widely used to represent and model flows for many science and engineering applications. This paper introduces a novel neural network architecture for learning tangent vector fields that are intrinsically defined on manifold surfaces embedded in 3D. Previous approaches to learning vector fields on surfaces treat vectors as multi-dimensional scalar fields, using traditional scalar-valued architectures to process channels individually, thus fail to preserve fundamental intrinsic properties of the vector field. The core idea of this work is to introduce a trainable vector heat diffusion module to spatially propagate vector-valued feature data across the surface, which we incorporate into our proposed architecture that consists of vector-valued neurons. Our architecture is invariant to rigid motion of the input, isometric deformation, and choice of local tangent bases, and is robust to discretizations of the surface. We evaluate our Vector Heat Network on triangle meshes, and empirically validate its invariant properties. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the useful industrial application of quadrilateral mesh generation.

- **Summary**: Images captured under low-light scenarios often suffer from low quality. Previous CNN-based deep learning methods often involve using Retinex theory. Nevertheless, most of them cannot perform well in more complicated datasets like LOL-v2 while consuming too much computational resources. Besides, some of these methods require sophisticated training at different stages, making the procedure even more time-consuming and tedious. In this paper, we propose a more accurate, concise, and one-stage Retinex theory based framework, RSEND. RSEND first divides the low-light image into the illumination map and reflectance map, then captures the important details in the illumination map and performs light enhancement. After this step, it refines the enhanced gray-scale image and does element-wise matrix multiplication with the reflectance map. By denoising the output it has from the previous step, it obtains the final result. In all the steps, RSEND utilizes Squeeze and Excitation network to better capture the details. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our Efficient Retinex model significantly outperforms other CNN-based models, achieving a PSNR improvement ranging from 0.44 dB to 4.2 dB in different datasets and even outperforms transformer-based models in the LOL-v2-real dataset.

- **Summary**: Language is highly structured, with syntactic and semantic structures, to some extent, agreed upon by speakers of the same language. With implicit or explicit awareness of such structures, humans can learn and use language efficiently and generalize to sentences that contain unseen words. Motivated by human language learning, in this dissertation, we consider a family of machine learning tasks that aim to learn language structures through grounding. We seek distant supervision from other data sources (i.e., grounds), including but not limited to other modalities (e.g., vision), execution results of programs, and other languages.   We demonstrate the potential of this task formulation and advocate for its adoption through three schemes. In Part I, we consider learning syntactic parses through visual grounding. We propose the task of visually grounded grammar induction, present the first models to induce syntactic structures from visually grounded text and speech, and find that the visual grounding signals can help improve the parsing quality over language-only models. As a side contribution, we propose a novel evaluation metric that enables the evaluation of speech parsing without text or automatic speech recognition systems involved. In Part II, we propose two execution-aware methods to map sentences into corresponding semantic structures (i.e., programs), significantly improving compositional generalization and few-shot program synthesis. In Part III, we propose methods that learn language structures from annotations in other languages. Specifically, we propose a method that sets a new state of the art on cross-lingual word alignment. We then leverage the learned word alignments to improve the performance of zero-shot cross-lingual dependency parsing, by proposing a novel substructure-based projection method that preserves structural knowledge learned from the source language.

- **Summary**: Training a unified model to take multiple targets into account is a trend towards artificial general intelligence. However, how to efficiently mitigate the training conflicts among heterogeneous data collected from different domains or tasks remains under-explored. In this study, we explore to leverage Mixture of Low-rank Adapters (MoLA) to mitigate conflicts in heterogeneous data training, which requires to jointly train the multiple low-rank adapters and their shared backbone. Specifically, we introduce two variants of MoLA, namely, MoLA-Grad and MoLA-Router, to respectively handle the target-aware and target-agnostic scenarios during inference. The former uses task identifiers to assign personalized low-rank adapters to each task, disentangling task-specific knowledge towards their adapters, thereby mitigating heterogeneity conflicts. The latter uses a novel Task-wise Decorrelation (TwD) loss to intervene the router to learn oriented weight combinations of adapters to homogeneous tasks, achieving similar effects. We conduct comprehensive experiments to verify the superiority of MoLA over previous state-of-the-art methods and present in-depth analysis on its working mechanism.

- **Summary**: In recent years, deep learning-based point cloud normal estimation has made great progress. However, existing methods mainly rely on the PCPNet dataset, leading to overfitting. In addition, the correlation between point clouds with different noise scales remains unexplored, resulting in poor performance in cross-domain scenarios. In this paper, we explore the consistency of intrinsic features learned from clean and noisy point clouds using an Asymmetric Siamese Network architecture. By applying reasonable constraints between features extracted from different branches, we enhance the quality of normal estimation. Moreover, we introduce a novel multi-view normal estimation dataset that includes a larger variety of shapes with different noise levels. Evaluation of existing methods on this new dataset reveals their inability to adapt to different types of shapes, indicating a degree of overfitting. Extensive experiments show that the proposed dataset poses significant challenges for point cloud normal estimation and that our feature constraint mechanism effectively improves upon existing methods and reduces overfitting in current architectures.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a temporal group alignment and fusion network to enhance the quality of compressed videos by using the long-short term correlations between frames. The proposed model consists of the intra-group feature alignment (IntraGFA) module, the inter-group feature fusion (InterGFF) module, and the feature enhancement (FE) module. We form the group of pictures (GoP) by selecting frames from the video according to their temporal distances to the target enhanced frame. With this grouping, the composed GoP can contain either long- or short-term correlated information of neighboring frames. We design the IntraGFA module to align the features of frames of each GoP to eliminate the motion existing between frames. We construct the InterGFF module to fuse features belonging to different GoPs and finally enhance the fused features with the FE module to generate high-quality video frames. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves up to 0.05dB gain and lower complexity compared to the state-of-the-art method.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Survival analysis, as a challenging task, requires integrating Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and genomic data for comprehensive decision-making. There are two main challenges in this task: significant heterogeneity and complex inter- and intra-modal interactions between the two modalities. Previous approaches utilize co-attention methods, which fuse features from both modalities only once after separate encoding. However, these approaches are insufficient for modeling the complex task due to the heterogeneous nature between the modalities. To address these issues, we propose a Biased Progressive Encoding (BPE) paradigm, performing encoding and fusion simultaneously. This paradigm uses one modality as a reference when encoding the other. It enables deep fusion of the modalities through multiple alternating iterations, progressively reducing the cross-modal disparities and facilitating complementary interactions. Besides modality heterogeneity, survival analysis involves various biomarkers from WSIs, genomics, and their combinations. The critical biomarkers may exist in different modalities under individual variations, necessitating flexible adaptation of the models to specific scenarios. Therefore, we further propose a Mixture of Multimodal Experts (MoME) layer to dynamically selects tailored experts in each stage of the BPE paradigm. Experts incorporate reference information from another modality to varying degrees, enabling a balanced or biased focus on different modalities during the encoding process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method on various datasets, including TCGA-BLCA, TCGA-UCEC and TCGA-LUAD.

- **Summary**: Fine-grained urban flow inference (FUFI) is a crucial transportation service aimed at improving traffic efficiency and safety. FUFI can infer fine-grained urban traffic flows based solely on observed coarse-grained data. However, most of existing methods focus on the influence of single-scale static geographic information on FUFI, neglecting the interactions and dynamic information between different-scale regions within the city. Different-scale geographical features can capture redundant information from the same spatial areas. In order to effectively learn multi-scale information across time and space, we propose an effective fine-grained urban flow inference model called UrbanMSR, which uses self-supervised contrastive learning to obtain dynamic multi-scale representations of neighborhood-level and city-level geographic information, and fuses multi-scale representations to improve fine-grained accuracy. The fusion of multi-scale representations enhances fine-grained. We validate the performance through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The resutls compared with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model.

- **Summary**: We introduce a multimodal vision framework for precision livestock farming, harnessing the power of GroundingDINO, HQSAM, and ViTPose models. This integrated suite enables comprehensive behavioral analytics from video data without invasive animal tagging. GroundingDINO generates accurate bounding boxes around livestock, while HQSAM segments individual animals within these boxes. ViTPose estimates key body points, facilitating posture and movement analysis. Demonstrated on a sheep dataset with grazing, running, sitting, standing, and walking activities, our framework extracts invaluable insights: activity and grazing patterns, interaction dynamics, and detailed postural evaluations. Applicable across species and video resolutions, this framework revolutionizes non-invasive livestock monitoring for activity detection, counting, health assessments, and posture analyses. It empowers data-driven farm management, optimizing animal welfare and productivity through AI-powered behavioral understanding.

- **Summary**: Cross-view geo-localization has garnered notable attention in the realm of computer vision, spurred by the widespread availability of copious geotagged datasets and the advancements in machine learning techniques. This paper provides a thorough survey of cutting-edge methodologies, techniques, and associated challenges that are integral to this domain, with a focus on feature-based and deep learning strategies. Feature-based methods capitalize on unique features to establish correspondences across disparate viewpoints, whereas deep learning-based methodologies deploy convolutional neural networks to embed view-invariant attributes. This work also delineates the multifaceted challenges encountered in cross-view geo-localization, such as variations in viewpoints and illumination, the occurrence of occlusions, and it elucidates innovative solutions that have been formulated to tackle these issues. Furthermore, we delineate benchmark datasets and relevant evaluation metrics, and also perform a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, we conclude the paper with a discussion on prospective avenues for future research and the burgeoning applications of cross-view geo-localization in an intricately interconnected global landscape.

- **Summary**: Visual sensors are not only becoming better at capturing high-quality images but also they have steadily increased their capabilities in processing data on their own on-chip. Yet the majority of VO pipelines rely on the transmission and processing of full images in a centralized unit (e.g. CPU or GPU), which often contain much redundant and low-quality information for the task. In this paper, we address the task of frame-to-frame rotational estimation but, instead of reasoning about relative motion between frames using the full images, distribute the estimation at pixel-level. In this paradigm, each pixel produces an estimate of the global motion by only relying on local information and local message-passing with neighbouring pixels. The resulting per-pixel estimates can then be communicated to downstream tasks, yielding higher-level, informative cues instead of the original raw pixel-readings. We evaluate the proposed approach on real public datasets, where we offer detailed insights about this novel technique and open-source our implementation for the future benefit of the community.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel method for learning representations of poses for 3D deformable objects, which specializes in 1) disentangling pose information from the object's identity, 2) facilitating the learning of pose variations, and 3) transferring pose information to other object identities. Based on these properties, our method enables the generation of 3D deformable objects with diversity in both identities and poses, using variations of a single object. It does not require explicit shape parameterization such as skeletons or joints, point-level or shape-level correspondence supervision, or variations of the target object for pose transfer. To achieve pose disentanglement, compactness for generative models, and transferability, we first design the pose extractor to represent the pose as a keypoint-based hybrid representation and the pose applier to learn an implicit deformation field. To better distill pose information from the object's geometry, we propose the implicit pose applier to output an intrinsic mesh property, the face Jacobian. Once the extracted pose information is transferred to the target object, the pose applier is fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to better describe the target object's shapes with pose variations. The extracted poses are also used to train a cascaded diffusion model to enable the generation of novel poses. Our experiments with the DeformThings4D and Human datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in pose transfer and the ability to generate diverse deformed shapes with various objects and poses.

- **Summary**: Identification of changes in pavement markings has become crucial for infrastructure monitoring, maintenance, development, traffic management, and safety. Automated extraction of roadway geometry is critical in helping with this, given the increasing availability of high-resolution images and advancements in computer vision and object detection. Specifically, due to the substantial volume of satellite and high-resolution aerial images captured at different time instances, change detection has become a viable solution. In this study, an automated framework is developed to detect changes in crosswalks of Orange, Osceola, and Seminole counties in Florida, utilizing data extracted from high-resolution images obtained at various time intervals. Specifically, for Orange County, crosswalk changes between 2019 and 2021 were manually extracted, verified, and categorized as either new or modified crosswalks. For Seminole County, the developed model was used to automatically extract crosswalk changes between 2018 and 2021, while for Osceola County, changes between 2019 and 2020 were extracted. Findings indicate that Orange County witnessed approximately 2,094 crosswalk changes, with 312 occurring on state roads. In Seminole and Osceola counties, on the other hand, 1,040 and 1,402 crosswalk changes were observed on both local and state roads, respectively. Among these, 340 and 344 were identified on state roads in Seminole and Osceola, respectively. Spatiotemporal changes observed in crosswalks can be utilized to regularly update the existing crosswalk inventories, which is essential for agencies engaged in traffic and safety studies. Data extracted from these crosswalk changes can be combined with traffic and crash data to provide valuable insights to policymakers.

- **Summary**: Developing robots capable of executing various manipulation tasks, guided by natural language instructions and visual observations of intricate real-world environments, remains a significant challenge in robotics. Such robot agents need to understand linguistic commands and distinguish between the requirements of different tasks. In this work, we present Sigma-Agent, an end-to-end imitation learning agent for multi-task robotic manipulation. Sigma-Agent incorporates contrastive Imitation Learning (contrastive IL) modules to strengthen vision-language and current-future representations. An effective and efficient multi-view querying Transformer (MVQ-Former) for aggregating representative semantic information is introduced. Sigma-Agent shows substantial improvement over state-of-the-art methods under diverse settings in 18 RLBench tasks, surpassing RVT by an average of 5.2% and 5.9% in 10 and 100 demonstration training, respectively. Sigma-Agent also achieves 62% success rate with a single policy in 5 real-world manipulation tasks. The code will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel method for detecting DeepFakes, enhancing the generalization of detection through semantic decoupling. There are now multiple DeepFake forgery technologies that not only possess unique forgery semantics but may also share common forgery semantics. The unique forgery semantics and irrelevant content semantics may promote over-fitting and hamper generalization for DeepFake detectors. For our proposed method, after decoupling, the common forgery semantics could be extracted from DeepFakes, and subsequently be employed for developing the generalizability of DeepFake detectors. Also, to pursue additional generalizability, we designed an adaptive high-pass module and a two-stage training strategy to improve the independence of decoupled semantics. Evaluation on FF++, Celeb-DF, DFD, and DFDC datasets showcases our method's excellent detection and generalization performance.

- **Summary**: Conditional visual generation has witnessed remarkable progress with the advent of diffusion models (DMs), especially in tasks like control-to-image generation. However, challenges such as expensive computational cost, high inference latency, and difficulties of integration with large language models (LLMs) have necessitated exploring alternatives to DMs. This paper introduces ControlVAR, a novel framework that explores pixel-level controls in visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling for flexible and efficient conditional generation. In contrast to traditional conditional models that learn the conditional distribution, ControlVAR jointly models the distribution of image and pixel-level conditions during training and imposes conditional controls during testing. To enhance the joint modeling, we adopt the next-scale AR prediction paradigm and unify control and image representations. A teacher-forcing guidance strategy is proposed to further facilitate controllable generation with joint modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficacy and flexibility of ControlVAR across various conditional generation tasks against popular conditional DMs, \eg, ControlNet and T2I-Adaptor.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a LArge-scale Video Interpolation Benchmark (LAVIB) for the low-level video task of video frame interpolation (VFI). LAVIB comprises a large collection of high-resolution videos sourced from the web through an automated pipeline with minimal requirements for human verification. Metrics are computed for each video's motion magnitudes, luminance conditions, frame sharpness, and contrast. The collection of videos and the creation of quantitative challenges based on these metrics are under-explored by current low-level video task datasets. In total, LAVIB includes 283K clips from 17K ultra-HD videos, covering 77.6 hours. Benchmark train, val, and test sets maintain similar video metric distributions. Further splits are also created for out-of-distribution (OOD) challenges, with train and test splits including videos of dissimilar attributes.

- **Summary**: Image Matching is a core component of all best-performing algorithms and pipelines in 3D vision. Yet despite matching being fundamentally a 3D problem, intrinsically linked to camera pose and scene geometry, it is typically treated as a 2D problem. This makes sense as the goal of matching is to establish correspondences between 2D pixel fields, but also seems like a potentially hazardous choice. In this work, we take a different stance and propose to cast matching as a 3D task with DUSt3R, a recent and powerful 3D reconstruction framework based on Transformers. Based on pointmaps regression, this method displayed impressive robustness in matching views with extreme viewpoint changes, yet with limited accuracy. We aim here to improve the matching capabilities of such an approach while preserving its robustness. We thus propose to augment the DUSt3R network with a new head that outputs dense local features, trained with an additional matching loss. We further address the issue of quadratic complexity of dense matching, which becomes prohibitively slow for downstream applications if not carefully treated. We introduce a fast reciprocal matching scheme that not only accelerates matching by orders of magnitude, but also comes with theoretical guarantees and, lastly, yields improved results. Extensive experiments show that our approach, coined MASt3R, significantly outperforms the state of the art on multiple matching tasks. In particular, it beats the best published methods by 30% (absolute improvement) in VCRE AUC on the extremely challenging Map-free localization dataset.

- **Summary**: Despite recent surge of interest in deploying colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) for early diagnosis of colorectal diseases, there remains a large gap between the current state of CCE in clinical practice, and the state of its counterpart optical colonoscopy (OC). Our study is aimed at closing this gap, by focusing on the full integration of AI in CCE's pathway, where image processing steps linked to the detection, localization and characterisation of important findings are carried out autonomously using various AI algorithms. We developed a recognition network, that with an impressive sensitivity of 99.9%, a specificity of 99.4%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.8%, detected colorectal polyps. After recognising a polyp within a sequence of images, only those images containing polyps were fed into two parallel independent networks for characterisation, and estimation of the size of those important findings. The characterisation network reached a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 80% in classifying polyps to two groups, namely neoplastic vs. non-neoplastic. The size estimation network reached an accuracy of 88% in correctly segmenting the polyps. By automatically incorporating this crucial information into CCE's pathway, we moved a step closer towards the full integration of AI in CCE's routine clinical practice.

- **Summary**: Point clouds in 3D applications frequently experience quality degradation during processing, e.g., scanning and compression. Reliable point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) is important for developing compression algorithms with good bitrate-quality trade-offs and techniques for quality improvement (e.g., denoising). This paper introduces a full-reference (FR) PCQA method utilizing spectral graph wavelets (SGWs). First, we propose novel SGW-based PCQA metrics that compare SGW coefficients of coordinate and color signals between reference and distorted point clouds. Second, we achieve accurate PCQA by integrating several conventional FR metrics and our SGW-based metrics using support vector regression. To our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce SGWs for PCQA. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed PCQA metric is more accurately correlated with subjective quality scores compared to conventional PCQA metrics.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have recently been shown to excel in many image reconstruction tasks that involve inverse problems based on a forward measurement operator. A common framework uses task-agnostic unconditional models that are later post-conditioned for reconstruction, an approach that typically suffers from suboptimal task performance. While task-specific conditional models have also been proposed, current methods heuristically inject measured data as a naive input channel that elicits sampling inaccuracies. Here, we address the optimal conditioning of diffusion models for solving challenging inverse problems that arise during image reconstruction. Specifically, we propose a novel Bayesian conditioning technique for diffusion models, BCDM, based on score-functions associated with the conditional distribution of desired images given measured data. We rigorously derive the theory to express and train the conditional score-function. Finally, we show state-of-the-art performance in image dealiasing, deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting with the proposed technique.

- **Summary**: With the widespread application of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in fields such as autonomous driving, robot navigation, and terrain mapping, the importance of edge detection in LiDAR images has become increasingly prominent. Traditional edge detection methods often face challenges in accuracy and computational complexity when processing LiDAR images. To address these issues, this study proposes an edge detection method for LiDAR images based on artificial intelligence technology. This paper first reviews the current state of research on LiDAR technology and image edge detection, introducing common edge detection algorithms and their applications in LiDAR image processing. Subsequently, a deep learning-based edge detection model is designed and implemented, optimizing the model training process through preprocessing and enhancement of the LiDAR image dataset. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms traditional methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency, showing significant practical application value. Finally, improvement strategies are proposed for the current method's shortcomings, and the improvements are validated through experiments.

- **Summary**: Accurate volumetric image registration is highly relevant for clinical routines and computer-aided medical diagnosis. Recently, researchers have begun to use transformers in learning-based methods for medical image registration, and have achieved remarkable success. Due to the strong global modeling capability, Transformers are considered a better option than convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for registration. However, they use bulky models with huge parameter sets, which require high computation edge devices for deployment as portable devices or in hospitals. Transformers also need a large amount of training data to produce significant results, and it is often challenging to collect suitable annotated data. Although existing CNN-based image registration can offer rich local information, their global modeling capability is poor for handling long-distance information interaction and limits registration performance. In this work, we propose a CNN-based registration method with an enhanced receptive field, a low number of parameters, and significant results on a limited training dataset. For this, we propose a residual U-Net with embedded parallel dilated-convolutional blocks to enhance the receptive field. The proposed method is evaluated on inter-patient and atlas-based datasets. We show that the performance of the proposed method is comparable and slightly better than transformer-based methods by using only $\SI{1.5}{\percent}$ of its number of parameters.

- **Summary**: Memes, which rapidly disseminate personal opinions and positions across the internet, also pose significant challenges in propagating social bias and prejudice. This study presents a novel approach to detecting harmful memes, particularly within the multicultural and multilingual context of Singapore. Our methodology integrates image captioning, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and Large Language Model (LLM) analysis to comprehensively understand and classify harmful memes. Utilizing the BLIP model for image captioning, PP-OCR and TrOCR for text recognition across multiple languages, and the Qwen LLM for nuanced language understanding, our system is capable of identifying harmful content in memes created in English, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. To enhance the system's performance, we fine-tuned our approach by leveraging additional data labeled using GPT-4V, aiming to distill the understanding capability of GPT-4V for harmful memes to our system. Our framework achieves top-1 at the public leaderboard of the Online Safety Prize Challenge hosted by AI Singapore, with the AUROC as 0.7749 and accuracy as 0.7087, significantly ahead of the other teams. Notably, our approach outperforms previous benchmarks, with FLAVA achieving an AUROC of 0.5695 and VisualBERT an AUROC of 0.5561.

- **Summary**: Animal ethology is an crucial aspect of animal research, and animal behavior labeling is the foundation for studying animal behavior. This process typically involves labeling video clips with behavioral semantic tags, a task that is complex, subjective, and multimodal. With the rapid development of multimodal large language models(LLMs), new application have emerged for animal behavior understanding tasks in livestock scenarios. This study evaluates the visual perception capabilities of multimodal LLMs in animal activity recognition. To achieve this, we created piglet test data comprising close-up video clips of individual piglets and annotated full-shot video clips. These data were used to assess the performance of four multimodal LLMs-Video-LLaMA, MiniGPT4-Video, Video-Chat2, and GPT-4 omni (GPT-4o)-in piglet activity understanding. Through comprehensive evaluation across five dimensions, including counting, actor referring, semantic correspondence, time perception, and robustness, we found that while current multimodal LLMs require improvement in semantic correspondence and time perception, they have initially demonstrated visual perception capabilities for animal activity recognition. Notably, GPT-4o showed outstanding performance, with Video-Chat2 and GPT-4o exhibiting significantly better semantic correspondence and time perception in close-up video clips compared to full-shot clips. The initial evaluation experiments in this study validate the potential of multimodal large language models in livestock scene video understanding and provide new directions and references for future research on animal behavior video understanding. Furthermore, by deeply exploring the influence of visual prompts on multimodal large language models, we expect to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of animal behavior recognition in livestock scenarios through human visual processing methods.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised monocular depth estimation has received widespread attention because of its capability to train without ground truth. In real-world scenarios, the images may be blurry or noisy due to the influence of weather conditions and inherent limitations of the camera. Therefore, it is particularly important to develop a robust depth estimation model. Benefiting from the training strategies of generative networks, generative-based methods often exhibit enhanced robustness. In light of this, we employ a well-converging diffusion model among generative networks for unsupervised monocular depth estimation. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical feature-guided denoising module. This model significantly enriches the model's capacity for learning and interpreting depth distribution by fully leveraging image features to guide the denoising process. Furthermore, we explore the implicit depth within reprojection and design an implicit depth consistency loss. This loss function serves to enhance the performance of the model and ensure the scale consistency of depth within a video sequence. We conduct experiments on the KITTI, Make3D, and our self-collected SIMIT datasets. The results indicate that our approach stands out among generative-based models, while also showcasing remarkable robustness.

- **Summary**: Pose estimation has promised to impact healthcare by enabling more practical methods to quantify nuances of human movement and biomechanics. However, despite the inherent connection between pose estimation and biomechanics, these disciplines have largely remained disparate. For example, most current pose estimation benchmarks use metrics such as Mean Per Joint Position Error, Percentage of Correct Keypoints, or mean Average Precision to assess performance, without quantifying kinematic and physiological correctness - key aspects for biomechanics. To alleviate this challenge, we develop OpenCapBench to offer an easy-to-use unified benchmark to assess common tasks in human pose estimation, evaluated under physiological constraints. OpenCapBench computes consistent kinematic metrics through joints angles provided by an open-source musculoskeletal modeling software (OpenSim). Through OpenCapBench, we demonstrate that current pose estimation models use keypoints that are too sparse for accurate biomechanics analysis. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce SynthPose, a new approach that enables finetuning of pre-trained 2D human pose models to predict an arbitrarily denser set of keypoints for accurate kinematic analysis through the use of synthetic data. Incorporating such finetuning on synthetic data of prior models leads to twofold reduced joint angle errors. Moreover, OpenCapBench allows users to benchmark their own developed models on our clinically relevant cohort. Overall, OpenCapBench bridges the computer vision and biomechanics communities, aiming to drive simultaneous advances in both areas.

- **Summary**: Depth images have a wide range of applications, such as 3D reconstruction, autonomous driving, augmented reality, robot navigation, and scene understanding. Commodity-grade depth cameras are hard to sense depth for bright, glossy, transparent, and distant surfaces. Although existing depth completion methods have achieved remarkable progress, their performance is limited when applied to complex indoor scenarios. To address these problems, we propose a two-step Transformer-based network for indoor depth completion. Unlike existing depth completion approaches, we adopt a self-supervision pre-training encoder based on the masked autoencoder to learn an effective latent representation for the missing depth value; then we propose a decoder based on a token fusion mechanism to complete (i.e., reconstruct) the full depth from the jointly RGB and incomplete depth image. Compared to the existing methods, our proposed network, achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the Matterport3D dataset. In addition, to validate the importance of the depth completion task, we apply our methods to indoor 3D reconstruction. The code, dataset, and demo are available at https://github.com/kailaisun/Indoor-Depth-Completion.

- **Summary**: SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a widely used graphics format that possesses excellent scalability and editability. Image vectorization, which aims to convert raster images to SVGs, is an important yet challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing image vectorization methods either suffer from low reconstruction accuracy for complex images or require long computation time. To address this issue, we propose SuperSVG, a superpixel-based vectorization model that achieves fast and high-precision image vectorization. Specifically, we decompose the input image into superpixels to help the model focus on areas with similar colors and textures. Then, we propose a two-stage self-training framework, where a coarse-stage model is employed to reconstruct the main structure and a refinement-stage model is used for enriching the details. Moreover, we propose a novel dynamic path warping loss to help the refinement-stage model to inherit knowledge from the coarse-stage model. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method in terms of reconstruction accuracy and inference time compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) enables the agent to navigate to a remote location in 3D environments following the natural language instruction. In this field, the agent is usually trained and evaluated in the navigation simulators, lacking effective approaches for sim-to-real transfer. The VLN agents with only a monocular camera exhibit extremely limited performance, while the mainstream VLN models trained with panoramic observation, perform better but are difficult to deploy on most monocular robots. For this case, we propose a sim-to-real transfer approach to endow the monocular robots with panoramic traversability perception and panoramic semantic understanding, thus smoothly transferring the high-performance panoramic VLN models to the common monocular robots. In this work, the semantic traversable map is proposed to predict agent-centric navigable waypoints, and the novel view representations of these navigable waypoints are predicted through the 3D feature fields. These methods broaden the limited field of view of the monocular robots and significantly improve navigation performance in the real world. Our VLN system outperforms previous SOTA monocular VLN methods in R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks within the simulation environments and is also validated in real-world environments, providing a practical and high-performance solution for real-world VLN.

- **Summary**: Our objective is to leverage a differentiable radiance field \eg NeRF to reconstruct detailed 3D surfaces in addition to producing the standard novel view renderings. There have been related methods that perform such tasks, usually by utilizing a signed distance field (SDF). However, the state-of-the-art approaches still fail to correctly reconstruct the small-scale details, such as the leaves, ropes, and textile surfaces. Considering that different methods formulate and optimize the projection from SDF to radiance field with a globally constant Eikonal regularization, we improve with a ray-wise weighting factor to prioritize the rendering and zero-crossing surface fitting on top of establishing a perfect SDF. We propose to adaptively adjust the regularization on the signed distance field so that unsatisfying rendering rays won't enforce strong Eikonal regularization which is ineffective, and allow the gradients from regions with well-learned radiance to effectively back-propagated to the SDF. Consequently, balancing the two objectives in order to generate accurate and detailed surfaces. Additionally, concerning whether there is a geometric bias between the zero-crossing surface in SDF and rendering points in the radiance field, the projection becomes adjustable as well depending on different 3D locations during optimization. Our proposed \textit{RaNeuS} are extensively evaluated on both synthetic and real datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on both novel view synthesis and geometric reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Channel knowledge map (CKM) has received widespread attention as an emerging enabling technology for environment-aware wireless communications. It involves the construction of databases containing location-specific channel knowledge, which are then leveraged to facilitate channel state information (CSI) acquisition and transceiver design. In this context, a fundamental challenge lies in efficiently constructing the CKM based on a given wireless propagation environment. Most existing methods are based on stochastic modeling and sequence prediction, which do not fully exploit the inherent physical characteristics of the propagation environment, resulting in low accuracy and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a Laplacian pyramid (LP)-based CKM construction scheme to predict the channel knowledge at arbitrary locations in a targeted area. Specifically, we first view the channel knowledge as a 2-D image and transform the CKM construction problem into an image-to-image (I2I) inpainting task, which predicts the channel knowledge at a specific location by recovering the corresponding pixel value in the image matrix. Then, inspired by the reversible and closed-form structure of the LP, we show its natural suitability for our task in designing a fast I2I mapping network. For different frequency components of LP decomposition, we design tailored networks accordingly. Besides, to encode the global structural information of the propagation environment, we introduce self-attention and cross-covariance attention mechanisms in different layers, respectively. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the benchmark, achieving higher reconstruction accuracy while with lower computational complexity. Moreover, the proposed approach has a strong generalization ability and can be implemented in different wireless communication scenarios.

- **Summary**: In modern large language models (LLMs), increasing sequence lengths is a crucial challenge for enhancing their comprehension and coherence in handling complex tasks such as multi-modal question answering. However, handling long context sequences with LLMs is prohibitively costly due to the conventional attention mechanism's quadratic time and space complexity, and the context window size is limited by the GPU memory. Although recent works have proposed linear and sparse attention mechanisms to address this issue, their real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train pre-trained models. In response, we propose a novel approach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which simultaneously reduces the training and inference time complexity from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T \log T)$ and the space complexity from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T)$. To this end, we devise a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that generates an attention mask through a novel tree-search-like algorithm for a given query on the fly. HiP is training-free as it only utilizes the pre-trained attention scores to spot the positions of the top-$k$ most significant elements for each query. Moreover, it ensures that no token is overlooked, unlike the sliding window-based sub-quadratic attention methods, such as StreamingLLM. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HiP significantly reduces prompt (i.e., prefill) and decoding latency and memory usage while maintaining high generation performance with little or no degradation. As HiP allows pretrained LLMs to scale to millions of tokens on commodity GPUs with no additional engineering due to its easy plug-and-play deployment, we believe that our work will have a large practical impact, opening up the possibility to many long-context LLM applications previously infeasible.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation is a challenging task, which requires the model to output semantic masks of an image beyond a close-set vocabulary. Although many efforts have been made to utilize powerful CLIP models to accomplish this task, they are still easily overfitting to training classes due to the natural gaps in semantic information between training and new classes. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel framework for openvocabulary semantic segmentation called EBSeg, incorporating an Adaptively Balanced Decoder (AdaB Decoder) and a Semantic Structure Consistency loss (SSC Loss). The AdaB Decoder is designed to generate different image embeddings for both training and new classes. Subsequently, these two types of embeddings are adaptively balanced to fully exploit their ability to recognize training classes and generalization ability for new classes. To learn a consistent semantic structure from CLIP, the SSC Loss aligns the inter-classes affinity in the image feature space with that in the text feature space of CLIP, thereby improving the generalization ability of our model. Furthermore, we employ a frozen SAM image encoder to complement the spatial information that CLIP features lack due to the low training image resolution and image-level supervision inherent in CLIP. Extensive experiments conducted across various benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed EBSeg outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our code and trained models will be here: https://github.com/slonetime/EBSeg.

- **Summary**: Real-time detection and prediction of extreme weather protect human lives and infrastructure. Traditional methods rely on numerical threshold setting and manual interpretation of weather heatmaps with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which can be slow and error-prone. Our research redefines Extreme Weather Events Detection (EWED) by framing it as a Visual Question Answering (VQA) problem, thereby introducing a more precise and automated solution. Leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLM) to simultaneously process visual and textual data, we offer an effective aid to enhance the analysis process of weather heatmaps. Our initial assessment of general-purpose VLMs (e.g., GPT-4-Vision) on EWED revealed poor performance, characterized by low accuracy and frequent hallucinations due to inadequate color differentiation and insufficient meteorological knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce ClimateIQA, the first meteorological VQA dataset, which includes 8,760 wind gust heatmaps and 254,040 question-answer pairs covering four question types, both generated from the latest climate reanalysis data. We also propose Sparse Position and Outline Tracking (SPOT), an innovative technique that leverages OpenCV and K-Means clustering to capture and depict color contours in heatmaps, providing ClimateIQA with more accurate color spatial location information. Finally, we present Climate-Zoo, the first meteorological VLM collection, which adapts VLMs to meteorological applications using the ClimateIQA dataset. Experiment results demonstrate that models from Climate-Zoo substantially outperform state-of-the-art general VLMs, achieving an accuracy increase from 0% to over 90% in EWED verification. The datasets and models in this study are publicly available for future climate science research: https://github.com/AlexJJJChen/Climate-Zoo.

- **Summary**: Text-to-3D generation has shown promising results, yet common challenges such as the Multi-face Janus problem and extended generation time for high-quality assets. In this paper, we address these issues by introducing a novel three-stage training pipeline called GradeADreamer. This pipeline is capable of producing high-quality assets with a total generation time of under 30 minutes using only a single RTX 3090 GPU. Our proposed method employs a Multi-view Diffusion Model, MVDream, to generate Gaussian Splats as a prior, followed by refining geometry and texture using StableDiffusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly mitigates the Multi-face Janus problem and achieves the highest average user preference ranking compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The visual quality of an image is confounded by a number of intertwined factors including its semantic content, distortion characteristics and appearance properties such as brightness, contrast, sharpness, and colourfulness. Distilling high level knowledge about all these quality bearing attributes is crucial for developing objective Image Quality Assessment (IQA).While existing solutions have modeled some of these aspects, a comprehensive solution that involves all these important quality related attributes has not yet been developed. In this paper, we present a new blind IQA (BIQA) model termed Self-supervision and Vision-Language supervision Image QUality Evaluator (SLIQUE) that features a joint vision-language and visual contrastive representation learning framework for acquiring high level knowledge about the images semantic contents, distortion characteristics and appearance properties for IQA. For training SLIQUE, we have developed a systematic approach to constructing a first of its kind large image database annotated with all three categories of quality relevant texts. The Text Annotated Distortion, Appearance and Content (TADAC) database has over 1.6 million images annotated with textual descriptions of their semantic contents, distortion characteristics and appearance properties. The method for constructing TADAC and the database itself will be particularly useful for exploiting vision-language modeling for advanced IQA applications. Extensive experimental results show that SLIQUE has superior performances over state of the art, demonstrating the soundness of its design principle and the effectiveness of its implementation.

- **Summary**: Dataset condensation (DC) methods aim to learn a smaller synthesized dataset with informative data records to accelerate the training of machine learning models. Current distribution matching (DM) based DC methods learn a synthesized dataset by matching the mean of the latent embeddings between the synthetic and the real dataset. However two distributions with the same mean can still be vastly different. In this work we demonstrate the shortcomings of using Maximum Mean Discrepancy to match latent distributions i.e. the weak matching power and lack of outlier regularization. To alleviate these shortcomings we propose our new method: Latent Quantile Matching (LQM) which matches the quantiles of the latent embeddings to minimize the goodness of fit test statistic between two distributions. Empirical experiments on both image and graph-structured datasets show that LQM matches or outperforms previous state of the art in distribution matching based DC. Moreover we show that LQM improves the performance in continual graph learning (CGL) setting where memory efficiency and privacy can be important. Our work sheds light on the application of DM based DC for CGL.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Deep Learning enhances decision-making by integrating diverse information sources, such as texts, images, audio, and videos. To develop trustworthy multimodal approaches, it is essential to understand how uncertainty impacts these models. We introduce LUMA, a unique benchmark dataset, featuring audio, image, and textual data from 50 classes, for learning from uncertain and multimodal data. It extends the well-known CIFAR 10/100 dataset with audio samples extracted from three audio corpora, and text data generated using the Gemma-7B Large Language Model (LLM). The LUMA dataset enables the controlled injection of varying types and degrees of uncertainty to achieve and tailor specific experiments and benchmarking initiatives. LUMA is also available as a Python package including the functions for generating multiple variants of the dataset with controlling the diversity of the data, the amount of noise for each modality, and adding out-of-distribution samples. A baseline pre-trained model is also provided alongside three uncertainty quantification methods: Monte-Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensemble, and Reliable Conflictive Multi-View Learning. This comprehensive dataset and its tools are intended to promote and support the development and benchmarking of trustworthy and robust multimodal deep learning approaches.

- **Summary**: Most existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmarks classify samples with novel labels as the OOD data. However, some marginal OOD samples actually have close semantic contents to the in-distribution (ID) sample, which makes determining the OOD sample a Sorites Paradox. In this paper, we construct a benchmark named Incremental Shift OOD (IS-OOD) to address the issue, in which we divide the test samples into subsets with different semantic and covariate shift degrees relative to the ID dataset. The data division is achieved through a shift measuring method based on our proposed Language Aligned Image feature Decomposition (LAID). Moreover, we construct a Synthetic Incremental Shift (Syn-IS) dataset that contains high-quality generated images with more diverse covariate contents to complement the IS-OOD benchmark. We evaluate current OOD detection methods on our benchmark and find several important insights: (1) The performance of most OOD detection methods significantly improves as the semantic shift increases; (2) Some methods like GradNorm may have different OOD detection mechanisms as they rely less on semantic shifts to make decisions; (3) Excessive covariate shifts in the image are also likely to be considered as OOD for some methods. Our code and data are released in https://github.com/qqwsad5/IS-OOD.

- **Summary**: Achieving robust generalization across diverse data domains remains a significant challenge in computer vision. This challenge is important in safety-critical applications, where deep-neural-network-based systems must perform reliably under various environmental conditions not seen during training. Our study investigates whether the generalization capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods for the semantic segmentation task are complementary. Results show that combining VFMs with UDA has two main benefits: (a) it allows for better UDA performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution performance of VFMs, and (b) it makes certain time-consuming UDA components redundant, thus enabling significant inference speedups. Specifically, with equivalent model sizes, the resulting VFM-UDA method achieves an 8.4$\times$ speed increase over the prior non-VFM state of the art, while also improving performance by +1.2 mIoU in the UDA setting and by +6.1 mIoU in terms of out-of-distribution generalization. Moreover, when we use a VFM with 3.6$\times$ more parameters, the VFM-UDA approach maintains a 3.3$\times$ speed up, while improving the UDA performance by +3.1 mIoU and the out-of-distribution performance by +10.3 mIoU. These results underscore the significant benefits of combining VFMs with UDA, setting new standards and baselines for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: We introduce Nymeria - a large-scale, diverse, richly annotated human motion dataset collected in the wild with multiple multimodal egocentric devices. The dataset comes with a) full-body 3D motion ground truth; b) egocentric multimodal recordings from Project Aria devices with RGB, grayscale, eye-tracking cameras, IMUs, magnetometer, barometer, and microphones; and c) an additional "observer" device providing a third-person viewpoint. We compute world-aligned 6DoF transformations for all sensors, across devices and capture sessions. The dataset also provides 3D scene point clouds and calibrated gaze estimation. We derive a protocol to annotate hierarchical language descriptions of in-context human motion, from fine-grain pose narrations, to atomic actions and activity summarization. To the best of our knowledge, the Nymeria dataset is the world largest in-the-wild collection of human motion with natural and diverse activities; first of its kind to provide synchronized and localized multi-device multimodal egocentric data; and the world largest dataset with motion-language descriptions. It contains 1200 recordings of 300 hours of daily activities from 264 participants across 50 locations, travelling a total of 399Km. The motion-language descriptions provide 310.5K sentences in 8.64M words from a vocabulary size of 6545. To demonstrate the potential of the dataset we define key research tasks for egocentric body tracking, motion synthesis, and action recognition and evaluate several state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. Data and code will be open-sourced.

- **Summary**: Adverse weather conditions can severely affect the performance of LiDAR sensors by introducing unwanted noise in the measurements. Therefore, differentiating between noise and valid points is crucial for the reliable use of these sensors. Current approaches for detecting adverse weather points require large amounts of labeled data, which can be difficult and expensive to obtain. This paper proposes a label-efficient approach to segment LiDAR point clouds in adverse weather. We develop a framework that uses few-shot semantic segmentation to learn to segment adverse weather points from only a few labeled examples. Then, we use a semi-supervised learning approach to generate pseudo-labels for unlabelled point clouds, significantly increasing the amount of training data without requiring any additional labeling. We also integrate good weather data in our training pipeline, allowing for high performance in both good and adverse weather conditions. Results on real and synthetic datasets show that our method performs well in detecting snow, fog, and spray. Furthermore, we achieve competitive performance against fully supervised methods while using only a fraction of labeled data.

- **Summary**: This work aims to develop a measure that can accurately rank the performance of various classifiers when they are tested on unlabeled data from out-of-distribution (OOD) distributions. We commence by demonstrating that conventional uncertainty metrics, notably the maximum Softmax prediction probability, possess inherent utility in forecasting model generalization across certain OOD contexts. Building on this insight, we introduce a new measure called Softmax Correlation (SoftmaxCorr). It calculates the cosine similarity between a class-class correlation matrix, constructed from Softmax output vectors across an unlabeled test dataset, and a predefined reference matrix that embodies ideal class correlations. A high resemblance of predictions to the reference matrix signals that the model delivers confident and uniform predictions across all categories, reflecting minimal uncertainty and confusion. Through rigorous evaluation across a suite of datasets, including ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and WILDS, we affirm the predictive validity of SoftmaxCorr in accurately forecasting model performance within both in-distribution (ID) and OOD settings. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of our proposed measure and suggest avenues for future research.

- **Summary**: Computer-aided design (CAD) tools are utilized in the manufacturing industry for modeling everything from cups to spacecraft. These programs are complex to use and typically require years of training and experience to master. Structured and well-constrained 2D sketches and 3D constructions are crucial components of CAD modeling. A well-executed CAD model can be seamlessly integrated into the manufacturing process, thereby enhancing production efficiency. Deep generative models of 3D shapes and 3D object reconstruction models has garnered significant research interest. However, most of these models are represented in discrete forms. Moreover, the few models based on CAD operations often have substantial input restrictions. In this work, we fine-tuned pre-trained models to create OpenECAD (0.55B, 0.89B, and 4.2B), leveraging the visual, logical, coding, and general capabilities of visual language models. OpenECAD can process images of 3D designs as input and generate highly structured 2D sketches and 3D construction commands. These outputs can be directly used with existing CAD tools' APIs to generate project files. To train our network, we created a new CAD dataset. This dataset is based on existing public CAD datasets, with adjustments and augmentations to meet the requirements of ~VLM training.

- **Summary**: Developing a robust object tracker is a challenging task due to factors such as occlusion, motion blur, fast motion, illumination variations, rotation, background clutter, low resolution and deformation across the frames. In the literature, lots of good approaches based on sparse representation have already been presented to tackle the above problems. However, most of the algorithms do not focus on the learning of sparse representation. They only consider the modeling of target appearance and therefore drift away from the target with the imprecise training samples. By considering all the above factors in mind, we have proposed a visual object tracking algorithm by integrating a coarse-to-fine search strategy based on sparse representation and the weighted multiple instance learning (WMIL) algorithm. Compared with the other trackers, our approach has more information of the original signal with less complexity due to the coarse-to-fine search method, and also has weights for important samples. Thus, it can easily discriminate the background features from the foreground. Furthermore, we have also selected the samples from the un-occluded sub-regions to efficiently develop the strong classifier. As a consequence, a stable and robust object tracker is achieved to tackle all the aforementioned problems. Experimental results with quantitative as well as qualitative analysis on challenging benchmark datasets show the accuracy and efficiency of our method.

- **Summary**: The incidence and mortality rates of malignant tumors, such as acute leukemia, have risen significantly. Clinically, hospitals rely on cytological examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow smears to diagnose malignant tumors, with accurate blood cell counting being crucial. Existing automated methods face challenges such as low feature expression capability, poor interpretability, and redundant feature extraction when processing high-dimensional microimage data. We propose a novel fine-grained classification model, SCKansformer, for bone marrow blood cells, which addresses these challenges and enhances classification accuracy and efficiency. The model integrates the Kansformer Encoder, SCConv Encoder, and Global-Local Attention Encoder. The Kansformer Encoder replaces the traditional MLP layer with the KAN, improving nonlinear feature representation and interpretability. The SCConv Encoder, with its Spatial and Channel Reconstruction Units, enhances feature representation and reduces redundancy. The Global-Local Attention Encoder combines Multi-head Self-Attention with a Local Part module to capture both global and local features. We validated our model using the Bone Marrow Blood Cell Fine-Grained Classification Dataset (BMCD-FGCD), comprising over 10,000 samples and nearly 40 classifications, developed with a partner hospital. Comparative experiments on our private dataset, as well as the publicly available PBC and ALL-IDB datasets, demonstrate that SCKansformer outperforms both typical and advanced microcell classification methods across all datasets. Our source code and private BMCD-FGCD dataset are available at https://github.com/JustlfC03/SCKansformer.

- **Summary**: This work presents Adaptive Local-then-Global Merging (ALGM), a token reduction method for semantic segmentation networks that use plain Vision Transformers. ALGM merges tokens in two stages: (1) In the first network layer, it merges similar tokens within a small local window and (2) halfway through the network, it merges similar tokens across the entire image. This is motivated by an analysis in which we found that, in those situations, tokens with a high cosine similarity can likely be merged without a drop in segmentation quality. With extensive experiments across multiple datasets and network configurations, we show that ALGM not only significantly improves the throughput by up to 100%, but can also enhance the mean IoU by up to +1.1, thereby achieving a better trade-off between segmentation quality and efficiency than existing methods. Moreover, our approach is adaptive during inference, meaning that the same model can be used for optimal efficiency or accuracy, depending on the application.

- **Summary**: Autonomous vehicles rely on camera, LiDAR, and radar sensors to navigate the environment. Adverse weather conditions like snow, rain, and fog are known to be problematic for both camera and LiDAR-based perception systems. Currently, it is difficult to evaluate the performance of these methods due to the lack of publicly available datasets containing multimodal labeled data. To address this limitation, we propose the SemanticSpray++ dataset, which provides labels for camera, LiDAR, and radar data of highway-like scenarios in wet surface conditions. In particular, we provide 2D bounding boxes for the camera image, 3D bounding boxes for the LiDAR point cloud, and semantic labels for the radar targets. By labeling all three sensor modalities, the SemanticSpray++ dataset offers a comprehensive test bed for analyzing the performance of different perception methods when vehicles travel on wet surface conditions. Together with comprehensive label statistics, we also evaluate multiple baseline methods across different tasks and analyze their performances. The dataset will be available at https://semantic-spray-dataset.github.io .

- **Summary**: Existing Vision-Language Compositionality (VLC) benchmarks like SugarCrepe are formulated as image-to-text retrieval problems, where, given an image, the models need to select between the correct textual description and a synthetic hard negative text. In this work we present the Bidirectional Vision-Language Compositionality (BiVLC) dataset. The novelty of BiVLC is to add a synthetic hard negative image generated from the synthetic text, resulting in two image-to-text retrieval examples (one for each image) and, more importantly, two text-to-image retrieval examples (one for each text). Human annotators filter out ill-formed examples ensuring the validity of the benchmark. The experiments on BiVLC uncover a weakness of current multimodal models, as they perform poorly in the text-to-image direction. In fact, when considering both retrieval directions, the conclusions obtained in previous works change significantly. In addition to the benchmark, we show that a contrastive model trained using synthetic images and texts improves the state of the art in SugarCrepe and in BiVLC for both retrieval directions. The gap to human performance in BiVLC confirms that Vision-Language Compositionality is still a challenging problem. BiVLC and code are available at https://imirandam.github.io/BiVLC_project_page.

- **Summary**: We introduce a new benchmark, ChartMimic, aimed at assessing the visually-grounded code generation capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). ChartMimic utilizes information-intensive visual charts and textual instructions as inputs, requiring LMMs to generate the corresponding code for chart rendering. ChartMimic includes 1,000 human-curated (figure, instruction, code) triplets, which represent the authentic chart use cases found in scientific papers across various domains(e.g., Physics, Computer Science, Economics, etc). These charts span 18 regular types and 4 advanced types, diversifying into 191 subcategories. Furthermore, we propose multi-level evaluation metrics to provide an automatic and thorough assessment of the output code and the rendered charts. Unlike existing code generation benchmarks, ChartMimic places emphasis on evaluating LMMs' capacity to harmonize a blend of cognitive capabilities, encompassing visual understanding, code generation, and cross-modal reasoning. The evaluation of 3 proprietary models and 11 open-weight models highlights the substantial challenges posed by ChartMimic. Even the advanced GPT-4V, Claude-3-opus only achieve an average score of 73.2 and 53.7, respectively, indicating significant room for improvement. We anticipate that ChartMimic will inspire the development of LMMs, advancing the pursuit of artificial general intelligence.

- **Summary**: Instruction-based image editing has made a great process in using natural human language to manipulate the visual content of images. However, existing models are limited by the quality of the dataset and cannot accurately localize editing regions in images with complex object relationships. In this paper, we propose Reinforcement Learning Guided Image Editing Method(InstructRL4Pix) to train a diffusion model to generate images that are guided by the attention maps of the target object. Our method maximizes the output of the reward model by calculating the distance between attention maps as a reward function and fine-tuning the diffusion model using proximal policy optimization (PPO). We evaluate our model in object insertion, removal, replacement, and transformation. Experimental results show that InstructRL4Pix breaks through the limitations of traditional datasets and uses unsupervised learning to optimize editing goals and achieve accurate image editing based on natural human commands.



### Deep Learning Models to Automate the Scoring of Hand Radiographs for Rheumatoid Arthritis

- **Summary**: The van der Heijde modification of the Sharp (SvdH) score is a widely used radiographic scoring method to quantify damage in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in clinical trials. However, its complexity with a necessity to score each individual joint, and the expertise required limit its application in clinical practice, especially in disease progression measurement. In this work, we addressed this limitation by developing a bespoke, automated pipeline that is capable of predicting the SvdH score and RA severity from hand radiographs without the need to localise the joints first. Using hand radiographs from RA and suspected RA patients, we first investigated the performance of the state-of-the-art architectures in predicting the total SvdH score for hands and wrists and its corresponding severity class. Secondly, we leveraged publicly available data sets to perform transfer learning with different finetuning schemes and ensemble learning, which resulted in substantial improvement in model performance being on par with an experienced human reader. The best model for RA scoring achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.925 and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 18.02, while the best model for RA severity classification achieved an accuracy of 0.358 and PCC of 0.859. Our score prediction model attained almost comparable accuracy with experienced radiologists (PCC = 0.97, RMSE = 18.75). Finally, using Grad-CAM, we showed that our models could focus on the anatomical structures in hands and wrists which clinicians deemed as relevant to RA progression in the majority of cases.

- **Summary**: Much machine learning research progress is based on developing models and evaluating them on a benchmark dataset (e.g., ImageNet for images). However, applying such benchmark-successful methods to real-world data often does not work as expected. This is particularly the case for biological data where we expect variability at multiple time and spatial scales. In this work, we are using grain data and the goal is to detect diseases and damages. Pink fusarium, skinned grains, and other diseases and damages are key factors in setting the price of grains or excluding dangerous grains from food production. Apart from challenges stemming from differences of the data from the standard toy datasets, we also present challenges that need to be overcome when explaining deep learning models. For example, explainability methods have many hyperparameters that can give different results, and the ones published in the papers do not work on dissimilar images. Other challenges are more general: problems with visualization of the explanations and their comparison since the magnitudes of their values differ from method to method. An open fundamental question also is: How to evaluate explanations? It is a non-trivial task because the "ground truth" is usually missing or ill-defined. Also, human annotators may create what they think is an explanation of the task at hand, yet the machine learning model might solve it in a different and perhaps counter-intuitive way. We discuss several of these challenges and evaluate various post-hoc explainability methods on grain data. We focus on robustness, quality of explanations, and similarity to particular "ground truth" annotations made by experts. The goal is to find the methods that overall perform well and could be used in this challenging task. We hope the proposed pipeline will be used as a framework for evaluating explainability methods in specific use cases.

- **Summary**: In the evolving landscape of text-to-3D technology, Dreamfusion has showcased its proficiency by utilizing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to optimize implicit representations such as NeRF. This process is achieved through the distillation of pretrained large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. However, Dreamfusion encounters fidelity and efficiency constraints: it faces the multi-head Janus issue and exhibits a relatively slow optimization process. To circumvent these challenges, we introduce OrientDream, a camera orientation conditioned framework designed for efficient and multi-view consistent 3D generation from textual prompts. Our strategy emphasizes the implementation of an explicit camera orientation conditioned feature in the pre-training of a 2D text-to-image diffusion module. This feature effectively utilizes data from MVImgNet, an extensive external multi-view dataset, to refine and bolster its functionality. Subsequently, we utilize the pre-conditioned 2D images as a basis for optimizing a randomly initialized implicit representation (NeRF). This process is significantly expedited by a decoupled back-propagation technique, allowing for multiple updates of implicit parameters per optimization cycle. Our experiments reveal that our method not only produces high-quality NeRF models with consistent multi-view properties but also achieves an optimization speed significantly greater than existing methods, as quantified by comparative metrics.

- **Summary**: Biomechanical biofeedback may enhance rehabilitation and provide clinicians with more objective task evaluation. These feedbacks often rely on expensive motion capture systems, which restricts their widespread use, leading to the development of computer vision-based methods. These methods are subject to large joint angle errors, considering the upper limb, and exclude the scapula and clavicle motion in the analysis. Our open-source approach offers a user-friendly solution for high-fidelity upper-limb kinematics using a single low-cost RGBD camera and includes semi-automatic skin marker labeling. Real-time biomechanical analysis, ranging from kinematics to muscle force estimation, was conducted on eight participants performing a hand-cycling motion to demonstrate the applicability of our approach on the upper limb. Markers were recorded by the RGBD camera and an optoelectronic camera system, considered as a reference. Muscle activity and external load were recorded using eight EMG and instrumented hand pedals, respectively. Bland-Altman analysis revealed significant agreements in the 3D markers' positions between the two motion capture methods, with errors averaging 3.3$\pm$3.9 mm. For the biomechanical analysis, the level of agreement was sensitive to whether the same marker set was used. For example, joint angle differences averaging 2.3$\pm$2.8{\deg} when using the same marker set, compared to 4.5$\pm$2.9{\deg} otherwise. Biofeedback from the RGBD camera was provided at 63 Hz. Our study introduces a novel method for using an RGBD camera as a low-cost motion capture solution, emphasizing its potential for accurate kinematic reconstruction and comprehensive upper-limb biomechanical studies.

- **Summary**: After the revelation that neural networks tend to produce overconfident predictions, the problem of calibration, which aims to align confidence with accuracy to enhance the reliability of predictions, has gained significant importance. Several solutions based on calibration maps have been proposed to address the problem of recalibrating a trained classifier using additional datasets. In this paper, we offer an algorithm that transforms the weights of the last layer of the classifier, distinct from the calibration-map-based approach. We concentrate on the geometry of the final linear layer, specifically its angular aspect, and adjust the weights of the corresponding layer. We name the method Tilt and Average(\textsc{Tna}), and validate the calibration effect empirically and theoretically. Through this, we demonstrate that our approach, in addition to the existing calibration-map-based techniques, can yield improved calibration performance.

- **Summary**: The increasing size of neural networks has led to a growing demand for methods of efficient fine-tuning. Recently, an orthogonal fine-tuning paradigm was introduced that uses orthogonal matrices for adapting the weights of a pretrained model. In this paper, we introduce a new class of structured matrices, which unifies and generalizes structured classes from previous works. We examine properties of this class and build a structured orthogonal parametrization upon it. We then use this parametrization to modify the orthogonal fine-tuning framework, improving parameter and computational efficiency. We empirically validate our method on different domains, including adapting of text-to-image diffusion models and downstream task fine-tuning in language modeling. Additionally, we adapt our construction for orthogonal convolutions and conduct experiments with 1-Lipschitz neural networks.

- **Summary**: Prototypical networks aim to build intrinsically explainable models based on the linear summation of concepts. However, important challenges remain in the transparency, compactness, and meaningfulness of the explanations provided by these models. This work demonstrates how frozen pre-trained ViT backbones can be effectively turned into prototypical models for both general and domain-specific tasks, in our case biomedical image classifiers. By leveraging strong spatial features combined with a novel prototypical head, ProtoS-ViT surpasses existing prototypical models showing strong performance in terms of accuracy, compactness, and explainability. Model explainability is evaluated through an extensive set of quantitative and qualitative metrics which serve as a general benchmark for the development of prototypical models.

- **Summary**: Aging and chronic conditions affect older adults' daily lives, making early detection of developing health issues crucial. Weakness, common in many conditions, alters physical movements and daily activities subtly. However, detecting such changes can be challenging due to their subtle and gradual nature. To address this, we employ a non-intrusive camera sensor to monitor individuals' daily sitting and relaxing activities for signs of weakness. We simulate weakness in healthy subjects by having them perform physical exercise and observing the behavioral changes in their daily activities before and after workouts. The proposed system captures fine-grained features related to body motion, inactivity, and environmental context in real-time while prioritizing privacy. A Bayesian Network is used to model the relationships between features, activities, and health conditions. We aim to identify specific features and activities that indicate such changes and determine the most suitable time scale for observing the change. Results show 0.97 accuracy in distinguishing simulated weakness at the daily level. Fine-grained behavioral features, including non-dominant upper body motion speed and scale, and inactivity distribution, along with a 300-second window, are found most effective. However, individual-specific models are recommended as no universal set of optimal features and activities was identified across all participants.

- **Summary**: In the context of medical imaging and machine learning, one of the most pressing challenges is the effective adaptation of pre-trained models to specialized medical contexts. Despite the availability of advanced pre-trained models, their direct application to the highly specialized and diverse field of medical imaging often falls short due to the unique characteristics of medical data. This study provides a comprehensive analysis on the performance of various fine-tuning methods applied to pre-trained models across a spectrum of medical imaging domains, including X-ray, MRI, Histology, Dermoscopy, and Endoscopic surgery. We evaluated eight fine-tuning strategies, including standard techniques such as fine-tuning all layers or fine-tuning only the classifier layers, alongside methods such as gradually unfreezing layers, regularization based fine-tuning and adaptive learning rates. We selected three well-established CNN architectures (ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, and VGG-19) to cover a range of learning and feature extraction scenarios. Although our results indicate that the efficacy of these fine-tuning methods significantly varies depending on both the architecture and the medical imaging type, strategies such as combining Linear Probing with Full Fine-tuning resulted in notable improvements in over 50% of the evaluated cases, demonstrating general effectiveness across medical domains. Moreover, Auto-RGN, which dynamically adjusts learning rates, led to performance enhancements of up to 11% for specific modalities. Additionally, the DenseNet architecture showed more pronounced benefits from alternative fine-tuning approaches compared to traditional full fine-tuning. This work not only provides valuable insights for optimizing pre-trained models in medical image analysis but also suggests the potential for future research into more advanced architectures and fine-tuning methods.

- **Summary**: With the development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) technology, its general capabilities are increasingly powerful. To evaluate the various abilities of MLLMs, numerous evaluation systems have emerged. But now there is still a lack of a comprehensive method to evaluate MLLMs in the tasks related to flowcharts, which are very important in daily life and work. We propose the first comprehensive method, FlowCE, to assess MLLMs across various dimensions for tasks related to flowcharts. It encompasses evaluating MLLMs' abilities in Reasoning, Localization Recognition, Information Extraction, Logical Verification, and Summarization on flowcharts. However, we find that even the GPT4o model achieves only a score of 56.63. Among open-source models, Phi-3-Vision obtained the highest score of 49.97. We hope that FlowCE can contribute to future research on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for tasks based on flowcharts. We are open-sourcing this project: \url{https://github.com/360AILAB-NLP/FlowCE}

- **Summary**: We present DurLAR, a high-fidelity 128-channel 3D LiDAR dataset with panoramic ambient (near infrared) and reflectivity imagery, as well as a sample benchmark task using depth estimation for autonomous driving applications. Our driving platform is equipped with a high resolution 128 channel LiDAR, a 2MPix stereo camera, a lux meter and a GNSS/INS system. Ambient and reflectivity images are made available along with the LiDAR point clouds to facilitate multi-modal use of concurrent ambient and reflectivity scene information. Leveraging DurLAR, with a resolution exceeding that of prior benchmarks, we consider the task of monocular depth estimation and use this increased availability of higher resolution, yet sparse ground truth scene depth information to propose a novel joint supervised/self-supervised loss formulation. We compare performance over both our new DurLAR dataset, the established KITTI benchmark and the Cityscapes dataset. Our evaluation shows our joint use supervised and self-supervised loss terms, enabled via the superior ground truth resolution and availability within DurLAR improves the quantitative and qualitative performance of leading contemporary monocular depth estimation approaches (RMSE=3.639, Sq Rel=0.936).

- **Summary**: Dynamic reconstruction and spatiotemporal novel-view synthesis of non-rigidly deforming scenes recently gained increased attention. While existing work achieves impressive quality and performance on multi-view or teleporting camera setups, most methods fail to efficiently and faithfully recover motion and appearance from casual monocular captures. This paper contributes to the field by introducing a new method for dynamic novel view synthesis from monocular video, such as casual smartphone captures.   Our approach represents the scene as a $\textit{dynamic neural point cloud}$, an implicit time-conditioned point distribution that encodes local geometry and appearance in separate hash-encoded neural feature grids for static and dynamic regions. By sampling a discrete point cloud from our model, we can efficiently render high-quality novel views using a fast differentiable rasterizer and neural rendering network. Similar to recent work, we leverage advances in neural scene analysis by incorporating data-driven priors like monocular depth estimation and object segmentation to resolve motion and depth ambiguities originating from the monocular captures. In addition to guiding the optimization process, we show that these priors can be exploited to explicitly initialize our scene representation to drastically improve optimization speed and final image quality. As evidenced by our experimental evaluation, our dynamic point cloud model not only enables fast optimization and real-time frame rates for interactive applications, but also achieves competitive image quality on monocular benchmark sequences.

- **Summary**: Video understanding is a pivotal task in the digital era, yet the dynamic and multievent nature of videos makes them labor-intensive and computationally demanding to process. Thus, localizing a specific event given a semantic query has gained importance in both user-oriented applications like video search and academic research into video foundation models. A significant limitation in current research is that semantic queries are typically in natural language that depicts the semantics of the target event. This setting overlooks the potential for multimodal semantic queries composed of images and texts. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, ICQ, for localizing events in videos with multimodal queries, along with a new evaluation dataset ICQ-Highlight. Our new benchmark aims to evaluate how well models can localize an event given a multimodal semantic query that consists of a reference image, which depicts the event, and a refinement text to adjust the images' semantics. To systematically benchmark model performance, we include 4 styles of reference images and 5 types of refinement texts, allowing us to explore model performance across different domains. We propose 3 adaptation methods that tailor existing models to our new setting and evaluate 10 SOTA models, ranging from specialized to large-scale foundation models. We believe this benchmark is an initial step toward investigating multimodal queries in video event localization.

- **Summary**: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) uses lip-based video to improve performance in noise. Since videos are harder to obtain than audio, the video training data of AVSR models is usually limited to a few thousand hours. In contrast, speech models such as Whisper are trained with hundreds of thousands of hours of data, and thus learn a better speech-to-text decoder. The huge training data difference motivates us to adapt Whisper to handle video inputs. Inspired by Flamingo which injects visual features into language models, we propose Whisper-Flamingo which integrates visual features into the Whisper speech recognition and translation model with gated cross attention. Our audio-visual Whisper-Flamingo outperforms audio-only Whisper on English speech recognition and En-X translation for 6 languages in noisy conditions. Moreover, Whisper-Flamingo is a versatile model and conducts all of these tasks using one set of parameters, while prior methods are trained separately on each language.

- **Summary**: Remote Sensing Large Multi-Modal Models (RSLMMs) are developing rapidly and showcase significant capabilities in remote sensing imagery (RSI) comprehension. However, due to the limitations of existing datasets, RSLMMs have shortcomings in understanding the rich semantic relations among objects in complex remote sensing scenes. To unlock RSLMMs' complex comprehension ability, we propose a large-scale instruction tuning dataset FIT-RS, containing 1,800,851 instruction samples. FIT-RS covers common interpretation tasks and innovatively introduces several complex comprehension tasks of escalating difficulty, ranging from relation reasoning to image-level scene graph generation. Based on FIT-RS, we build the FIT-RSFG benchmark. Furthermore, we establish a new benchmark to evaluate the fine-grained relation comprehension capabilities of LMMs, named FIT-RSRC. Based on combined instruction data, we propose SkySenseGPT, which achieves outstanding performance on both public datasets and FIT-RSFG, surpassing existing RSLMMs. We hope the FIT-RS dataset can enhance the relation comprehension capability of RSLMMs and provide a large-scale fine-grained data source for the remote sensing community. The dataset will be available at https://github.com/Luo-Z13/SkySenseGPT



### Annotation Cost-Efficient Active Learning for Deep Metric Learning Driven Remote Sensing Image Retrieval

- **Summary**: Deep metric learning (DML) has shown to be very effective for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) in remote sensing (RS). Most of DML methods for CBIR rely on many annotated images to accurately learn model parameters of deep neural networks. However, gathering many image annotations is time consuming and costly. To address this, we propose an annotation cost-efficient active learning (ANNEAL) method specifically designed for DML driven CBIR in RS. ANNEAL aims to create a small but informative training set made up of similar and dissimilar image pairs to be utilized for learning a deep metric space. The informativeness of the image pairs is assessed combining uncertainty and diversity criteria. To assess the uncertainty of image pairs, we introduce two algorithms: 1) metric-guided uncertainty estimation (MGUE); and 2) binary classifier guided uncertainty estimation (BCGUE). MGUE automatically estimates a threshold value that acts as a "boundary" between similar and dissimilar image pairs based on the distances in the metric space. The closer the similarity between image pairs to the estimated threshold value the higher their uncertainty. BCGUE estimates the uncertainty of the image pairs based on the confidence of the classifier in assigning the correct similarity label. The diversity criterion is assessed through a clustering-based strategy. ANNEAL selects the most informative image pairs by combining either MGUE or BCGUE with clustering-based strategy. The selected image pairs are sent to expert annotators to be labeled as similar or dissimilar. This way of annotating images significantly reduces the annotation cost compared to the cost of annotating images with LULC labels. Experimental results carried out on two RS benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code of the proposed method will be publicly available upon the acceptance of the paper.

- **Summary**: Achieving high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS) from low-resolution input views is a challenging task due to the lack of high-resolution data. Previous methods optimize high-resolution Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) from low-resolution input views but suffer from slow rendering speed. In this work, we base our method on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) due to its capability of producing high-quality images at a faster rendering speed. To alleviate the shortage of data for higher-resolution synthesis, we propose to leverage off-the-shelf 2D diffusion priors by distilling the 2D knowledge into 3D with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). Nevertheless, applying SDS directly to Gaussian-based 3D super-resolution leads to undesirable and redundant 3D Gaussian primitives, due to the randomness brought by generative priors. To mitigate this issue, we introduce two simple yet effective techniques to reduce stochastic disturbances introduced by SDS. Specifically, we 1) shrink the range of diffusion timestep in SDS with an annealing strategy; 2) randomly discard redundant Gaussian primitives during densification. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed GaussainSR can attain high-quality results for HRNVS with only low-resolution inputs on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Part-aware panoptic segmentation (PPS) requires (a) that each foreground object and background region in an image is segmented and classified, and (b) that all parts within foreground objects are segmented, classified and linked to their parent object. Existing methods approach PPS by separately conducting object-level and part-level segmentation. However, their part-level predictions are not linked to individual parent objects. Therefore, their learning objective is not aligned with the PPS task objective, which harms the PPS performance. To solve this, and make more accurate PPS predictions, we propose Task-Aligned Part-aware Panoptic Segmentation (TAPPS). This method uses a set of shared queries to jointly predict (a) object-level segments, and (b) the part-level segments within those same objects. As a result, TAPPS learns to predict part-level segments that are linked to individual parent objects, aligning the learning objective with the task objective, and allowing TAPPS to leverage joint object-part representations. With experiments, we show that TAPPS considerably outperforms methods that predict objects and parts separately, and achieves new state-of-the-art PPS results.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art 3D object detectors are often trained on massive labeled datasets. However, annotating 3D bounding boxes remains prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, particularly for LiDAR. Instead, recent works demonstrate that self-supervised pre-training with unlabeled data can improve detection accuracy with limited labels. Contemporary methods adapt best-practices for self-supervised learning from the image domain to point clouds (such as contrastive learning). However, publicly available 3D datasets are considerably smaller and less diverse than those used for image-based self-supervised learning, limiting their effectiveness. We do note, however, that such data is naturally collected in a multimodal fashion, often paired with images. Rather than pre-training with only self-supervised objectives, we argue that it is better to bootstrap point cloud representations using image-based foundation models trained on internet-scale image data. Specifically, we propose a shelf-supervised approach (e.g. supervised with off-the-shelf image foundation models) for generating zero-shot 3D bounding boxes from paired RGB and LiDAR data. Pre-training 3D detectors with such pseudo-labels yields significantly better semi-supervised detection accuracy than prior self-supervised pretext tasks. Importantly, we show that image-based shelf-supervision is helpful for training LiDAR-only and multi-modal (RGB + LiDAR) detectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on nuScenes and WOD, significantly improving over prior work in limited data settings.

- **Summary**: Current methods for predicting osteoarthritis (OA) outcomes do not incorporate disease specific prior knowledge to improve the outcome prediction models. We developed a novel approach that effectively uses consecutive imaging studies to improve OA outcome predictions by incorporating an OA severity constraint. This constraint ensures that the risk of OA for a knee should either increase or remain the same over time. DL models were trained to predict TKR within multiple time periods (1 year, 2 years, and 4 years) using knee radiographs and MRI scans. Models with and without the risk constraint were evaluated using the area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) analysis. The novel RiskFORM2 method, leveraging a dual model risk constraint architecture, demonstrated superior performance, yielding an AUROC of 0.87 and AUPRC of 0.47 for 1 year TKR prediction on the OAI radiograph test set, a marked improvement over the 0.79 AUROC and 0.34 AUPRC of the baseline approach. The performance advantage extended to longer followup periods, with RiskFORM2 maintaining a high AUROC of 0.86 and AUPRC of 0.75 in predicting TKR within 4 years. Additionally, when generalizing to the external MOST radiograph test set, RiskFORM2 generalized better with an AUROC of 0.77 and AUPRC of 0.25 for 1 year predictions, which was higher than the 0.71 AUROC and 0.19 AUPRC of the baseline approach. In the MRI test sets, similar patterns emerged, with RiskFORM2 outperforming the baseline approach consistently. However, RiskFORM1 exhibited the highest AUROC of 0.86 and AUPRC of 0.72 for 4 year predictions on the OAI set.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving without high-definition (HD) maps demands a higher level of active scene understanding. In this competition, the organizers provided the multi-perspective camera images and standard-definition (SD) maps to explore the boundaries of scene reasoning capabilities. We found that most existing algorithms construct Bird's Eye View (BEV) features from these multi-perspective images and use multi-task heads to delineate road centerlines, boundary lines, pedestrian crossings, and other areas. However, these algorithms perform poorly at the far end of roads and struggle when the primary subject in the image is occluded. Therefore, in this competition, we not only used multi-perspective images as input but also incorporated SD maps to address this issue. We employed map encoder pre-training to enhance the network's geometric encoding capabilities and utilized YOLOX to improve traffic element detection precision. Additionally, for area detection, we innovatively introduced LDTR and auxiliary tasks to achieve higher precision. As a result, our final OLUS score is 0.58.

- **Summary**: We propose a training-free and robust solution to offer camera movement control for off-the-shelf video diffusion models. Unlike previous work, our method does not require any supervised finetuning on camera-annotated datasets or self-supervised training via data augmentation. Instead, it can be plugged and played with most pretrained video diffusion models and generate camera controllable videos with a single image or text prompt as input. The inspiration of our work comes from the layout prior that intermediate latents hold towards generated results, thus rearranging noisy pixels in them will make output content reallocated as well. As camera move could also be seen as a kind of pixel rearrangement caused by perspective change, videos could be reorganized following specific camera motion if their noisy latents change accordingly. Established on this, we propose our method CamTrol, which enables robust camera control for video diffusion models. It is achieved by a two-stage process. First, we model image layout rearrangement through explicit camera movement in 3D point cloud space. Second, we generate videos with camera motion using layout prior of noisy latents formed by a series of rearranged images. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the robustness our method holds in controlling camera motion of generated videos. Furthermore, we show that our method can produce impressive results in generating 3D rotation videos with dynamic content. Project page at https://lifedecoder.github.io/CamTrol/.

- **Summary**: Precise and prompt identification of road surface conditions enables vehicles to adjust their actions, like changing speed or using specific traction control techniques, to lower the chance of accidents and potential danger to drivers and pedestrians. However, most of the existing methods for detecting road surfaces solely rely on visual data, which may be insufficient in certain situations, such as when the roads are covered by debris, in low light conditions, or in the presence of fog. Therefore, we introduce a multimodal approach for the automated detection of road surface conditions by integrating audio and images. The robustness of the proposed method is tested on a diverse dataset collected under various environmental conditions and road surface types. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of our multimodal approach in accurately identifying road surface conditions in real-time scenarios. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating auditory and visual cues for enhancing road safety and minimizing accident risks

- **Summary**: Recently, 3D assets created via reconstruction and generation have matched the quality of manually crafted assets, highlighting their potential for replacement. However, this potential is largely unrealized because these assets always need to be converted to meshes for 3D industry applications, and the meshes produced by current mesh extraction methods are significantly inferior to Artist-Created Meshes (AMs), i.e., meshes created by human artists. Specifically, current mesh extraction methods rely on dense faces and ignore geometric features, leading to inefficiencies, complicated post-processing, and lower representation quality. To address these issues, we introduce MeshAnything, a model that treats mesh extraction as a generation problem, producing AMs aligned with specified shapes. By converting 3D assets in any 3D representation into AMs, MeshAnything can be integrated with various 3D asset production methods, thereby enhancing their application across the 3D industry. The architecture of MeshAnything comprises a VQ-VAE and a shape-conditioned decoder-only transformer. We first learn a mesh vocabulary using the VQ-VAE, then train the shape-conditioned decoder-only transformer on this vocabulary for shape-conditioned autoregressive mesh generation. Our extensive experiments show that our method generates AMs with hundreds of times fewer faces, significantly improving storage, rendering, and simulation efficiencies, while achieving precision comparable to previous methods.

- **Summary**: In this technical report, we present CarLLaVA, a Vision Language Model (VLM) for autonomous driving, developed for the CARLA Autonomous Driving Challenge 2.0. CarLLaVA uses the vision encoder of the LLaVA VLM and the LLaMA architecture as backbone, achieving state-of-the-art closed-loop driving performance with only camera input and without the need for complex or expensive labels. Additionally, we show preliminary results on predicting language commentary alongside the driving output. CarLLaVA uses a semi-disentangled output representation of both path predictions and waypoints, getting the advantages of the path for better lateral control and the waypoints for better longitudinal control. We propose an efficient training recipe to train on large driving datasets without wasting compute on easy, trivial data. CarLLaVA ranks 1st place in the sensor track of the CARLA Autonomous Driving Challenge 2.0 outperforming the previous state of the art by 458% and the best concurrent submission by 32.6%.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel approach 4DRecons that takes a single camera RGB-D sequence of a dynamic subject as input and outputs a complete textured deforming 3D model over time. 4DRecons encodes the output as a 4D neural implicit surface and presents an optimization procedure that combines a data term and two regularization terms. The data term fits the 4D implicit surface to the input partial observations. We address fundamental challenges in fitting a complete implicit surface to partial observations. The first regularization term enforces that the deformation among adjacent frames is as rigid as possible (ARAP). To this end, we introduce a novel approach to compute correspondences between adjacent textured implicit surfaces, which are used to define the ARAP regularization term. The second regularization term enforces that the topology of the underlying object remains fixed over time. This regularization is critical for avoiding self-intersections that are typical in implicit-based reconstructions. We have evaluated the performance of 4DRecons on a variety of datasets. Experimental results show that 4DRecons can handle large deformations and complex inter-part interactions and outperform state-of-the-art approaches considerably.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based brain tumor segmentation (BTS) models for multi-modal MRI images have seen significant advancements in recent years. However, a common problem in practice is the unavailability of some modalities due to varying scanning protocols and patient conditions, making segmentation from incomplete MRI modalities a challenging issue. Previous methods have attempted to address this by fusing accessible multi-modal features, leveraging attention mechanisms, and synthesizing missing modalities using generative models. However, these methods ignore the intrinsic problems of medical image segmentation, such as the limited availability of training samples, particularly for cases with tumors. Furthermore, these methods require training and deploying a specific model for each subset of missing modalities. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that enhances the BTS model from two perspectives. Firstly, we introduce a pre-training stage that generates a diverse pre-training dataset covering a wide range of different combinations of tumor shapes and brain anatomy. Secondly, we propose a post-training stage that enables the model to reconstruct missing modalities in the prediction results when only partial modalities are available. To achieve the pre-training stage, we conceptually decouple the MRI image into two parts: `anatomy' and `tumor'. We pre-train the BTS model using synthesized data generated from the anatomy and tumor parts across different training samples. ... Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the performance over the baseline and achieves new state-of-the-art results on three brain tumor segmentation datasets: BRATS2020, BRATS2018, and BRATS2015.

- **Summary**: DensePose provides a pixel-accurate association of images with 3D mesh coordinates, but does not provide a 3D mesh, while Human Mesh Reconstruction (HMR) systems have high 2D reprojection error, as measured by DensePose localization metrics. In this work we introduce MeshPose to jointly tackle DensePose and HMR. For this we first introduce new losses that allow us to use weak DensePose supervision to accurately localize in 2D a subset of the mesh vertices ('VertexPose'). We then lift these vertices to 3D, yielding a low-poly body mesh ('MeshPose'). Our system is trained in an end-to-end manner and is the first HMR method to attain competitive DensePose accuracy, while also being lightweight and amenable to efficient inference, making it suitable for real-time AR applications.

- **Summary**: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly integral to healthcare applications, including medical visual question answering and imaging report generation. While these models inherit the robust capabilities of foundational Large Language Models (LLMs), they also inherit susceptibility to hallucinations-a significant concern in high-stakes medical contexts where the margin for error is minimal. However, currently, there are no dedicated methods or benchmarks for hallucination detection and evaluation in the medical field. To bridge this gap, we introduce Med-HallMark, the first benchmark specifically designed for hallucination detection and evaluation within the medical multimodal domain. This benchmark provides multi-tasking hallucination support, multifaceted hallucination data, and hierarchical hallucination categorization. Furthermore, we propose the MediHall Score, a new medical evaluative metric designed to assess LVLMs' hallucinations through a hierarchical scoring system that considers the severity and type of hallucination, thereby enabling a granular assessment of potential clinical impacts. We also present MediHallDetector, a novel Medical LVLM engineered for precise hallucination detection, which employs multitask training for hallucination detection. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we establish baselines for popular LVLMs using our benchmark. The findings indicate that MediHall Score provides a more nuanced understanding of hallucination impacts compared to traditional metrics and demonstrate the enhanced performance of MediHallDetector. We hope this work can significantly improve the reliability of LVLMs in medical applications. All resources of this work will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image generation from large generative models like Stable Diffusion, DALLE-2, etc., have become a common base for various tasks due to their superior quality and extensive knowledge bases. As image composition and generation are creative processes the artists need control over various parts of the images being generated. We find that just adding details about parts in the base text prompt either leads to an entirely different image (e.g., missing/incorrect identity) or the extra part details simply being ignored. To mitigate these issues, we introduce PartCraft, which enables image generation based on fine-grained part-level details specified for objects in the base text prompt. This allows more control for artists and enables novel object compositions by combining distinctive object parts. PartCraft first localizes object parts by denoising the object region from a specific diffusion process. This enables each part token to be localized to the right object region. After obtaining part masks, we run a localized diffusion process in each of the part regions based on fine-grained part descriptions and combine them to produce the final image. All the stages of PartCraft are based on repurposing a pre-trained diffusion model, which enables it to generalize across various domains without training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of part-level control provided by PartCraft qualitatively through visual examples and quantitatively in comparison to the contemporary baselines.

- **Summary**: Polyps are early cancer indicators, so assessing occurrences of polyps and their removal is critical. They are observed through a colonoscopy screening procedure that generates a stream of video frames. Segmenting polyps in their natural video screening procedure has several challenges, such as the co-existence of imaging artefacts, motion blur, and floating debris. Most existing polyp segmentation algorithms are developed on curated still image datasets that do not represent real-world colonoscopy. Their performance often degrades on video data. We propose a video polyp segmentation method that performs self-supervised learning as an auxiliary task and a spatial-temporal self-attention mechanism for improved representation learning. Our end-to-end configuration and joint optimisation of losses enable the network to learn more discriminative contextual features in videos. Our experimental results demonstrate an improvement with respect to several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our ablation study also confirms that the choice of the proposed joint end-to-end training improves network accuracy by over 3% and nearly 10% on both the Dice similarity coefficient and intersection-over-union compared to the recently proposed method PNS+ and Polyp-PVT, respectively. Results on previously unseen video data indicate that the proposed method generalises.

- **Summary**: Recently, Glyph-ByT5 has achieved highly accurate visual text rendering performance in graphic design images. However, it still focuses solely on English and performs relatively poorly in terms of visual appeal. In this work, we address these two fundamental limitations by presenting Glyph-ByT5-v2 and Glyph-SDXL-v2, which not only support accurate visual text rendering for 10 different languages but also achieve much better aesthetic quality. To achieve this, we make the following contributions: (i) creating a high-quality multilingual glyph-text and graphic design dataset consisting of more than 1 million glyph-text pairs and 10 million graphic design image-text pairs covering nine other languages, (ii) building a multilingual visual paragraph benchmark consisting of 1,000 prompts, with 100 for each language, to assess multilingual visual spelling accuracy, and (iii) leveraging the latest step-aware preference learning approach to enhance the visual aesthetic quality. With the combination of these techniques, we deliver a powerful customized multilingual text encoder, Glyph-ByT5-v2, and a strong aesthetic graphic generation model, Glyph-SDXL-v2, that can support accurate spelling in 10 different languages. We perceive our work as a significant advancement, considering that the latest DALL-E3 and Ideogram 1.0 still struggle with the multilingual visual text rendering task.

- **Summary**: Despite the unprecedented success of text-to-image diffusion models, controlling the number of depicted objects using text is surprisingly hard. This is important for various applications from technical documents, to children's books to illustrating cooking recipes. Generating object-correct counts is fundamentally challenging because the generative model needs to keep a sense of separate identity for every instance of the object, even if several objects look identical or overlap, and then carry out a global computation implicitly during generation. It is still unknown if such representations exist. To address count-correct generation, we first identify features within the diffusion model that can carry the object identity information. We then use them to separate and count instances of objects during the denoising process and detect over-generation and under-generation. We fix the latter by training a model that predicts both the shape and location of a missing object, based on the layout of existing ones, and show how it can be used to guide denoising with correct object count. Our approach, CountGen, does not depend on external source to determine object layout, but rather uses the prior from the diffusion model itself, creating prompt-dependent and seed-dependent layouts. Evaluated on two benchmark datasets, we find that CountGen strongly outperforms the count-accuracy of existing baselines.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models face significant challenges when employed for large-scale medical image reconstruction in real practice such as 3D Computed Tomography (CT). Due to the demanding memory, time, and data requirements, it is difficult to train a diffusion model directly on the entire volume of high-dimensional data to obtain an efficient 3D diffusion prior. Existing works utilizing diffusion priors on single 2D image slice with hand-crafted cross-slice regularization would sacrifice the z-axis consistency, which results in severe artifacts along the z-axis. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enables learning the 3D image prior through position-aware 3D-patch diffusion score blending for reconstructing large-scale 3D medical images. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize a 3D-patch diffusion prior for 3D medical image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on sparse view and limited angle CT reconstruction show that our DiffusionBlend method significantly outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world CT reconstruction problems with high-dimensional 3D image (i.e., $256 \times 256 \times 500$). Our algorithm also comes with better or comparable computational efficiency than previous state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Photoelasticity enables full-field stress analysis in transparent objects through stress-induced birefringence. Existing techniques are limited to 2D slices and require destructively slicing the object. Recovering the internal 3D stress distribution of the entire object is challenging as it involves solving a tensor tomography problem and handling phase wrapping ambiguities. We introduce NeST, an analysis-by-synthesis approach for reconstructing 3D stress tensor fields as neural implicit representations from polarization measurements. Our key insight is to jointly handle phase unwrapping and tensor tomography using a differentiable forward model based on Jones calculus. Our non-linear model faithfully matches real captures, unlike prior linear approximations. We develop an experimental multi-axis polariscope setup to capture 3D photoelasticity and experimentally demonstrate that NeST reconstructs the internal stress distribution for objects with varying shape and force conditions. Additionally, we showcase novel applications in stress analysis, such as visualizing photoelastic fringes by virtually slicing the object and viewing photoelastic fringes from unseen viewpoints. NeST paves the way for scalable non-destructive 3D photoelastic analysis.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in novel view synthesis have enabled real-time rendering speeds and high reconstruction accuracy. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), a foundational point-based parametric 3D scene representation, models scenes as large sets of 3D Gaussians. Complex scenes can comprise of millions of Gaussians, amounting to large storage and memory requirements that limit the viability of 3D-GS on devices with limited resources. Current techniques for compressing these pretrained models by pruning Gaussians rely on combining heuristics to determine which ones to remove. In this paper, we propose a principled spatial sensitivity pruning score that outperforms these approaches. It is computed as a second-order approximation of the reconstruction error on the training views with respect to the spatial parameters of each Gaussian. Additionally, we propose a multi-round prune-refine pipeline that can be applied to any pretrained 3D-GS model without changing the training pipeline. After pruning 88.44% of the Gaussians, we observe that our PUP 3D-GS pipeline increases the average rendering speed of 3D-GS by 2.65$\times$ while retaining more salient foreground information and achieving higher image quality metrics than previous pruning techniques on scenes from the Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks & Temples, and Deep Blending datasets.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in vision-language models have significantly propelled video understanding. Existing datasets and tasks, however, have notable limitations. Most datasets are confined to short videos with limited events and narrow narratives. For example, datasets with instructional and egocentric videos often document the activities of one person in a single scene. Although some movie datasets offer richer content, they are often limited to short-term tasks, lack publicly available videos and frequently encounter data leakage given the use of movie forums and other resources in LLM training. To address the above limitations, we propose the Short Film Dataset (SFD) with 1,078 publicly available amateur movies, a wide variety of genres and minimal data leakage issues. SFD offers long-term story-oriented video tasks in the form of multiple-choice and open-ended question answering. Our extensive experiments emphasize the need for long-term reasoning to solve SFD tasks. Notably, we find strong signals in movie transcripts leading to the on-par performance of people and LLMs. We also show significantly lower performance of current models compared to people when using vision data alone.

- **Summary**: The advent of wearable computers enables a new source of context for AI that is embedded in egocentric sensor data. This new egocentric data comes equipped with fine-grained 3D location information and thus presents the opportunity for a novel class of spatial foundation models that are rooted in 3D space. To measure progress on what we term Egocentric Foundation Models (EFMs) we establish EFM3D, a benchmark with two core 3D egocentric perception tasks. EFM3D is the first benchmark for 3D object detection and surface regression on high quality annotated egocentric data of Project Aria. We propose Egocentric Voxel Lifting (EVL), a baseline for 3D EFMs. EVL leverages all available egocentric modalities and inherits foundational capabilities from 2D foundation models. This model, trained on a large simulated dataset, outperforms existing methods on the EFM3D benchmark.

- **Summary**: During the acquisition of satellite images, there is generally a trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal resolution (acquisition frequency) due to the onboard sensors of satellite imaging systems. High-resolution satellite images are very important for land crop monitoring, urban planning, wildfire management and a variety of applications. It is a significant yet challenging task to achieve high spatial-temporal resolution in satellite imaging. With the advent of diffusion models, we can now learn strong generative priors to generate realistic satellite images with high resolution, which can be utilized to promote the super-resolution task as well. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based fusion algorithm called \textbf{SatDiffMoE} that can take an arbitrary number of sequential low-resolution satellite images at the same location as inputs, and fuse them into one high-resolution reconstructed image with more fine details, by leveraging and fusing the complementary information from different time points. Our algorithm is highly flexible and allows training and inference on arbitrary number of low-resolution images. Experimental results show that our proposed SatDiffMoE method not only achieves superior performance for the satellite image super-resolution tasks on a variety of datasets, but also gets an improved computational efficiency with reduced model parameters, compared with previous methods.

- **Summary**: Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation holds significant promise for enhancing human productivity by assisting with computer tasks. Existing task formulations primarily focus on simple tasks that can be specified by a single, language-only instruction, such as "Insert a new slide." In this work, we introduce VideoGUI, a novel multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate GUI assistants on visual-centric GUI tasks. Sourced from high-quality web instructional videos, our benchmark focuses on tasks involving professional and novel software (e.g., Adobe Photoshop or Stable Diffusion WebUI) and complex activities (e.g., video editing). VideoGUI evaluates GUI assistants through a hierarchical process, allowing for identification of the specific levels at which they may fail: (i) high-level planning: reconstruct procedural subtasks from visual conditions without language descriptions; (ii) middle-level planning: generate sequences of precise action narrations based on visual state (i.e., screenshot) and goals; (iii) atomic action execution: perform specific actions such as accurately clicking designated elements. For each level, we design evaluation metrics across individual dimensions to provide clear signals, such as individual performance in clicking, dragging, typing, and scrolling for atomic action execution. Our evaluation on VideoGUI reveals that even the SoTA large multimodal model GPT4o performs poorly on visual-centric GUI tasks, especially for high-level planning.

- **Summary**: The swift progress of Multi-modal Large Models (MLLMs) has showcased their impressive ability to tackle tasks blending vision and language. Yet, most current models and benchmarks cater to scenarios with a narrow scope of visual and textual contexts. These models often fall short when faced with complex comprehension tasks, which involve navigating through a plethora of irrelevant and potentially misleading information in both text and image forms. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new, more demanding task known as Interleaved Image-Text Comprehension (IITC). This task challenges models to discern and disregard superfluous elements in both images and text to accurately answer questions and to follow intricate instructions to pinpoint the relevant image. In support of this task, we further craft a new VEGA dataset, tailored for the IITC task on scientific content, and devised a subtask, Image-Text Association (ITA), to refine image-text correlation skills. Our evaluation of four leading closed-source models, as well as various open-source models using VEGA, underscores the rigorous nature of IITC. Even the most advanced models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT4V, only achieved modest success. By employing a multi-task, multi-scale post-training strategy, we have set a robust baseline for MLLMs on the IITC task, attaining an $85.8\%$ accuracy rate in image association and a $0.508$ Rouge score. These results validate the effectiveness of our dataset in improving MLLMs capabilities for nuanced image-text comprehension.
