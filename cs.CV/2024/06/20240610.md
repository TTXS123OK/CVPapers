- **Summary**: In this paper, the solution of HYU MLLAB KT Team to the Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning Task: SMART-101 CVPR 2024 Challenge is presented. Beyond conventional visual question-answering problems, the SMART-101 challenge aims to achieve human-level multimodal understanding by tackling complex visio-linguistic puzzles designed for children in the 6-8 age group. To solve this problem, we suggest two main ideas. First, to utilize the reasoning ability of a large-scale language model (LLM), the given visual cues (images) are grounded in the text modality. For this purpose, we generate highly detailed text captions that describe the context of the image and use these captions as input for the LLM. Second, due to the nature of puzzle images, which often contain various geometric visual patterns, we utilize an object detection algorithm to ensure these patterns are not overlooked in the captioning process. We employed the SAM algorithm, which can detect various-size objects, to capture the visual features of these geometric patterns and used this information as input for the LLM. Under the puzzle split configuration, we achieved an option selection accuracy Oacc of 29.5 on the test set and a weighted option selection accuracy (WOSA) of 27.1 on the challenge set.

- **Summary**: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is an important task in multimodal AI, and it is often used to test the ability of vision-language models to understand and reason on knowledge present in both visual and textual data. However, most of the current VQA models use datasets that are primarily focused on English and a few major world languages, with images that are typically Western-centric. While recent efforts have tried to increase the number of languages covered on VQA datasets, they still lack diversity in low-resource languages. More importantly, although these datasets often extend their linguistic range via translation or some other approaches, they usually keep images the same, resulting in narrow cultural representation. To address these limitations, we construct CVQA, a new Culturally-diverse multilingual Visual Question Answering benchmark, designed to cover a rich set of languages and cultures, where we engage native speakers and cultural experts in the data collection process. As a result, CVQA includes culturally-driven images and questions from across 28 countries on four continents, covering 26 languages with 11 scripts, providing a total of 9k questions. We then benchmark several Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on CVQA, and show that the dataset is challenging for the current state-of-the-art models. This benchmark can serve as a probing evaluation suite for assessing the cultural capability and bias of multimodal models and hopefully encourage more research efforts toward increasing cultural awareness and linguistic diversity in this field.

- **Summary**: In clinical practice, 2D magnetic resonance (MR) sequences are widely adopted. While individual 2D slices can be stacked to form a 3D volume, the relatively large slice spacing can pose challenges for both image visualization and subsequent analysis tasks, which often require isotropic voxel spacing. To reduce slice spacing, deep-learning-based super-resolution techniques are widely investigated. However, most current solutions require a substantial number of paired high-resolution and low-resolution images for supervised training, which are typically unavailable in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a self-supervised super-resolution framework for inter-slice super-resolution of MR images. Our framework is first featured by pre-training on video dataset, as temporal correlation of videos is found beneficial for modeling the spatial relation among MR slices. Then, we use public high-quality MR dataset to fine-tune our pre-trained model, for enhancing awareness of our model to medical data. Finally, given a target dataset at hand, we utilize self-supervised fine-tuning to further ensure our model works well with user-specific super-resolution tasks. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to other self-supervised methods and also holds the potential to benefit various downstream applications.

- **Summary**: Single domain generalization (Single-DG) intends to develop a generalizable model with only one single training domain to perform well on other unknown target domains. Under the domain-hungry configuration, how to expand the coverage of source domain and find intrinsic causal features across different distributions is the key to enhancing the models' generalization ability. Existing methods mainly depend on the meticulous design of finite image-level transformation techniques and learning invariant features across domains based on statistical correlation between samples and labels in source domain. This makes it difficult to capture stable semantics between source and target domains, which hinders the improvement of the model's generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a novel causality-inspired latent feature augmentation method for Single-DG by learning the meta-knowledge of feature-level transformation based on causal learning and interventions. Instead of strongly relying on the finite image-level transformation, with the learned meta-knowledge, we can generate diverse implicit feature-level transformations in latent space based on the consistency of causal features and diversity of non-causal features, which can better compensate for the domain-hungry defect and reduce the strong reliance on initial finite image-level transformations and capture more stable domain-invariant causal features for generalization. Extensive experiments on several open-access benchmarks demonstrate the outstanding performance of our model over other state-of-the-art single domain generalization and also multi-source domain generalization methods.

- **Summary**: Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), with Mamba as a prime example, have shown great promise for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity. Then, Vision Mamba and the subsequent architectures are presented successively, and they perform well on visual tasks. The crucial step of applying Mamba to visual tasks is to construct 2D visual features in sequential manners. To effectively organize and construct visual features within the 2D image space through 1D selective scan, we propose a novel Multi-Head Scan (MHS) module. The embeddings extracted from the preceding layer are projected into multiple lower-dimensional subspaces. Subsequently, within each subspace, the selective scan is performed along distinct scan routes. The resulting sub-embeddings, obtained from the multi-head scan process, are then integrated and ultimately projected back into the high-dimensional space. Moreover, we incorporate a Scan Route Attention (SRA) mechanism to enhance the module's capability to discern complex structures. To validate the efficacy of our module, we exclusively substitute the 2D-Selective-Scan (SS2D) block in VM-UNet with our proposed module, and we train our models from scratch without using any pre-trained weights. The results indicate a significant improvement in performance while reducing the parameters of the original VM-UNet. The code for this study is publicly available at https://github.com/PixDeep/MHS-VM.

- **Summary**: Most existing image captioning evaluation metrics focus on assigning a single numerical score to a caption by comparing it with reference captions. However, these methods do not provide an explanation for the assigned score. Moreover, reference captions are expensive to acquire. In this paper, we propose FLEUR, an explainable reference-free metric to introduce explainability into image captioning evaluation metrics. By leveraging a large multimodal model, FLEUR can evaluate the caption against the image without the need for reference captions, and provide the explanation for the assigned score. We introduce score smoothing to align as closely as possible with human judgment and to be robust to user-defined grading criteria. FLEUR achieves high correlations with human judgment across various image captioning evaluation benchmarks and reaches state-of-the-art results on Flickr8k-CF, COMPOSITE, and Pascal-50S within the domain of reference-free evaluation metrics. Our source code and results are publicly available at: https://github.com/Yebin46/FLEUR.

- **Summary**: Artificial intelligence has significantly impacted medical applications, particularly with the advent of Medical Large Vision Language Models (Med-LVLMs), sparking optimism for the future of automated and personalized healthcare. However, the trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs remains unverified, posing significant risks for future model deployment. In this paper, we introduce CARES and aim to comprehensively evaluate the Trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs across the medical domain. We assess the trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs across five dimensions, including trustfulness, fairness, safety, privacy, and robustness. CARES comprises about 41K question-answer pairs in both closed and open-ended formats, covering 16 medical image modalities and 27 anatomical regions. Our analysis reveals that the models consistently exhibit concerns regarding trustworthiness, often displaying factual inaccuracies and failing to maintain fairness across different demographic groups. Furthermore, they are vulnerable to attacks and demonstrate a lack of privacy awareness. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/CARES.

- **Summary**: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is a high-level visual understanding and reasoning task aimed at extracting entities (such as objects) and their interrelationships from images. Significant progress has been made in the study of SGG in natural images in recent years, but its exploration in the domain of remote sensing images remains very limited. The complex characteristics of remote sensing images necessitate higher time and manual interpretation costs for annotation compared to natural images. The lack of a large-scale public SGG benchmark is a major impediment to the advancement of SGG-related research in aerial imagery. In this paper, we introduce the first publicly available large-scale, million-level relation dataset in the field of remote sensing images which is named as ReCon1M. Specifically, our dataset is built upon Fair1M and comprises 21,392 images. It includes annotations for 859,751 object bounding boxes across 60 different categories, and 1,149,342 relation triplets across 64 categories based on these bounding boxes. We provide a detailed description of the dataset's characteristics and statistical information. We conducted two object detection tasks and three sub-tasks within SGG on this dataset, assessing the performance of mainstream methods on these tasks.

- **Summary**: Low-bit quantization has become widespread for compressing image super-resolution (SR) models for edge deployment, which allows advanced SR models to enjoy compact low-bit parameters and efficient integer/bitwise constructions for storage compression and inference acceleration, respectively. However, it is notorious that low-bit quantization degrades the accuracy of SR models compared to their full-precision (FP) counterparts. Despite several efforts to alleviate the degradation, the transformer-based SR model still suffers severe degradation due to its distinctive activation distribution. In this work, we present a dual-stage low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) method for image super-resolution, namely 2DQuant, which achieves efficient and accurate SR under low-bit quantization. The proposed method first investigates the weight and activation and finds that the distribution is characterized by coexisting symmetry and asymmetry, long tails. Specifically, we propose Distribution-Oriented Bound Initialization (DOBI), using different searching strategies to search a coarse bound for quantizers. To obtain refined quantizer parameters, we further propose Distillation Quantization Calibration (DQC), which employs a distillation approach to make the quantized model learn from its FP counterpart. Through extensive experiments on different bits and scaling factors, the performance of DOBI can reach the state-of-the-art (SOTA) while after stage two, our method surpasses existing PTQ in both metrics and visual effects. 2DQuant gains an increase in PSNR as high as 4.52dB on Set5 (x2) compared with SOTA when quantized to 2-bit and enjoys a 3.60x compression ratio and 5.08x speedup ratio. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/2DQuant.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Recently, various pre-training methods have been introduced in vision-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, their generalization ability remains unclear due to evaluations being limited to in-distribution environments and non-unified experimental setups. To address this, we introduce the Atari Pre-training Benchmark (Atari-PB), which pre-trains a ResNet-50 model on 10 million transitions from 50 Atari games and evaluates it across diverse environment distributions. Our experiments show that pre-training objectives focused on learning task-agnostic features (e.g., identifying objects and understanding temporal dynamics) enhance generalization across different environments. In contrast, objectives focused on learning task-specific knowledge (e.g., identifying agents and fitting reward functions) improve performance in environments similar to the pre-training dataset but not in varied ones. We publicize our codes, datasets, and model checkpoints at https://github.com/dojeon-ai/Atari-PB.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: With the breakthrough of large models, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its extensions have been attempted to apply in diverse tasks of computer vision. Underwater salient instance segmentation is a foundational and vital step for various underwater vision tasks, which often suffer from low segmentation accuracy due to the complex underwater circumstances and the adaptive ability of models. Moreover, the lack of large-scale datasets with pixel-level salient instance annotations has impeded the development of machine learning techniques in this field. To address these issues, we construct the first large-scale underwater salient instance segmentation dataset (USIS10K), which contains 10,632 underwater images with pixel-level annotations in 7 categories from various underwater scenes. Then, we propose an Underwater Salient Instance Segmentation architecture based on Segment Anything Model (USIS-SAM) specifically for the underwater domain. We devise an Underwater Adaptive Visual Transformer (UA-ViT) encoder to incorporate underwater domain visual prompts into the segmentation network. We further design an out-of-the-box underwater Salient Feature Prompter Generator (SFPG) to automatically generate salient prompters instead of explicitly providing foreground points or boxes as prompts in SAM. Comprehensive experimental results show that our USIS-SAM method can achieve superior performance on USIS10K datasets compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Datasets and codes are released on https://github.com/LiamLian0727/USIS10K.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Advancements in multimodal learning, particularly in video understanding and generation, require high-quality video-text datasets for improved model performance. Vript addresses this issue with a meticulously annotated corpus of 12K high-resolution videos, offering detailed, dense, and script-like captions for over 420K clips. Each clip has a caption of ~145 words, which is over 10x longer than most video-text datasets. Unlike captions only documenting static content in previous datasets, we enhance video captioning to video scripting by documenting not just the content, but also the camera operations, which include the shot types (medium shot, close-up, etc) and camera movements (panning, tilting, etc). By utilizing the Vript, we explore three training paradigms of aligning more text with the video modality rather than clip-caption pairs. This results in Vriptor, a top-performing video captioning model among open-source models, comparable to GPT-4V in performance. Vriptor is also a powerful model capable of end-to-end generation of dense and detailed captions for long videos. Moreover, we introduce Vript-Hard, a benchmark consisting of three video understanding tasks that are more challenging than existing benchmarks: Vript-HAL is the first benchmark evaluating action and object hallucinations in video LLMs, Vript-RR combines reasoning with retrieval resolving question ambiguity in long-video QAs, and Vript-ERO is a new task to evaluate the temporal understanding of events in long videos rather than actions in short videos in previous works. All code, models, and datasets are available in https://github.com/mutonix/Vript.

- **Summary**: In video editing, the hallmark of a quality edit lies in its consistent and unobtrusive adjustment. Modification, when integrated, must be smooth and subtle, preserving the natural flow and aligning seamlessly with the original vision. Therefore, our primary focus is on overcoming the current challenges in high quality edit to ensure that each edit enhances the final product without disrupting its intended essence. However, quality deterioration such as blurring and flickering is routinely observed in recent diffusion video editing systems. We confirm that this deterioration often stems from high-frequency leak: the diffusion model fails to accurately synthesize high-frequency components during denoising process. To this end, we devise Frequency Adapting Group (FRAG) which enhances the video quality in terms of consistency and fidelity by introducing a novel receptive field branch to preserve high-frequency components during the denoising process. FRAG is performed in a model-agnostic manner without additional training and validates the effectiveness on video editing benchmarks (i.e., TGVE, DAVIS).

- **Summary**: Existing person re-identification (Re-ID) methods principally deploy the ImageNet-1K dataset for model initialization, which inevitably results in sub-optimal situations due to the large domain gap. One of the key challenges is that building large-scale person Re-ID datasets is time-consuming. Some previous efforts address this problem by collecting person images from the internet e.g., LUPerson, but it struggles to learn from unlabeled, uncontrollable, and noisy data. In this paper, we present a novel paradigm Diffusion-ReID to efficiently augment and generate diverse images based on known identities without requiring any cost of data collection and annotation. Technically, this paradigm unfolds in two stages: generation and filtering. During the generation stage, we propose Language Prompts Enhancement (LPE) to ensure the ID consistency between the input image sequence and the generated images. In the diffusion process, we propose a Diversity Injection (DI) module to increase attribute diversity. In order to make the generated data have higher quality, we apply a Re-ID confidence threshold filter to further remove the low-quality images. Benefiting from our proposed paradigm, we first create a new large-scale person Re-ID dataset Diff-Person, which consists of over 777K images from 5,183 identities. Next, we build a stronger person Re-ID backbone pre-trained on our Diff-Person. Extensive experiments are conducted on four person Re-ID benchmarks in six widely used settings. Compared with other pre-training and self-supervised competitors, our approach shows significant superiority.

- **Summary**: Large models have demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities in computer vision and natural language processing. Recent efforts have focused on enhancing these models with multimodal processing abilities. However, addressing the challenges posed by scenarios where one modality is absent remains a significant hurdle. In response to this issue, we propose a robust latent representation tuning method for large models. Specifically, our approach introduces a modality latent translation module to maximize the correlation between modalities. Following this, a newly designed fusion module is employed to facilitate information interaction between the modalities. In this framework, not only are common semantics refined during training, but the method also yields robust representations in the absence of one modality. Importantly, our method maintains the frozen state of the image and text foundation models to preserve their abilities acquired through large-scale pretraining. We conduct experiments on several public datasets, and the results underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method.

The main challenge for this task is to recover detailed geometry and appearance, especially for the unobserved regions. To this end, we propose single-view generalizable Human Gaussian model (HGM), a diffusion-guided framework for 3D human modeling from a single image. We design a diffusion-based coarse-to-fine pipeline, where the diffusion model is adapted to refine novel-view images rendered from a coarse human Gaussian model. The refined images are then used together with the input image to learn a refined human Gaussian model. Although effective in hallucinating the unobserved views, the approach may generate unrealistic human pose and shapes due to the lack of supervision. We circumvent this problem by further encoding the geometric priors from SMPL model. Specifically, we propagate geometric features from SMPL volume to the predicted Gaussians via sparse convolution and attention mechanism. We validate our approach on publicly available datasets and demonstrate that it significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM. Additionally, our method exhibits strong generalization for in-the-wild images.

- **Summary**: The painting process of artists is inherently stepwise and varies significantly among different painters and styles. Generating detailed, step-by-step painting processes is essential for art education and research, yet remains largely underexplored. Traditional stroke-based rendering methods break down images into sequences of brushstrokes, yet they fall short of replicating the authentic processes of artists, with limitations confined to basic brushstroke modifications. Text-to-image models utilizing diffusion processes generate images through iterative denoising, also diverge substantially from artists' painting process. To address these challenges, we introduce ProcessPainter, a text-to-video model that is initially pre-trained on synthetic data and subsequently fine-tuned with a select set of artists' painting sequences using the LoRA model. This approach successfully generates painting processes from text prompts for the first time. Furthermore, we introduce an Artwork Replication Network capable of accepting arbitrary-frame input, which facilitates the controlled generation of painting processes, decomposing images into painting sequences, and completing semi-finished artworks. This paper offers new perspectives and tools for advancing art education and image generation technology.

- **Summary**: Mamba, based on state space model (SSM) with its linear complexity and great success in classification provide its superiority in 3D point cloud analysis. Prior to that, Transformer has emerged as one of the most prominent and successful architectures for point cloud analysis. We present PointABM, a hybrid model that integrates the Mamba and Transformer architectures for enhancing local feature to improve performance of 3D point cloud analysis. In order to enhance the extraction of global features, we introduce a bidirectional SSM (bi-SSM) framework, which comprises both a traditional token forward SSM and an innovative backward SSM. To enhance the bi-SSM's capability of capturing more comprehensive features without disrupting the sequence relationships required by the bidirectional Mamba, we introduce Transformer, utilizing its self-attention mechanism to process point clouds. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that integrating Mamba with Transformer significantly enhance the model's capability to analysis 3D point cloud.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViT), when paired with large-scale pretraining, have shown remarkable performance across various computer vision tasks, primarily due to their weak inductive bias. However, while such weak inductive bias aids in pretraining scalability, this may hinder the effective adaptation of ViTs for visuo-motor control tasks as a result of the absence of control-centric inductive biases. Such absent inductive biases include spatial locality and translation equivariance bias which convolutions naturally offer. To this end, we introduce Convolution Injector (CoIn), an add-on module that injects convolutions which are rich in locality and equivariance biases into a pretrained ViT for effective adaptation in visuo-motor control. We evaluate CoIn with three distinct types of pretrained ViTs (CLIP, MVP, VC-1) across 12 varied control tasks within three separate domains (Adroit, MetaWorld, DMC), and demonstrate that CoIn consistently enhances control task performance across all experimented environments and models, validating the effectiveness of providing pretrained ViTs with control-centric biases.

- **Summary**: Humans can effortlessly draw new categories from a single exemplar, a feat that has long posed a challenge for generative models. However, this gap has started to close with recent advances in diffusion models. This one-shot drawing task requires powerful inductive biases that have not been systematically investigated. Here, we study how different inductive biases shape the latent space of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). Along with standard LDM regularizers (KL and vector quantization), we explore supervised regularizations (including classification and prototype-based representation) and contrastive inductive biases (using SimCLR and redundancy reduction objectives). We demonstrate that LDMs with redundancy reduction and prototype-based regularizations produce near-human-like drawings (regarding both samples' recognizability and originality) -- better mimicking human perception (as evaluated psychophysically). Overall, our results suggest that the gap between humans and machines in one-shot drawings is almost closed.

- **Summary**: Precise crop yield predictions are of national importance for ensuring food security and sustainable agricultural practices. While AI-for-science approaches have exhibited promising achievements in solving many scientific problems such as drug discovery, precipitation nowcasting, etc., the development of deep learning models for predicting crop yields is constantly hindered by the lack of an open and large-scale deep learning-ready dataset with multiple modalities to accommodate sufficient information. To remedy this, we introduce the CropNet dataset, the first terabyte-sized, publicly available, and multi-modal dataset specifically targeting climate change-aware crop yield predictions for the contiguous United States (U.S.) continent at the county level. Our CropNet dataset is composed of three modalities of data, i.e., Sentinel-2 Imagery, WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, and USDA Crop Dataset, for over 2200 U.S. counties spanning 6 years (2017-2022), expected to facilitate researchers in developing versatile deep learning models for timely and precisely predicting crop yields at the county-level, by accounting for the effects of both short-term growing season weather variations and long-term climate change on crop yields. Besides, we develop the CropNet package, offering three types of APIs, for facilitating researchers in downloading the CropNet data on the fly over the time and region of interest, and flexibly building their deep learning models for accurate crop yield predictions. Extensive experiments have been conducted on our CropNet dataset via employing various types of deep learning solutions, with the results validating the general applicability and the efficacy of the CropNet dataset in climate change-aware crop yield predictions.

- **Summary**: Assessing action quality is both imperative and challenging due to its significant impact on the quality of AI-generated videos, further complicated by the inherently ambiguous nature of actions within AI-generated video (AIGV). Current action quality assessment (AQA) algorithms predominantly focus on actions from real specific scenarios and are pre-trained with normative action features, thus rendering them inapplicable in AIGVs. To address these problems, we construct GAIA, a Generic AI-generated Action dataset, by conducting a large-scale subjective evaluation from a novel causal reasoning-based perspective, resulting in 971,244 ratings among 9,180 video-action pairs. Based on GAIA, we evaluate a suite of popular text-to-video (T2V) models on their ability to generate visually rational actions, revealing their pros and cons on different categories of actions. We also extend GAIA as a testbed to benchmark the AQA capacity of existing automatic evaluation methods. Results show that traditional AQA methods, action-related metrics in recent T2V benchmarks, and mainstream video quality methods correlate poorly with human opinions, indicating a sizable gap between current models and human action perception patterns in AIGVs. Our findings underscore the significance of action quality as a unique perspective for studying AIGVs and can catalyze progress towards methods with enhanced capacities for AQA in AIGVs.

- **Summary**: Universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), also known as image-agnostic perturbation, is a fixed perturbation map that can fool the classifier with high probabilities on arbitrary images, making it more practical for attacking deep models in the real world. Previous UAP methods generate a scale-fixed and texture-fixed perturbation map for all images, which ignores the multi-scale objects in images and usually results in a low fooling ratio. Since the widely used convolution neural networks tend to classify objects according to semantic information stored in local textures, it seems a reasonable and intuitive way to improve the UAP from the perspective of utilizing local contents effectively. In this work, we find that the fooling ratios significantly increase when we add a constraint to encourage a small-scale UAP map and repeat it vertically and horizontally to fill the whole image domain. To this end, we propose texture scale-constrained UAP (TSC-UAP), a simple yet effective UAP enhancement method that automatically generates UAPs with category-specific local textures that can fool deep models more easily. Through a low-cost operation that restricts the texture scale, TSC-UAP achieves a considerable improvement in the fooling ratio and attack transferability for both data-dependent and data-free UAP methods. Experiments conducted on two state-of-the-art UAP methods, eight popular CNN models and four classical datasets show the remarkable performance of TSC-UAP.

- **Summary**: Accurate prediction of the likelihood of recurrence is important in the selection of postoperative treatment for patients with early-stage breast cancer. In this study, we investigated whether deep learning algorithms can predict patients' risk of recurrence by analyzing the pathology images of their cancer histology. A total of 125 hematoxylin and eosin stained breast cancer whole slide images labeled with the risk prediction via genomics assays were used, and we obtained sensitivity of 0.857, 0.746, and 0.529 for predicting low, intermediate, and high risk, and specificity of 0.816, 0.803, and 0.972. When compared to the expert pathologist's regional histology grade information, a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.61 was obtained. When we checked the model learned through these studies through the class activation map, we found that it actually considered tubule formation and mitotic rate when predicting different risk groups.

- **Summary**: Due to the huge category number, the sophisticated combinations of various strokes and radicals, and the free writing or printing styles, generating Chinese characters with diverse styles is always considered as a difficult task. In this paper, an efficient and generalized deep framework, namely, the W-Net, is introduced for the one-shot arbitrary-style Chinese character generation task. Specifically, given a single character (one-shot) with a specific style (e.g., a printed font or hand-writing style), the proposed W-Net model is capable of learning and generating any arbitrary characters sharing the style similar to the given single character. Such appealing property was rarely seen in the literature. We have compared the proposed W-Net framework to many other competitive methods. Experimental results showed the proposed method is significantly superior in the one-shot setting.

- **Summary**: We propose ExtraNeRF, a novel method for extrapolating the range of views handled by a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). Our main idea is to leverage NeRFs to model scene-specific, fine-grained details, while capitalizing on diffusion models to extrapolate beyond our observed data. A key ingredient is to track visibility to determine what portions of the scene have not been observed, and focus on reconstructing those regions consistently with diffusion models. Our primary contributions include a visibility-aware diffusion-based inpainting module that is fine-tuned on the input imagery, yielding an initial NeRF with moderate quality (often blurry) inpainted regions, followed by a second diffusion model trained on the input imagery to consistently enhance, notably sharpen, the inpainted imagery from the first pass. We demonstrate high-quality results, extrapolating beyond a small number of (typically six or fewer) input views, effectively outpainting the NeRF as well as inpainting newly disoccluded regions inside the original viewing volume. We compare with related work both quantitatively and qualitatively and show significant gains over prior art.

- **Summary**: Dataset bias is a significant challenge in machine learning, where specific attributes, such as texture or color of the images are unintentionally learned resulting in detrimental performance. To address this, previous efforts have focused on debiasing models either by developing novel debiasing algorithms or by generating synthetic data to mitigate the prevalent dataset biases. However, generative approaches to date have largely relied on using bias-specific samples from the dataset, which are typically too scarce. In this work, we propose, DiffInject, a straightforward yet powerful method to augment synthetic bias-conflict samples using a pretrained diffusion model. This approach significantly advances the use of diffusion models for debiasing purposes by manipulating the latent space. Our framework does not require any explicit knowledge of the bias types or labelling, making it a fully unsupervised setting for debiasing. Our methodology demonstrates substantial result in effectively reducing dataset bias.

- **Summary**: Texture, a significant visual attribute in images, has been extensively investigated across various image recognition applications. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have been successful in many computer vision tasks, are currently among the best texture analysis approaches. On the other hand, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have been surpassing the performance of CNNs on tasks such as object recognition, causing a paradigm shift in the field. However, ViTs have so far not been scrutinized for texture recognition, hindering a proper appreciation of their potential in this specific setting. For this reason, this work explores various pre-trained ViT architectures when transferred to tasks that rely on textures. We review 21 different ViT variants and perform an extensive evaluation and comparison with CNNs and hand-engineered models on several tasks, such as assessing robustness to changes in texture rotation, scale, and illumination, and distinguishing color textures, material textures, and texture attributes. The goal is to understand the potential and differences among these models when directly applied to texture recognition, using pre-trained ViTs primarily for feature extraction and employing linear classifiers for evaluation. We also evaluate their efficiency, which is one of the main drawbacks in contrast to other methods. Our results show that ViTs generally outperform both CNNs and hand-engineered models, especially when using stronger pre-training and tasks involving in-the-wild textures (images from the internet). We highlight the following promising models: ViT-B with DINO pre-training, BeiTv2, and the Swin architecture, as well as the EfficientFormer as a low-cost alternative. In terms of efficiency, although having a higher number of GFLOPs and parameters, ViT-B and BeiT(v2) can achieve a lower feature extraction time on GPUs compared to ResNet50.

- **Summary**: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) aims to segment sound sources in the video sequence, requiring a pixel-level understanding of audio-visual correspondence. As the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has strongly impacted extensive fields of dense prediction problems, prior works have investigated the introduction of SAM into AVS with audio as a new modality of the prompt. Nevertheless, constrained by SAM's single-frame segmentation scheme, the temporal context across multiple frames of audio-visual data remains insufficiently utilized. To this end, we study the extension of SAM's capabilities to the sequence of audio-visual scenes by analyzing contextual cross-modal relationships across the frames. To achieve this, we propose a Spatio-Temporal, Bidirectional Audio-Visual Attention (ST-BAVA) module integrated into the middle of SAM's image encoder and mask decoder. It adaptively updates the audio-visual features to convey the spatio-temporal correspondence between the video frames and audio streams. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on AVS benchmarks, especially with an 8.3% mIoU gain on a challenging multi-sources subset.

- **Summary**: Rate-distortion optimization through neural networks has accomplished competitive results in compression efficiency and image quality. This learning-based approach seeks to minimize the compromise between compression rate and reconstructed image quality by automatically extracting and retaining crucial information, while discarding less critical details. A successful technique consists in introducing a deep hyperprior that operates within a 2-level nested latent variable model, enhancing compression by capturing complex data dependencies. This paper extends this concept by designing a generalized L-level nested generative model with a Markov chain structure. We demonstrate as L increases that a trainable prior is detrimental and explore a common dimensionality along the distinct latent variables to boost compression performance. As this structured framework can represent autoregressive coders, we outperform the hyperprior model and achieve state-of-the-art performance while reducing substantially the computational cost. Our experimental evaluation is performed on wind turbine scenarios to study its application on visual inspections

- **Summary**: Black carbon (BC) is an important pollutant aerosol emitted by numerous human activities, including gas flaring. Improper combustion in flaring activities can release large amounts of BC, which is harmful to human health and has a strong climate warming effect. To our knowledge, no study has ever directly monitored BC emissions from satellite imagery. Previous works quantified BC emissions indirectly, by applying emission coefficients to flaring volumes estimated from satellite imagery. Here, we develop a deep learning framework and apply it to Sentinel-2 imagery over North Africa during 2022 to detect and quantify BC emissions from gas flaring. We find that BC emissions in this region amount to about 1 million tCO$_{2,\mathrm{eq}}$, or 1 million passenger cars, more than a quarter of which are due to 10 sites alone. This work demonstrates the operational monitoring of BC emissions from flaring, a key step in implementing effective mitigation policies to reduce the climate impact of oil and gas operations.

- **Summary**: Unlike the sparse label action detection task, where a single action occurs in each timestamp of a video, in a dense multi-label scenario, actions can overlap. To address this challenging task, it is necessary to simultaneously learn (i) temporal dependencies and (ii) co-occurrence action relationships. Recent approaches model temporal information by extracting multi-scale features through hierarchical transformer-based networks. However, the self-attention mechanism in transformers inherently loses temporal positional information. We argue that combining this with multiple sub-sampling processes in hierarchical designs can lead to further loss of positional information. Preserving this information is essential for accurate action detection. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a novel transformer-based network that (a) employs a non-hierarchical structure when modelling different ranges of temporal dependencies and (b) embeds relative positional encoding in its transformer layers. Furthermore, to model co-occurrence action relationships, current methods explicitly embed class relations into the transformer network. However, these approaches are not computationally efficient, as the network needs to compute all possible pair action class relations. We also overcome this challenge by introducing a novel learning paradigm that allows the network to benefit from explicitly modelling temporal co-occurrence action dependencies without imposing their additional computational costs during inference. We evaluate the performance of our proposed approach on two challenging dense multi-label benchmark datasets and show that our method improves the current state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: Moment retrieval aims to locate the most relevant moment in an untrimmed video based on a given natural language query. Existing solutions can be roughly categorized into moment-based and clip-based methods. The former often involves heavy computations, while the latter, due to overlooking coarse-grained information, typically underperforms compared to moment-based models. Hence, this paper proposes a novel 2-Dimensional Pointer-based Machine Reading Comprehension for Moment Retrieval Choice (2DP-2MRC) model to address the issue of imprecise localization in clip-based methods while maintaining lower computational complexity than moment-based methods. Specifically, we introduce an AV-Encoder to capture coarse-grained information at moment and video levels. Additionally, a 2D pointer encoder module is introduced to further enhance boundary detection for target moment.

- **Summary**: We introduce iMotion-LLM: a Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) with trajectory prediction, tailored to guide interactive multi-agent scenarios. Different from conventional motion prediction approaches, iMotion-LLM capitalizes on textual instructions as key inputs for generating contextually relevant trajectories. By enriching the real-world driving scenarios in the Waymo Open Dataset with textual motion instructions, we created InstructWaymo. Leveraging this dataset, iMotion-LLM integrates a pretrained LLM, fine-tuned with LoRA, to translate scene features into the LLM input space. iMotion-LLM offers significant advantages over conventional motion prediction models. First, it can generate trajectories that align with the provided instructions if it is a feasible direction. Second, when given an infeasible direction, it can reject the instruction, thereby enhancing safety. These findings act as milestones in empowering autonomous navigation systems to interpret and predict the dynamics of multi-agent environments, laying the groundwork for future advancements in this field.

- **Summary**: Volumetric rendering based methods, like NeRF, excel in HDR view synthesis from RAWimages, especially for nighttime scenes. While, they suffer from long training times and cannot perform real-time rendering due to dense sampling requirements. The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering and faster training. However, implementing RAW image-based view synthesis directly using 3DGS is challenging due to its inherent drawbacks: 1) in nighttime scenes, extremely low SNR leads to poor structure-from-motion (SfM) estimation in distant views; 2) the limited representation capacity of spherical harmonics (SH) function is unsuitable for RAW linear color space; and 3) inaccurate scene structure hampers downstream tasks such as refocusing. To address these issues, we propose LE3D (Lighting Every darkness with 3DGS). Our method proposes Cone Scatter Initialization to enrich the estimation of SfM, and replaces SH with a Color MLP to represent the RAW linear color space. Additionally, we introduce depth distortion and near-far regularizations to improve the accuracy of scene structure for downstream tasks. These designs enable LE3D to perform real-time novel view synthesis, HDR rendering, refocusing, and tone-mapping changes. Compared to previous volumetric rendering based methods, LE3D reduces training time to 1% and improves rendering speed by up to 4,000 times for 2K resolution images in terms of FPS.

- **Summary**: The scarcity of high-quality Earth Observation (EO) imagery poses a significant challenge, despite its critical role in enabling precise analysis and informed decision-making across various sectors. This scarcity is primarily due to atmospheric conditions, seasonal variations, and limited geographical coverage, which complicates the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in EO. Data augmentation, a widely used technique in AI that involves generating additional data mainly through parameterized image transformations, has been employed to increase the volume and diversity of data. However, this method often falls short in generating sufficient diversity across key semantic axes, adversely affecting the accuracy of EO applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel four-stage approach aimed at improving the diversity of augmented data by integrating diffusion models. Our approach employs meta-prompts for instruction generation, harnesses general-purpose vision-language models for generating rich captions, fine-tunes an Earth Observation diffusion model, and iteratively augments data. We conducted extensive experiments using four different data augmentation techniques, and our approach consistently demonstrated improvements, outperforming the established augmentation methods, revealing its effectiveness in generating semantically rich and diverse EO images.

- **Summary**: The development of multi-modal object detection for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) typically relies on a large amount of pixel-aligned multi-modal image data. However, existing datasets face challenges such as limited modalities, high construction costs, and imprecise annotations. To this end, we propose a synthetic multi-modal UAV-based object detection dataset, UEMM-Air. Specially, we simulate various UAV flight scenarios and object types using the Unreal Engine (UE). Then we design the UAV's flight logic to automatically collect data from different scenarios, perspectives, and altitudes. Finally, we propose a novel heuristic automatic annotation algorithm to generate accurate object detection labels. In total, our UEMM-Air consists of 20k pairs of images with 5 modalities and precise annotations. Moreover, we conduct numerous experiments and establish new benchmark results on our dataset. We found that models pre-trained on UEMM-Air exhibit better performance on downstream tasks compared to other similar datasets. The dataset is publicly available (https://github.com/1e12Leon/UEMM-Air) to support the research of multi-modal UAV object detection models.

- **Summary**: Document layout analysis is a key area in document research, involving techniques like text mining and visual analysis. Despite various methods developed to tackle layout analysis, a critical but frequently overlooked problem is the scarcity of labeled data needed for analyses. With the rise of internet use, an overwhelming number of documents are now available online, making the process of accurately labeling them for research purposes increasingly challenging and labor-intensive. Moreover, the diversity of documents online presents a unique set of challenges in maintaining the quality and consistency of these labels, further complicating document layout analysis in the digital era. To address this, we employ a vision-based approach for analyzing document layouts designed to train a network without labels. Instead, we focus on pre-training, initially generating simple object masks from the unlabeled document images. These masks are then used to train a detector, enhancing object detection and segmentation performance. The model's effectiveness is further amplified through several unsupervised training iterations, continuously refining its performance. This approach significantly advances document layout analysis, particularly precision and efficiency, without labels.

- **Summary**: Understanding human visual processing in dynamic environments is essential for psychology and human-centered interaction design. Mobile eye-tracking systems, combining egocentric video and gaze signals, offer valuable insights. However, manual analysis of these recordings is time-intensive. In this work, we present a novel human-centered learning algorithm designed for automated object recognition within mobile eye-tracking settings. Our approach seamlessly integrates an object detector with an inductive message-passing network technique (I-MPN), harnessing node features such as node profile information and positions. This integration enables our algorithm to learn embedding functions capable of generalizing to new object angle views, thereby facilitating rapid adaptation and efficient reasoning in dynamic contexts as users navigate through their environment. Through experiments conducted on three distinct video sequences, our \textit{interactive-based method} showcases significant performance improvements over fixed training/testing algorithms, even when trained on considerably smaller annotated samples collected through user feedback. Furthermore, we showcase exceptional efficiency in data annotation processes, surpassing approaches that use complete object detectors, combine detectors with convolutional networks, or employ interactive video segmentation.



### Tuning-Free Visual Customization via View Iterative Self-Attention Control

- **Summary**: Fine-Tuning Diffusion Models enable a wide range of personalized generation and editing applications on diverse visual modalities. While Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) accelerates the fine-tuning process, it still requires multiple reference images and time-consuming training, which constrains its scalability for large-scale and real-time applications. In this paper, we propose \textit{View Iterative Self-Attention Control (VisCtrl)} to tackle this challenge. Specifically, VisCtrl is a training-free method that injects the appearance and structure of a user-specified subject into another subject in the target image, unlike previous approaches that require fine-tuning the model. Initially, we obtain the initial noise for both the reference and target images through DDIM inversion. Then, during the denoising phase, features from the reference image are injected into the target image via the self-attention mechanism. Notably, by iteratively performing this feature injection process, we ensure that the reference image features are gradually integrated into the target image. This approach results in consistent and harmonious editing with only one reference image in a few denoising steps. Moreover, benefiting from our plug-and-play architecture design and the proposed Feature Gradual Sampling strategy for multi-view editing, our method can be easily extended to edit in complex visual domains. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of VisCtrl across a spectrum of tasks, including personalized editing of images, videos, and 3D scenes.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art approaches for autonomous driving integrate multiple sub-tasks of the overall driving task into a single pipeline that can be trained in an end-to-end fashion by passing latent representations between the different modules. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on a unified grid to represent the belief state of the scene, we propose dedicated representations to disentangle dynamic agents and static scene elements. This allows us to explicitly compensate for the effect of both ego and object motion between consecutive time steps and to flexibly propagate the belief state through time. Furthermore, dynamic objects can not only attend to the input camera images, but also directly benefit from the inferred static scene structure via a novel dynamic-static cross-attention. Extensive experiments on the challenging nuScenes benchmark demonstrate the benefits of the proposed dual-stream design, especially for modelling highly dynamic agents in the scene, and highlight the improved temporal consistency of our approach. Our method titled DualAD not only outperforms independently trained single-task networks, but also improves over previous state-of-the-art end-to-end models by a large margin on all tasks along the functional chain of driving.

- **Summary**: The recent release of GPT-4o has garnered widespread attention due to its powerful general capabilities. While its impressive performance is widely acknowledged, its safety aspects have not been sufficiently explored. Given the potential societal impact of risky content generated by advanced generative AI such as GPT-4o, it is crucial to rigorously evaluate its safety. In response to this question, this paper for the first time conducts a rigorous evaluation of GPT-4o against jailbreak attacks. Specifically, this paper adopts a series of multi-modal and uni-modal jailbreak attacks on 4 commonly used benchmarks encompassing three modalities (\ie, text, speech, and image), which involves the optimization of over 4,000 initial text queries and the analysis and statistical evaluation of nearly 8,000+ response on GPT-4o. Our extensive experiments reveal several novel observations: (1) In contrast to the previous version (such as GPT-4V), GPT-4o has enhanced safety in the context of text modality jailbreak; (2) The newly introduced audio modality opens up new attack vectors for jailbreak attacks on GPT-4o; (3) Existing black-box multimodal jailbreak attack methods are largely ineffective against GPT-4o and GPT-4V. These findings provide critical insights into the safety implications of GPT-4o and underscore the need for robust alignment guardrails in large models.

- **Summary**: Recently, brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have attracted great research attention owing to their inherent bio-interpretability, event-triggered properties and powerful perception of spatiotemporal information, which is beneficial to handling event-based neuromorphic datasets. In contrast to conventional static image datasets, event-based neuromorphic datasets present heightened complexity in feature extraction due to their distinctive time series and sparsity characteristics, which influences their classification accuracy. To overcome this challenge, a novel approach termed Neuromorphic Momentum Contrast Learning (NeuroMoCo) for SNNs is introduced in this paper by extending the benefits of self-supervised pre-training to SNNs to effectively stimulate their potential. This is the first time that self-supervised learning (SSL) based on momentum contrastive learning is realized in SNNs. In addition, we devise a novel loss function named MixInfoNCE tailored to their temporal characteristics to further increase the classification accuracy of neuromorphic datasets, which is verified through rigorous ablation experiments. Finally, experiments on DVS-CIFAR10, DVS128Gesture and N-Caltech101 have shown that NeuroMoCo of this paper establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks: 83.6% (Spikformer-2-256), 98.62% (Spikformer-2-256), and 84.4% (SEW-ResNet-18), respectively.

- **Summary**: The ability to accurately recognize an individual's face with respect to human aging factor holds significant importance for various private as well as government sectors such as customs and public security bureaus, passport office, and national database systems. Therefore, developing a robust age-invariant face recognition system is of crucial importance to address the challenges posed by ageing and maintain the reliability and accuracy of facial recognition technology. In this research work, the focus is to explore the feasibility of utilizing synthetic ageing data to improve the robustness of face recognition models that can eventually help in recognizing people at broader age intervals. To achieve this, we first design set of experiments to evaluate state-of-the-art synthetic ageing methods. In the next stage we explore the effect of age intervals on a current deep learning-based face recognition algorithm by using synthetic ageing data as well as real ageing data to perform rigorous training and validation. Moreover, these synthetic age data have been used in facilitating face recognition algorithms. Experimental results show that the recognition rate of the model trained on synthetic ageing images is 3.33% higher than the results of the baseline model when tested on images with an age gap of 40 years, which prove the potential of synthetic age data which has been quantified to enhance the performance of age-invariant face recognition systems.

- **Summary**: We explore methods to detect automobiles in Planet imagery and build a large scale vector field for moving objects. Planet operates two distinct constellations: high-resolution SkySat satellites as well as medium-resolution SuperDove satellites. We show that both static and moving cars can be identified reliably in high-resolution SkySat imagery. We are able to estimate the speed and heading of moving vehicles by leveraging the inter-band displacement (or "rainbow" effect) of moving objects. Identifying cars and trucks in medium-resolution SuperDove imagery is far more difficult, though a similar rainbow effect is observed in these satellites and enables moving vehicles to be detected and vectorized. The frequent revisit of Planet satellites enables the categorization of automobile and truck activity patterns over broad areas of interest and lengthy timeframes.

- **Summary**: Stochastic optimisation algorithms are the de facto standard for machine learning with large amounts of data. Handling only a subset of available data in each optimisation step dramatically reduces the per-iteration computational costs, while still ensuring significant progress towards the solution. Driven by the need to solve large-scale optimisation problems as efficiently as possible, the last decade has witnessed an explosion of research in this area. Leveraging the parallels between machine learning and inverse problems has allowed harnessing the power of this research wave for solving inverse problems. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive account of the state-of-the-art in stochastic optimisation from the viewpoint of inverse problems. We present algorithms with diverse modalities of problem randomisation and discuss the roles of variance reduction, acceleration, higher-order methods, and other algorithmic modifications, and compare theoretical results with practical behaviour. We focus on the potential and the challenges for stochastic optimisation that are unique to inverse imaging problems and are not commonly encountered in machine learning. We conclude the survey with illustrative examples from imaging problems to examine the advantages and disadvantages that this new generation of algorithms bring to the field of inverse problems.

- **Summary**: Deep learners tend to perform well when trained under the closed set assumption but struggle when deployed under open set conditions. This motivates the field of Open Set Recognition in which we seek to give deep learners the ability to recognize whether a data sample belongs to the known classes trained on or comes from the surrounding infinite world. Existing open set recognition methods typically rely upon a single function for the dual task of distinguishing between knowns and unknowns as well as making known class distinction. This dual process leaves performance on the table as the function is not specialized for either task. In this work, we introduce Cascading Unknown Detection with Known Classification (Cas-DC), where we instead learn specialized functions in a cascading fashion for both known/unknown detection and fine class classification amongst the world of knowns. Our experiments and analysis demonstrate that Cas-DC handily outperforms modern methods in open set recognition when compared using AUROC scores and correct classification rate at various true positive rates.

- **Summary**: Mitigating biases in generative AI and, particularly in text-to-image models, is of high importance given their growing implications in society. The biased datasets used for training pose challenges in ensuring the responsible development of these models, and mitigation through hard prompting or embedding alteration, are the most common present solutions. Our work introduces a novel approach to achieve diverse and inclusive synthetic images by learning a direction in the latent space and solely modifying the initial Gaussian noise provided for the diffusion process. Maintaining a neutral prompt and untouched embeddings, this approach successfully adapts to diverse debiasing scenarios, such as geographical biases. Moreover, our work proves it is possible to linearly combine these learned latent directions to introduce new mitigations, and if desired, integrate it with text embedding adjustments. Furthermore, text-to-image models lack transparency for assessing bias in outputs, unless visually inspected. Thus, we provide a tool to empower developers to select their desired concepts to mitigate. The project page with code is available online.

- **Summary**: Recent 3D large reconstruction models (LRMs) can generate high-quality 3D content in sub-seconds by integrating multi-view diffusion models with scalable multi-view reconstructors. Current works further leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting as 3D representation for improved visual quality and rendering efficiency. However, we observe that existing Gaussian reconstruction models often suffer from multi-view inconsistency and blurred textures. We attribute this to the compromise of multi-view information propagation in favor of adopting powerful yet computationally intensive architectures (\eg, Transformers). To address this issue, we introduce MVGamba, a general and lightweight Gaussian reconstruction model featuring a multi-view Gaussian reconstructor based on the RNN-like State Space Model (SSM). Our Gaussian reconstructor propagates causal context containing multi-view information for cross-view self-refinement while generating a long sequence of Gaussians for fine-detail modeling with linear complexity. With off-the-shelf multi-view diffusion models integrated, MVGamba unifies 3D generation tasks from a single image, sparse images, or text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVGamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in all 3D content generation scenarios with approximately only $0.1\times$ of the model size.

- **Summary**: Dealing with atypical traffic scenarios remains a challenging task in autonomous driving. However, most anomaly detection approaches cannot be trained on raw sensor data but require exposure to outlier data and powerful semantic segmentation models trained in a supervised fashion. This limits the representation of normality to labeled data, which does not scale well. In this work, we revisit unsupervised anomaly detection and present UMAD, leveraging generative world models and unsupervised image segmentation. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection.

- **Summary**: Modeling and manufacturing of personalized cranial implants are important research areas that may decrease the waiting time for patients suffering from cranial damage. The modeling of personalized implants may be partially automated by the use of deep learning-based methods. However, this task suffers from difficulties with generalizability into data from previously unseen distributions that make it difficult to use the research outcomes in real clinical settings. Due to difficulties with acquiring ground-truth annotations, different techniques to improve the heterogeneity of datasets used for training the deep networks have to be considered and introduced. In this work, we present a large-scale study of several augmentation techniques, varying from classical geometric transformations, image registration, variational autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks, to the most recent advances in latent diffusion models. We show that the use of heavy data augmentation significantly increases both the quantitative and qualitative outcomes, resulting in an average Dice Score above 0.94 for the SkullBreak and above 0.96 for the SkullFix datasets. Moreover, we show that the synthetically augmented network successfully reconstructs real clinical defects. The work is a considerable contribution to the field of artificial intelligence in the automatic modeling of personalized cranial implants.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel approach to visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using multiple RGB-D cameras. The proposed method, Multicam-SLAM, significantly enhances the robustness and accuracy of SLAM systems by capturing more comprehensive spatial information from various perspectives. This method enables the accurate determination of pose relationships among multiple cameras without the need for overlapping fields of view. The proposed Muticam-SLAM includes a unique multi-camera model, a multi-keyframes structure, and several parallel SLAM threads. The multi-camera model allows for the integration of data from multiple cameras, while the multi-keyframes and parallel SLAM threads ensure efficient and accurate pose estimation and mapping. Extensive experiments in various environments demonstrate the superior accuracy and robustness of the proposed method compared to conventional single-camera SLAM systems. The results highlight the potential of the proposed Multicam-SLAM for more complex and challenging applications. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/AlterPang/Multi_ORB_SLAM}.

- **Summary**: Aligning large language models with human preferences has emerged as a critical focus in language modeling research. Yet, integrating preference learning into Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models is still relatively uncharted territory. The Diffusion-DPO technique made initial strides by employing pairwise preference learning in diffusion models tailored for specific text prompts. We introduce Diffusion-RPO, a new method designed to align diffusion-based T2I models with human preferences more effectively. This approach leverages both prompt-image pairs with identical prompts and those with semantically related content across various modalities. Furthermore, we have developed a new evaluation metric, style alignment, aimed at overcoming the challenges of high costs, low reproducibility, and limited interpretability prevalent in current evaluations of human preference alignment. Our findings demonstrate that Diffusion-RPO outperforms established methods such as Supervised Fine-Tuning and Diffusion-DPO in tuning Stable Diffusion versions 1.5 and XL-1.0, achieving superior results in both automated evaluations of human preferences and style alignment.

- **Summary**: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), induced by diabetes, poses a significant risk of visual impairment. Accurate and effective grading of DR aids in the treatment of this condition. Yet existing models experience notable performance degradation on unseen domains due to domain shifts. Previous methods address this issue by simulating domain style through simple visual transformation and mitigating domain noise via learning robust representations. However, domain shifts encompass more than image styles. They overlook biases caused by implicit factors such as ethnicity, age, and diagnostic criteria. In our work, we propose a novel framework where representations of paired data from different domains are decoupled into semantic features and domain noise. The resulting augmented representation comprises original retinal semantics and domain noise from other domains, aiming to generate enhanced representations aligned with real-world clinical needs, incorporating rich information from diverse domains. Subsequently, to improve the robustness of the decoupled representations, class and domain prototypes are employed to interpolate the disentangled representations while data-aware weights are designed to focus on rare classes and domains. Finally, we devise a robust pixel-level semantic alignment loss to align retinal semantics decoupled from features, maintaining a balance between intra-class diversity and dense class features. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on unseen domains. The code implementations are accessible on https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/DECO.

- **Summary**: Digital mammography is essential to breast cancer detection, and deep learning offers promising tools for faster and more accurate mammogram analysis. In radiology and other high-stakes environments, uninterpretable ("black box") deep learning models are unsuitable and there is a call in these fields to make interpretable models. Recent work in interpretable computer vision provides transparency to these formerly black boxes by utilizing prototypes for case-based explanations, achieving high accuracy in applications including mammography. However, these models struggle with precise feature localization, reasoning on large portions of an image when only a small part is relevant. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel multi-scale interpretable deep learning model for mammographic mass margin classification. Our contribution not only offers an interpretable model with reasoning aligned with radiologist practices, but also provides a general architecture for computer vision with user-configurable prototypes from coarse- to fine-grained prototypes.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in multi-modal algorithms have driven and been driven by the increasing availability of large image-text datasets, leading to significant strides in various fields, including computational pathology. However, in most existing medical image-text datasets, the text typically provides high-level summaries that may not sufficiently describe sub-tile regions within a large pathology image. For example, an image might cover an extensive tissue area containing cancerous and healthy regions, but the accompanying text might only specify that this image is a cancer slide, lacking the nuanced details needed for in-depth analysis. In this study, we introduce STimage-1K4M, a novel dataset designed to bridge this gap by providing genomic features for sub-tile images. STimage-1K4M contains 1,149 images derived from spatial transcriptomics data, which captures gene expression information at the level of individual spatial spots within a pathology image. Specifically, each image in the dataset is broken down into smaller sub-image tiles, with each tile paired with 15,000-30,000 dimensional gene expressions. With 4,293,195 pairs of sub-tile images and gene expressions, STimage-1K4M offers unprecedented granularity, paving the way for a wide range of advanced research in multi-modal data analysis an innovative applications in computational pathology, and beyond.

- **Summary**: In autonomous driving, the most challenging scenarios are the ones that can only be detected within their temporal context. Most video anomaly detection approaches focus either on surveillance or traffic accidents, which are only a subfield of autonomous driving. In this work, we present HF$^2$-VAD$_{AD}$, a variation of the HF$^2$-VAD surveillance video anomaly detection method for autonomous driving. We learn a representation of normality from a vehicle's ego perspective and evaluate pixel-wise anomaly detections in rare and critical scenarios.

- **Summary**: Modern alignment techniques based on human preferences, such as RLHF and DPO, typically employ divergence regularization relative to the reference model to ensure training stability. However, this often limits the flexibility of models during alignment, especially when there is a clear distributional discrepancy between the preference data and the reference model. In this paper, we focus on the alignment of recent text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), and find that this "reference mismatch" is indeed a significant problem in aligning these models due to the unstructured nature of visual modalities: e.g., a preference for a particular stylistic aspect can easily induce such a discrepancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel and memory-friendly preference alignment method for diffusion models that does not depend on any reference model, coined margin-aware preference optimization (MaPO). MaPO jointly maximizes the likelihood margin between the preferred and dispreferred image sets and the likelihood of the preferred sets, simultaneously learning general stylistic features and preferences. For evaluation, we introduce two new pairwise preference datasets, which comprise self-generated image pairs from SDXL, Pick-Style and Pick-Safety, simulating diverse scenarios of reference mismatch. Our experiments validate that MaPO can significantly improve alignment on Pick-Style and Pick-Safety and general preference alignment when used with Pick-a-Pic v2, surpassing the base SDXL and other existing methods.

- **Summary**: Despite the growing success of 3D-aware GANs, which can be trained on 2D images to generate high-quality 3D assets, they still rely on multi-view images with camera annotations to synthesize sufficient details from all viewing directions. However, the scarce availability of calibrated multi-view image datasets, especially in comparison to single-view images, has limited the potential of 3D GANs. Moreover, while bypassing camera pose annotations with a camera distribution constraint reduces dependence on exact camera parameters, it still struggles to generate a consistent orientation of 3D assets. To this end, we propose SYM3D, a novel 3D-aware GAN designed to leverage the prevalent reflectional symmetry structure found in natural and man-made objects, alongside a proposed view-aware spatial attention mechanism in learning the 3D representation. We evaluate SYM3D on both synthetic (ShapeNet Chairs, Cars, and Airplanes) and real-world datasets (ABO-Chair), demonstrating its superior performance in capturing detailed geometry and texture, even when trained on only single-view images. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating symmetry regularization in helping reduce artifacts in the modeling of 3D assets in the text-to-3D task.

- **Summary**: Perfusion MRI (pMRI) offers valuable insights into tumor vascularity and promises to predict tumor genotypes, thus benefiting prognosis for glioma patients, yet effective models tailored to 4D pMRI are still lacking. This study presents the first attempt to model 4D pMRI using a GNN-based spatiotemporal model PerfGAT, integrating spatial information and temporal kinetics to predict Isocitrate DeHydrogenase (IDH) mutation status in glioma patients. Specifically, we propose a graph structure learning approach based on edge attention and negative graphs to optimize temporal correlations modeling. Moreover, we design a dual-attention feature fusion module to integrate spatiotemporal features while addressing tumor-related brain regions. Further, we develop a class-balanced augmentation methods tailored to spatiotemporal data, which could mitigate the common label imbalance issue in clinical datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, promising to model pMRI effectively for patient characterization.

- **Summary**: We introduce Semantic Parsing in Contextual Environments (SPICE), a task designed to enhance artificial agents' contextual awareness by integrating multimodal inputs with prior contexts. SPICE goes beyond traditional semantic parsing by offering a structured, interpretable framework for dynamically updating an agent's knowledge with new information, mirroring the complexity of human communication. We develop the VG-SPICE dataset, crafted to challenge agents with visual scene graph construction from spoken conversational exchanges, highlighting speech and visual data integration. We also present the Audio-Vision Dialogue Scene Parser (AViD-SP) developed for use on VG-SPICE. These innovations aim to improve multimodal information processing and integration. Both the VG-SPICE dataset and the AViD-SP model are publicly available.

- **Summary**: We introduce Visual Caption Restoration (VCR), a novel vision-language task that challenges models to accurately restore partially obscured texts using pixel-level hints within images. This task stems from the observation that text embedded in images is intrinsically different from common visual elements and natural language due to the need to align the modalities of vision, text, and text embedded in images. While numerous works have integrated text embedded in images into visual question-answering tasks, approaches to these tasks generally rely on optical character recognition or masked language modeling, thus reducing the task to mainly text-based processing. However, text-based processing becomes ineffective in VCR as accurate text restoration depends on the combined information from provided images, context, and subtle cues from the tiny exposed areas of masked texts. We develop a pipeline to generate synthetic images for the VCR task using image-caption pairs, with adjustable caption visibility to control the task difficulty. With this pipeline, we construct a dataset for VCR called VCR-Wiki using images with captions from Wikipedia, comprising 2.11M English and 346K Chinese entities in both easy and hard split variants. Our results reveal that current vision language models significantly lag behind human performance in the VCR task, and merely fine-tuning the models on our dataset does not lead to notable improvements. We release VCR-Wiki and the data construction code to facilitate future research.

- **Summary**: Text-guided video prediction (TVP) involves predicting the motion of future frames from the initial frame according to an instruction, which has wide applications in virtual reality, robotics, and content creation. Previous TVP methods make significant breakthroughs by adapting Stable Diffusion for this task. However, they struggle with frame consistency and temporal stability primarily due to the limited scale of video datasets. We observe that pretrained Image2Video diffusion models possess good priors for video dynamics but they lack textual control. Hence, transferring Image2Video models to leverage their video dynamic priors while injecting instruction control to generate controllable videos is both a meaningful and challenging task. To achieve this, we introduce the Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to predict future video states based on initial frames and text instructions. More specifically, we design a dual query transformer (DQFormer) architecture, which integrates the instructions and frames into the conditional embeddings for future frame prediction. Additionally, we develop Long-Short Term Temporal Adapters and Spatial Adapters that can quickly transfer general video diffusion models to specific scenarios with minimal training costs. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on four datasets: Something Something V2, Epic Kitchen-100, Bridge Data, and UCF-101. Notably, AID achieves 91.2% and 55.5% FVD improvements on Bridge and SSv2 respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in various domains.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in generative vision-language models (VLMs) have exciting potential implications for AI in radiology, yet VLMs are also known to produce hallucinations, nonsensical text, and other unwanted behaviors that can waste clinicians' time and cause patient harm. Drawing on recent work on direct preference optimization (DPO), we propose a simple method for modifying the behavior of pretrained VLMs performing radiology report generation by suppressing unwanted types of generations. We apply our method to the prevention of hallucinations of prior exams, addressing a long-established problem behavior in models performing chest X-ray report generation. Across our experiments, we find that DPO fine-tuning achieves a 3.2-4.8x reduction in lines hallucinating prior exams while maintaining model performance on clinical accuracy metrics. Our work is, to the best of our knowledge, the first work to apply DPO to medical VLMs, providing a data- and compute- efficient way to suppress problem behaviors while maintaining overall clinical accuracy.

- **Summary**: Existing video captioning benchmarks and models lack coherent representations of causal-temporal narrative, which is sequences of events linked through cause and effect, unfolding over time and driven by characters or agents. This lack of narrative restricts models' ability to generate text descriptions that capture the causal and temporal dynamics inherent in video content. To address this gap, we propose NarrativeBridge, an approach comprising of: (1) a novel Causal-Temporal Narrative (CTN) captions benchmark generated using a large language model and few-shot prompting, explicitly encoding cause-effect temporal relationships in video descriptions, evaluated automatically to ensure caption quality and relevance; and (2) a dedicated Cause-Effect Network (CEN) architecture with separate encoders for capturing cause and effect dynamics independently, enabling effective learning and generation of captions with causal-temporal narrative. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CEN is more accurate in articulating the causal and temporal aspects of video content than the second best model (GIT): 17.88 and 17.44 CIDEr on the MSVD and MSR-VTT datasets, respectively. The proposed framework understands and generates nuanced text descriptions with intricate causal-temporal narrative structures present in videos, addressing a critical limitation in video captioning.

- **Summary**: Given the remarkable results of motion synthesis with diffusion models, a natural question arises: how can we effectively leverage these models for motion editing? Existing diffusion-based motion editing methods overlook the profound potential of the prior embedded within the weights of pre-trained models, which enables manipulating the latent feature space; hence, they primarily center on handling the motion space. In this work, we explore the attention mechanism of pre-trained motion diffusion models. We uncover the roles and interactions of attention elements in capturing and representing intricate human motion patterns, and carefully integrate these elements to transfer a leader motion to a follower one while maintaining the nuanced characteristics of the follower, resulting in zero-shot motion transfer. Editing features associated with selected motions allows us to confront a challenge observed in prior motion diffusion approaches, which use general directives (e.g., text, music) for editing, ultimately failing to convey subtle nuances effectively. Our work is inspired by how a monkey closely imitates what it sees while maintaining its unique motion patterns; hence we call it Monkey See, Monkey Do, and dub it MoMo. Employing our technique enables accomplishing tasks such as synthesizing out-of-distribution motions, style transfer, and spatial editing. Furthermore, diffusion inversion is seldom employed for motions; as a result, editing efforts focus on generated motions, limiting the editability of real ones. MoMo harnesses motion inversion, extending its application to both real and generated motions. Experimental results show the advantage of our approach over the current art. In particular, unlike methods tailored for specific applications through training, our approach is applied at inference time, requiring no training.

- **Summary**: Over 85 million computed tomography (CT) scans are performed annually in the US, of which approximately one quarter focus on the abdomen. Given the current radiologist shortage, there is a large impetus to use artificial intelligence to alleviate the burden of interpreting these complex imaging studies. Prior state-of-the-art approaches for automated medical image interpretation leverage vision language models (VLMs). However, current medical VLMs are generally limited to 2D images and short reports, and do not leverage electronic health record (EHR) data for supervision. We introduce Merlin - a 3D VLM that we train using paired CT scans (6+ million images from 15,331 CTs), EHR diagnosis codes (1.8+ million codes), and radiology reports (6+ million tokens). We evaluate Merlin on 6 task types and 752 individual tasks. The non-adapted (off-the-shelf) tasks include zero-shot findings classification (31 findings), phenotype classification (692 phenotypes), and zero-shot cross-modal retrieval (image to findings and image to impressions), while model adapted tasks include 5-year disease prediction (6 diseases), radiology report generation, and 3D semantic segmentation (20 organs). We perform internal validation on a test set of 5,137 CTs, and external validation on 7,000 clinical CTs and on two public CT datasets (VerSe, TotalSegmentator). Beyond these clinically-relevant evaluations, we assess the efficacy of various network architectures and training strategies to depict that Merlin has favorable performance to existing task-specific baselines. We derive data scaling laws to empirically assess training data needs for requisite downstream task performance. Furthermore, unlike conventional VLMs that require hundreds of GPUs for training, we perform all training on a single GPU.

- **Summary**: The characterization of Tumor MicroEnvironment (TME) is challenging due to its complexity and heterogeneity. Relatively consistent TME characteristics embedded within highly specific tissue features, render them difficult to predict. The capability to accurately classify TME subtypes is of critical significance for clinical tumor diagnosis and precision medicine. Based on the observation that tumors with different origins share similar microenvironment patterns, we propose PathoTME, a genomics-guided Siamese representation learning framework employing Whole Slide Image (WSI) for pan-cancer TME subtypes prediction. Specifically, we utilize Siamese network to leverage genomic information as a regularization factor to assist WSI embeddings learning during the training phase. Additionally, we employ Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) to mitigate the impact of tissue type variations. To eliminate domain bias, a dynamic WSI prompt is designed to further unleash the model's capabilities. Our model achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art methods across 23 cancer types on TCGA dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/Mengflz/PathoTME.

- **Summary**: This work tackles the challenges of data heterogeneity and communication limitations in decentralized federated learning. We focus on creating a collaboration graph that guides each client in selecting suitable collaborators for training personalized models that leverage their local data effectively. Our approach addresses these issues through a novel, communication-efficient strategy that enhances resource efficiency. Unlike traditional methods, our formulation identifies collaborators at a granular level by considering combinatorial relations of clients, enhancing personalization while minimizing communication overhead. We achieve this through a bi-level optimization framework that employs a constrained greedy algorithm, resulting in a resource-efficient collaboration graph for personalized learning. Extensive evaluation against various baselines across diverse datasets demonstrates the superiority of our method, named DPFL. DPFL consistently outperforms other approaches, showcasing its effectiveness in handling real-world data heterogeneity, minimizing communication overhead, enhancing resource efficiency, and building personalized models in decentralized federated learning scenarios.

- **Summary**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted widespread attention due to its high-quality rendering, and ultra-fast training and rendering speed. However, due to the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian point clouds, it is difficult to guarantee geometric reconstruction accuracy and multi-view consistency simply by relying on image reconstruction loss. Although many studies on surface reconstruction based on 3DGS have emerged recently, the quality of their meshes is generally unsatisfactory. To address this problem, we propose a fast planar-based Gaussian splatting reconstruction representation (PGSR) to achieve high-fidelity surface reconstruction while ensuring high-quality rendering. Specifically, we first introduce an unbiased depth rendering method, which directly renders the distance from the camera origin to the Gaussian plane and the corresponding normal map based on the Gaussian distribution of the point cloud, and divides the two to obtain the unbiased depth. We then introduce single-view geometric, multi-view photometric, and geometric regularization to preserve global geometric accuracy. We also propose a camera exposure compensation model to cope with scenes with large illumination variations. Experiments on indoor and outdoor scenes show that our method achieves fast training and rendering while maintaining high-fidelity rendering and geometric reconstruction, outperforming 3DGS-based and NeRF-based methods.

- **Summary**: We propose a video editing framework, NaRCan, which integrates a hybrid deformation field and diffusion prior to generate high-quality natural canonical images to represent the input video. Our approach utilizes homography to model global motion and employs multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to capture local residual deformations, enhancing the model's ability to handle complex video dynamics. By introducing a diffusion prior from the early stages of training, our model ensures that the generated images retain a high-quality natural appearance, making the produced canonical images suitable for various downstream tasks in video editing, a capability not achieved by current canonical-based methods. Furthermore, we incorporate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and introduce a noise and diffusion prior update scheduling technique that accelerates the training process by 14 times. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches in various video editing tasks and produces coherent and high-quality edited video sequences.

- **Summary**: We introduce LlamaGen, a new family of image generation models that apply original ``next-token prediction'' paradigm of large language models to visual generation domain. It is an affirmative answer to whether vanilla autoregressive models, e.g., Llama, without inductive biases on visual signals can achieve state-of-the-art image generation performance if scaling properly. We reexamine design spaces of image tokenizers, scalability properties of image generation models, and their training data quality. The outcome of this exploration consists of: (1) An image tokenizer with downsample ratio of 16, reconstruction quality of 0.94 rFID and codebook usage of 97% on ImageNet benchmark. (2) A series of class-conditional image generation models ranging from 111M to 3.1B parameters, achieving 2.18 FID on ImageNet 256x256 benchmarks, outperforming the popular diffusion models such as LDM, DiT. (3) A text-conditional image generation model with 775M parameters, from two-stage training on LAION-COCO and high aesthetics quality images, demonstrating competitive performance of visual quality and text alignment. (4) We verify the effectiveness of LLM serving frameworks in optimizing the inference speed of image generation models and achieve 326% - 414% speedup.

- **Summary**: 3D city generation with NeRF-based methods shows promising generation results but is computationally inefficient. Recently 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a highly efficient alternative for object-level 3D generation. However, adapting 3D-GS from finite-scale 3D objects and humans to infinite-scale 3D cities is non-trivial. Unbounded 3D city generation entails significant storage overhead (out-of-memory issues), arising from the need to expand points to billions, often demanding hundreds of Gigabytes of VRAM for a city scene spanning 10km^2. In this paper, we propose GaussianCity, a generative Gaussian Splatting framework dedicated to efficiently synthesizing unbounded 3D cities with a single feed-forward pass. Our key insights are two-fold: 1) Compact 3D Scene Representation: We introduce BEV-Point as a highly compact intermediate representation, ensuring that the growth in VRAM usage for unbounded scenes remains constant, thus enabling unbounded city generation. 2) Spatial-aware Gaussian Attribute Decoder: We present spatial-aware BEV-Point decoder to produce 3D Gaussian attributes, which leverages Point Serializer to integrate the structural and contextual characteristics of BEV points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GaussianCity achieves state-of-the-art results in both drone-view and street-view 3D city generation. Notably, compared to CityDreamer, GaussianCity exhibits superior performance with a speedup of 60 times (10.72 FPS v.s. 0.18 FPS).

- **Summary**: Existing methods for relightable view synthesis -- using a set of images of an object under unknown lighting to recover a 3D representation that can be rendered from novel viewpoints under a target illumination -- are based on inverse rendering, and attempt to disentangle the object geometry, materials, and lighting that explain the input images. Furthermore, this typically involves optimization through differentiable Monte Carlo rendering, which is brittle and computationally-expensive. In this work, we propose a simpler approach: we first relight each input image using an image diffusion model conditioned on lighting and then reconstruct a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) with these relit images, from which we render novel views under the target lighting. We demonstrate that this strategy is surprisingly competitive and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple relighting benchmarks. Please see our project page at https://illuminerf.github.io/.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces PatchRefiner, an advanced framework for metric single image depth estimation aimed at high-resolution real-domain inputs. While depth estimation is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving, 3D generative modeling, and 3D reconstruction, achieving accurate high-resolution depth in real-world scenarios is challenging due to the constraints of existing architectures and the scarcity of detailed real-world depth data. PatchRefiner adopts a tile-based methodology, reconceptualizing high-resolution depth estimation as a refinement process, which results in notable performance enhancements. Utilizing a pseudo-labeling strategy that leverages synthetic data, PatchRefiner incorporates a Detail and Scale Disentangling (DSD) loss to enhance detail capture while maintaining scale accuracy, thus facilitating the effective transfer of knowledge from synthetic to real-world data. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate PatchRefiner's superior performance, significantly outperforming existing benchmarks on the Unreal4KStereo dataset by 18.1% in terms of the root mean squared error (RMSE) and showing marked improvements in detail accuracy and consistent scale estimation on diverse real-world datasets like CityScape, ScanNet++, and ETH3D.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a simple yet effective strategy for exercise classification and muscle group activation prediction (MGAP). These tasks have significant implications for personal fitness, facilitating more affordable, accessible, safer, and simpler exercise routines. This is particularly relevant for novices and individuals with disabilities. Previous research in the field is mostly dominated by the reliance on mounted sensors and a limited scope of exercises, reducing practicality for everyday use. Furthermore, existing MGAP methodologies suffer from a similar dependency on sensors and a restricted range of muscle groups, often excluding strength training exercises, which are pivotal for a comprehensive fitness regimen. Addressing these limitations, our research employs a video-based deep learning framework that encompasses a broad spectrum of exercises and muscle groups, including those vital for strength training. Utilizing the "Workout/Exercises Video" dataset, our approach integrates the X3D and SlowFast video activity recognition models in an effective way to enhance exercise classification and MGAP performance. Our findings demonstrate that this hybrid method obtained via weighted ensemble outperforms existing baseline models in accuracy. Pretrained models play a crucial role in enhancing overall performance, with optimal channel reduction values for the SlowFast model identified near 10. Through an ablation study that explores fine-tuning, we further elucidate the interrelation between the two tasks. Our composite model, a weighted-average ensemble of X3D and SlowFast, sets a new benchmark in both exercise classification and MGAP across all evaluated categories, offering a robust solution to the limitations of previous approaches.

- **Summary**: Large multimodal language models have shown remarkable proficiency in understanding and editing images. However, a majority of these visually-tuned models struggle to comprehend the textual content embedded in images, primarily due to the limitation of training data. In this work, we introduce TRINS: a Text-Rich image INStruction dataset, with the objective of enhancing the reading ability of the multimodal large language model. TRINS is built upon LAION using hybrid data annotation strategies that include machine-assisted and human-assisted annotation processes. It contains 39,153 text-rich images, captions, and 102,437 questions. Specifically, we show that the number of words per annotation in TRINS is significantly longer than that of related datasets, providing new challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a simple and effective architecture, called a Language-vision Reading Assistant (LaRA), which is good at understanding textual content within images. LaRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art multimodal large language models on the TRINS dataset, as well as other classical benchmarks. Lastly, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation with TRINS on various text-rich image understanding and generation tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Spectral Unmixing is an important technique in remote sensing used to analyze hyperspectral images to identify endmembers and estimate abundance maps. Over the past few decades, performance of techniques for endmember extraction and fractional abundance map estimation have significantly improved. This article presents an ensemble model workflow called Autoencoder Graph Ensemble Model (AEGEM) designed to extract endmembers and fractional abundance maps. An elliptical kernel is applied to measure spectral distances, generating the adjacency matrix within the elliptical neighborhood. This information is used to construct an elliptical graph, with centroids as senders and remaining pixels within the geometry as receivers. The next step involves stacking abundance maps, senders, and receivers as inputs to a Graph Convolutional Network, which processes this input to refine abundance maps. Finally, an ensemble decision-making process determines the best abundance maps based on root mean square error metric. The proposed AEGEM is assessed with benchmark datasets such as Samson, Jasper, and Urban, outperforming results obtained by baseline algorithms. For the Samson dataset, AEGEM excels in three abundance maps: water, tree and soil yielding values of 0.081, 0.158, and 0.182, respectively. For the Jasper dataset, results are improved for the tree and water endmembers with values of 0.035 and 0.060 in that order, as well as for the mean average of the spectral angle distance metric 0.109. For the Urban dataset, AEGEM outperforms previous results for the abundance maps of roof and asphalt, achieving values of 0.135 and 0.240, respectively. Additionally, for the endmembers of grass and roof, AEGEM achieves values of 0.063 and 0.094.

- **Summary**: SeeFar is an evolving collection of multi-resolution satellite images from public and commercial satellites. We specifically curated this dataset for training geospatial foundation models, unconstrained by satellite type. In recent years, advances in technology have made satellite imagery more accessible than ever. More earth-observing satellites have been launched in the last five years than in the previous fifty. Modern commercial satellites now offer up to 100 times the spatial resolution of public access satellites. However, the high cost and limited historical availability of commercial satellite imagery is a barrier to the training of foundational models, impacting what images can be used during inference. The SeeFar dataset represents a step towards training models that are satellite-agnostic by combining multi-resolution commercial and public access pre-processed images. This will enable users to utilize historical data alongside higher-resolution, more expensive satellite imagery, offering greater flexibility during inference. To achieve this, we describe a process for standardizing data from diverse satellite sources, normalizing different data formats, and aligning spectral bands to enhance interoperability. The SeeFar dataset includes images at a resolution of 384x384 pixels, spanning four spectral bands (Blue, Green, Red, and Near-Infrared) and expanding spatial resolutions (starting with 30, 10, 1.5, and 1.0 meters), all in cloud-optimized GeoTIFF format. It also provides consistent and comprehensive metadata to enhance data transparency and reliability. By aggregating data from multiple sources, SeeFar makes processed and consistent satellite data accessible to a wider range of users - from researchers to policymakers - fostering competition and innovation in satellite imagery analysis.

- **Summary**: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) with their strong task-handling capabilities have shown remarkable advancements across a spectrum of fields, moving beyond natural language understanding. However, their proficiency within the chemistry domain remains restricted, especially in solving professional molecule-related tasks. This challenge is attributed to their inherent limitations in comprehending molecules using only common textual representations, i.e., SMILES strings. In this study, we seek to enhance the ability of LLMs to comprehend molecules by designing and equipping them with a multi-modal external module, namely MolX. In particular, instead of directly using a SMILES string to represent a molecule, we utilize specific encoders to extract fine-grained features from both SMILES string and 2D molecular graph representations for feeding into an LLM. Moreover, a human-defined molecular fingerprint is incorporated to leverage its embedded domain knowledge. Then, to establish an alignment between MolX and the LLM's textual input space, the whole model in which the LLM is frozen, is pre-trained with a versatile strategy including a diverse set of tasks. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed method only introduces a small number of trainable parameters while outperforming baselines on various downstream molecule-related tasks ranging from molecule-to-text translation to retrosynthesis, with and without fine-tuning the LLM.

- **Summary**: Localization is a critical technology for various applications ranging from navigation and surveillance to assisted living. Localization systems typically fuse information from sensors viewing the scene from different perspectives to estimate the target location while also employing multiple modalities for enhanced robustness and accuracy. Recently, such systems have employed end-to-end deep neural models trained on large datasets due to their superior performance and ability to handle data from diverse sensor modalities. However, such neural models are often trained on data collected from a particular set of sensor poses (i.e., locations and orientations). During real-world deployments, slight deviations from these sensor poses can result in extreme inaccuracies. To address this challenge, we introduce FlexLoc, which employs conditional neural networks to inject node perspective information to adapt the localization pipeline. Specifically, a small subset of model weights are derived from node poses at run time, enabling accurate generalization to unseen perspectives with minimal additional overhead. Our evaluations on a multimodal, multiview indoor tracking dataset showcase that FlexLoc improves the localization accuracy by almost 50% in the zero-shot case (no calibration data available) compared to the baselines. The source code of FlexLoc is available at https://github.com/nesl/FlexLoc.

- **Journal**: (2024 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)
- **Summary**: We study source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) for semantic segmentation, which aims to adapt a source-trained model to the target domain without accessing the source data. Many works have been proposed to address this challenging problem, among which uncertainty-based self-training is a predominant approach. However, without comprehensive denoising mechanisms, they still largely fall into biased estimates when dealing with different domains and confirmation bias. In this paper, we observe that pseudo-label noise is mainly contained in unstable samples in which the predictions of most pixels undergo significant variations during self-training. Inspired by this, we propose a novel mechanism to denoise unstable samples with stable ones. Specifically, we introduce the Stable Neighbor Denoising (SND) approach, which effectively discovers highly correlated stable and unstable samples by nearest neighbor retrieval and guides the reliable optimization of unstable samples by bi-level learning. Moreover, we compensate for the stable set by object-level object paste, which can further eliminate the bias caused by less learned classes. Our SND enjoys two advantages. First, SND does not require a specific segmentor structure, endowing its universality. Second, SND simultaneously addresses the issues of class, domain, and confirmation biases during adaptation, ensuring its effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that SND consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various SFUDA semantic segmentation settings. In addition, SND can be easily integrated with other approaches, obtaining further improvements.

- **Summary**: Adapters provide an efficient and lightweight mechanism for adapting trained transformer models to a variety of different tasks. However, they have often been found to be outperformed by other adaptation mechanisms, including low-rank adaptation. In this paper, we provide an in-depth study of adapters, their internal structure, as well as various implementation choices. We uncover pitfalls for using adapters and suggest a concrete, improved adapter architecture, called Adapter+, that not only outperforms previous adapter implementations but surpasses a number of other, more complex adaptation mechanisms in several challenging settings. Despite this, our suggested adapter is highly robust and, unlike previous work, requires little to no manual intervention when addressing a novel scenario. Adapter+ reaches state-of-the-art average accuracy on the VTAB benchmark, even without a per-task hyperparameter optimization.

- **Summary**: We introduce a data capture system and a new dataset named HO-Cap that can be used to study 3D reconstruction and pose tracking of hands and objects in videos. The capture system uses multiple RGB-D cameras and a HoloLens headset for data collection, avoiding the use of expensive 3D scanners or mocap systems. We propose a semi-automatic method to obtain annotations of shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, which significantly reduces the required annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans using objects to perform different tasks, as well as simple pick-and-place and handover of an object from one hand to the other, which can be used as human demonstrations for embodied AI and robot manipulation research. Our data capture setup and annotation framework can be used by the community to reconstruct 3D shapes of objects and human hands and track their poses in videos.

- **Summary**: Synthesizing Chinese characters with consistent style using few stylized examples is challenging. Existing models struggle to generate arbitrary style characters with limited examples. In this paper, we propose the Generalized W-Net, a novel class of W-shaped architectures that addresses this. By incorporating Adaptive Instance Normalization and introducing multi-content, our approach can synthesize Chinese characters in any desired style, even with limited examples. It handles seen and unseen styles during training and can generate new character contents. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose a novel supervised contrastive loss that enables the integration of taxonomic hierarchy information during the representation learning process. A supervised contrastive loss operates by enforcing that images with the same class label (positive samples) project closer to each other than images with differing class labels (negative samples). The advantage of this approach is that it directly penalizes the structure of the representation space itself. This enables greater flexibility with respect to encoding semantic concepts. However, the standard supervised contrastive loss only enforces semantic structure based on the downstream task (i.e. the class label). In reality, the class label is only one level of a \emph{hierarchy of different semantic relationships known as a taxonomy}. For example, the class label is oftentimes the species of an animal, but between different classes there are higher order relationships such as all animals with wings being ``birds". We show that by explicitly accounting for these relationships with a weighting penalty in the contrastive loss we can out-perform the supervised contrastive loss. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of the notion of a taxonomy by integrating our loss into medical and noise-based settings that show performance improvements by as much as 7%.
