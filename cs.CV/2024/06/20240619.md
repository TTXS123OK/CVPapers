- **Summary**: Accurately segmenting brain tumors from MRI scans is important for developing effective treatment plans and improving patient outcomes. This study introduces a new implementation of the Columbia-University-Net (CU-Net) architecture for brain tumor segmentation using the BraTS 2019 dataset. The CU-Net model has a symmetrical U-shaped structure and uses convolutional layers, max pooling, and upsampling operations to achieve high-resolution segmentation. Our CU-Net model achieved a Dice score of 82.41%, surpassing two other state-of-the-art models. This improvement in segmentation accuracy highlights the robustness and effectiveness of the model, which helps to accurately delineate tumor boundaries, which is crucial for surgical planning and radiation therapy, and ultimately has the potential to improve patient outcomes.

- **Summary**: Video language continual learning involves continuously adapting to information from video and text inputs, enhancing a model's ability to handle new tasks while retaining prior knowledge. This field is a relatively under-explored area, and establishing appropriate datasets is crucial for facilitating communication and research in this field. In this study, we present the first dedicated benchmark, ViLCo-Bench, designed to evaluate continual learning models across a range of video-text tasks. The dataset comprises ten-minute-long videos and corresponding language queries collected from publicly available datasets. Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-efficient framework that incorporates self-supervised learning and mimics long-term and short-term memory effects. This framework addresses challenges including memory complexity from long video clips, natural language complexity from open queries, and text-video misalignment. We posit that ViLCo-Bench, with greater complexity compared to existing continual learning benchmarks, would serve as a critical tool for exploring the video-language domain, extending beyond conventional class-incremental tasks, and addressing complex and limited annotation issues. The curated data, evaluations, and our novel method are available at https://github.com/cruiseresearchgroup/ViLCo .

- **Summary**: Effectively representing medical images, especially retinal images, presents a considerable challenge due to variations in appearance, size, and contextual information of pathological signs called lesions. Precise discrimination of these lesions is crucial for diagnosing vision-threatening issues such as diabetic retinopathy. While visual attention-based neural networks have been introduced to learn spatial context and channel correlations from retinal images, they often fall short in capturing localized lesion context. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel attention mechanism called Guided Context Gating, an unique approach that integrates Context Formulation, Channel Correlation, and Guided Gating to learn global context, spatial correlations, and localized lesion context. Our qualitative evaluation against existing attention mechanisms emphasize the superiority of Guided Context Gating in terms of explainability. Notably, experiments on the Zenodo-DR-7 dataset reveal a substantial 2.63% accuracy boost over advanced attention mechanisms & an impressive 6.53% improvement over the state-of-the-art Vision Transformer for assessing the severity grade of retinopathy, even with imbalanced and limited training samples for each class.



### A New Approach for Evaluating and Improving the Performance of Segmentation Algorithms on Hard-to-Detect Blood Vessels

- **Summary**: Many studies regarding the vasculature of biological tissues involve the segmentation of the blood vessels in a sample followed by the creation of a graph structure to model the vasculature. The graph is then used to extract relevant vascular properties. Small segmentation errors can lead to largely distinct connectivity patterns and a high degree of variability of the extracted properties. Nevertheless, global metrics such as Dice, precision, and recall are commonly applied for measuring the performance of blood vessel segmentation algorithms. These metrics might conceal important information about the accuracy at specific regions of a sample. To tackle this issue, we propose a local vessel salience (LVS) index to quantify the expected difficulty in segmenting specific blood vessel segments. The LVS index is calculated for each vessel pixel by comparing the local intensity of the vessel with the image background around the pixel. The index is then used for defining a new accuracy metric called low-salience recall (LSRecall), which quantifies the performance of segmentation algorithms on blood vessel segments having low salience. The perspective provided by the LVS index is used to define a data augmentation procedure that can be used to improve the segmentation performance of convolutional neural networks. We show that segmentation algorithms having high Dice and recall values can display very low LSRecall values, which reveals systematic errors of these algorithms for vessels having low salience. The proposed data augmentation procedure is able to improve the LSRecall of some samples by as much as 25%. The developed methodology opens up new possibilities for comparing the performance of segmentation algorithms regarding hard-to-detect blood vessels as well as their capabilities for vascular topology preservation.

- **Summary**: Automated retinal image medical description generation is crucial for streamlining medical diagnosis and treatment planning. Existing challenges include the reliance on learned retinal image representations, difficulties in handling multiple imaging modalities, and the lack of clinical context in visual representations. Addressing these issues, we propose the Multi-Modal Medical Transformer (M3T), a novel deep learning architecture that integrates visual representations with diagnostic keywords. Unlike previous studies focusing on specific aspects, our approach efficiently learns contextual information and semantics from both modalities, enabling the generation of precise and coherent medical descriptions for retinal images. Experimental studies on the DeepEyeNet dataset validate the success of M3T in meeting ophthalmologists' standards, demonstrating a substantial 13.5% improvement in BLEU@4 over the best-performing baseline model.

- **Summary**: Remote physiological measurement (RPM) is an essential tool for healthcare monitoring as it enables the measurement of physiological signs, e.g., heart rate, in a remote setting via physical wearables. Recently, with facial videos, we have seen rapid advancements in video-based RPMs. However, adopting facial videos for RPM in the clinical setting largely depends on the accuracy and robustness (work across patient populations). Fortunately, the capability of the state-of-the-art transformer architecture in general (natural) video understanding has resulted in marked improvements and has been translated to facial understanding, including RPM. However, existing RPM methods usually need RPM-specific modules, e.g., temporal difference convolution and handcrafted feature maps. Although these customized modules can increase accuracy, they are not demonstrated for their robustness across datasets. Further, due to their customization of the transformer architecture, they cannot use the advancements made in general video transformers (GVT). In this study, we interrogate the GVT architecture and empirically analyze how the training designs, i.e., data pre-processing and network configurations, affect the model performance applied to RPM. Based on the structure of video transformers, we propose to configure its spatiotemporal hierarchy to align with the dense temporal information needed in RPM for signal feature extraction. We define several practical guidelines and gradually adapt GVTs for RPM without introducing RPM-specific modules. Our experiments demonstrate favorable results to existing RPM-specific module counterparts. We conducted extensive experiments with five datasets using intra-dataset and cross-dataset settings. We highlight that the proposed guidelines GVT2RPM can be generalized to any video transformers and is robust to various datasets.

- **Summary**: Recent 3D face reconstruction methods have made significant progress in shape estimation, but high-fidelity facial albedo reconstruction remains challenging. Existing methods depend on expensive light-stage captured data to learn facial albedo maps. However, a lack of diversity in subjects limits their ability to recover high-fidelity results. In this paper, we present a novel facial albedo reconstruction model, HiFiAlbedo, which recovers the albedo map directly from a single image without the need for captured albedo data. Our key insight is that the albedo map is the illumination invariant texture map, which enables us to use inexpensive texture data to derive an albedo estimation by eliminating illumination. To achieve this, we first collect large-scale ultra-high-resolution facial images and train a high-fidelity facial texture codebook. By using the FFHQ dataset and limited UV textures, we then fine-tune the encoder for texture reconstruction from the input image with adversarial supervision in both image and UV space. Finally, we train a cross-attention module and utilize group identity loss to learn the adaptation from facial texture to the albedo domain. Extensive experimentation has demonstrated that our method exhibits excellent generalizability and is capable of achieving high-fidelity results for in-the-wild facial albedo recovery. Our code, pre-trained weights, and training data will be made publicly available at https://hifialbedo.github.io/.

- **Summary**: Radiation hazards associated with standard-dose positron emission tomography (SPET) images remain a concern, whereas the quality of low-dose PET (LPET) images fails to meet clinical requirements. Therefore, there is great interest in reconstructing SPET images from LPET images. However, prior studies focus solely on image data, neglecting vital complementary information from other modalities, e.g., patients' clinical tabular, resulting in compromised reconstruction with limited diagnostic utility. Moreover, they often overlook the semantic consistency between real SPET and reconstructed images, leading to distorted semantic contexts. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Multi-modal Conditioned Adversarial Diffusion model (MCAD) to reconstruct SPET images from multi-modal inputs, including LPET images and clinical tabular. Specifically, our MCAD incorporates a Multi-modal conditional Encoder (Mc-Encoder) to extract multi-modal features, followed by a conditional diffusion process to blend noise with multi-modal features and gradually map blended features to the target SPET images. To balance multi-modal inputs, the Mc-Encoder embeds Optimal Multi-modal Transport co-Attention (OMTA) to narrow the heterogeneity gap between image and tabular while capturing their interactions, providing sufficient guidance for reconstruction. In addition, to mitigate semantic distortions, we introduce the Multi-Modal Masked Text Reconstruction (M3TRec), which leverages semantic knowledge extracted from denoised PET images to restore the masked clinical tabular, thereby compelling the network to maintain accurate semantics during reconstruction. To expedite the diffusion process, we further introduce an adversarial diffusive network with a reduced number of diffusion steps. Experiments show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes the first pure Transformer structure inversion network called SwinStyleformer, which can compensate for the shortcomings of the CNNs inversion framework by handling long-range dependencies and learning the global structure of objects. Experiments found that the inversion network with the Transformer backbone could not successfully invert the image. The above phenomena arise from the differences between CNNs and Transformers, such as the self-attention weights favoring image structure ignoring image details compared to convolution, the lack of multi-scale properties of Transformer, and the distribution differences between the latent code extracted by the Transformer and the StyleGAN style vector. To address these differences, we employ the Swin Transformer with a smaller window size as the backbone of the SwinStyleformer to enhance the local detail of the inversion image. Meanwhile, we design a Transformer block based on learnable queries. Compared to the self-attention transformer block, the Transformer block based on learnable queries provides greater adaptability and flexibility, enabling the model to update the attention weights according to specific tasks. Thus, the inversion focus is not limited to the image structure. To further introduce multi-scale properties, we design multi-scale connections in the extraction of feature maps. Multi-scale connections allow the model to gain a comprehensive understanding of the image to avoid loss of detail due to global modeling. Moreover, we propose an inversion discriminator and distribution alignment loss to minimize the distribution differences. Based on the above designs, our SwinStyleformer successfully solves the Transformer's inversion failure issue and demonstrates SOTA performance in image inversion and several related vision tasks.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce the Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Convolutional KANs), an innovative alternative to the standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that have revolutionized the field of computer vision. We integrate the non-linear activation functions presented in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into convolutions to build a new layer. Throughout the paper, we empirically validate the performance of Convolutional KANs against traditional architectures across MNIST and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks, illustrating that this new approach maintains a similar level of accuracy while using half the amount of parameters. This significant reduction of parameters opens up a new approach to advance the optimization of neural network architectures.

- **Summary**: In recent years, California's electrical grid has confronted mounting challenges stemming from aging infrastructure and a landscape increasingly susceptible to wildfires. This paper presents a comprehensive framework utilizing computer vision techniques to address wildfire risk within the state's electrical grid, with a particular focus on vulnerable utility poles. These poles are susceptible to fire outbreaks or structural failure during extreme weather events. The proposed pipeline harnesses readily available Google Street View imagery to identify utility poles and assess their proximity to surrounding vegetation, as well as to determine any inclination angles. The early detection of potential risks associated with utility poles is pivotal for forestalling wildfire ignitions and informing strategic investments, such as undergrounding vulnerable poles and powerlines. Moreover, this study underscores the significance of data-driven decision-making in bolstering grid resilience, particularly concerning Public Safety Power Shutoffs. By fostering collaboration among utilities, policymakers, and researchers, this pipeline aims to solidify the electric grid's resilience and safeguard communities against the escalating threat of wildfires.

- **Summary**: Echocardiography is the only technique capable of real-time imaging of the heart and is vital for diagnosing the majority of cardiac diseases. However, there is a severe shortage of experienced cardiac sonographers, due to the heart's complex structure and significant operational challenges. To mitigate this situation, we present a Cardiac Copilot system capable of providing real-time probe movement guidance to assist less experienced sonographers in conducting freehand echocardiography. This system can enable non-experts, especially in primary departments and medically underserved areas, to perform cardiac ultrasound examinations, potentially improving global healthcare delivery. The core innovation lies in proposing a data-driven world model, named Cardiac Dreamer, for representing cardiac spatial structures. This world model can provide structure features of any cardiac planes around the current probe position in the latent space, serving as an precise navigation map for autonomous plane localization. We train our model with real-world ultrasound data and corresponding probe motion from 110 routine clinical scans with 151K sample pairs by three certified sonographers. Evaluations on three standard planes with 37K sample pairs demonstrate that the world model can reduce navigation errors by up to 33\% and exhibit more stable performance.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in multimodal foundation models have showcased impressive capabilities in understanding and reasoning with visual and textual information. Adapting these foundation models trained for general usage to specialized domains like biomedicine requires large-scale domain-specific instruction datasets. While existing works have explored curating such datasets automatically, the resultant datasets are not explicitly aligned with domain expertise. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework, Biomedical Visual Instruction Tuning with Clinician Preference Alignment (BioMed-VITAL), that incorporates clinician preferences into both stages of generating and selecting instruction data for tuning biomedical multimodal foundation models. First, during the generation stage, we prompt the GPT-4V generator with a diverse set of clinician-selected demonstrations for preference-aligned data candidate generation. Then, during the selection phase, we train a separate selection model, which explicitly distills clinician and policy-guided model preferences into a rating function to select high-quality data for medical instruction tuning. Results show that the model tuned with the instruction-following data from our method demonstrates a significant improvement in open visual chat (18.5% relatively) and medical VQA (win rate up to 81.73%). Our instruction-following data and models are available at BioMed-VITAL.github.io.

- **Summary**: Robust Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (RoUDA) aims to achieve not only clean but also robust cross-domain knowledge transfer from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. A number of works have been conducted by directly injecting adversarial training (AT) in UDA based on the self-training pipeline and then aiming to generate better adversarial examples (AEs) for AT. Despite the remarkable progress, these methods only focus on finding stronger AEs but neglect how to better learn from these AEs, thus leading to unsatisfied results. In this paper, we investigate robust UDA from a representation learning perspective and design a novel algorithm by utilizing the mutual information theory, dubbed MIRoUDA. Specifically, through mutual information optimization, MIRoUDA is designed to achieve three characteristics that are highly expected in robust UDA, i.e., robustness, discrimination, and generalization. We then propose a dual-model framework accordingly for robust UDA learning. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks verify the effectiveness of the proposed MIRoUDA, in which our method surpasses the state-of-the-arts by a large margin.

- **Summary**: This study investigates the integration of diverse patient data sources into multimodal language models for automated chest X-ray (CXR) report generation. Traditionally, CXR report generation relies solely on CXR images and limited radiology data, overlooking valuable information from patient health records, particularly from emergency departments. Utilising the MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-IV-ED datasets, we incorporate detailed patient information such as aperiodic vital signs, medications, and clinical history to enhance diagnostic accuracy. We introduce a novel approach to transform these heterogeneous data sources into embeddings that prompt a multimodal language model, significantly enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of generated radiology reports. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the benefits of using a broader set of patient data, underscoring the potential for enhanced diagnostic capabilities and better patient outcomes through the integration of multimodal data in CXR report generation.

- **Summary**: The 3D simulation model of the lung was established by using the reconstruction method. A computer aided pulmonary nodule detection model was constructed. The process iterates over the images to refine the lung nodule recognition model based on neural networks. It is integrated with 3D virtual modeling technology to improve the interactivity of the system, so as to achieve intelligent recognition of lung nodules. A 3D RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) was utilized for feature extraction and nodule identification. The LUNA16 large sample database was used as the research dataset. FROC (Free-response Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis was applied to evaluate the model, calculating sensitivity at various false positive rates to derive the average FROC. Compared with conventional diagnostic methods, the recognition rate was significantly improved. This technique facilitates the detection of pulmonary abnormalities at an initial phase, which holds immense value for the prompt diagnosis of lung malignancies.

- **Summary**: Text spotting has seen tremendous progress in recent years yielding performant techniques which can extract text at the character, word or line level. However, extracting blocks of text from images (block-level text spotting) is relatively unexplored. Blocks contain more context than individual lines, words or characters and so block-level text spotting would enhance downstream applications, such as translation, which benefit from added context. We propose a novel method, BTS-LLM (Block-level Text Spotting with LLMs), to identify text at the block level. BTS-LLM has three parts: 1) detecting and recognizing text at the line level, 2) grouping lines into blocks and 3) finding the best order of lines within a block using a large language model (LLM). We aim to exploit the strong semantic knowledge in LLMs for accurate block-level text spotting. Consequently if the text spotted is semantically meaningful but has been corrupted during text recognition, the LLM is also able to rectify mistakes in the text and produce a reconstruction of it.

- **Summary**: Fiber orientation distributions (FODs) is a popular model to represent the diffusion MRI (dMRI) data. However, imaging artifacts such as susceptibility-induced distortion in dMRI can cause signal loss and lead to the corrupted reconstruction of FODs, which prohibits successful fiber tracking and connectivity analysis in affected brain regions such as the brain stem. Generative models, such as the diffusion models, have been successfully applied in various image restoration tasks. However, their application on FOD images poses unique challenges since FODs are 4-dimensional data represented by spherical harmonics (SPHARM) with the 4-th dimension exhibiting order-related dependency. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model for FOD restoration that can recover the signal loss caused by distortion artifacts. We use volume-order encoding to enhance the ability of the diffusion model to generate individual FOD volumes at all SPHARM orders. Moreover, we add cross-attention features extracted across all SPHARM orders in generating every individual FOD volume to capture the order-related dependency across FOD volumes. We also condition the diffusion model with low-distortion FODs surrounding high-distortion areas to maintain the geometric coherence of the generated FODs. We trained and tested our model using data from the UK Biobank (n = 1315). On a test set with ground truth (n = 43), we demonstrate the high accuracy of the generated FODs in terms of root mean square errors of FOD volumes and angular errors of FOD peaks. We also apply our method to a test set with large distortion in the brain stem area (n = 1172) and demonstrate the efficacy of our method in restoring the FOD integrity and, hence, greatly improving tractography performance in affected brain regions.

- **Summary**: Surgical triplet recognition is an essential building block to enable next-generation context-aware operating rooms. The goal is to identify the combinations of instruments, verbs, and targets presented in surgical video frames. In this paper, we propose DiffTriplet, a new generative framework for surgical triplet recognition employing the diffusion model, which predicts surgical triplets via iterative denoising. To handle the challenge of triplet association, two unique designs are proposed in our diffusion framework, i.e., association learning and association guidance. During training, we optimize the model in the joint space of triplets and individual components to capture the dependencies among them. At inference, we integrate association constraints into each update of the iterative denoising process, which refines the triplet prediction using the information of individual components. Experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets show the superiority of the proposed method in achieving a new state-of-the-art performance for surgical triplet recognition. Our codes will be released.

- **Summary**: The most advanced diffusion models have recently adopted increasingly deep stacked networks (e.g., U-Net or Transformer) to promote the generative emergence capabilities of vision generation models similar to large language models (LLMs). However, progressively deeper stacked networks will intuitively cause numerical propagation errors and reduce noisy prediction capabilities on generative data, which hinders massively deep scalable training of vision generation models. In this paper, we first uncover the nature that neural networks being able to effectively perform generative denoising lies in the fact that the intrinsic residual unit has consistent dynamic property with the input signal's reverse diffusion process, thus supporting excellent generative abilities. Afterwards, we stand on the shoulders of two common types of deep stacked networks to propose a unified and massively scalable Neural Residual Diffusion Models framework (Neural-RDM for short), which is a simple yet meaningful change to the common architecture of deep generative networks by introducing a series of learnable gated residual parameters that conform to the generative dynamics. Experimental results on various generative tasks show that the proposed neural residual models obtain state-of-the-art scores on image's and video's generative benchmarks. Rigorous theoretical proofs and extensive experiments also demonstrate the advantages of this simple gated residual mechanism consistent with dynamic modeling in improving the fidelity and consistency of generated content and supporting large-scale scalable training.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are prone to non-factual or outdated knowledge issues, which can manifest as misreading and misrecognition errors due to the complexity of multimodal knowledge. Previous benchmarks have not systematically analyzed the performance of editing methods in correcting these two error types. To better represent and correct these errors, we decompose multimodal knowledge into its visual and textual components. Different error types correspond to different editing formats, which edits distinct part of the multimodal knowledge. We present MC-MKE, a fine-grained Multimodal Knowledge Editing benchmark emphasizing Modality Consistency. Our benchmark facilitates independent correction of misreading and misrecognition errors by editing the corresponding knowledge component. We evaluate three multimodal knowledge editing methods on MC-MKE, revealing their limitations, particularly in terms of modality consistency. Our work highlights the challenges posed by multimodal knowledge editing and motivates further research in developing effective techniques for this task.

- **Summary**: Face retouching aims to remove facial blemishes, such as pigmentation and acne, and still retain fine-grain texture details. Nevertheless, existing methods just remove the blemishes but focus little on realism of the intermediate process, limiting their use more to beautifying facial images on social media rather than being effective tools for simulating changes in facial pigmentation and ance. Motivated by this limitation, we propose our Controllable and Gradual Face Retouching (CGFR). Our CGFR is based on physical modelling, adopting Sum-of-Gaussians to approximate skin subsurface scattering in a decomposed melanin and haemoglobin color space. Our CGFR offers a user-friendly control over the facial blemishes, achieving realistic and gradual blemishes retouching. Experimental results based on actual clinical data shows that CGFR can realistically simulate the blemishes' gradual recovering process.

- **Summary**: Pixel-level dense labeling is both resource-intensive and time-consuming, whereas weak labels such as scribble present a more feasible alternative to full annotations. However, training segmentation networks with weak supervision from scribbles remains challenging. Inspired by the fact that different segmentation tasks can be correlated with each other, we introduce a new approach to few-scribble supervised segmentation based on model parameter interpolation, termed as ModelMix. Leveraging the prior knowledge that linearly interpolating convolution kernels and bias terms should result in linear interpolations of the corresponding feature vectors, ModelMix constructs virtual models using convex combinations of convolutional parameters from separate encoders. We then regularize the model set to minimize vicinal risk across tasks in both unsupervised and scribble-supervised way. Validated on three open datasets, i.e., ACDC, MSCMRseg, and MyoPS, our few-scribble guided ModelMix significantly surpasses the performance of the state-of-the-art scribble supervised methods.

- **Summary**: The ability to understand and reason about spatial relationships between objects in images is an important component of visual reasoning. This skill rests on the ability to recognize and localize objects of interest and determine their spatial relation. Early vision and language models (VLMs) have been shown to struggle to recognize spatial relations. We extend the previously released What'sUp dataset and propose a novel comprehensive evaluation for spatial relationship understanding that highlights the strengths and weaknesses of 27 different models. In addition to the VLMs evaluated in What'sUp, our extensive evaluation encompasses 3 classes of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that vary in their parameter sizes (ranging from 7B to 110B), training/instruction-tuning methods, and visual resolution to benchmark their performances and scrutinize the scaling laws in this task.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable success in representing 3D scenes and generating novel views. However, they often struggle with aliasing artifacts, especially when rendering images from different camera distances from the training views. To address the issue, Mip-NeRF proposed using volumetric frustums to render a pixel and suggested integrated positional encoding (IPE). While effective, this approach requires long training times due to its reliance on MLP architecture. In this work, we propose a novel anti-aliasing technique that utilizes grid-based representations, usually showing significantly faster training time. In addition, we exploit frequency-domain representation to handle the aliasing problem inspired by the sampling theorem. The proposed method, FreqMipAA, utilizes scale-specific low-pass filtering (LPF) and learnable frequency masks. Scale-specific low-pass filters (LPF) prevent aliasing and prioritize important image details, and learnable masks effectively remove problematic high-frequency elements while retaining essential information. By employing a scale-specific LPF and trainable masks, FreqMipAA can effectively eliminate the aliasing factor while retaining important details. We validated the proposed technique by incorporating it into a widely used grid-based method. The experimental results have shown that the FreqMipAA effectively resolved the aliasing issues and achieved state-of-the-art results in the multi-scale Blender dataset.

- **Summary**: Challenges persist in providing interpretable explanations for neural network reasoning in explainable AI (xAI). Existing methods like Integrated Gradients produce noisy maps, and LIME, while intuitive, may deviate from the model's reasoning. We introduce a framework that uses hierarchical segmentation techniques for faithful and interpretable explanations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our method constructs model-based hierarchical segmentations that maintain the model's reasoning fidelity and allows both human-centric and model-centric segmentation. This approach offers multiscale explanations, aiding bias identification and enhancing understanding of neural network decision-making. Experiments show that our framework, xAiTrees, delivers highly interpretable and faithful model explanations, not only surpassing traditional xAI methods but shedding new light on a novel approach to enhancing xAI interpretability.

- **Summary**: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) aims to detect and associate all targets of given classes across frames. Current dominant solutions, e.g. ByteTrack and StrongSORT++, follow the hybrid pipeline, which first accomplish most of the associations in an online manner, and then refine the results using offline tricks such as interpolation and global link. While this paradigm offers flexibility in application, the disjoint design between the two stages results in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical IoU Tracking framework, dubbed HIT, which achieves unified hierarchical tracking by utilizing tracklet intervals as priors. To ensure the conciseness, only IoU is utilized for association, while discarding the heavy appearance models, tricky auxiliary cues, and learning-based association modules. We further identify three inconsistency issues regarding target size, camera movement and hierarchical cues, and design corresponding solutions to guarantee the reliability of associations. Though its simplicity, our method achieves promising performance on four datasets, i.e., MOT17, KITTI, DanceTrack and VisDrone, providing a strong baseline for future tracking method design. Moreover, we experiment on seven trackers and prove that HIT can be seamlessly integrated with other solutions, whether they are motion-based, appearance-based or learning-based. Our codes will be released at https://github.com/dyhBUPT/HIT.

- **Summary**: Face reenactment refers to the process of transferring the pose and facial expressions from a reference (driving) video onto a static facial (source) image while maintaining the original identity of the source image. Previous research in this domain has made significant progress by training controllable deep generative models to generate faces based on specific identity, pose and expression conditions. However, the mechanisms used in these methods to control pose and expression often inadvertently introduce identity information from the driving video, while also causing a loss of expression-related details. This paper proposes a new method based on Stable Diffusion, called AniFaceDiff, incorporating a new conditioning module for high-fidelity face reenactment. First, we propose an enhanced 2D facial snapshot conditioning approach by facial shape alignment to prevent the inclusion of identity information from the driving video. Then, we introduce an expression adapter conditioning mechanism to address the potential loss of expression-related information. Our approach effectively preserves pose and expression fidelity from the driving video while retaining the identity and fine details of the source image. Through experiments on the VoxCeleb dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in face reenactment, showcasing superior image quality, identity preservation, and expression accuracy, especially for cross-identity scenarios. Considering the ethical concerns surrounding potential misuse, we analyze the implications of our method, evaluate current state-of-the-art deepfake detectors, and identify their shortcomings to guide future research.

- **Summary**: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is vital for autonomous driving. Despite the importance, existing LLIE methods often prioritize robustness in overall brightness adjustment, which can come at the expense of detail preservation. To overcome this limitation,we propose the Hierarchical Mutual Enhancement via Cross-Attention transformer (ECAFormer), a novel network that utilizes Dual Multi-head Self Attention (DMSA) to enhance both visual and semantic features across scales, significantly preserving details during the process. The cross-attention mechanism in ECAFormer not only improves upon traditional enhancement techniques but also excels in maintaining a balance between global brightness adjustment and local detail retention. Our extensive experimental validation on renowned low-illumination datasets, including SID and LOL, and additional tests on dark road scenarios. or performance over existing methods in terms of illumination enhancement and noise reduction, while also optimizing computational complexity and parameter count, further boosting SSIM and PSNR metrics.

- **Summary**: Sequential decision-making can be formulated as a text-conditioned video generation problem, where a video planner, guided by a text-defined goal, generates future frames visualizing planned actions, from which control actions are subsequently derived. In this work, we introduce Active Region Video Diffusion for Universal Policies (ARDuP), a novel framework for video-based policy learning that emphasizes the generation of active regions, i.e. potential interaction areas, enhancing the conditional policy's focus on interactive areas critical for task execution. This innovative framework integrates active region conditioning with latent diffusion models for video planning and employs latent representations for direct action decoding during inverse dynamic modeling. By utilizing motion cues in videos for automatic active region discovery, our method eliminates the need for manual annotations of active regions. We validate ARDuP's efficacy via extensive experiments on simulator CLIPort and the real-world dataset BridgeData v2, achieving notable improvements in success rates and generating convincingly realistic video plans.

- **Summary**: The process of segmenting point cloud data into several homogeneous areas with points in the same region having the same attributes is known as 3D segmentation. Segmentation is challenging with point cloud data due to substantial redundancy, fluctuating sample density and lack of apparent organization. The research area has a wide range of robotics applications, including intelligent vehicles, autonomous mapping and navigation. A number of researchers have introduced various methodologies and algorithms. Deep learning has been successfully used to a spectrum of 2D vision domains as a prevailing A.I. methods. However, due to the specific problems of processing point clouds with deep neural networks, deep learning on point clouds is still in its initial stages. This study examines many strategies that have been presented to 3D instance and semantic segmentation and gives a complete assessment of current developments in deep learning-based 3D segmentation. In these approaches benefits, draw backs, and design mechanisms are studied and addressed. This study evaluates the impact of various segmentation algorithms on competitiveness on various publicly accessible datasets, as well as the most often used pipelines, their advantages and limits, insightful findings and intriguing future research directions.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel framework to reinforce classification models using language-guided generated counterfactual images. Deep learning classification models are often trained using datasets that mirror real-world scenarios. In this training process, because learning is based solely on correlations with labels, there is a risk that models may learn spurious relationships, such as an overreliance on features not central to the subject, like background elements in images. However, due to the black-box nature of the decision-making process in deep learning models, identifying and addressing these vulnerabilities has been particularly challenging. We introduce a novel framework for reinforcing the classification models, which consists of a two-stage process. First, we identify model weaknesses by testing the model using the counterfactual image dataset, which is generated by perturbed image captions. Subsequently, we employ the counterfactual images as an augmented dataset to fine-tune and reinforce the classification model. Through extensive experiments on several classification models across various datasets, we revealed that fine-tuning with a small set of counterfactual images effectively strengthens the model.

- **Summary**: Marine fog poses a significant hazard to global shipping, necessitating effective detection and forecasting to reduce economic losses. In recent years, several machine learning (ML) methods have demonstrated superior detection accuracy compared to traditional meteorological methods. However, most of these works are developed on proprietary datasets, and the few publicly accessible datasets are often limited to simplistic toy scenarios for research purposes. To advance the field, we have collected nearly a decade's worth of multi-modal data related to continuous marine fog stages from four series of geostationary meteorological satellites, along with meteorological observations and numerical analysis, covering 15 marine regions globally where maritime fog frequently occurs. Through pixel-level manual annotation by meteorological experts, we present the most comprehensive marine fog detection and forecasting dataset to date, named M4Fog, to bridge ocean and atmosphere. The dataset comprises 68,000 "super data cubes" along four dimensions: elements, latitude, longitude and time, with a temporal resolution of half an hour and a spatial resolution of 1 kilometer. Considering practical applications, we have defined and explored three meaningful tracks with multi-metric evaluation systems: static or dynamic marine fog detection, and spatio-temporal forecasting for cloud images. Extensive benchmarking and experiments demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of the construction concept for proposed M4Fog. The data and codes are available to whole researchers through cloud platforms to develop ML-driven marine fog solutions and mitigate adverse impacts on human activities.

- **Summary**: While remarkable progress has been made on supervised skeleton-based action recognition, the challenge of zero-shot recognition remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we argue that relying solely on aligning label-level semantics and global skeleton features is insufficient to effectively transfer locally consistent visual knowledge from seen to unseen classes. To address this limitation, we introduce Part-aware Unified Representation between Language and Skeleton (PURLS) to explore visual-semantic alignment at both local and global scales. PURLS introduces a new prompting module and a novel partitioning module to generate aligned textual and visual representations across different levels. The former leverages a pre-trained GPT-3 to infer refined descriptions of the global and local (body-part-based and temporal-interval-based) movements from the original action labels. The latter employs an adaptive sampling strategy to group visual features from all body joint movements that are semantically relevant to a given description. Our approach is evaluated on various skeleton/language backbones and three large-scale datasets, i.e., NTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120, and a newly curated dataset Kinetics-skeleton 200. The results showcase the universality and superior performance of PURLS, surpassing prior skeleton-based solutions and standard baselines from other domains.

- **Summary**: Depth information serves as a crucial prerequisite for various visual tasks, whether on land or underwater. Recently, self-supervised methods have achieved remarkable performance on several terrestrial benchmarks despite the absence of depth annotations. However, in more challenging underwater scenarios, they encounter numerous brand-new obstacles such as the influence of marine life and degradation of underwater images, which break the assumption of a static scene and bring low-quality images, respectively. Besides, the camera angles of underwater images are more diverse. Fortunately, we have discovered that knowledge distillation presents a promising approach for tackling these challenges. In this paper, we propose WaterMono, a novel framework for depth estimation coupled with image enhancement. It incorporates the following key measures: (1) We present a Teacher-Guided Anomaly Mask to identify dynamic regions within the images; (2) We employ depth information combined with the Underwater Image Formation Model to generate enhanced images, which in turn contribute to the depth estimation task; and (3) We utilize a rotated distillation strategy to enhance the model's rotational robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for both depth estimation and image enhancement.

- **Summary**: Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) is the task of estimating the movement trajectory of an agent from an onboard camera stream fused with additional Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements. A crucial subtask within VIO is the tracking of features, which can be achieved through Optical Flow (OF). As the calculation of OF is a resource-demanding task in terms of computational load and memory footprint, which needs to be executed at low latency, especially in robotic applications, OF estimation is today performed on powerful CPUs or GPUs. This restricts its use in a broad spectrum of applications where the deployment of such powerful, power-hungry processors is unfeasible due to constraints related to cost, size, and power consumption. On-sensor hardware acceleration is a promising approach to enable low latency VIO even on resource-constrained devices such as nano drones. This paper assesses the speed-up in a VIO sensor system exploiting a compact OF sensor consisting of a global shutter camera and an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). By replacing the feature tracking logic of the VINS-Mono pipeline with data from this OF camera, we demonstrate a 49.4% reduction in latency and a 53.7% reduction of compute load of the VIO pipeline over the original VINS-Mono implementation, allowing VINS-Mono operation up to 50 FPS instead of 20 FPS on the quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 processor of a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4.

- **Summary**: Due to factors such as thick cloud cover and sensor limitations, remote sensing images often suffer from significant missing data, resulting in incomplete time-series information. Existing methods for imputing missing values in remote sensing images do not fully exploit spatio-temporal auxiliary information, leading to limited accuracy in restoration. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach called MS2TAN (Multi-scale Masked Spatial-Temporal Attention Network), for reconstructing time-series remote sensing images. Firstly, we introduce an efficient spatio-temporal feature extractor based on Masked Spatial-Temporal Attention (MSTA), to obtain high-quality representations of the spatio-temporal neighborhood features in the missing regions. Secondly, a Multi-scale Restoration Network consisting of the MSTA-based Feature Extractors, is employed to progressively refine the missing values by exploring spatio-temporal neighborhood features at different scales. Thirdly, we propose a ``Pixel-Structure-Perception'' Multi-Objective Joint Optimization method to enhance the visual effects of the reconstruction results from multiple perspectives and preserve more texture structures. Furthermore, the proposed method reconstructs missing values in all input temporal phases in parallel (i.e., Multi-In Multi-Out), achieving higher processing efficiency. Finally, experimental evaluations on two typical missing data restoration tasks across multiple research areas demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with an improvement of 0.40dB/1.17dB in mean peak signal-to-noise ratio (mPSNR) and 3.77/9.41 thousandths in mean structural similarity (mSSIM), while exhibiting stronger texture and structural consistency.

- **Summary**: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly progressed with the recent success of large language models. However, there have been few attempts to incorporate efficient linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) architectures into VLMs. In this study, we introduce VisualRWKV, the first application of a linear RNN model to multimodal learning tasks, leveraging the pre-trained RWKV language model. We propose a data-dependent recurrence and sandwich prompts to enhance our modeling capabilities, along with a 2D image scanning mechanism to enrich the processing of visual sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VisualRWKV achieves competitive performance compared to Transformer-based models like LLaVA-1.5 on various benchmarks. To facilitate further research and analysis, we have made the checkpoints and the associated code publicly accessible at the following GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/howard-hou/VisualRWKV}{https://github.com/howard-hou/VisualRWKV}.

- **Summary**: Recently, Depth Anything Model (DAM) - a type of depth foundation model - reveals impressive zero-shot capacity for diverse perspective images. Despite its success, it remains an open question regarding DAM's performance on 360 images that enjoy a large field-of-view (180x360) but suffer from spherical distortions. To this end, we establish, to our knowledge, the first benchmark that aims to 1) evaluate the performance of DAM on 360 images and 2) develop a powerful 360 DAM for the benefit of the community. For this, we conduct a large suite of experiments that consider the key properties of 360 images, e.g., different 360 representations, various spatial transformations, and diverse indoor and outdoor scenes. This way, our benchmark unveils some key findings, e.g., DAM is less effective for diverse 360 scenes and sensitive to spatial transformations. To address these challenges, we first collect a large-scale unlabeled dataset including diverse indoor and outdoor scenes. We then propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework to learn a 360 DAM, dubbed Any360D. Under the umbrella of SSL, Any360D first learns a teacher model by fine-tuning DAM via metric depth supervision. Then, we train the student model by uncovering the potential of large-scale unlabeled data with pseudo labels from the teacher model. M\"obius transformation-based spatial augmentation (MTSA) is proposed to impose consistency regularization between the unlabeled data and spatially transformed ones. This subtly improves the student model's robustness to various spatial transformations even under severe distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Any360D outperforms DAM and many prior data-specific models, e.g., PanoFormer, across diverse scenes, showing impressive zero-shot capacity for being a 360 depth foundation model.

- **Summary**: Deepfakes are a major security risk for biometric authentication. This technology creates realistic fake videos that can impersonate real people, fooling systems that rely on facial features and voice patterns for identification. Existing multimodal deepfake detectors rely on conventional fusion methods, such as majority rule and ensemble voting, which often struggle to adapt to changing data characteristics and complex patterns. In this paper, we introduce the Straight-through Gumbel-Softmax (STGS) framework, offering a comprehensive approach to search multimodal fusion model architectures. Using a two-level search approach, the framework optimizes the network architecture, parameters, and performance. Initially, crucial features were efficiently identified from backbone networks, whereas within the cell structure, a weighted fusion operation integrated information from various sources. An architecture that maximizes the classification performance is derived by varying parameters such as temperature and sampling time. The experimental results on the FakeAVCeleb and SWAN-DF datasets demonstrated an impressive AUC value 94.4\% achieved with minimal model parameters.

- **Summary**: In recent years, employing layer attention to enhance interaction among hierarchical layers has proven to be a significant advancement in building network structures. In this paper, we delve into the distinction between layer attention and the general attention mechanism, noting that existing layer attention methods achieve layer interaction on fixed feature maps in a static manner. These static layer attention methods limit the ability for context feature extraction among layers. To restore the dynamic context representation capability of the attention mechanism, we propose a Dynamic Layer Attention (DLA) architecture. The DLA comprises dual paths, where the forward path utilizes an improved recurrent neural network block, named Dynamic Sharing Unit (DSU), for context feature extraction. The backward path updates features using these shared context representations. Finally, the attention mechanism is applied to these dynamically refreshed feature maps among layers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DLA architecture, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods in image recognition and object detection tasks. Additionally, the DSU block has been evaluated as an efficient plugin in the proposed DLA architecture.The code is available at https://github.com/tunantu/Dynamic-Layer-Attention.

- **Summary**: We propose a simple yet effective pipeline for stylizing a 3D scene, harnessing the power of 2D image diffusion models. Given a NeRF model reconstructed from a set of multi-view images, we perform 3D style transfer by refining the source NeRF model using stylized images generated by a style-aligned image-to-image diffusion model. Given a target style prompt, we first generate perceptually similar multi-view images by leveraging a depth-conditioned diffusion model with an attention-sharing mechanism. Next, based on the stylized multi-view images, we propose to guide the style transfer process with the sliced Wasserstein loss based on the feature maps extracted from a pre-trained CNN model. Our pipeline consists of decoupled steps, allowing users to test various prompt ideas and preview the stylized 3D result before proceeding to the NeRF fine-tuning stage. We demonstrate that our method can transfer diverse artistic styles to real-world 3D scenes with competitive quality.

- **Summary**: Satellite-based street-view information extraction by cross-view matching refers to a task that extracts the location and orientation information of a given street-view image query by using one or multiple geo-referenced satellite images. Recent work has initiated a new research direction to find accurate information within a local area covered by one satellite image centered at a location prior (e.g., from GPS). It can be used as a standalone solution or complementary step following a large-scale search with multiple satellite candidates. However, these existing works require an accurate initial orientation (angle) prior (e.g., from IMU) and/or do not efficiently search through all possible poses. To allow efficient search and to give accurate prediction regardless of the existence or the accuracy of the angle prior, we present PetalView extractors with multi-scale search. The PetalView extractors give semantically meaningful features that are equivalent across two drastically different views, and the multi-scale search strategy efficiently inspects the satellite image from coarse to fine granularity to provide sub-meter and sub-degree precision extraction. Moreover, when an angle prior is given, we propose a learnable prior angle mixer to utilize this information. Our method obtains the best performance on the VIGOR dataset and successfully improves the performance on KITTI dataset test 1 set with the recall within 1 meter (r@1m) for location estimation to 68.88% and recall within 1 degree (r@1d) 21.10% when no angle prior is available, and with angle prior achieves stable estimations at r@1m and r@1d above 70% and 21%, up to a 40-degree noise level.

- **Summary**: Learning composite concepts, such as \textquotedbl red car\textquotedbl , from individual examples -- like a white car representing the concept of \textquotedbl car\textquotedbl{} and a red strawberry representing the concept of \textquotedbl red\textquotedbl -- is inherently challenging. This paper introduces a novel method called Composite Concept Extractor (CoCE), which leverages techniques from traditional backdoor attacks to learn these composite concepts in a zero-shot setting, requiring only examples of individual concepts. By repurposing the trigger-based model backdooring mechanism, we create a strategic distortion in the manifold of the target object (e.g., \textquotedbl car\textquotedbl ) induced by example objects with the target property (e.g., \textquotedbl red\textquotedbl ) from objects \textquotedbl red strawberry\textquotedbl , ensuring the distortion selectively affects the target objects with the target property. Contrastive learning is then employed to further refine this distortion, and a method is formulated for detecting objects that are influenced by the distortion. Extensive experiments with in-depth analysis across different datasets demonstrate the utility and applicability of our proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Image registration is essential for medical image applications where alignment of voxels across multiple images is needed for qualitative or quantitative analysis. With recent advancements in deep neural networks and parallel computing, deep learning-based medical image registration methods become competitive with their flexible modelling and fast inference capabilities. However, compared to traditional optimization-based registration methods, the speed advantage may come at the cost of registration performance at inference time. Besides, deep neural networks ideally demand large training datasets while optimization-based methods are training-free. To improve registration accuracy and data efficiency, we propose a novel image registration method, termed Recurrent Inference Image Registration (RIIR) network. RIIR is formulated as a meta-learning solver to the registration problem in an iterative manner. RIIR addresses the accuracy and data efficiency issues, by learning the update rule of optimization, with implicit regularization combined with explicit gradient input.   We evaluated RIIR extensively on brain MRI and quantitative cardiac MRI datasets, in terms of both registration accuracy and training data efficiency. Our experiments showed that RIIR outperformed a range of deep learning-based methods, even with only $5\%$ of the training data, demonstrating high data efficiency. Key findings from our ablation studies highlighted the important added value of the hidden states introduced in the recurrent inference framework for meta-learning. Our proposed RIIR offers a highly data-efficient framework for deep learning-based medical image registration.

- **Summary**: Recently, there has been increasing interest in multimodal applications that integrate text with other modalities, such as images, audio and video, to facilitate natural language interactions with multimodal AI systems. While applications involving standard modalities have been extensively explored, there is still a lack of investigation into specific data modalities such as remote sensing (RS) data. Despite the numerous potential applications of RS data, including environmental protection, disaster monitoring and land planning, available solutions are predominantly focused on specific tasks like classification, captioning and retrieval. These solutions often overlook the unique characteristics of RS data, such as its capability to systematically provide information on the same geographical areas over time. This ability enables continuous monitoring of changes in the underlying landscape. To address this gap, we propose a novel foundation model for bi-temporal RS image pairs, in the context of change detection analysis, leveraging Contrastive Learning and the LEVIR-CC dataset for both captioning and text-image retrieval. By jointly training a contrastive encoder and captioning decoder, our model add text-image retrieval capabilities, in the context of bi-temporal change detection, while maintaining captioning performances that are comparable to the state of the art. We release the source code and pretrained weights at: https://github.com/rogerferrod/RSICRC.

- **Summary**: This study focuses on analyzing dermoscopy images to determine the depth of melanomas, which is a critical factor in diagnosing and treating skin cancer. The Breslow depth, measured from the top of the granular layer to the deepest point of tumor invasion, serves as a crucial parameter for staging melanoma and guiding treatment decisions. This research aims to improve the prediction of the depth of melanoma through the use of machine learning models, specifically deep learning, while also providing an analysis of the possible existance of graduation in the images characteristics which correlates with the depth of the melanomas. Various datasets, including ISIC and private collections, were used, comprising a total of 1162 images. The datasets were combined and balanced to ensure robust model training. The study utilized pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Results indicated that the models achieved significant improvements over previous methods. Additionally, the study conducted a correlation analysis between model's predictions and actual melanoma thickness, revealing a moderate correlation that improves with higher thickness values. Explainability methods such as feature visualization through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated the capability of deep features to distinguish between different depths of melanoma, providing insight into the data distribution and model behavior. In summary, this research presents a dual contribution: enhancing the state-of-the-art classification results through advanced training techniques and offering a detailed analysis of the data and model behavior to better understand the relationship between dermoscopy images and melanoma thickness.

- **Summary**: Visual programs are executable code generated by large language models to address visual reasoning problems. They decompose complex questions into multiple reasoning steps and invoke specialized models for each step to solve the problems. However, these programs are prone to logic errors, with our preliminary evaluation showing that 58% of the total errors are caused by program logic errors. Debugging complex visual programs remains a major bottleneck for visual reasoning. To address this, we introduce VDebugger, a novel critic-refiner framework trained to localize and debug visual programs by tracking execution step by step. VDebugger identifies and corrects program errors leveraging detailed execution feedback, improving interpretability and accuracy. The training data is generated through an automated pipeline that injects errors into correct visual programs using a novel mask-best decoding technique. Evaluations on six datasets demonstrate VDebugger's effectiveness, showing performance improvements of up to 3.2% in downstream task accuracy. Further studies show VDebugger's ability to generalize to unseen tasks, bringing a notable improvement of 2.3% on the unseen COVR task.

- **Summary**: Many targets are often very small in infrared images due to the long-distance imaging meachnism. UNet and its variants, as popular detection backbone networks, downsample the local features early and cause the irreversible loss of these local features, leading to both the missed and false detection of small targets in infrared images. We propose HintU, a novel network to recover the local features lost by various UNet-based methods for effective infrared small target detection. HintU has two key contributions. First, it introduces the "Hint" mechanism for the first time, i.e., leveraging the prior knowledge of target locations to highlight critical local features. Second, it improves the mainstream UNet-based architecture to preserve target pixels even after downsampling. HintU can shift the focus of various networks (e.g., vanilla UNet, UNet++, UIUNet, MiM+, and HCFNet) from the irrelevant background pixels to a more restricted area from the beginning. Experimental results on three datasets NUDT-SIRST, SIRSTv2 and IRSTD1K demonstrate that HintU enhances the performance of existing methods with only an additional 1.88 ms cost (on RTX Titan). Additionally, the explicit constraints of HintU enhance the generalization ability of UNet-based methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Wuzhou-Quan/HintU.

- **Summary**: Event-based vision has drawn increasing attention due to its unique characteristics, such as high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. It has been used in video super-resolution (VSR) recently to enhance the flow estimation and temporal alignment. Rather than for motion learning, we propose in this paper the first VSR method that utilizes event signals for texture enhancement. Our method, called EvTexture, leverages high-frequency details of events to better recover texture regions in VSR. In our EvTexture, a new texture enhancement branch is presented. We further introduce an iterative texture enhancement module to progressively explore the high-temporal-resolution event information for texture restoration. This allows for gradual refinement of texture regions across multiple iterations, leading to more accurate and rich high-resolution details. Experimental results show that our EvTexture achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets. For the Vid4 dataset with rich textures, our method can get up to 4.67dB gain compared with recent event-based methods. Code: https://github.com/DachunKai/EvTexture.

- **Summary**: With the rise of autonomous vehicles and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), ensuring reliable object detection in all weather conditions is crucial for safety and efficiency. Adverse weather like snow, rain, and fog presents major challenges for current detection systems, often resulting in failures and potential safety risks. This paper introduces a novel framework and pipeline designed to improve object detection under such conditions, focusing on traffic signal detection where traditional methods often fail due to domain shifts caused by adverse weather. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of existing techniques. Our proposed pipeline significantly enhances detection accuracy in snow, rain, and fog. Results show a 40.8% improvement in average IoU and F1 scores compared to naive fine-tuning and a 22.4% performance increase in domain shift scenarios, such as training on artificial snow and testing on rain images.

- **Summary**: We propose a new comprehensive benchmark to revolutionize the current deepfake detection field to the next generation. Predominantly, existing works identify top-notch detection algorithms and models by adhering to the common practice: training detectors on one specific dataset (e.g., FF++) and testing them on other prevalent deepfake datasets. This protocol is often regarded as a "golden compass" for navigating SoTA detectors. But can these stand-out "winners" be truly applied to tackle the myriad of realistic and diverse deepfakes lurking in the real world? If not, what underlying factors contribute to this gap? In this work, we found the dataset (both train and test) can be the "primary culprit" due to: (1) forgery diversity: Deepfake techniques are commonly referred to as both face forgery (face-swapping and face-reenactment) and entire image synthesis (AIGC). Most existing datasets only contain partial types, with limited forgery methods implemented; (2) forgery realism: The dominant training dataset, FF++, contains old forgery techniques from the past five years. "Honing skills" on these forgeries makes it difficult to guarantee effective detection of nowadays' SoTA deepfakes; (3) evaluation protocol: Most detection works perform evaluations on one type, e.g., train and test on face-swapping only, which hinders the development of universal deepfake detectors. To address this dilemma, we construct a highly diverse and large-scale deepfake dataset called DF40, which comprises 40 distinct deepfake techniques. We then conduct comprehensive evaluations using 4 standard evaluation protocols and 7 representative detectors, resulting in over 2,000 evaluations. Through these evaluations, we analyze from various perspectives, leading to 12 new insightful findings contributing to the field. We also open up 5 valuable yet previously underexplored research questions to inspire future works.

- **Summary**: Few-shot object detection~(FSOD), which aims to detect novel objects with limited annotated instances, has made significant progress in recent years. However, existing methods still suffer from biased representations, especially for novel classes in extremely low-shot scenarios. During fine-tuning, a novel class may exploit knowledge from similar base classes to construct its own feature distribution, leading to classification confusion and performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-tuning based FSOD framework that utilizes semantic embeddings for better detection. In our proposed method, we align the visual features with class name embeddings and replace the linear classifier with our semantic similarity classifier. Our method trains each region proposal to converge to the corresponding class embedding. Furthermore, we introduce a multimodal feature fusion to augment the vision-language communication, enabling a novel class to draw support explicitly from well-trained similar base classes. To prevent class confusion, we propose a semantic-aware max-margin loss, which adaptively applies a margin beyond similar classes. As a result, our method allows each novel class to construct a compact feature space without being confused with similar base classes. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and MS COCO demonstrate the superiority of our method.

- **Summary**: We present Locally Orderless Networks (LON) and its theoretic foundation which links it to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to Scale-space histograms, and measurement theory. The key elements are a regular sampling of the bias and the derivative of the activation function. We compare LON, CNN, and Scale-space histograms on prototypical single-layer networks. We show how LON and CNN can emulate each other, how LON expands the set of functionals computable to non-linear functions such as squaring. We demonstrate simple networks which illustrate the improved performance of LON over CNN on simple tasks for estimating the gradient magnitude squared, for regressing shape area and perimeter lengths, and for explainability of individual pixels' influence on the result.

- **Summary**: Efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction is crucial for various applications, including augmented and virtual reality, medical imaging, and cinematic special effects. While traditional Multi-View Stereo (MVS) systems have been fundamental in these applications, using neural implicit fields in implicit 3D scene modeling has introduced new possibilities for handling complex topologies and continuous surfaces. However, neural implicit fields often suffer from computational inefficiencies, overfitting, and heavy reliance on data quality, limiting their practical use. This paper presents an enhanced MVS framework that integrates multi-view 360-degree imagery with robust camera pose estimation via Structure from Motion (SfM) and advanced image processing for point cloud densification, mesh reconstruction, and texturing. Our approach significantly improves upon traditional MVS methods, offering superior accuracy and precision as validated using Chamfer distance metrics on the Realistic Synthetic 360 dataset. The developed MVS technique enhances the detail and clarity of 3D reconstructions and demonstrates superior computational efficiency and robustness in complex scene reconstruction, effectively handling occlusions and varying viewpoints. These improvements suggest that our MVS framework can compete with and potentially exceed current state-of-the-art neural implicit field methods, especially in scenarios requiring real-time processing and scalability.

- **Summary**: The blooming of virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR) technologies has driven an increasing demand for the creation of high-quality, immersive, and dynamic environments. However, existing generative techniques either focus solely on dynamic objects or perform outpainting from a single perspective image, failing to meet the needs of VR/AR applications. In this work, we tackle the challenging task of elevating a single panorama to an immersive 4D experience. For the first time, we demonstrate the capability to generate omnidirectional dynamic scenes with 360-degree views at 4K resolution, thereby providing an immersive user experience. Our method introduces a pipeline that facilitates natural scene animations and optimizes a set of 4D Gaussians using efficient splatting techniques for real-time exploration. To overcome the lack of scene-scale annotated 4D data and models, especially in panoramic formats, we propose a novel Panoramic Denoiser that adapts generic 2D diffusion priors to animate consistently in 360-degree images, transforming them into panoramic videos with dynamic scenes at targeted regions. Subsequently, we elevate the panoramic video into a 4D immersive environment while preserving spatial and temporal consistency. By transferring prior knowledge from 2D models in the perspective domain to the panoramic domain and the 4D lifting with spatial appearance and geometry regularization, we achieve high-quality Panorama-to-4D generation at a resolution of (4096 $\times$ 2048) for the first time.

- **Summary**: Colonoscopy videos provide richer information in polyp segmentation for rectal cancer diagnosis. However, the endoscope's fast moving and close-up observing make the current methods suffer from large spatial incoherence and continuous low-quality frames, and thus yield limited segmentation accuracy. In this context, we focus on robust video polyp segmentation by enhancing the adjacent feature consistency and rebuilding the reliable polyp representation. To achieve this goal, we in this paper propose SALI network, a hybrid of Short-term Alignment Module (SAM) and Long-term Interaction Module (LIM). The SAM learns spatial-aligned features of adjacent frames via deformable convolution and further harmonizes them to capture more stable short-term polyp representation. In case of low-quality frames, the LIM stores the historical polyp representations as a long-term memory bank, and explores the retrospective relations to interactively rebuild more reliable polyp features for the current segmentation. Combing SAM and LIM, the SALI network of video segmentation shows a great robustness to the spatial variations and low-visual cues. Benchmark on the large-scale SUNSEG verifies the superiority of SALI over the current state-of-the-arts by improving Dice by 2.1%, 2.5%, 4.1% and 1.9%, for the four test sub-sets, respectively.

- **Summary**: Histopathology can help clinicians make accurate diagnoses, determine disease prognosis, and plan appropriate treatment strategies. As deep learning techniques prove successful in the medical domain, the primary challenges become limited data availability and concerns about data sharing and privacy. Federated learning has addressed this challenge by training models locally and updating parameters on a server. However, issues, such as domain shift and bias, persist and impact overall performance. Dataset distillation presents an alternative approach to overcoming these challenges. It involves creating a small synthetic dataset that encapsulates essential information, which can be shared without constraints. At present, this paradigm is not practicable as current distillation approaches only generate non human readable representations and exhibit insufficient performance for downstream learning tasks. We train a latent diffusion model and construct a new distilled synthetic dataset with a small number of human readable synthetic images. Selection of maximally informative synthetic images is done via graph community analysis of the representation space. We compare downstream classification models trained on our synthetic distillation data to models trained on real data and reach performances suitable for practical application.

- **Summary**: Despite significant advancements in computer vision, understanding complex scenes, particularly those involving humor, remains a substantial challenge. This paper introduces HumorDB, a novel image-only dataset specifically designed to advance visual humor understanding. HumorDB consists of meticulously curated image pairs with contrasting humor ratings, emphasizing subtle visual cues that trigger humor and mitigating potential biases. The dataset enables evaluation through binary classification(Funny or Not Funny), range regression(funniness on a scale from 1 to 10), and pairwise comparison tasks(Which Image is Funnier?), effectively capturing the subjective nature of humor perception. Initial experiments reveal that while vision-only models struggle, vision-language models, particularly those leveraging large language models, show promising results. HumorDB also shows potential as a valuable zero-shot benchmark for powerful large multimodal models. We open-source both the dataset and code under the CC BY 4.0 license.

- **Summary**: Image forgery localization, which aims to segment tampered regions in an image, is a fundamental yet challenging digital forensic task. While some deep learning-based forensic methods have achieved impressive results, they directly learn pixel-to-label mappings without fully exploiting the relationship between pixels in the feature space. To address such deficiency, we propose a Multi-view Pixel-wise Contrastive algorithm (MPC) for image forgery localization. Specifically, we first pre-train the backbone network with the supervised contrastive loss to model pixel relationships from the perspectives of within-image, cross-scale and cross-modality. That is aimed at increasing intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Then the localization head is fine-tuned using the cross-entropy loss, resulting in a better pixel localizer. The MPC is trained on three different scale training datasets to make a comprehensive and fair comparison with existing image forgery localization algorithms. Extensive experiments on the small, medium and large scale training datasets show that the proposed MPC achieves higher generalization performance and robustness against post-processing than the state-of-the-arts. Code will be available at https://github.com/multimediaFor/MPC.

- **Summary**: Digital video inpainting techniques have been substantially improved with deep learning in recent years. Although inpainting is originally designed to repair damaged areas, it can also be used as malicious manipulation to remove important objects for creating false scenes and facts. As such it is significant to identify inpainted regions blindly. In this paper, we present a Trusted Video Inpainting Localization network (TruVIL) with excellent robustness and generalization ability. Observing that high-frequency noise can effectively unveil the inpainted regions, we design deep attentive noise learning in multiple stages to capture the inpainting traces. Firstly, a multi-scale noise extraction module based on 3D High Pass (HP3D) layers is used to create the noise modality from input RGB frames. Then the correlation between such two complementary modalities are explored by a cross-modality attentive fusion module to facilitate mutual feature learning. Lastly, spatial details are selectively enhanced by an attentive noise decoding module to boost the localization performance of the network. To prepare enough training samples, we also build a frame-level video object segmentation dataset of 2500 videos with pixel-level annotation for all frames. Extensive experimental results validate the superiority of TruVIL compared with the state-of-the-arts. In particular, both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on various inpainted videos verify the remarkable robustness and generalization ability of our proposed TruVIL. Code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/multimediaFor/TruVIL.

- **Summary**: Analyses for biodiversity monitoring based on passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) recordings is time-consuming and challenged by the presence of background noise in recordings. Existing models for sound event detection (SED) worked only on certain avian species and the development of further models required labeled data. The developed framework automatically extracted labeled data from available platforms for selected avian species. The labeled data were embedded into recordings, including environmental sounds and noise, and were used to train convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) models. The models were evaluated on unprocessed real world data recorded in urban KwaZulu-Natal habitats. The Adapted SED-CRNN model reached a F1 score of 0.73, demonstrating its efficiency under noisy, real-world conditions. The proposed approach to automatically extract labeled data for chosen avian species enables an easy adaption of PAM to other species and habitats for future conservation projects.

- **Summary**: The primary goal of continual learning (CL) task in medical image segmentation field is to solve the "catastrophic forgetting" problem, where the model totally forgets previously learned features when it is extended to new categories (class-level) or tasks (task-level). Due to the privacy protection, the historical data labels are inaccessible. Prevalent continual learning methods primarily focus on generating pseudo-labels for old datasets to force the model to memorize the learned features. However, the incorrect pseudo-labels may corrupt the learned feature and lead to a new problem that the better the model is trained on the old task, the poorer the model performs on the new tasks. To avoid this problem, we propose a network by introducing the data-specific Mixture of Experts (MoE) structure to handle the new tasks or categories, ensuring that the network parameters of previous tasks are unaffected or only minimally impacted. To further overcome the tremendous memory costs caused by introducing additional structures, we propose a Low-Rank strategy which significantly reduces memory cost. We validate our method on both class-level and task-level continual learning challenges. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show our model outperforms all other methods.

- **Summary**: The bilateral asymmetry of flanks of animals with visual body marks that uniquely identify an individual, complicates tasks like population estimations. Automatically generated additional information on the visible side of the animal would improve the accuracy for individual identification. In this study we used transfer learning on popular CNN image classification architectures to train a flank predictor that predicts the visible flank of quadruped mammalian species in images. We automatically derived the data labels from existing datasets originally labeled for animal pose estimation. We trained the models in two phases with different degrees of retraining. The developed models were evaluated in different scenarios of different unknown quadruped species in known and unknown environments. As a real-world scenario, we used a dataset of manually labeled Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) from camera traps in the Bavarian Forest National Park to evaluate the model. The best model, trained on an EfficientNetV2 backbone, achieved an accuracy of 88.70 % for the unknown species lynx in a complex habitat.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify the changes of interest in a region by analyzing multi-temporal remote sensing images, and has an outstanding value for local development monitoring. Existing RSCD methods are devoted to contextual modeling in the spatial domain to enhance the changes of interest. Despite the satisfactory performance achieved, the lack of knowledge in the frequency domain limits the further improvement of model performance. In this paper, we propose DDLNet, a RSCD network based on dual-domain learning (i.e., frequency and spatial domains). In particular, we design a Frequency-domain Enhancement Module (FEM) to capture frequency components from the input bi-temporal images using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and thus enhance the changes of interest. Besides, we devise a Spatial-domain Recovery Module (SRM) to fuse spatiotemporal features for reconstructing spatial details of change representations. Extensive experiments on three benchmark RSCD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and reaches a more satisfactory accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

- **Summary**: Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image restoration has acquired remarkable attention due to its practical demand. In this paper, we construct UHD snow and rain benchmarks, named UHD-Snow and UHD-Rain, to remedy the deficiency in this field. The UHD-Snow/UHD-Rain is established by simulating the physics process of rain/snow into consideration and each benchmark contains 3200 degraded/clear image pairs of 4K resolution. Furthermore, we propose an effective UHD image restoration solution by considering gradient and normal priors in model design thanks to these priors' spatial and detail contributions. Specifically, our method contains two branches: (a) feature fusion and reconstruction branch in high-resolution space and (b) prior feature interaction branch in low-resolution space. The former learns high-resolution features and fuses prior-guided low-resolution features to reconstruct clear images, while the latter utilizes normal and gradient priors to mine useful spatial features and detail features to guide high-resolution recovery better. To better utilize these priors, we introduce single prior feature interaction and dual prior feature interaction, where the former respectively fuses normal and gradient priors with high-resolution features to enhance prior ones, while the latter calculates the similarity between enhanced prior ones and further exploits dual guided filtering to boost the feature interaction of dual priors. We conduct experiments on both new and existing public datasets and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method on UHD image low-light enhancement, UHD image desonwing, and UHD image deraining.

- **Summary**: Commonsense reasoning is fundamentally based on multimodal knowledge. However, existing large language models (LLMs) are primarily trained using textual data only, limiting their ability to incorporate essential visual information. In contrast, Visual Language Models, which excel at visually-oriented tasks, often fail at non-visual tasks such as basic commonsense reasoning. This divergence highlights a critical challenge - the integration of robust visual understanding with foundational text-based language reasoning. To this end, we introduce a method aimed at enhancing LLMs' visual commonsense. Specifically, our method generates multiple images based on the input text prompt and integrates these into the model's decision-making process by mixing their prediction probabilities. To facilitate multimodal grounded language modeling, we employ a late-fusion layer that combines the projected visual features with the output of a pre-trained LLM conditioned on text only. This late-fusion layer enables predictions based on comprehensive image-text knowledge as well as text only when this is required. We evaluate our approach using several visual commonsense reasoning tasks together with traditional NLP tasks, including common sense reasoning and reading comprehension. Our experimental results demonstrate significant superiority over existing baselines. When applied to recent state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., Llama3), we observe improvements not only in visual common sense but also in traditional NLP benchmarks.

- **Summary**: This paper presents T3: Transferable Tactile Transformers, a framework for tactile representation learning that scales across multi-sensors and multi-tasks. T3 is designed to overcome the contemporary issue that camera-based tactile sensing is extremely heterogeneous, i.e. sensors are built into different form factors, and existing datasets were collected for disparate tasks. T3 captures the shared latent information across different sensor-task pairings by constructing a shared trunk transformer with sensor-specific encoders and task-specific decoders. The pre-training of T3 utilizes a novel Foundation Tactile (FoTa) dataset, which is aggregated from several open-sourced datasets and it contains over 3 million data points gathered from 13 sensors and 11 tasks. FoTa is the largest and most diverse dataset in tactile sensing to date and it is made publicly available in a unified format. Across various sensors and tasks, experiments show that T3 pre-trained with FoTa achieved zero-shot transferability in certain sensor-task pairings, can be further fine-tuned with small amounts of domain-specific data, and its performance scales with bigger network sizes. T3 is also effective as a tactile encoder for long horizon contact-rich manipulation. Results from sub-millimeter multi-pin electronics insertion tasks show that T3 achieved a task success rate 25% higher than that of policies trained with tactile encoders trained from scratch, or 53% higher than without tactile sensing. Data, code, and model checkpoints are open-sourced at https://t3.alanz.info.

In this paper, we propose SpatialBot for better spatial understanding by feeding both RGB and depth images. Additionally, we have constructed the SpatialQA dataset, which involves multi-level depth-related questions to train VLMs for depth understanding. Finally, we present SpatialBench to comprehensively evaluate VLMs' capabilities in spatial understanding at different levels. Extensive experiments on our spatial-understanding benchmark, general VLM benchmarks and Embodied AI tasks, demonstrate the remarkable improvements of SpatialBot trained on SpatialQA.

- **Summary**: Accurate vessel segmentation in Ultra-Wide-Field Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (UWF-SLO) images is crucial for diagnosing retinal diseases. Although recent techniques have shown encouraging outcomes in vessel segmentation, models trained on one medical dataset often underperform on others due to domain shifts. Meanwhile, manually labeling high-resolution UWF-SLO images is an extremely challenging, time-consuming and expensive task. In response, this study introduces a pioneering framework that leverages a patch-based active domain adaptation approach. By actively recommending a few valuable image patches by the devised Cascade Uncertainty-Predominance (CUP) selection strategy for labeling and model-finetuning, our method significantly improves the accuracy of UWF-SLO vessel segmentation across diverse medical centers. In addition, we annotate and construct the first Multi-center UWF-SLO Vessel Segmentation (MU-VS) dataset to promote this topic research, comprising data from multiple institutions. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for cross-center evaluation, verifying the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing domain adaptation and active learning methods, considerably reducing the gap between the Upper and Lower bounds with minimal annotations, highlighting our method's practical clinical value. We will release our dataset and code to facilitate relevant research: https://github.com/whq-xxh/SFADA-UWF-SLO.

- **Summary**: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) leverage sparse spikes to represent information and process them in an asynchronous event-driven manner, offering an energy-efficient paradigm for the next generation of machine intelligence. However, the current focus within the SNN community prioritizes accuracy optimization through the development of large-scale models, limiting their viability in resource-constrained and low-power edge devices. To address this challenge, we introduce a lightweight and hardware-friendly Quantized SNN (Q-SNN) that applies quantization to both synaptic weights and membrane potentials. By significantly compressing these two key elements, the proposed Q-SNNs substantially reduce both memory usage and computational complexity. Moreover, to prevent the performance degradation caused by this compression, we present a new Weight-Spike Dual Regulation (WS-DR) method inspired by information entropy theory. Experimental evaluations on various datasets, including static and neuromorphic, demonstrate that our Q-SNNs outperform existing methods in terms of both model size and accuracy. These state-of-the-art results in efficiency and efficacy suggest that the proposed method can significantly improve edge intelligent computing.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has enabled great strides in abdominal multi-organ segmentation, even surpassing junior oncologists on common cases or organs. However, robustness on corner cases and complex organs remains a challenging open problem for clinical adoption. To investigate model robustness, we collected and annotated the RAOS dataset comprising 413 CT scans ($\sim$80k 2D images, $\sim$8k 3D organ annotations) from 413 patients each with 17 (female) or 19 (male) labelled organs, manually delineated by oncologists. We grouped scans based on clinical information into 1) diagnosis/radiotherapy (317 volumes), 2) partial excision without the whole organ missing (22 volumes), and 3) excision with the whole organ missing (74 volumes). RAOS provides a potential benchmark for evaluating model robustness including organ hallucination. It also includes some organs that can be very hard to access on public datasets like the rectum, colon, intestine, prostate and seminal vesicles. We benchmarked several state-of-the-art methods in these three clinical groups to evaluate performance and robustness. We also assessed cross-generalization between RAOS and three public datasets. This dataset and comprehensive analysis establish a potential baseline for future robustness research: \url{https://github.com/Luoxd1996/RAOS}.

- **Summary**: Image-text contrastive models such as CLIP learn transferable and robust representations for zero-shot transfer to a variety of downstream tasks. However, to obtain strong downstream performances, prompts need to be carefully curated, which can be a tedious engineering task. To address the issue of manual prompt engineering, prompt-tuning is used where a set of contextual vectors are learned by leveraging information from the training data. Despite their effectiveness, existing prompt-tuning frameworks often lack interpretability, thus limiting their ability to understand the compositional nature of images. In this work, we first identify that incorporating compositional attributes (e.g., a "green" tree frog) in the design of manual prompts can significantly enhance image-text alignment scores. Building upon this observation, we propose a novel and interpretable prompt-tuning method named IntCoOp, which learns to jointly align attribute-level inductive biases and class embeddings during prompt-tuning. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate IntCoOp across two representative tasks in a few-shot learning setup: generalization to novel classes, and unseen domain shifts. Through extensive experiments across 10 downstream datasets on CLIP, we find that introducing attribute-level inductive biases leads to superior performance against state-of-the-art prompt tuning frameworks. Notably, in a 16-shot setup, IntCoOp improves CoOp by 7.35% in average performance across 10 diverse datasets.

- **Summary**: Over the past years, images generated by artificial intelligence have become more prevalent and more realistic. Their advent raises ethical questions relating to misinformation, artistic expression, and identity theft, among others. The crux of many of these moral questions is the difficulty in distinguishing between real and fake images. It is important to develop tools that are able to detect AI-generated images, especially when these images are too realistic-looking for the human eye to identify as fake. This paper proposes a dual-branch neural network architecture that takes both images and their Fourier frequency decomposition as inputs. We use standard CNN-based methods for both branches as described in Stuchi et al. [7], followed by fully-connected layers. Our proposed model achieves an accuracy of 94% on the CIFAKE dataset, which significantly outperforms classic ML methods and CNNs, achieving performance comparable to some state-of-the-art architectures, such as ResNet.

- **Summary**: Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) is highly valued for its non-invasive and painless approach, though its effectiveness is compromised by uneven illumination from hardware constraints and complex internal dynamics, leading to overexposed or underexposed images. While researchers have discussed the challenges of low-light enhancement in WCE, the issue of correcting for different exposure levels remains underexplored. To tackle this, we introduce EndoUIC, a WCE unified illumination correction solution using an end-to-end promptable diffusion transformer (DFT) model. In our work, the illumination prompt module shall navigate the model to adapt to different exposure levels and perform targeted image enhancement, in which the Adaptive Prompt Integration (API) and Global Prompt Scanner (GPS) modules shall further boost the concurrent representation learning between the prompt parameters and features. Besides, the U-shaped restoration DFT model shall capture the long-range dependencies and contextual information for unified illumination restoration. Moreover, we present a novel Capsule-endoscopy Exposure Correction (CEC) dataset, including ground-truth and corrupted image pairs annotated by expert photographers. Extensive experiments against a variety of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on four datasets showcase the effectiveness of our proposed method and components in WCE illumination restoration, and the additional downstream experiments further demonstrate its utility for clinical diagnosis and surgical assistance.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present a comparison between color spaces namely YUV, LAB, RGB and their effect on learned image compression. For this we use the structure and color based learned image codec (SLIC) from our prior work, which consists of two branches - one for the luminance component (Y or L) and another for chrominance components (UV or AB). However, for the RGB variant we input all 3 channels in a single branch, similar to most learned image codecs operating in RGB. The models are trained for multiple bitrate configurations in each color space. We report the findings from our experiments by evaluating them on various datasets and compare the results to state-of-the-art image codecs. The YUV model performs better than the LAB variant in terms of MS-SSIM with a Bj{\o}ntegaard delta bitrate (BD-BR) gain of 7.5\% using VTM intra-coding mode as the baseline. Whereas the LAB variant has a better performance than YUV model in terms of CIEDE2000 having a BD-BR gain of 8\%. Overall, the RGB variant of SLIC achieves the best performance with a BD-BR gain of 13.14\% in terms of MS-SSIM and a gain of 17.96\% in CIEDE2000 at the cost of a higher model complexity.

- **Summary**: The advent of Multimodal LLMs has significantly enhanced image OCR recognition capabilities, making GUI automation a viable reality for increasing efficiency in digital tasks. One fundamental aspect of developing a GUI automation system is understanding primitive GUI actions. This comprehension is crucial as it enables agents to learn from user demonstrations, an essential element of automation. To rigorously evaluate such capabilities, we developed a video captioning benchmark for GUI actions, comprising 4,189 diverse video captioning samples. This task presents unique challenges compared to natural scene video captioning: 1) GUI screenshots typically contain denser information than natural scenes, and 2) events within GUIs are subtler and occur more rapidly, requiring precise attention to the appropriate time span and spatial region for accurate understanding. To address these challenges, we introduce our GUI action dataset \textbf{Act2Cap} as well as a simple yet effective framework, \textbf{GUI Narrator}, for GUI video captioning that utilizes the cursor as a visual prompt to enhance the interpretation of high-resolution screenshots. Specifically, a cursor detector is trained on our dataset, and a multimodal LLM model with mechanisms for selecting keyframes and key regions generates the captions. Experimental results indicate that even for today's most advanced multimodal models, such as GPT-4o, the task remains highly challenging. Additionally, our evaluations show that our strategy effectively enhances model performance, whether integrated into the fine-tuning of open-source models or employed as a prompting strategy in closed-source models.

- **Summary**: Understanding the semantics of visual scenes is a fundamental challenge in Computer Vision. A key aspect of this challenge is that objects sharing similar semantic meanings or functions can exhibit striking visual differences, making accurate identification and categorization difficult. Recent advancements in text-to-image frameworks have led to models that implicitly capture natural scene statistics. These frameworks account for the visual variability of objects, as well as complex object co-occurrences and sources of noise such as diverse lighting conditions. By leveraging large-scale datasets and cross-attention conditioning, these models generate detailed and contextually rich scene representations. This capability opens new avenues for improving object recognition and scene understanding in varied and challenging environments. Our work presents StableSemantics, a dataset comprising 224 thousand human-curated prompts, processed natural language captions, over 2 million synthetic images, and 10 million attention maps corresponding to individual noun chunks. We explicitly leverage human-generated prompts that correspond to visually interesting stable diffusion generations, provide 10 generations per phrase, and extract cross-attention maps for each image. We explore the semantic distribution of generated images, examine the distribution of objects within images, and benchmark captioning and open vocabulary segmentation methods on our data. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to release a diffusion dataset with semantic attributions. We expect our proposed dataset to catalyze advances in visual semantic understanding and provide a foundation for developing more sophisticated and effective visual models.

- **Summary**: While text-to-visual models now produce photo-realistic images and videos, they struggle with compositional text prompts involving attributes, relationships, and higher-order reasoning such as logic and comparison. In this work, we conduct an extensive human study on GenAI-Bench to evaluate the performance of leading image and video generation models in various aspects of compositional text-to-visual generation. We also compare automated evaluation metrics against our collected human ratings and find that VQAScore -- a metric measuring the likelihood that a VQA model views an image as accurately depicting the prompt -- significantly outperforms previous metrics such as CLIPScore. In addition, VQAScore can improve generation in a black-box manner (without finetuning) via simply ranking a few (3 to 9) candidate images. Ranking by VQAScore is 2x to 3x more effective than other scoring methods like PickScore, HPSv2, and ImageReward at improving human alignment ratings for DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion, especially on compositional prompts that require advanced visio-linguistic reasoning. We will release a new GenAI-Rank benchmark with over 40,000 human ratings to evaluate scoring metrics on ranking images generated from the same prompt. Lastly, we discuss promising areas for improvement in VQAScore, such as addressing fine-grained visual details. We will release all human ratings (over 80,000) to facilitate scientific benchmarking of both generative models and automated metrics.

- **Summary**: Tuberculosis persists as a global health crisis, especially in resource-limited populations and remote regions, with more than 10 million individuals newly infected annually. It stands as a stark symbol of inequity in public health. Tuberculosis impacts roughly a quarter of the global populace, with the majority of cases concentrated in eight countries, accounting for two-thirds of all tuberculosis infections. Although a severe ailment, tuberculosis is both curable and manageable. However, early detection and screening of at-risk populations are imperative. Chest x-ray stands as the predominant imaging technique utilized in tuberculosis screening efforts. However, x-ray screening necessitates skilled radiologists, a resource often scarce, particularly in remote regions with limited resources. Consequently, there is a pressing need for artificial intelligence (AI)-powered systems to support clinicians and healthcare providers in swift screening. However, training a reliable AI model necessitates large-scale high-quality data, which can be difficult and costly to acquire. Inspired by these challenges, in this work, we introduce an explainable self-supervised self-train learning network tailored for tuberculosis case screening. The network achieves an outstanding overall accuracy of 98.14% and demonstrates high recall and precision rates of 95.72% and 99.44%, respectively, in identifying tuberculosis cases, effectively capturing clinically significant features.

- **Summary**: The remarkable success of transformers in sequence modeling tasks, spanning various applications in natural language processing and computer vision, is attributed to the critical role of self-attention. Similar to the development of most deep learning models, the construction of these attention mechanisms rely on heuristics and experience. In our work, we derive self-attention from kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA) and show that self-attention projects its query vectors onto the principal component axes of its key matrix in a feature space. We then formulate the exact formula for the value matrix in self-attention, theoretically and empirically demonstrating that this value matrix captures the eigenvectors of the Gram matrix of the key vectors in self-attention. Leveraging our kernel PCA framework, we propose Attention with Robust Principal Components (RPC-Attention), a novel class of robust attention that is resilient to data contamination. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of RPC-Attention over softmax attention on the ImageNet-1K object classification, WikiText-103 language modeling, and ADE20K image segmentation task.

- **Summary**: Can large multimodal models have a human-like ability for emotional and social reasoning, and if so, how does it work? Recent research has discovered emergent theory-of-mind (ToM) reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). LLMs can reason about people's mental states by solving various text-based ToM tasks that ask questions about the actors' ToM (e.g., human belief, desire, intention). However, human reasoning in the wild is often grounded in dynamic scenes across time. Thus, we consider videos a new medium for examining spatio-temporal ToM reasoning ability. Specifically, we ask explicit probing questions about videos with abundant social and emotional reasoning content. We develop a pipeline for multimodal LLM for ToM reasoning using video and text. We also enable explicit ToM reasoning by retrieving key frames for answering a ToM question, which reveals how multimodal LLMs reason about ToM.

- **Summary**: Pairwise dot-product self-attention is key to the success of transformers that achieve state-of-the-art performance across a variety of applications in language and vision. This dot-product self-attention computes attention weights among the input tokens using Euclidean distance, which makes the model prone to representation collapse and vulnerable to contaminated samples. In this paper, we propose using a Mahalanobis distance metric for computing the attention weights to stretch the underlying feature space in directions of high contextual relevance. In particular, we define a hyper-ellipsoidal neighborhood around each query to increase the attention weights of the tokens lying in the contextually important directions. We term this novel class of attention Elliptical Attention. Our Elliptical Attention provides two benefits: 1) reducing representation collapse and 2) enhancing the model's robustness as the Elliptical Attention pays more attention to contextually relevant information rather than focusing on some small subset of informative features. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of Elliptical Attention over the baseline dot-product attention and state-of-the-art attention methods on various practical tasks, including object classification, image segmentation, and language modeling across different data modalities.

- **Summary**: Self-attention is key to the remarkable success of transformers in sequence modeling tasks including many applications in natural language processing and computer vision. Like neural network layers, these attention mechanisms are often developed by heuristics and experience. To provide a principled framework for constructing attention layers in transformers, we show that the self-attention corresponds to the support vector expansion derived from a support vector regression problem, whose primal formulation has the form of a neural network layer. Using our framework, we derive popular attention layers used in practice and propose two new attentions: 1) the Batch Normalized Attention (Attention-BN) derived from the batch normalization layer and 2) the Attention with Scaled Head (Attention-SH) derived from using less training data to fit the SVR model. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of the Attention-BN and Attention-SH in reducing head redundancy, increasing the model's accuracy, and improving the model's efficiency in a variety of practical applications including image and time-series classification.

- **Summary**: Large Language Models (LLM) and Vision Language Models (VLM) enable robots to ground natural language prompts into control actions to achieve tasks in an open world. However, when applied to a long-horizon collaborative task, this formulation results in excessive prompting for initiating or clarifying robot actions at every step of the task. We propose Language-driven Intention Tracking (LIT), leveraging LLMs and VLMs to model the human user's long-term behavior and to predict the next human intention to guide the robot for proactive collaboration. We demonstrate smooth coordination between a LIT-based collaborative robot and the human user in collaborative cooking tasks.

- **Summary**: Object Pose Estimation is a crucial component in robotic grasping and augmented reality. Learning based approaches typically require training data from a highly accurate CAD model or labeled training data acquired using a complex setup. We address this by learning to estimate pose from weakly labeled data without a known CAD model. We propose to use a NeRF to learn object shape implicitly which is later used to learn view-invariant features in conjunction with CNN using a contrastive loss. While NeRF helps in learning features that are view-consistent, CNN ensures that the learned features respect symmetry. During inference, CNN is used to predict view-invariant features which can be used to establish correspondences with the implicit 3d model in NeRF. The correspondences are then used to estimate the pose in the reference frame of NeRF. Our approach can also handle symmetric objects unlike other approaches using a similar training setup. Specifically, we learn viewpoint invariant, discriminative features using NeRF which are later used for pose estimation. We evaluated our approach on LM, LM-Occlusion, and T-Less dataset and achieved benchmark accuracy despite using weakly labeled data.

- **Summary**: AI personal assistants deployed via robots or wearables require embodied understanding to collaborate with humans effectively. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) primarily focus on third-person view videos, neglecting the richness of egocentric perceptual experience. To address this gap, we propose three key contributions. First, we introduce the Egocentric Video Understanding Dataset (EVUD) for training VLMs on video captioning and question answering tasks specific to egocentric videos. Second, we present AlanaVLM, a 7B parameter VLM trained using parameter-efficient methods on EVUD. Finally, we evaluate AlanaVLM's capabilities on OpenEQA, a challenging benchmark for embodied video question answering. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming open-source models including strong Socratic models using GPT-4 as a planner by 3.6%. Additionally, we outperform Claude 3 and Gemini Pro Vision 1.0 and showcase competitive results compared to Gemini Pro 1.5 and GPT-4V, even surpassing the latter in spatial reasoning. This research paves the way for building efficient VLMs that can be deployed in robots or wearables, leveraging embodied video understanding to collaborate seamlessly with humans in everyday tasks, contributing to the next generation of Embodied AI

- **Summary**: A more robust and holistic language-video representation is the key to pushing video understanding forward. Despite the improvement in training strategies, the quality of the language-video dataset is less attention to. The current plain and simple text descriptions and the visual-only focus for the language-video tasks result in a limited capacity in real-world natural language video retrieval tasks where queries are much more complex. This paper introduces a method to automatically enhance video-language datasets, making them more modality and context-aware for more sophisticated representation learning needs, hence helping all downstream tasks. Our multifaceted video captioning method captures entities, actions, speech transcripts, aesthetics, and emotional cues, providing detailed and correlating information from the text side to the video side for training. We also develop an agent-like strategy using language models to generate high-quality, factual textual descriptions, reducing human intervention and enabling scalability. The method's effectiveness in improving language-video representation is evaluated through text-video retrieval using the MSR-VTT dataset and several multi-modal retrieval models.

- **Summary**: In the field of single image super-resolution (SISR), transformer-based models, have demonstrated significant advancements. However, the potential and efficiency of these models in applied fields such as real-world image super-resolution are less noticed and there are substantial opportunities for improvement. Recently, composite fusion attention transformer (CFAT), outperformed previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in classic image super-resolution. This paper extends the CFAT model to an improved GAN-based model called IG-CFAT to effectively exploit the performance of transformers in real-world image super-resolution. IG-CFAT incorporates a semantic-aware discriminator to reconstruct image details more accurately, significantly improving perceptual quality. Moreover, our model utilizes an adaptive degradation model to better simulate real-world degradations. Our methodology adds wavelet losses to conventional loss functions of GAN-based super-resolution models to reconstruct high-frequency details more efficiently. Empirical results demonstrate that IG-CFAT sets new benchmarks in real-world image super-resolution, outperforming SOTA models in both quantitative and qualitative metrics.

- **Summary**: Current research in breast cancer Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), especially with Artificial Intelligence (AI), faces challenges due to the lack of expert segmentations. To address this, we introduce the MAMA-MIA dataset, comprising 1506 multi-center dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI cases with expert segmentations of primary tumors and non-mass enhancement areas. These cases were sourced from four publicly available collections in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Initially, we trained a deep learning model to automatically segment the cases, generating preliminary segmentations that significantly reduced expert segmentation time. Sixteen experts, averaging 9 years of experience in breast cancer, then corrected these segmentations, resulting in the final expert segmentations. Additionally, two radiologists conducted a visual inspection of the automatic segmentations to support future quality control studies. Alongside the expert segmentations, we provide 49 harmonized demographic and clinical variables and the pretrained weights of the well-known nnUNet architecture trained using the DCE-MRI full-images and expert segmentations. This dataset aims to accelerate the development and benchmarking of deep learning models and foster innovation in breast cancer diagnostics and treatment planning.

- **Summary**: Aquaculture production -- the cultivation of aquatic plants and animals -- has grown rapidly since the 1990s, but sparse, self-reported and aggregate production data limits the effective understanding and monitoring of the industry's trends and potential risks. Building on a manual survey of aquaculture production from remote sensing imagery, we train a computer vision model to identify marine aquaculture cages from aerial and satellite imagery, and generate a spatially explicit dataset of finfish production locations in the French Mediterranean from 2000-2021 that includes 4,010 cages (69m2 average cage area). We demonstrate the value of our method as an easily adaptable, cost-effective approach that can improve the speed and reliability of aquaculture surveys, and enables downstream analyses relevant to researchers and regulators. We illustrate its use to compute independent estimates of production, and develop a flexible framework to quantify uncertainty in these estimates. Overall, our study presents an efficient, scalable and highly adaptable method for monitoring aquaculture production from remote sensing imagery.

- **Summary**: Face recognition systems are increasingly used in biometric security for convenience and effectiveness. However, they remain vulnerable to spoofing attacks, where attackers use photos, videos, or masks to impersonate legitimate users. This research addresses these vulnerabilities by exploring the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, fine-tuned with the DINO framework. The DINO framework facilitates self-supervised learning, enabling the model to learn distinguishing features from unlabeled data. We compared the performance of the proposed fine-tuned ViT model using the DINO framework against a traditional CNN model, EfficientNet b2, on the face anti-spoofing task. Numerous tests on standard datasets show that the ViT model performs better than the CNN model in terms of accuracy and resistance to different spoofing methods. Additionally, we collected our own dataset from a biometric application to validate our findings further. This study highlights the superior performance of transformer-based architecture in identifying complex spoofing cues, leading to significant advancements in biometric security.

- **Summary**: Video representation is a long-standing problem that is crucial for various down-stream tasks, such as tracking,depth prediction,segmentation,view synthesis,and editing. However, current methods either struggle to model complex motions due to the absence of 3D structure or rely on implicit 3D representations that are ill-suited for manipulation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel explicit 3D representation-video Gaussian representation -- that embeds a video into 3D Gaussians. Our proposed representation models video appearance in a 3D canonical space using explicit Gaussians as proxies and associates each Gaussian with 3D motions for video motion. This approach offers a more intrinsic and explicit representation than layered atlas or volumetric pixel matrices. To obtain such a representation, we distill 2D priors, such as optical flow and depth, from foundation models to regularize learning in this ill-posed setting. Extensive applications demonstrate the versatility of our new video representation. It has been proven effective in numerous video processing tasks, including tracking, consistent video depth and feature refinement, motion and appearance editing, and stereoscopic video generation.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have yielded unprecedented performance for zero-shot image classification, yet their generalization capability may still be seriously challenged when confronted to domain shifts. In response, we present Weight Average Test-Time Adaptation (WATT) of CLIP, a pioneering approach facilitating full test-time adaptation (TTA) of this VLM. Our method employs a diverse set of templates for text prompts, augmenting the existing framework of CLIP. Predictions are utilized as pseudo labels for model updates, followed by weight averaging to consolidate the learned information globally. Furthermore, we introduce a text ensemble strategy, enhancing overall test performance by aggregating diverse textual cues. Our findings underscore the efficacy of WATT in enhancing performance across diverse datasets, including CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-10.1, CIFAR-100-C, VisDA-C, and several other challenging datasets, effectively covering a wide range of domain shifts. Notably, these enhancements are achieved without necessitating additional model transformations or trainable modules. Moreover, compared to other Test-Time Adaptation methods, our approach can operate effectively with just a single image. Highlighting the potential of innovative test-time strategies, this research emphasizes their role in fortifying the adaptability of VLMs. The implementation is available at: \url{https://github.com/Mehrdad-Noori/WATT.git}.

- **Summary**: LiDAR-based 3D object detection has seen impressive advances in recent times. However, deploying trained 3D detectors in the real world often yields unsatisfactory performance when the distribution of the test data significantly deviates from the training data due to different weather conditions, object sizes, \textit{etc}. A key factor in this performance degradation is the diminished generalizability of pre-trained models, which creates a sharp loss landscape during training. Such sharpness, when encountered during testing, can precipitate significant performance declines, even with minor data variations. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose \textbf{dual-perturbation optimization (DPO)} for \textbf{\underline{T}est-\underline{t}ime \underline{A}daptation in \underline{3}D \underline{O}bject \underline{D}etection (TTA-3OD)}. We minimize the sharpness to cultivate a flat loss landscape to ensure model resiliency to minor data variations, thereby enhancing the generalization of the adaptation process. To fully capture the inherent variability of the test point clouds, we further introduce adversarial perturbation to the input BEV features to better simulate the noisy test environment. As the dual perturbation strategy relies on trustworthy supervision signals, we utilize a reliable Hungarian matcher to filter out pseudo-labels sensitive to perturbations. Additionally, we introduce early Hungarian cutoff to avoid error accumulation from incorrect pseudo-labels by halting the adaptation process. Extensive experiments across three types of transfer tasks demonstrate that the proposed DPO significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches, specifically on Waymo $\rightarrow$ KITTI, outperforming the most competitive baseline by 57.72\% in $\text{AP}_\text{3D}$ and reaching 91\% of the fully supervised upper bound.

- **Summary**: Traditional approaches to safety event analysis in autonomous systems have relied on complex machine learning models and extensive datasets for high accuracy and reliability. However, the advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offers a novel approach by integrating textual, visual, and audio modalities, thereby providing automated analyses of driving videos. Our framework leverages the reasoning power of MLLMs, directing their output through context-specific prompts to ensure accurate, reliable, and actionable insights for hazard detection. By incorporating models like Gemini-Pro-Vision 1.5 and Llava, our methodology aims to automate the safety critical events and mitigate common issues such as hallucinations in MLLM outputs. Preliminary results demonstrate the framework's potential in zero-shot learning and accurate scenario analysis, though further validation on larger datasets is necessary. Furthermore, more investigations are required to explore the performance enhancements of the proposed framework through few-shot learning and fine-tuned models. This research underscores the significance of MLLMs in advancing the analysis of the naturalistic driving videos by improving safety-critical event detecting and understanding the interaction with complex environments.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a method for dynamic surface reconstruction of large-scale urban scenes from LiDAR. Depth-based reconstructions tend to focus on small-scale objects or large-scale SLAM reconstructions that treat moving objects as outliers. We take a holistic perspective and optimize a compositional model of a dynamic scene that decomposes the world into rigidly moving objects and the background. To achieve this, we take inspiration from recent novel view synthesis methods and pose the reconstruction problem as a global optimization, minimizing the distance between our predicted surface and the input LiDAR scans. We show how this global optimization can be decomposed into registration and surface reconstruction steps, which are handled well by off-the-shelf methods without any re-training. By careful modeling of continuous-time motion, our reconstructions can compensate for the rolling shutter effects of rotating LiDAR sensors. This allows for the first system (to our knowledge) that properly motion compensates LiDAR scans for rigidly-moving objects, complementing widely-used techniques for motion compensation of static scenes. Beyond pursuing dynamic reconstruction as a goal in and of itself, we also show that such a system can be used to auto-label partially annotated sequences and produce ground truth annotation for hard-to-label problems such as depth completion and scene flow.
