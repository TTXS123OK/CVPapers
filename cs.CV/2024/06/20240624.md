- **Summary**: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable results for video generation. Despite the encouraging performances, the generated videos are typically constrained to a small number of frames, resulting in clips lasting merely a few seconds. The primary challenges in producing longer videos include the substantial memory requirements and the extended processing time required on a single GPU. A straightforward solution would be to split the workload across multiple GPUs, which, however, leads to two issues: (1) ensuring all GPUs communicate effectively to share timing and context information, and (2) modifying existing video diffusion models, which are usually trained on short sequences, to create longer videos without additional training. To tackle these, in this paper we introduce Video-Infinity, a distributed inference pipeline that enables parallel processing across multiple GPUs for long-form video generation. Specifically, we propose two coherent mechanisms: Clip parallelism and Dual-scope attention. Clip parallelism optimizes the gathering and sharing of context information across GPUs which minimizes communication overhead, while Dual-scope attention modulates the temporal self-attention to balance local and global contexts efficiently across the devices. Together, the two mechanisms join forces to distribute the workload and enable the fast generation of long videos. Under an 8 x Nvidia 6000 Ada GPU (48G) setup, our method generates videos up to 2,300 frames in approximately 5 minutes, enabling long video generation at a speed 100 times faster than the prior methods.

- **Summary**: Assessment of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is crucial for diagnosing chronic kidney disease (CKD). The lack of domain-independent automatic segmentation tools for the GBM necessitates an AI-based solution to automate the process. In this study, we introduce GBMSeg, a training-free framework designed to automatically segment the GBM in TEM images guided only by a one-shot annotated reference. Specifically, GBMSeg first exploits the robust feature matching capabilities of the pretrained foundation model to generate initial prompt points, then introduces a series of novel automatic prompt engineering techniques across the feature and physical space to optimize the prompt scheme. Finally, GBMSeg employs a class-agnostic foundation segmentation model with the generated prompt scheme to obtain accurate segmentation results. Experimental results on our collected 2538 TEM images confirm that GBMSeg achieves superior segmentation performance with a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 87.27% using only one labeled reference image in a training-free manner, outperforming recently proposed one-shot or few-shot methods. In summary, GBMSeg introduces a distinctive automatic prompt framework that facilitates robust domain-independent segmentation performance without training, particularly advancing the automatic prompting of foundation segmentation models for medical images. Future work involves automating the thickness measurement of segmented GBM and quantifying pathological indicators, holding significant potential for advancing pathology assessments in clinical applications.

- **Summary**: Text-to-Image Diffusion Models (T2I DMs) have garnered significant attention for their ability to generate high-quality images from textual descriptions. However, these models often produce images that do not fully align with the input prompts, resulting in semantic inconsistencies. The most prominent issue among these semantic inconsistencies is catastrophic-neglect, where the images generated by T2I DMs miss key objects mentioned in the prompt. We first conduct an empirical study on this issue, exploring the prevalence of catastrophic-neglect, potential mitigation strategies with feature enhancement, and the insights gained. Guided by the empirical findings, we propose an automated repair approach named Patcher to address catastrophic-neglect in T2I DMs. Specifically, Patcher first determines whether there are any neglected objects in the prompt, and then applies attention-guided feature enhancement to these neglected objects, resulting in a repaired prompt. Experimental results on three versions of Stable Diffusion demonstrate that Patcher effectively repairs the issue of catastrophic-neglect, achieving 10.1%-16.3% higher Correct Rate in image generation compared to baselines.

- **Summary**: 3D generation guided by text-to-image diffusion models enables the creation of visually compelling assets. However previous methods explore generation based on image or text. The boundaries of creativity are limited by what can be expressed through words or the images that can be sourced. We present YouDream, a method to generate high-quality anatomically controllable animals. YouDream is guided using a text-to-image diffusion model controlled by 2D views of a 3D pose prior. Our method generates 3D animals that are not possible to create using previous text-to-3D generative methods. Additionally, our method is capable of preserving anatomic consistency in the generated animals, an area where prior text-to-3D approaches often struggle. Moreover, we design a fully automated pipeline for generating commonly found animals. To circumvent the need for human intervention to create a 3D pose, we propose a multi-agent LLM that adapts poses from a limited library of animal 3D poses to represent the desired animal. A user study conducted on the outcomes of YouDream demonstrates the preference of the animal models generated by our method over others.

- **Summary**: 4D LiDAR semantic segmentation, also referred to as multi-scan semantic segmentation, plays a crucial role in enhancing the environmental understanding capabilities of autonomous vehicles. It entails identifying the semantic category of each point in the LiDAR scan and distinguishing whether it is dynamic, a critical aspect in downstream tasks such as path planning and autonomous navigation. Existing methods for 4D semantic segmentation often rely on computationally intensive 4D convolutions for multi-scan input, resulting in poor real-time performance. In this article, we introduce SegNet4D, a novel real-time multi-scan semantic segmentation method leveraging a projection-based approach for fast motion feature encoding, showcasing outstanding performance. SegNet4D treats 4D semantic segmentation as two distinct tasks: single-scan semantic segmentation and moving object segmentation, each addressed by dedicated head. These results are then fused in the proposed motion-semantic fusion module to achieve comprehensive multi-scan semantic segmentation. Besides, we propose extracting instance information from the current scan and incorporating it into the network for instance-aware segmentation. Our approach exhibits state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets and stands out as a real-time multi-scan semantic segmentation method. The implementation of SegNet4D will be made available at \url{https://github.com/nubot-nudt/SegNet4D}.

- **Summary**: Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) achieved impressive results in novel view synthesis. Block-NeRF showed the capability of leveraging NeRF to build large city-scale models. For large-scale modeling, a mass of image data is necessary. Collecting images from specially designed data-collection vehicles can not support large-scale applications. How to acquire massive high-quality data remains an opening problem. Noting that the automotive industry has a huge amount of image data, crowd-sourcing is a convenient way for large-scale data collection. In this paper, we present a crowd-sourced framework, which utilizes substantial data captured by production vehicles to reconstruct the scene with the NeRF model. This approach solves the key problem of large-scale reconstruction, that is where the data comes from and how to use them. Firstly, the crowd-sourced massive data is filtered to remove redundancy and keep a balanced distribution in terms of time and space. Then a structure-from-motion module is performed to refine camera poses. Finally, images, as well as poses, are used to train the NeRF model in a certain block. We highlight that we present a comprehensive framework that integrates multiple modules, including data selection, sparse 3D reconstruction, sequence appearance embedding, depth supervision of ground surface, and occlusion completion. The complete system is capable of effectively processing and reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from crowd-sourced data. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted to validate the performance of our system. Moreover, we proposed an application, named first-view navigation, which leveraged the NeRF model to generate 3D street view and guide the driver with a synthesized video.

- **Summary**: User Generated Content (UGC) videos are susceptible to complicated and variant degradations and contents, which prevents the existing blind video quality assessment (BVQA) models from good performance since the lack of the adapability of distortions and contents. To mitigate this, we propose a novel prior-augmented perceptual vision transformer (PriorFormer) for the BVQA of UGC, which boots its adaptability and representation capability for divergent contents and distortions. Concretely, we introduce two powerful priors, i.e., the content and distortion priors, by extracting the content and distortion embeddings from two pre-trained feature extractors. Then we adopt these two powerful embeddings as the adaptive prior tokens, which are transferred to the vision transformer backbone jointly with implicit quality features. Based on the above strategy, the proposed PriorFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public UGC VQA datasets including KoNViD-1K, LIVE-VQC and YouTube-UGC.

- **Summary**: With the surge in the amount of video data, video summarization techniques, including visual-modal(VM) and textual-modal(TM) summarization, are attracting more and more attention. However, unimodal summarization inevitably loses the rich semantics of the video. In this paper, we focus on a more comprehensive video summarization task named Bimodal Semantic Summarization of Videos (BiSSV). Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset, BIDS, in (video, VM-Summary, TM-Summary) triplet format. Unlike traditional processing methods, our construction procedure contains a VM-Summary extraction algorithm aiming to preserve the most salient content within long videos. Based on BIDS, we propose a Unified framework UBiSS for the BiSSV task, which models the saliency information in the video and generates a TM-summary and VM-summary simultaneously. We further optimize our model with a list-wise ranking-based objective to improve its capacity to capture highlights. Lastly, we propose a metric, $NDCG_{MS}$, to provide a joint evaluation of the bimodal summary. Experiments show that our unified framework achieves better performance than multi-stage summarization pipelines. Code and data are available at https://github.com/MeiYutingg/UBiSS.

- **Summary**: Although current text detection algorithms demonstrate effectiveness in general scenarios, their performance declines when confronted with artistic-style text featuring complex structures. This paper proposes a method that utilizes Criss-Cross Attention and residual dense block to address the incomplete and misdiagnosis of artistic-style text detection by current algorithms. Specifically, our method mainly consists of a feature extraction backbone, a feature enhancement network, a multi-scale feature fusion module, and a boundary discrimination module. The feature enhancement network significantly enhances the model's perceptual capabilities in complex environments by fusing horizontal and vertical contextual information, allowing it to capture detailed features overlooked in artistic-style text. We incorporate residual dense block into the Feature Pyramid Network to suppress the effect of background noise during feature fusion. Aiming to omit the complex post-processing, we explore a boundary discrimination module that guides the correct generation of boundary proposals. Furthermore, given that movie poster titles often use stylized art fonts, we collected a Movie-Poster dataset to address the scarcity of artistic-style text data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method performs superiorly on the Movie-Poster dataset and produces excellent results on multiple benchmark datasets. The code and the Movie-Poster dataset will be available at: https://github.com/biedaxiaohua/Artistic-style-text-detection

- **Summary**: Multi-phase computed tomography (CT) has been widely used for the preoperative diagnosis of kidney cancer due to its non-invasive nature and ability to characterize renal lesions. However, since enhancement patterns of renal lesions across CT phases are different even for the same lesion type, the visual assessment by radiologists suffers from inter-observer variability in clinical practice. Although deep learning-based approaches have been recently explored for differential diagnosis of kidney cancer, they do not explicitly model the relationships between CT phases in the network design, limiting the diagnostic performance. In this paper, we propose a novel lesion-aware cross-phase attention network (LACPANet) that can effectively capture temporal dependencies of renal lesions across CT phases to accurately classify the lesions into five major pathological subtypes from time-series multi-phase CT images. We introduce a 3D inter-phase lesion-aware attention mechanism to learn effective 3D lesion features that are used to estimate attention weights describing the inter-phase relations of the enhancement patterns. We also present a multi-scale attention scheme to capture and aggregate temporal patterns of lesion features at different spatial scales for further improvement. Extensive experiments on multi-phase CT scans of kidney cancer patients from the collected dataset demonstrate that our LACPANet outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in diagnostic accuracy.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of Text-to-Image(T2I) generative models has enabled the synthesis of high-quality images guided by textual descriptions. Despite this significant progress, these models are often susceptible in generating contents that contradict the input text, which poses a challenge to their reliability and practical deployment. To address this problem, we introduce a novel diffusion-based framework to significantly enhance the alignment of generated images with their corresponding descriptions, addressing the inconsistency between visual output and textual input. Our framework is built upon a comprehensive analysis of inconsistency phenomena, categorizing them based on their manifestation in the image. Leveraging a state-of-the-art large language module, we first extract objects and construct a knowledge graph to predict the locations of these objects in potentially generated images. We then integrate a state-of-the-art controllable image generation model with a visual text generation module to generate an image that is consistent with the original prompt, guided by the predicted object locations. Through extensive experiments on an advanced multimodal hallucination benchmark, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in accurately generating the images without the inconsistency with the original prompt.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have extended their capabilities to video understanding. Yet, these models are often plagued by "hallucinations", where irrelevant or nonsensical content is generated, deviating from the actual video context. This work introduces VideoHallucer, the first comprehensive benchmark for hallucination detection in large video-language models (LVLMs). VideoHallucer categorizes hallucinations into two main types: intrinsic and extrinsic, offering further subcategories for detailed analysis, including object-relation, temporal, semantic detail, extrinsic factual, and extrinsic non-factual hallucinations. We adopt an adversarial binary VideoQA method for comprehensive evaluation, where pairs of basic and hallucinated questions are crafted strategically. By evaluating eleven LVLMs on VideoHallucer, we reveal that i) the majority of current models exhibit significant issues with hallucinations; ii) while scaling datasets and parameters improves models' ability to detect basic visual cues and counterfactuals, it provides limited benefit for detecting extrinsic factual hallucinations; iii) existing models are more adept at detecting facts than identifying hallucinations. As a byproduct, these analyses further instruct the development of our self-PEP framework, achieving an average of 5.38% improvement in hallucination resistance across all model architectures.



### Directed Domain Fine-Tuning: Tailoring Separate Modalities for Specific Training Tasks

- **Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) and large visual language models (LVLMs) have been at the forefront of the artificial intelligence field, particularly for tasks like text generation, video captioning, and question-answering. Typically, it is more applicable to train these models on broader knowledge bases or datasets to increase generalizability, learn relationships between topics, and recognize patterns. Instead, we propose to provide instructional datasets specific to the task of each modality within a distinct domain and then fine-tune the parameters of the model using LORA. With our approach, we can eliminate all noise irrelevant to the given task while also ensuring that the model generates with enhanced precision. For this work, we use Video-LLaVA to generate recipes given cooking videos without transcripts. Video-LLaVA's multimodal architecture allows us to provide cooking images to its image encoder, cooking videos to its video encoder, and general cooking questions to its text encoder. Thus, we aim to remove all noise unrelated to cooking while improving our model's capabilities to generate specific ingredient lists and detailed instructions. As a result, our approach to fine-tuning Video-LLaVA leads to gains over the baseline Video-LLaVA by 2% on the YouCook2 dataset. While this may seem like a marginal increase, our model trains on an image instruction dataset 2.5% the size of Video-LLaVA's and a video instruction dataset 23.76% of Video-LLaVA's.

- **Summary**: In this research, we explore different ways to improve generative adversarial networks for video super-resolution tasks from a base single image super-resolution GAN model. Our primary objective is to identify potential techniques that enhance these models and to analyze which of these techniques yield the most significant improvements. We evaluate our results using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). Our findings indicate that the most effective techniques include temporal smoothing, long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, and a temporal loss function. The integration of these methods results in an 11.97% improvement in PSNR and an 8% improvement in SSIM compared to the baseline video super-resolution generative adversarial network (GAN) model. This substantial improvement suggests potential further applications to enhance current state-of-the-art models.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We present MIRReS, a novel two-stage inverse rendering framework that jointly reconstructs and optimizes the explicit geometry, material, and lighting from multi-view images. Unlike previous methods that rely on implicit irradiance fields or simplified path tracing algorithms, our method extracts an explicit geometry (triangular mesh) in stage one, and introduces a more realistic physically-based inverse rendering model that utilizes multi-bounce path tracing and Monte Carlo integration. By leveraging multi-bounce path tracing, our method effectively estimates indirect illumination, including self-shadowing and internal reflections, which improves the intrinsic decomposition of shape, material, and lighting. Moreover, we incorporate reservoir sampling into our framework to address the noise in Monte Carlo integration, enhancing convergence and facilitating gradient-based optimization with low sample counts. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of several scenarios, especially in challenging scenarios with complex shadows, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on decomposition results. Additionally, our optimized explicit geometry enables applications such as scene editing, relighting, and material editing with modern graphics engines or CAD software.

  pose estimation". Project page: https://jcorsetti.github.io/oryon
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: The generalisation to unseen objects in the 6D pose estimation task is very challenging. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable using natural language descriptions to support 6D pose estimation of unseen objects, these solutions underperform compared to model-based methods. In this work we present Horyon, an open-vocabulary VLM-based architecture that addresses relative pose estimation between two scenes of an unseen object, described by a textual prompt only. We use the textual prompt to identify the unseen object in the scenes and then obtain high-resolution multi-scale features. These features are used to extract cross-scene matches for registration. We evaluate our model on a benchmark with a large variety of unseen objects across four datasets, namely REAL275, Toyota-Light, Linemod, and YCB-Video. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets, outperforming by 12.6 in Average Recall the previous best-performing approach.

- **Summary**: The advancement of developing efficient medical image segmentation has evolved from initial dependence on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to the present investigation of hybrid models that combine CNNs with Vision Transformers. Furthermore, there is an increasing focus on creating architectures that are both high-performing in medical image segmentation tasks and computationally efficient to be deployed on systems with limited resources. Although transformers have several advantages like capturing global dependencies in the input data, they face challenges such as high computational and memory complexity. This paper investigates the integration of CNNs and Vision Extended Long Short-Term Memory (Vision-xLSTM) models by introducing a novel approach called UVixLSTM. The Vision-xLSTM blocks captures temporal and global relationships within the patches extracted from the CNN feature maps. The convolutional feature reconstruction path upsamples the output volume from the Vision-xLSTM blocks to produce the segmentation output. Our primary objective is to propose that Vision-xLSTM forms a reliable backbone for medical image segmentation tasks, offering excellent segmentation performance and reduced computational complexity. UVixLSTM exhibits superior performance compared to state-of-the-art networks on the publicly-available Synapse dataset. Code is available at: https://github.com/duttapallabi2907/UVixLSTM

- **Summary**: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning has witnessed great stride with the development of meta-learning. However, most existing methods pay more attention to learning domain-adaptive inductive bias (meta-knowledge) through feature-wise manipulation or task diversity improvement while neglecting the phenomenon that deep networks tend to rely more on high-frequency cues to make the classification decision, which thus degenerates the robustness of learned inductive bias since high-frequency information is vulnerable and easy to be disturbed by noisy information. Hence in this paper, we make one of the first attempts to propose a Frequency-Aware Prompting method with mutual attention for Cross-Domain Few-Shot classification, which can let networks simulate the human visual perception of selecting different frequency cues when facing new recognition tasks. Specifically, a frequency-aware prompting mechanism is first proposed, in which high-frequency components of the decomposed source image are switched either with normal distribution sampling or zeroing to get frequency-aware augment samples. Then, a mutual attention module is designed to learn generalizable inductive bias under CD-FSL settings. More importantly, the proposed method is a plug-and-play module that can be directly applied to most off-the-shelf CD-FLS methods. Experimental results on CD-FSL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method as well as robustly improve the performance of existing CD-FLS methods.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has achieved impressive results in nuclei segmentation, but the massive requirement for pixel-wise labels remains a significant challenge. To alleviate the annotation burden, existing methods generate pseudo masks for model training using point labels. However, the generated masks are inevitably different from the ground truth, and these dissimilarities are not handled reasonably during the network training, resulting in the subpar performance of the segmentation model. To tackle this issue, we propose a framework named DoNuSeg, enabling \textbf{D}ynamic pseudo label \textbf{O}ptimization in point-supervised \textbf{Nu}clei \textbf{Seg}mentation. Specifically, DoNuSeg takes advantage of class activation maps (CAMs) to adaptively capture regions with semantics similar to annotated points. To leverage semantic diversity in the hierarchical feature levels, we design a dynamic selection module to choose the optimal one among CAMs from different encoder blocks as pseudo masks. Meanwhile, a CAM-guided contrastive module is proposed to further enhance the accuracy of pseudo masks. In addition to exploiting the semantic information provided by CAMs, we consider location priors inherent to point labels, developing a task-decoupled structure for effectively differentiating nuclei. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DoNuSeg outperforms state-of-the-art point-supervised methods. The code is available at https://github.com/shinning0821/MICCAI24-DoNuSeg.

- **Summary**: Effective expression feature representations generated by a triplet-based deep metric learning are highly advantageous for facial expression recognition (FER). The performance of triplet-based deep metric learning is contingent upon identifying the best threshold for triplet loss. Threshold validation, however, is tough and challenging, as the ideal threshold changes among datasets and even across classes within the same dataset. In this paper, we present the multi-threshold deep metric learning technique, which not only avoids the difficult threshold validation but also vastly increases the capacity of triplet loss learning to construct expression feature representations. We find that each threshold of the triplet loss intrinsically determines a distinctive distribution of inter-class variations and corresponds, thus, to a unique expression feature representation. Therefore, rather than selecting a single optimal threshold from a valid threshold range, we thoroughly sample thresholds across the range, allowing the representation characteristics manifested by thresholds within the range to be fully extracted and leveraged for FER. To realize this approach, we partition the embedding layer of the deep metric learning network into a collection of slices and model training these embedding slices as an end-to-end multi-threshold deep metric learning problem. Each embedding slice corresponds to a sample threshold and is learned by enforcing the corresponding triplet loss, yielding a set of distinct expression features, one for each embedding slice. It makes the embedding layer, which is composed of a set of slices, a more informative and discriminative feature, hence enhancing the FER accuracy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach on both posed and spontaneous facial expression datasets.



### Exploring Test-Time Adaptation for Object Detection in Continually Changing Environments

- **Summary**: For real-world applications, neural network models are commonly deployed in dynamic environments, where the distribution of the target domain undergoes temporal changes. Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) has recently emerged as a promising technique to gradually adapt a source-trained model to test data drawn from a continually changing target domain. Despite recent advancements in addressing CTTA, two critical issues remain: 1) The use of a fixed threshold for pseudo-labeling in existing methodologies leads to the generation of low-quality pseudo-labels, as model confidence varies across categories and domains; 2) While current solutions utilize stochastic parameter restoration to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, their capacity to preserve critical information is undermined by its intrinsic randomness. To tackle these challenges, we present CTAOD, aiming to enhance the performance of detection models in CTTA scenarios. Inspired by prior CTTA works for effective adaptation, CTAOD is founded on the mean-teacher framework, characterized by three core components. Firstly, the object-level contrastive learning module tailored for object detection extracts object-level features using the teacher's region of interest features and optimizes them through contrastive learning. Secondly, the dynamic threshold strategy updates the category-specific threshold based on predicted confidence scores to improve the quality of pseudo-labels. Lastly, we design a data-driven stochastic restoration mechanism to selectively reset inactive parameters using the gradients as weights for a random mask matrix, thereby ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on four CTTA tasks for object detection, where CTAOD outperforms existing methods, especially achieving a 3.0 mAP improvement on the Cityscapes-to-Cityscapes-C CTTA task.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on objective multimodal perception tasks, but their ability to interpret subjective, emotionally nuanced multimodal content remains largely unexplored. Thus, it impedes their ability to effectively understand and react to the intricate emotions expressed by humans through multimodal media. To bridge this gap, we introduce EmoBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically to evaluate the emotional capabilities of MLLMs across five popular emotional tasks, using a diverse dataset of 287k images and videos paired with corresponding textual instructions. Meanwhile, we propose EmoLLM, a novel model for multimodal emotional understanding, incorporating with two core techniques. 1) Multi-perspective Visual Projection, it captures diverse emotional cues from visual data from multiple perspectives. 2) EmoPrompt, it guides MLLMs to reason about emotions in the correct direction. Experimental results demonstrate that EmoLLM significantly elevates multimodal emotional understanding performance, with an average improvement of 12.1% across multiple foundation models on EmoBench. Our work contributes to the advancement of MLLMs by facilitating a deeper and more nuanced comprehension of intricate human emotions, paving the way for the development of artificial emotional intelligence capabilities with wide-ranging applications in areas such as human-computer interaction, mental health support, and empathetic AI systems. Code, data, and model will be released.

- **Summary**: The issue of hallucinations is a prevalent concern in existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Previous efforts have primarily focused on investigating object hallucinations, which can be easily alleviated by introducing object detectors. However, these efforts neglect hallucinations in inter-object relationships, which is essential for visual comprehension. In this work, we introduce R-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating Vision Relationship Hallucination. R-Bench features image-level questions that focus on the existence of relationships and instance-level questions that assess local visual comprehension. We identify three types of relationship co-occurrences that lead to hallucinations: relationship-relationship, subject-relationship, and relationship-object. The visual instruction tuning dataset's long-tail distribution significantly impacts LVLMs' understanding of visual relationships. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that current LVLMs tend to disregard visual content and overly rely on the common sense knowledge of Large Language Models. They also struggle with reasoning about spatial relationships based on contextual information.

- **Summary**: The problem of blind image super-resolution aims to recover high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) images with unknown degradation modes. Most existing methods model the image degradation process using blur kernels. However, this explicit modeling approach struggles to cover the complex and varied degradation processes encountered in the real world, such as high-order combinations of JPEG compression, blur, and noise. Implicit modeling for the degradation process can effectively overcome this issue, but a key challenge of implicit modeling is the lack of accurate ground truth labels for the degradation process to conduct supervised training. To overcome this limitations inherent in implicit modeling, we propose an \textbf{U}ncertainty-based degradation representation for blind \textbf{S}uper-\textbf{R}esolution framework (\textbf{USR}). By suppressing the uncertainty of local degradation representations in images, USR facilitated self-supervised learning of degradation representations. The USR consists of two components: Adaptive Uncertainty-Aware Degradation Extraction (AUDE) and a feature extraction network composed of Variable Depth Dynamic Convolution (VDDC) blocks. To extract Uncertainty-based Degradation Representation from LR images, the AUDE utilizes the Self-supervised Uncertainty Contrast module with Uncertainty Suppression Loss to suppress the inherent model uncertainty of the Degradation Extractor. Furthermore, VDDC block integrates degradation information through dynamic convolution. Rhe VDDC also employs an Adaptive Intensity Scaling operation that adaptively adjusts the degradation representation according to the network hierarchy, thereby facilitating the effective integration of degradation information. Quantitative and qualitative experiments affirm the superiority of our approach.

- **Summary**: The prevalence of sarcasm in social media, conveyed through text-image combinations, presents significant challenges for sentiment analysis and intention mining. Current multi-modal sarcasm detection methods have been proven to struggle with biases from spurious cues, leading to a superficial understanding of the complex interactions between text and image. To address these issues, we propose InterCLIP-MEP, a robust framework for multi-modal sarcasm detection. InterCLIP-MEP introduces a refined variant of CLIP, Interactive CLIP (InterCLIP), as the backbone, enhancing sample representations by embedding cross-modality information in each encoder. Furthermore, a novel training strategy is designed to adapt InterCLIP for a Memory-Enhanced Predictor (MEP). MEP uses dynamic dual-channel memory to store valuable historical knowledge of test samples and then leverages this memory as a non-parametric classifier to derive the final prediction. By using InterCLIP to encode text-image interactions more effectively and incorporating MEP, InterCLIP-MEP offers a more robust recognition of multi-modal sarcasm. Experiments demonstrate that InterCLIP-MEP achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MMSD2.0 benchmark. Code and data are available at https://github.com/CoderChen01/InterCLIP-MEP.

- **Summary**: Purpose: To describe SLOctolyzer: an open-source analysis toolkit for en face retinal vessels appearing in infrared reflectance scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) images.   Methods: SLOctolyzer includes two main modules: segmentation and measurement. The segmentation module use deep learning methods to delineate retinal anatomy, while the measurement module quantifies key retinal vascular features such as vessel complexity, density, tortuosity, and calibre. We evaluate the segmentation module using unseen data and measure its reproducibility.   Results: SLOctolyzer's segmentation module performed well against unseen internal test data (Dice for all-vessels, 0.9097; arteries, 0.8376; veins, 0.8525; optic disc, 0.9430; fovea, 0.8837). External validation against severe retinal pathology showed decreased performance (Dice for arteries, 0.7180; veins, 0.7470; optic disc, 0.9032). SLOctolyzer had good reproducibility (mean difference for fractal dimension, -0.0007; vessel density, -0.0003; vessel calibre, -0.3154 $\mu$m; tortuosity density, 0.0013). SLOctolyzer can process a macula-centred SLO image in under 20 seconds and a disc-centred SLO image in under 30 seconds using a standard laptop CPU.   Conclusions: To our knowledge, SLOctolyzer is the first open-source tool to convert raw SLO images into reproducible and clinically meaningful retinal vascular parameters. SLO images are captured simultaneous to optical coherence tomography (OCT), and we believe our software will be useful for extracting retinal vascular measurements from large OCT image sets and linking them to ocular or systemic diseases. It requires no specialist knowledge or proprietary software, and allows manual correction of segmentations and re-computing of vascular metrics.

- **Summary**: To create culturally inclusive vision-language models (VLMs), the foremost requirement is developing a test benchmark that can diagnose the models' ability to respond to questions reflecting cultural elements. This paper addresses the necessity for such benchmarks, noting that existing research has relied on human annotators' manual efforts, which impedes diversity and efficiency. We propose a semi-automated pipeline for constructing cultural VLM benchmarks to enhance diversity and efficiency. This pipeline leverages human-VLM collaboration, where VLMs generate questions based on guidelines, human-annotated examples, and image-wise relevant knowledge, which are then reviewed by native speakers for quality and cultural relevance. The effectiveness of our adaptable pipeline is demonstrated through a specific application: creating a dataset tailored to Korean culture, dubbed K-Viscuit. The resulting benchmark features two types of questions: Type 1 questions measure visual recognition abilities, while Type 2 assess fine-grained visual reasoning skills. This ensures a thorough diagnosis of VLM models across various aspects. Our evaluation using K-Viscuit revealed that open-source models notably lag behind proprietary models in understanding Korean culture, highlighting areas for improvement. We provided diverse analyses of VLM performance across different cultural aspects. Besides, we explored the potential of incorporating external knowledge retrieval to enhance the generation process, suggesting future directions for improving cultural interpretation ability of VLMs. Our dataset and code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: The contemporary state-of-the-art of Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) technology facilitates remarkable progress by deriving emotional mappings of facial expressions from video content, underpinned by training on voluminous datasets. Yet, the DFER datasets encompass a substantial volume of noise data. Noise arises from low-quality captures that defy logical labeling, and instances that suffer from mislabeling due to annotation bias, engendering two principal types of uncertainty: the uncertainty regarding data usability and the uncertainty concerning label reliability. Addressing the two types of uncertainty, we have meticulously crafted a two-stage framework aiming at \textbf{S}eeking \textbf{C}ertain data \textbf{I}n extensive \textbf{U}ncertain data (SCIU). This initiative aims to purge the DFER datasets of these uncertainties, thereby ensuring that only clean, verified data is employed in training processes. To mitigate the issue of low-quality samples, we introduce the Coarse-Grained Pruning (CGP) stage, which assesses sample weights and prunes those deemed unusable due to their low weight. For samples with incorrect annotations, the Fine-Grained Correction (FGC) stage evaluates prediction stability to rectify mislabeled data. Moreover, SCIU is conceived as a universally compatible, plug-and-play framework, tailored to integrate seamlessly with prevailing DFER methodologies. Rigorous experiments across prevalent DFER datasets and against numerous benchmark methods substantiates SCIU's capacity to markedly elevate performance metrics.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models excel at producing high-quality images; however, scaling to higher resolutions, such as 4K, often results in over-smoothed content, structural distortions, and repetitive patterns. To this end, we introduce ResMaster, a novel, training-free method that empowers resolution-limited diffusion models to generate high-quality images beyond resolution restrictions. Specifically, ResMaster leverages a low-resolution reference image created by a pre-trained diffusion model to provide structural and fine-grained guidance for crafting high-resolution images on a patch-by-patch basis. To ensure a coherent global structure, ResMaster meticulously aligns the low-frequency components of high-resolution patches with the low-resolution reference at each denoising step. For fine-grained guidance, tailored image prompts based on the low-resolution reference and enriched textual prompts produced by a vision-language model are incorporated. This approach could significantly mitigate local pattern distortions and improve detail refinement. Extensive experiments validate that ResMaster sets a new benchmark for high-resolution image generation and demonstrates promising efficiency.

- **Summary**: Image super-resolution pursuits reconstructing high-fidelity high-resolution counterpart for low-resolution image. In recent years, diffusion-based models have garnered significant attention due to their capabilities with rich prior knowledge. The success of diffusion models based on general text prompts has validated the effectiveness of textual control in the field of text2image. However, given the severe degradation commonly presented in low-resolution images, coupled with the randomness characteristics of diffusion models, current models struggle to adequately discern semantic and degradation information within severely degraded images. This often leads to obstacles such as semantic loss, visual artifacts, and visual hallucinations, which pose substantial challenges for practical use. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to leverage degradation-aligned language prompt for accurate, fine-grained, and high-fidelity image restoration. Complementary priors including semantic content descriptions and degradation prompts are explored. Specifically, on one hand, image-restoration prompt alignment decoder is proposed to automatically discern the degradation degree of LR images, thereby generating beneficial degradation priors for image restoration. On the other hand, much richly tailored descriptions from pretrained multimodal large language model elicit high-level semantic priors closely aligned with human perception, ensuring fidelity control for image restoration. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have been done on several popular synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The quantitative and qualitative analysis have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art perceptual quality level, especially in real-world cases based on reference-free metrics.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose novel quaternion activation functions where we modify either the quaternion magnitude or the phase, as an alternative to the commonly used split activation functions. We define criteria that are relevant for quaternion activation functions, and subsequently we propose our novel activation functions based on this analysis. Instead of applying a known activation function like the ReLU or Tanh on the quaternion elements separately, these activation functions consider the quaternion properties and respect the quaternion space $\mathbb{H}$. In particular, all quaternion components are utilized to calculate all output components, carrying out the benefit of the Hamilton product in e.g. the quaternion convolution to the activation functions. The proposed activation functions can be incorporated in arbitrary quaternion valued neural networks trained with gradient descent techniques. We further discuss the derivatives of the proposed activation functions where we observe beneficial properties for the activation functions affecting the phase. Specifically, they prove to be sensitive on basically the whole input range, thus improved gradient flow can be expected. We provide an elaborate experimental evaluation of our proposed quaternion activation functions including comparison with the split ReLU and split Tanh on two image classification tasks using the CIFAR-10 and SVHN dataset. There, especially the quaternion activation functions affecting the phase consistently prove to provide better performance.

- **Summary**: As the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) becomes pervasive, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks and limitations in handling unseen classes poses significant challenges. The state-of-the-art offers discrete solutions aimed to tackle individual issues covering specific adversarial attack scenarios, classification or evolving learning. However, real-world systems need to be able to detect and recover from a wide range of adversarial attacks without sacrificing classification accuracy and to flexibly act in {\bf unseen} scenarios. In this paper, UNICAD, is proposed as a novel framework that integrates a variety of techniques to provide an adaptive solution.   For the targeted image classification, UNICAD achieves accurate image classification, detects unseen classes, and recovers from adversarial attacks using Prototype and Similarity-based DNNs with denoising autoencoders. Our experiments performed on the CIFAR-10 dataset highlight UNICAD's effectiveness in adversarial mitigation and unseen class classification, outperforming traditional models.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing images usually characterized by complex backgrounds, scale and orientation variations, and large intra-class variance. General semantic segmentation methods usually fail to fully investigate the above issues, and thus their performances on remote sensing image segmentation are limited. In this paper, we propose our LOGCAN++, a semantic segmentation model customized for remote sensing images, which is made up of a Global Class Awareness (GCA) module and several Local Class Awareness (LCA) modules. The GCA module captures global representations for class-level context modeling to reduce the interference of background noise. The LCA module generates local class representations as intermediate perceptual elements to indirectly associate pixels with the global class representations, targeting at dealing with the large intra-class variance problem. In particular, we introduce affine transformations in the LCA module for adaptive extraction of local class representations to effectively tolerate scale and orientation variations in remotely sensed images. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our LOGCAN++ outperforms current mainstream general and remote sensing semantic segmentation methods and achieves a better trade-off between speed and accuracy.

- **Summary**: Using images acquired by different satellite sensors has shown to improve classification performance in the framework of crop mapping from satellite image time series (SITS). Existing state-of-the-art architectures use self-attention mechanisms to process the temporal dimension and convolutions for the spatial dimension of SITS. Motivated by the success of purely attention-based architectures in crop mapping from single-modal SITS, we introduce several multi-modal multi-temporal transformer-based architectures. Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of Early Fusion, Cross Attention Fusion and Synchronized Class Token Fusion within the Temporo-Spatial Vision Transformer (TSViT). Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art architectures with both convolutional and self-attention components.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers have shown advanced accuracy in crack detection under certain conditions. Yet, the fixed local attention can compromise the generalisation of CNNs, and the quadratic complexity of the global self-attention restricts the practical deployment of Transformers. Given the emergence of the new-generation architecture of Mamba, this paper proposes a Vision Mamba (VMamba)-based framework for crack segmentation on concrete, asphalt, and masonry surfaces, with high accuracy, generalisation, and less computational complexity. Having 15.6% - 74.5% fewer parameters, the encoder-decoder network integrated with VMamba could obtain up to 2.8% higher mDS than representative CNN-based models while showing about the same performance as Transformer-based models. Moreover, the VMamba-based encoder-decoder network could process high-resolution image input with up to 90.6% lower floating-point operations.

- **Summary**: The extraordinary ability of generative models emerges as a new trend in image editing and generating realistic images, posing a serious threat to the trustworthiness of multimedia data and driving the research of image manipulation detection and location(IMDL). However, the lack of a large-scale data foundation makes IMDL task unattainable. In this paper, a local manipulation pipeline is designed, incorporating the powerful SAM, ChatGPT and generative models. Upon this basis, We propose the GIM dataset, which has the following advantages: 1) Large scale, including over one million pairs of AI-manipulated images and real images. 2) Rich Image Content, encompassing a broad range of image classes 3) Diverse Generative Manipulation, manipulated images with state-of-the-art generators and various manipulation tasks. The aforementioned advantages allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of IMDL methods, extending their applicability to diverse images. We introduce two benchmark settings to evaluate the generalization capability and comprehensive performance of baseline methods. In addition, we propose a novel IMDL framework, termed GIMFormer, which consists of a ShadowTracer, Frequency-Spatial Block (FSB), and a Multi-window Anomalous Modelling (MWAM) Module. Extensive experiments on the GIM demonstrate that GIMFormer surpasses previous state-of-the-art works significantly on two different benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Customized image generation, which seeks to synthesize images with consistent characters, holds significant relevance for applications such as storytelling, portrait generation, and character design. However, previous approaches have encountered challenges in preserving characters with high-fidelity consistency due to inadequate feature extraction and concept confusion of reference characters. Therefore, we propose Character-Adapter, a plug-and-play framework designed to generate images that preserve the details of reference characters, ensuring high-fidelity consistency. Character-Adapter employs prompt-guided segmentation to ensure fine-grained regional features of reference characters and dynamic region-level adapters to mitigate concept confusion. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of Character-Adapter. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that Character-Adapter achieves the state-of-the-art performance of consistent character generation, with an improvement of 24.8% compared with other methods

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel on clean images but struggle with corrupted ones. Incorporating specific corruptions into the data augmentation pipeline can improve robustness to those corruptions but may harm performance on clean images and other types of distortion. In this paper, we introduce an alternative approach that improves the robustness of DNNs to a wide range of corruptions without compromising accuracy on clean images. We first demonstrate that input perturbations can be mimicked by multiplicative perturbations in the weight space. Leveraging this, we propose Data Augmentation via Multiplicative Perturbation (DAMP), a training method that optimizes DNNs under random multiplicative weight perturbations. We also examine the recently proposed Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (ASAM) and show that it optimizes DNNs under adversarial multiplicative weight perturbations. Experiments on image classification datasets (CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet and ImageNet) and neural network architectures (ResNet50, ViT-S/16) show that DAMP enhances model generalization performance in the presence of corruptions across different settings. Notably, DAMP is able to train a ViT-S/16 on ImageNet from scratch, reaching the top-1 error of 23.7% which is comparable to ResNet50 without extensive data augmentations.

- **Summary**: Learned video compression methods already outperform VVC in the low-delay (LD) case, but the random-access (RA) scenario remains challenging. Most works on learned RA video compression either use HEVC as an anchor or compare it to VVC in specific test conditions, using RGB-PSNR metric instead of Y-PSNR and avoiding comprehensive evaluation. Here, we present an end-to-end learned video codec for random access that combines training on long sequences of frames, rate allocation designed for hierarchical coding and content adaptation on inference. We show that under common test conditions (JVET-CTC), it achieves results comparable to VTM (VVC reference software) in terms of YUV-PSNR BD-Rate on some classes of videos, and outperforms it on almost all test sets in terms of VMAF BD-Rate. On average it surpasses open LD and RA end-to-end solutions in terms of VMAF and YUV BD-Rates.

- **Summary**: The recent advancements in text-to-image generative models have been remarkable. Yet, the field suffers from a lack of evaluation metrics that accurately reflect the performance of these models, particularly lacking fine-grained metrics that can guide the optimization of the models. In this paper, we propose EvalAlign, a metric characterized by its accuracy, stability, and fine granularity. Our approach leverages the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) pre-trained on extensive datasets. We develop evaluation protocols that focus on two key dimensions: image faithfulness and text-image alignment. Each protocol comprises a set of detailed, fine-grained instructions linked to specific scoring options, enabling precise manual scoring of the generated images. We Supervised Fine-Tune (SFT) the MLLM to align closely with human evaluative judgments, resulting in a robust evaluation model. Our comprehensive tests across 24 text-to-image generation models demonstrate that EvalAlign not only provides superior metric stability but also aligns more closely with human preferences than existing metrics, confirming its effectiveness and utility in model assessment.

- **Summary**: Producing traversability maps and understanding the surroundings are crucial prerequisites for autonomous navigation. In this paper, we address the problem of traversability assessment using point clouds. We propose a novel pillar feature extraction module that utilizes PointNet to capture features from point clouds organized in vertical volume and a 2D encoder-decoder structure to conduct traversability classification instead of the widely used 3D convolutions. This results in less computational cost while even better performance is achieved at the same time. We then propose a new spatio-temporal attention module to fuse multi-frame information, which can properly handle the varying density problem of LIDAR point clouds, and this makes our module able to assess distant areas more accurately. Comprehensive experimental results on augmented Semantic KITTI and RELLIS-3D datasets show that our method is able to achieve superior performance over existing approaches both quantitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Federated learning enables distributed clients to collaborate on training while storing their data locally to protect client privacy. However, due to the heterogeneity of data, models, and devices, the final global model may need to perform better for tasks on each client. Communication bottlenecks, data heterogeneity, and model heterogeneity have been common challenges in federated learning. In this work, we considered a label distribution skew problem, a type of data heterogeneity easily overlooked. In the context of classification, we propose a personalized federated learning approach called pFedPM. In our process, we replace traditional gradient uploading with feature uploading, which helps reduce communication costs and allows for heterogeneous client models. These feature representations play a role in preserving privacy to some extent.   We use a hyperparameter $a$ to mix local and global features, which enables us to control the degree of personalization. We also introduced a relation network as an additional decision layer, which provides a non-linear learnable classifier to predict labels. Experimental results show that, with an appropriate setting of $a$, our scheme outperforms several recent FL methods on MNIST, FEMNIST, and CRIFAR10 datasets and achieves fewer communications.

- **Summary**: Face recognition and verification are two computer vision tasks whose performance has progressed with the introduction of deep representations. However, ethical, legal, and technical challenges due to the sensitive character of face data and biases in real training datasets hinder their development. Generative AI addresses privacy by creating fictitious identities, but fairness problems persist. We promote fairness by introducing a demographic attributes balancing mechanism in generated training datasets. We experiment with an existing real dataset, three generated training datasets, and the balanced versions of a diffusion-based dataset. We propose a comprehensive evaluation that considers accuracy and fairness equally and includes a rigorous regression-based statistical analysis of attributes. The analysis shows that balancing reduces demographic unfairness. Also, a performance gap persists despite generation becoming more accurate with time. The proposed balancing method and comprehensive verification evaluation promote fairer and transparent face recognition and verification.

- **Summary**: The waste of electrical and electronic equipment has been increased due to the fast evolution of technology products and competition of many IT sectors. Every year millions of tons of electronic waste are thrown into the environment which causes high consequences for human health. Therefore, it is crucial to control this waste flow using technology, especially using Artificial Intelligence but also reclamation of critical raw materials for new production processes. In this paper, we focused on the measurement of recyclability of waste electronic components (WECs) from waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) using mathematical innovation model. This innovative approach evaluates both the recyclability and recycling difficulties of WECs, integrating an AI model for improved disassembly and sorting. Assessing the recyclability of individual electronic components present on WPCBs provides insight into the recovery potential of valuable materials and indicates the level of complexity involved in recycling in terms of economic worth and production utility. This novel measurement approach helps AI models in accurately determining the number of classes to be identified and sorted during the automated disassembly of discarded PCBs. It also facilitates the model in iterative training and validation of individual electronic components.

- **Summary**: Human motion copy is an intriguing yet challenging task in artificial intelligence and computer vision, which strives to generate a fake video of a target person performing the motion of a source person. The problem is inherently challenging due to the subtle human-body texture details to be generated and the temporal consistency to be considered. Existing approaches typically adopt a conventional GAN with an L1 or L2 loss to produce the target fake video, which intrinsically necessitates a large number of training samples that are challenging to acquire. Meanwhile, current methods still have difficulties in attaining realistic image details and temporal consistency, which unfortunately can be easily perceived by human observers. Motivated by this, we try to tackle the issues from three aspects: (1) We constrain pose-to-appearance generation with a perceptual loss and a theoretically motivated Gromov-Wasserstein loss to bridge the gap between pose and appearance. (2) We present an episodic memory module in the pose-to-appearance generation to propel continuous learning that helps the model learn from its past poor generations. We also utilize geometrical cues of the face to optimize facial details and refine each key body part with a dedicated local GAN. (3) We advocate generating the foreground in a sequence-to-sequence manner rather than a single-frame manner, explicitly enforcing temporal inconsistency. Empirical results on five datasets, iPER, ComplexMotion, SoloDance, Fish, and Mouse datasets, demonstrate that our method is capable of generating realistic target videos while precisely copying motion from a source video. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and gains 7.2% and 12.4% improvements in PSNR and FID respectively.

- **Summary**: As a crucial step toward real-world learning scenarios with changing environments, dataset shift theory and invariant representation learning algorithm have been extensively studied to relax the identical distribution assumption in classical learning setting. Among the different assumptions on the essential of shifting distributions, generalized label shift (GLS) is the latest developed one which shows great potential to deal with the complex factors within the shift. In this paper, we aim to explore the limitations of current dataset shift theory and algorithm, and further provide new insights by presenting a comprehensive understanding of GLS. From theoretical aspect, two informative generalization bounds are derived, and the GLS learner is proved to be sufficiently close to optimal target model from the Bayesian perspective. The main results show the insufficiency of invariant representation learning, and prove the sufficiency and necessity of GLS correction for generalization, which provide theoretical supports and innovations for exploring generalizable model under dataset shift. From methodological aspect, we provide a unified view of existing shift correction frameworks, and propose a kernel embedding-based correction algorithm (KECA) to minimize the generalization error and achieve successful knowledge transfer. Both theoretical results and extensive experiment evaluations demonstrate the sufficiency and necessity of GLS correction for addressing dataset shift and the superiority of proposed algorithm.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce our approach to the 5th CLVision Challenge, which presents distinctive challenges beyond traditional class incremental learning. Unlike standard settings, this competition features the recurrence of previously encountered classes and includes unlabeled data that may contain Out-of-Distribution (OOD) categories. Our approach is based on Winning Subnetworks to allocate independent parameter spaces for each task addressing the catastrophic forgetting problem in class incremental learning and employ three training strategies: supervised classification learning, unsupervised contrastive learning, and pseudo-label classification learning to fully utilize the information in both labeled and unlabeled data, enhancing the classification performance of each subnetwork. Furthermore, during the inference stage, we have devised an interaction strategy between subnetworks, where the prediction for a specific class of a particular sample is the average logits across different subnetworks corresponding to that class, leveraging the knowledge learned from different subnetworks on recurring classes to improve classification accuracy. These strategies can be simultaneously applied to the three scenarios of the competition, effectively solving the difficulties in the competition scenarios. Experimentally, our method ranks first in both the pre-selection and final evaluation stages, with an average accuracy of 0.4535 during the preselection stage and an average accuracy of 0.4805 during the final evaluation stage.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded their capabilities to multimodal contexts, including comprehensive video understanding. However, processing extensive videos such as 24-hour CCTV footage or full-length films presents significant challenges due to the vast data and processing demands. Traditional methods, like extracting key frames or converting frames to text, often result in substantial information loss. To address these shortcomings, we develop OmAgent, efficiently stores and retrieves relevant video frames for specific queries, preserving the detailed content of videos. Additionally, it features an Divide-and-Conquer Loop capable of autonomous reasoning, dynamically invoking APIs and tools to enhance query processing and accuracy. This approach ensures robust video understanding, significantly reducing information loss. Experimental results affirm OmAgent's efficacy in handling various types of videos and complex tasks. Moreover, we have endowed it with greater autonomy and a robust tool-calling system, enabling it to accomplish even more intricate tasks.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel unsupervised method to learn the pose and part-segmentation of articulated objects with rigid parts. Given two observations of an object in different articulation states, our method learns the geometry and appearance of object parts by using an implicit model from the first observation, distils the part segmentation and articulation from the second observation while rendering the latter observation. Additionally, to tackle the complexities in the joint optimization of part segmentation and articulation, we propose a voxel grid-based initialization strategy and a decoupled optimization procedure. Compared to the prior unsupervised work, our model obtains significantly better performance, and generalizes to objects with multiple parts while it can be efficiently from few views for the latter observation.

- **Summary**: End-to-end (E2E) training approaches are commonly plagued by high memory consumption, reduced efficiency in training, challenges in model parallelization, and suboptimal biocompatibility. Local learning is considered a novel interactive training method that holds promise as an alternative to E2E. Nonetheless, conventional local learning methods fall short in achieving high model accuracy due to inadequate local inter-module interactions. In this paper, we introduce a new model known as the Scaling Supervised Local Learning with Multilaminar Leap Augmented Auxiliary Network (MLAAN). MLAAN features an innovative supervised local learning approach coupled with a robust reinforcement module. This dual-component design enables the MLAAN to integrate smoothly with established local learning techniques, thereby enhancing the efficacy of the foundational methods. The method simultaneously acquires the local and global features of the model separately by constructing an independent auxiliary network and a cascade auxiliary network on the one hand and incorporates a leap augmented module, which serves to counteract the reduced learning capacity often associated with weaker supervision. This architecture not only augments the exchange of information amongst the local modules but also effectively mitigates the model's tendency toward myopia. The experimental evaluations conducted on four benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10, STL-10, SVHN, and ImageNet, demonstrate that the integration of MLAAN with existing supervised local learning methods significantly enhances the original methodologies. Of particular note, MLAAN enables local learning methods to comprehensively outperform end-to-end training approaches in terms of optimal performance while saving GPU memory.

Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for this task, with models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers being employed to capture various aspects of human motion. One of the key contributions of this work is the demonstration of the effectiveness of feature fusion in improving HAR accuracy by capturing spatial and temporal features, which has important implications for the development of more accurate and robust activity recognition systems. The study uses sensory data from HuGaDB, PKU-MMD, LARa, and TUG datasets. Two model, the PO-MS-GCN and a Transformer were trained and evaluated, with PO-MS-GCN outperforming state-of-the-art models. HuGaDB and TUG achieved high accuracies and f1-scores, while LARa and PKU-MMD had lower scores. Feature fusion improved results across datasets.

- **Summary**: Recently, textual prompt tuning has shown inspirational performance in adapting Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models to natural image quality assessment. However, such uni-modal prompt learning method only tunes the language branch of CLIP models. This is not enough for adapting CLIP models to AI generated image quality assessment (AGIQA) since AGIs visually differ from natural images. In addition, the consistency between AGIs and user input text prompts, which correlates with the perceptual quality of AGIs, is not investigated to guide AGIQA. In this letter, we propose vision-language consistency guided multi-modal prompt learning for blind AGIQA, dubbed CLIP-AGIQA. Specifically, we introduce learnable textual and visual prompts in language and vision branches of CLIP models, respectively. Moreover, we design a text-to-image alignment quality prediction task, whose learned vision-language consistency knowledge is used to guide the optimization of the above multi-modal prompts. Experimental results on two public AGIQA datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art quality assessment models.

- **Summary**: This paper studies two classes of sampling methods for the solution of inverse problems, namely Randomize-Then-Optimize (RTO), which is rooted in sensitivity analysis, and Langevin methods, which are rooted in the Bayesian framework. The two classes of methods correspond to different assumptions and yield samples from different target distributions. We highlight the main conceptual and theoretical differences between the two approaches and compare them from a practical point of view by tackling two classical inverse problems in imaging: deblurring and inpainting. We show that the choice of the sampling method has a significant impact on the quality of the reconstruction and that the RTO method is more robust to the choice of the parameters.

- **Summary**: Score distillation sampling has been pivotal for integrating diffusion models into generation of complex visuals. Despite impressive results it suffers from mode collapse and lack of diversity. To cope with this challenge, we leverage the gradient flow interpretation of score distillation to propose Repulsive Score Distillation (RSD). In particular, we propose a variational framework based on repulsion of an ensemble of particles that promotes diversity. Using a variational approximation that incorporates a coupling among particles, the repulsion appears as a simple regularization that allows interaction of particles based on their relative pairwise similarity, measured e.g., via radial basis kernels. We design RSD for both unconstrained and constrained sampling scenarios. For constrained sampling we focus on inverse problems in the latent space that leads to an augmented variational formulation, that strikes a good balance between compute, quality and diversity. Our extensive experiments for text-to-image generation, and inverse problems demonstrate that RSD achieves a superior trade-off between diversity and quality compared with state-of-the-art alternatives.

- **Summary**: Score distillation sampling (SDS), the methodology in which the score from pretrained 2D diffusion models is distilled into 3D representation, has recently brought significant advancements in text-to-3D generation task. However, this approach is still confronted with critical geometric inconsistency problems such as the Janus problem. Starting from a hypothesis that such inconsistency problems may be induced by multiview inconsistencies between 2D scores predicted from various viewpoints, we introduce GSD, a simple and general plug-and-play framework for incorporating 3D consistency and therefore geometry awareness into the SDS process. Our methodology is composed of three components: 3D consistent noising, designed to produce 3D consistent noise maps that perfectly follow the standard Gaussian distribution, geometry-based gradient warping for identifying correspondences between predicted gradients of different viewpoints, and novel gradient consistency loss to optimize the scene geometry toward producing more consistent gradients. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance, successfully addressing the geometric inconsistency problems in text-to-3D generation task with minimal computation cost and being compatible with existing score distillation-based models.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in healthcare applications, and U-Nets have demonstrated promising results. This work delves into the understudied aspect of receptive field (RF) size and its impact on the U-Net and Attention U-Net architectures. This work explores several critical elements including the relationship between RF size, characteristics of the region of interest, and model performance, as well as the balance between RF size and computational costs for U-Net and Attention U-Net methods for different datasets. This work also proposes a mathematical notation for representing the theoretical receptive field (TRF) of a given layer in a network and proposes two new metrics - effective receptive field (ERF) rate and the Object rate to quantify the fraction of significantly contributing pixels within the ERF against the TRF area and assessing the relative size of the segmentation object compared to the TRF size respectively. The results demonstrate that there exists an optimal TRF size that successfully strikes a balance between capturing a wider global context and maintaining computational efficiency, thereby optimizing model performance. Interestingly, a distinct correlation is observed between the data complexity and the required TRF size; segmentation based solely on contrast achieved peak performance even with smaller TRF sizes, whereas more complex segmentation tasks necessitated larger TRFs. Attention U-Net models consistently outperformed their U-Net counterparts, highlighting the value of attention mechanisms regardless of TRF size. These novel insights present an invaluable resource for developing more efficient U-Net-based architectures for medical imaging and pave the way for future exploration. A tool is also developed that calculates the TRF for a U-Net (and Attention U-Net) model, and also suggest an appropriate TRF size for a given model and dataset.

- **Summary**: While recent works have achieved great success on one-shot 3D common object generation, high quality and fidelity 3D head generation from a single image remains a great challenge. Previous text-based methods for generating 3D heads were limited by text descriptions and image-based methods struggled to produce high-quality head geometry. To handle this challenging problem, we propose a novel framework, Portrait3D, to generate high-quality 3D heads while preserving their identities. Our work incorporates the identity information of the portrait image into three parts: 1) geometry initialization, 2) geometry sculpting, and 3) texture generation stages. Given a reference portrait image, we first align the identity features with text features to realize ID-aware guidance enhancement, which contains the control signals representing the face information. We then use the canny map, ID features of the portrait image, and a pre-trained text-to-normal/depth diffusion model to generate ID-aware geometry supervision, and 3D-GAN inversion is employed to generate ID-aware geometry initialization. Furthermore, with the ability to inject identity information into 3D head generation, we use ID-aware guidance to calculate ID-aware Score Distillation (ISD) for geometry sculpting. For texture generation, we adopt the ID Consistent Texture Inpainting and Refinement which progressively expands the view for texture inpainting to obtain an initialization UV texture map. We then use the id-aware guidance to provide image-level supervision for noisy multi-view images to obtain a refined texture map. Extensive experiments demonstrate that we can generate high-quality 3D heads with accurate geometry and texture from single in-the-wild portrait images.

- **Summary**: X-ray computed microtomography ({\mu}-CT) is a non-destructive technique that can generate high-resolution 3D images of the internal anatomy of medical and biological samples. These images enable clinicians to examine internal anatomy and gain insights into the disease or anatomical morphology. However, extracting relevant information from 3D images requires semantic segmentation of the regions of interest, which is usually done manually and results time-consuming and tedious. In this work, we propose a novel framework that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically segment the full morphology of the heart of Carassius auratus. The framework employs an optimized 2D CNN architecture that can infer a 3D segmentation of the sample, avoiding the high computational cost of a 3D CNN architecture. We tackle the challenges of handling large and high-resoluted image data (over a thousand pixels in each dimension) and a small training database (only three samples) by proposing a standard protocol for data normalization and processing. Moreover, we investigate how the noise, contrast, and spatial resolution of the sample and the training of the architecture are affected by the reconstruction technique, which depends on the number of input images. Experiments show that our framework significantly reduces the time required to segment new samples, allowing a faster microtomography analysis of the Carassius auratus heart shape. Furthermore, our framework can work with any bio-image (biological and medical) from {\mu}-CT with high-resolution and small dataset size

- **Summary**: Despite the high diagnostic accuracy of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), using MRI as a Point-of-Care (POC) disease identification tool poses significant accessibility challenges due to the use of high magnetic field strength and lengthy acquisition times. We ask a simple question: Can we dynamically optimise acquired samples, at the patient level, according to an (automated) downstream decision task, while discounting image reconstruction? We propose an ML-based framework that learns an active sampling strategy, via reinforcement learning, at a patient-level to directly infer disease from undersampled k-space. We validate our approach by inferring Meniscus Tear in undersampled knee MRI data, where we achieve diagnostic performance comparable with ML-based diagnosis, using fully sampled k-space data. We analyse task-specific sampling policies, showcasing the adaptability of our active sampling approach. The introduced frugal sampling strategies have the potential to reduce high field strength requirements that in turn strengthen the viability of MRI-based POC disease identification and associated preliminary screening tools.

- **Summary**: Large-scale datasets with point-wise semantic and instance labels are crucial to 3D instance segmentation but also expensive. To leverage unlabeled data, previous semi-supervised 3D instance segmentation approaches have explored self-training frameworks, which rely on high-quality pseudo labels for consistency regularization. They intuitively utilize both instance and semantic pseudo labels in a joint learning manner. However, semantic pseudo labels contain numerous noise derived from the imbalanced category distribution and natural confusion of similar but distinct categories, which leads to severe collapses in self-training. Motivated by the observation that 3D instances are non-overlapping and spatially separable, we ask whether we can solely rely on instance consistency regularization for improved semi-supervised segmentation. To this end, we propose a novel self-training network InsTeacher3D to explore and exploit pure instance knowledge from unlabeled data. We first build a parallel base 3D instance segmentation model DKNet, which distinguishes each instance from the others via discriminative instance kernels without reliance on semantic segmentation. Based on DKNet, we further design a novel instance consistency regularization framework to generate and leverage high-quality instance pseudo labels. Experimental results on multiple large-scale datasets show that the InsTeacher3D significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches.

- **Summary**: The transformer neural network architecture allows for autoregressive sequence-to-sequence modeling through the use of attention layers. It was originally created with the application of machine translation but has revolutionized natural language processing. Recently, transformers have also been applied across a wide variety of pattern recognition tasks, particularly in computer vision. In this literature review, we describe major advances in computer vision utilizing transformers. We then focus specifically on Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) and discuss how transformers are increasingly becoming competitive in state-of-the-art MOT works, yet still lag behind traditional deep learning methods.

- **Summary**: Human feedback plays a critical role in learning and refining reward models for text-to-image generation, but the optimal form the feedback should take for learning an accurate reward function has not been conclusively established. This paper investigates the effectiveness of fine-grained feedback which captures nuanced distinctions in image quality and prompt-alignment, compared to traditional coarse-grained feedback (for example, thumbs up/down or ranking between a set of options). While fine-grained feedback holds promise, particularly for systems catering to diverse societal preferences, we show that demonstrating its superiority to coarse-grained feedback is not automatic. Through experiments on real and synthetic preference data, we surface the complexities of building effective models due to the interplay of model choice, feedback type, and the alignment between human judgment and computational interpretation. We identify key challenges in eliciting and utilizing fine-grained feedback, prompting a reassessment of its assumed benefits and practicality. Our findings -- e.g., that fine-grained feedback can lead to worse models for a fixed budget, in some settings; however, in controlled settings with known attributes, fine grained rewards can indeed be more helpful -- call for careful consideration of feedback attributes and potentially beckon novel modeling approaches to appropriately unlock the potential value of fine-grained feedback in-the-wild.

- **Summary**: High-fidelity 3D garment synthesis from text is desirable yet challenging for digital avatar creation. Recent diffusion-based approaches via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) have enabled new possibilities but either intricately couple with human body or struggle to reuse. We introduce ClotheDreamer, a 3D Gaussian-based method for generating wearable, production-ready 3D garment assets from text prompts. We propose a novel representation Disentangled Clothe Gaussian Splatting (DCGS) to enable separate optimization. DCGS represents clothed avatar as one Gaussian model but freezes body Gaussian splats. To enhance quality and completeness, we incorporate bidirectional SDS to supervise clothed avatar and garment RGBD renderings respectively with pose conditions and propose a new pruning strategy for loose clothing. Our approach can also support custom clothing templates as input. Benefiting from our design, the synthetic 3D garment can be easily applied to virtual try-on and support physically accurate animation. Extensive experiments showcase our method's superior and competitive performance. Our project page is at https://ggxxii.github.io/clothedreamer.

GPT-4V introduces capabilities for visual question answering and complex scene comprehension, addressing challenges in these specialized settings.Our evaluation focuses on its proficiency in scene understanding, reasoning, and driving functions, with specific tests on its ability to recognize and interpret elements such as pedestrians, various vehicles, and traffic devices. While GPT-4V showed robust comprehension and decision-making skills, it faced difficulties in accurately identifying specific vehicle types and managing dynamic interactions. Despite these challenges, its effective navigation and strategic decision-making demonstrate its potential as a reliable agent for autonomous driving in the complex conditions of mining environments, highlighting its adaptability and operational viability in industrial settings.

- **Summary**: Significant advances have been made toward building accurate automatic segmentation models for adult gliomas. However, the performance of these models often degrades when applied to pediatric glioma due to their imaging and clinical differences (domain shift). Obtaining sufficient annotated data for pediatric glioma is typically difficult because of its rare nature. Also, manual annotations are scarce and expensive. In this work, we propose Domain-Adapted nnU-Net (DA-nnUNet) to perform unsupervised domain adaptation from adult glioma (source domain) to pediatric glioma (target domain). Specifically, we add a domain classifier connected with a gradient reversal layer (GRL) to a backbone nnU-Net. Once the classifier reaches a very high accuracy, the GRL is activated with the goal of transferring domain-invariant features from the classifier to the segmentation model while preserving segmentation accuracy on the source domain. The accuracy of the classifier slowly degrades to chance levels. No annotations are used in the target domain. The method is compared to 8 different supervised models using BraTS-Adult glioma (N=1251) and BraTS-PED glioma data (N=99). The proposed method shows notable performance enhancements in the tumor core (TC) region compared to the model that only uses adult data: ~32% better Dice scores and ~20 better 95th percentile Hausdorff distances. Moreover, our unsupervised approach shows no statistically significant difference compared to the practical upper bound model using manual annotations from both datasets in TC region.

- **Summary**: Embodied agents require robust navigation systems to operate in unstructured environments, making the robustness of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) models critical to embodied agent autonomy. While real-world datasets are invaluable, simulation-based benchmarks offer a scalable approach for robustness evaluations. However, the creation of a challenging and controllable noisy world with diverse perturbations remains under-explored. To this end, we propose a novel, customizable pipeline for noisy data synthesis, aimed at assessing the resilience of multi-modal SLAM models against various perturbations. The pipeline comprises a comprehensive taxonomy of sensor and motion perturbations for embodied multi-modal (specifically RGB-D) sensing, categorized by their sources and propagation order, allowing for procedural composition. We also provide a toolbox for synthesizing these perturbations, enabling the transformation of clean environments into challenging noisy simulations. Utilizing the pipeline, we instantiate the large-scale Noisy-Replica benchmark, which includes diverse perturbation types, to evaluate the risk tolerance of existing advanced RGB-D SLAM models.

- **Summary**: We present LoCoVQA, a dynamic benchmark generator for evaluating long-context extractive reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). LoCoVQA augments test examples for mathematical reasoning, VQA, and character recognition tasks with increasingly long visual contexts composed of both in-distribution and out-of-distribution distractor images.   Across these tasks, a diverse set of VLMs rapidly lose performance as the visual context length grows, often exhibiting a striking exponential decay trend. This test assesses how well VLMs can ignore irrelevant information when answering queries -- a task that is quite easy for language models (LMs) in the text domain -- demonstrating that current state-of-the-art VLMs lack this essential capability for many long-context applications.

- **Summary**: Video sequences offer valuable temporal information, but existing large multimodal models (LMMs) fall short in understanding extremely long videos. Many works address this by reducing the number of visual tokens using visual resamplers. Alternatively, in this paper, we approach this problem from the perspective of the language model. By simply extrapolating the context length of the language backbone, we enable LMMs to comprehend orders of magnitude more visual tokens without any video training. We call this phenomenon long context transfer and carefully ablate its properties. To effectively measure LMMs' ability to generalize to long contexts in the vision modality, we develop V-NIAH (Visual Needle-In-A-Haystack), a purely synthetic long vision benchmark inspired by the language model's NIAH test. Our proposed Long Video Assistant (LongVA) can process 2000 frames or over 200K visual tokens without additional complexities. With its extended context length, LongVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on Video-MME among 7B-scale models by densely sampling more input frames.

- **Summary**: Personalized image generation holds great promise in assisting humans in everyday work and life due to its impressive function in creatively generating personalized content. However, current evaluations either are automated but misalign with humans or require human evaluations that are time-consuming and expensive. In this work, we present DreamBench++, a human-aligned benchmark automated by advanced multimodal GPT models. Specifically, we systematically design the prompts to let GPT be both human-aligned and self-aligned, empowered with task reinforcement. Further, we construct a comprehensive dataset comprising diverse images and prompts. By benchmarking 7 modern generative models, we demonstrate that DreamBench++ results in significantly more human-aligned evaluation, helping boost the community with innovative findings.

- **Summary**: We introduce Cambrian-1, a family of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) designed with a vision-centric approach. While stronger language models can enhance multimodal capabilities, the design choices for vision components are often insufficiently explored and disconnected from visual representation learning research. This gap hinders accurate sensory grounding in real-world scenarios. Our study uses LLMs and visual instruction tuning as an interface to evaluate various visual representations, offering new insights into different models and architectures -- self-supervised, strongly supervised, or combinations thereof -- based on experiments with over 20 vision encoders. We critically examine existing MLLM benchmarks, addressing the difficulties involved in consolidating and interpreting results from various tasks, and introduce a new vision-centric benchmark, CV-Bench. To further improve visual grounding, we propose the Spatial Vision Aggregator (SVA), a dynamic and spatially-aware connector that integrates high-resolution vision features with LLMs while reducing the number of tokens. Additionally, we discuss the curation of high-quality visual instruction-tuning data from publicly available sources, emphasizing the importance of data source balancing and distribution ratio. Collectively, Cambrian-1 not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also serves as a comprehensive, open cookbook for instruction-tuned MLLMs. We provide model weights, code, supporting tools, datasets, and detailed instruction-tuning and evaluation recipes. We hope our release will inspire and accelerate advancements in multimodal systems and visual representation learning.

- **Summary**: A key challenge in manipulation is learning a policy that can robustly generalize to diverse visual environments. A promising mechanism for learning robust policies is to leverage video generative models, which are pretrained on large-scale datasets of internet videos. In this paper, we propose a visuomotor policy learning framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion model on human demonstrations of a given task. At test time, we generate an example of an execution of the task conditioned on images of a novel scene, and use this synthesized execution directly to control the robot. Our key insight is that using common tools allows us to effortlessly bridge the embodiment gap between the human hand and the robot manipulator. We evaluate our approach on four tasks of increasing complexity and demonstrate that harnessing internet-scale generative models allows the learned policy to achieve a significantly higher degree of generalization than existing behavior cloning approaches.

- **Summary**: Diffusion model has demonstrated remarkable capability in video generation, which further sparks interest in introducing trajectory control into the generation process. While existing works mainly focus on training-based methods (e.g., conditional adapter), we argue that diffusion model itself allows decent control over the generated content without requiring any training. In this study, we introduce a tuning-free framework to achieve trajectory-controllable video generation, by imposing guidance on both noise construction and attention computation. Specifically, 1) we first show several instructive phenomenons and analyze how initial noises influence the motion trajectory of generated content. 2) Subsequently, we propose FreeTraj, a tuning-free approach that enables trajectory control by modifying noise sampling and attention mechanisms. 3) Furthermore, we extend FreeTraj to facilitate longer and larger video generation with controllable trajectories. Equipped with these designs, users have the flexibility to provide trajectories manually or opt for trajectories automatically generated by the LLM trajectory planner. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our approach in enhancing the trajectory controllability of video diffusion models.

- **Summary**: This work addresses the challenge of high-quality surface normal estimation from monocular colored inputs (i.e., images and videos), a field which has recently been revolutionized by repurposing diffusion priors. However, previous attempts still struggle with stochastic inference, conflicting with the deterministic nature of the Image2Normal task, and costly ensembling step, which slows down the estimation process. Our method, StableNormal, mitigates the stochasticity of the diffusion process by reducing inference variance, thus producing "Stable-and-Sharp" normal estimates without any additional ensembling process. StableNormal works robustly under challenging imaging conditions, such as extreme lighting, blurring, and low quality. It is also robust against transparent and reflective surfaces, as well as cluttered scenes with numerous objects. Specifically, StableNormal employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, which starts with a one-step normal estimator (YOSO) to derive an initial normal guess, that is relatively coarse but reliable, then followed by a semantic-guided refinement process (SG-DRN) that refines the normals to recover geometric details. The effectiveness of StableNormal is demonstrated through competitive performance in standard datasets such as DIODE-indoor, iBims, ScannetV2 and NYUv2, and also in various downstream tasks, such as surface reconstruction and normal enhancement. These results evidence that StableNormal retains both the "stability" and "sharpness" for accurate normal estimation. StableNormal represents a baby attempt to repurpose diffusion priors for deterministic estimation. To democratize this, code and models have been publicly available in hf.co/Stable-X

- **Summary**: Referring expression comprehension (REC) involves localizing a target instance based on a textual description. Recent advancements in REC have been driven by large multimodal models (LMMs) like CogVLM, which achieved 92.44% accuracy on RefCOCO. However, this study questions whether existing benchmarks such as RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, capture LMMs' comprehensive capabilities. We begin with a manual examination of these benchmarks, revealing high labeling error rates: 14% in RefCOCO, 24% in RefCOCO+, and 5% in RefCOCOg, which undermines the authenticity of evaluations. We address this by excluding problematic instances and reevaluating several LMMs capable of handling the REC task, showing significant accuracy improvements, thus highlighting the impact of benchmark noise. In response, we introduce Ref-L4, a comprehensive REC benchmark, specifically designed to evaluate modern REC models. Ref-L4 is distinguished by four key features: 1) a substantial sample size with 45,341 annotations; 2) a diverse range of object categories with 365 distinct types and varying instance scales from 30 to 3,767; 3) lengthy referring expressions averaging 24.2 words; and 4) an extensive vocabulary comprising 22,813 unique words. We evaluate a total of 24 large models on Ref-L4 and provide valuable insights. The cleaned versions of RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, as well as our Ref-L4 benchmark and evaluation code, are available at https://github.com/JierunChen/Ref-L4.

- **Summary**: The interpretability of deep learning is crucial for evaluating the reliability of medical imaging models and reducing the risks of inaccurate patient recommendations. This study addresses the "human out of the loop" and "trustworthiness" issues in medical image analysis by integrating medical professionals into the interpretability process. We propose a disease-weighted attention map refinement network (Dwarf) that leverages expert feedback to enhance model relevance and accuracy. Our method employs cyclic training to iteratively improve diagnostic performance, generating precise and interpretable feature maps. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in interpretability and diagnostic accuracy across multiple medical imaging datasets. This approach fosters effective collaboration between AI systems and healthcare professionals, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes

- **Summary**: Scientific charts are essential tools for effectively communicating research findings, serving as a vital medium for conveying information and revealing data patterns. With the rapid advancement of science and technology, coupled with the advent of the big data era, the volume and diversity of scientific research data have surged, leading to an increase in the number and variety of charts. This trend presents new challenges for researchers, particularly in efficiently and accurately generating appropriate titles for these charts to better convey their information and results. Automatically generated chart titles can enhance information retrieval systems by providing precise data for detailed chart classification. As research in image captioning and text summarization matures, the automatic generation of scientific chart titles has gained significant attention. By leveraging natural language processing, machine learning, and multimodal techniques, it is possible to automatically extract key information from charts and generate accurate, concise titles that better serve the needs of researchers. This paper presents a novel approach to scientific chart title generation, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the clarity and accessibility of research data.

- **Summary**: Skin cancer is a major concern to public health, accounting for one-third of the reported cancers. If not detected early, the cancer has the potential for severe consequences. Recognizing the critical need for effective skin cancer classification, we address the limitations of existing models, which are often too large to deploy in areas with limited computational resources. In response, we present a knowledge distillation based approach for creating a lightweight yet high-performing classifier. The proposed solution involves fusing three models, namely ResNet152V2, ConvNeXtBase, and ViT Base, to create an effective teacher model. The teacher model is then employed to guide a lightweight student model of size 2.03 MB. This student model is further compressed to 469.77 KB using 16-bit quantization, enabling smooth incorporation into edge devices. With six-stage image preprocessing, data augmentation, and a rigorous ablation study, the model achieves an impressive accuracy of 98.75% on the HAM10000 dataset and 98.94% on the Kaggle dataset in classifying benign and malignant skin cancers. With its high accuracy and compact size, our model appears to be a potential choice for accurate skin cancer classification, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian splatting provides excellent visual quality for novel view synthesis, with fast training and real-time rendering; unfortunately, the memory requirements of this method for storing and transmission are unreasonably high. We first analyze the reasons for this, identifying three main areas where storage can be reduced: the number of 3D Gaussian primitives used to represent a scene, the number of coefficients for the spherical harmonics used to represent directional radiance, and the precision required to store Gaussian primitive attributes. We present a solution to each of these issues. First, we propose an efficient, resolution-aware primitive pruning approach, reducing the primitive count by half. Second, we introduce an adaptive adjustment method to choose the number of coefficients used to represent directional radiance for each Gaussian primitive, and finally a codebook-based quantization method, together with a half-float representation for further memory reduction. Taken together, these three components result in a 27 reduction in overall size on disk on the standard datasets we tested, along with a 1.7 speedup in rendering speed. We demonstrate our method on standard datasets and show how our solution results in significantly reduced download times when using the method on a mobile device.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers have shown superior performance to the traditional convolutional-based frameworks in many vision applications, including but not limited to the segmentation of 3D medical images. To further advance this area, this study introduces the Multi-Aperture Fusion of Transformer-Convolutional Network (MFTC-Net), which integrates the output of Swin Transformers and their corresponding convolutional blocks using 3D fusion blocks. The Multi-Aperture incorporates each image patch at its original resolutions with its pyramid representation to better preserve minute details. The proposed architecture has demonstrated a score of 89.73 and 7.31 for Dice and HD95, respectively, on the Synapse multi-organs dataset an improvement over the published results. The improved performance also comes with the added benefits of the reduced complexity of approximately 40 million parameters. Our code is available at https://github.com/Siyavashshabani/MFTC-Net

- **Summary**: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved significant success in generating imaginative images given textual descriptions. However, they are likely to fall short when it comes to real-life scenarios with intricate details.The low-quality, unrealistic human faces in text-to-image generation are one of the most prominent issues, hindering the wide application of DMs in practice. Targeting addressing such an issue, we first assess the face quality of generations from popular pre-trained DMs with the aid of human annotators and then evaluate the alignment between existing metrics such as ImageReward, Human Preference Score, Aesthetic Score Predictor, and Face Quality Assessment, with human judgments. Observing that existing metrics can be unsatisfactory for quantifying face quality, we develop a novel metric named Face Score (FS) by fine-tuning ImageReward on a dataset of (good, bad) face pairs cheaply crafted by an inpainting pipeline of DMs. Extensive studies reveal that FS enjoys a superior alignment with humans. On the other hand, FS opens up the door for refining DMs for better face generation. To achieve this, we incorporate a guidance loss on the denoising trajectories of the aforementioned face pairs for fine-tuning pre-trained DMs such as Stable Diffusion V1.5 and Realistic Vision V5.1. Intuitively, such a loss pushes the trajectory of bad faces toward that of good ones. Comprehensive experiments verify the efficacy of our approach for improving face quality while preserving general capability.

- **Summary**: Leaf instance segmentation is a challenging multi-instance segmentation task, aiming to separate and delineate each leaf in an image of a plant. The delineation of each leaf is a necessary prerequisite task for several biology-related applications such as the fine-grained monitoring of plant growth, and crop yield estimation. The task is challenging because self-similarity of instances is high (similar shape and colour) and instances vary greatly in size under heavy occulusion.   We believe that the key to overcoming the aforementioned challenges lies in the specific spatial patterns of leaf distribution. For example, leaves typically grow around the plant's center, with smaller leaves clustering and overlapped near this central point. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Guided Mask Transformer (GMT), which contains three key components, namely Guided Positional Encoding (GPE), Guided Embedding Fusion Module (GEFM) and Guided Dynamic Positional Queries (GDPQ), to extend the meta-architecture of Mask2Former and incorporate with a set of harmonic guide functions. These guide functions are tailored to the pixel positions of instances and trained to separate distinct instances in an embedding space. The proposed GMT consistently outperforms State-of-the-Art models on three public plant datasets.

- **Summary**: Despite the rapid progress and outstanding performance of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in recent years, LVLMs have been plagued by the issue of hallucination, i.e., LVLMs tend to generate responses that are inconsistent with the corresponding visual inputs. To evaluate the degree of hallucination in LVLMs, previous works have proposed a series of benchmarks featuring different types of tasks and evaluation metrics. However, we find that the quality of the existing hallucination benchmarks varies, with some suffering from problems, e.g., inconsistent evaluation results under repeated tests, and misalignment with human evaluation. To this end, we propose a Hallucination benchmark Quality Measurement framework (HQM), which leverages various indicators to assess the reliability and validity of existing hallucination benchmarks separately. Specifically, for reliability we explore test-retest reliability and parallel-forms reliability, while for validity we examine criterion validity and coverage of hallucination types. Furthermore, based on the results of our quality measurement, we construct a High-Quality Hallucination Benchmark (HQH) for LVLMs. We conduct an extensive evaluation of over 10 representative LVLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini-Vision-Pro, to provide an in-depth analysis of the hallucination issues in existing models. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/HQHBench/HQHBench.

- **Summary**: Scaling up neural networks has been a key recipe to the success of large language and vision models. However, in practice, up-scaled models can be disproportionately costly in terms of computations, providing only marginal improvements in performance; for example, EfficientViT-L3-384 achieves <2% improvement on ImageNet-1K accuracy over the base L1-224 model, while requiring $14\times$ more multiply-accumulate operations (MACs). In this paper, we investigate scaling properties of popular families of neural networks for image classification, and find that scaled-up models mostly help with "difficult" samples. Decomposing the samples by difficulty, we develop a simple model-agnostic two-pass Little-Big algorithm that first uses a light-weight "little" model to make predictions of all samples, and only passes the difficult ones for the "big" model to solve. Good little companion achieve drastic MACs reduction for a wide variety of model families and scales. Without loss of accuracy or modification of existing models, our Little-Big models achieve MACs reductions of 76% for EfficientViT-L3-384, 81% for EfficientNet-B7-600, 71% for DeiT3-L-384 on ImageNet-1K. Little-Big also speeds up the InternImage-G-512 model by 62% while achieving 90% ImageNet-1K top-1 accuracy, serving both as a strong baseline and as a simple practical method for large model compression.

- **Summary**: Prolonged contact between a corrosive liquid and metal alloys can cause progressive dealloying. For such liquid-metal dealloying (LMD) process, phase field models have been developed. However, the governing equations often involve coupled non-linear partial differential equations (PDE), which are challenging to solve numerically. In particular, stiffness in the PDEs requires an extremely small time steps (e.g. $10^{-12}$ or smaller). This computational bottleneck is especially problematic when running LMD simulation until a late time horizon is required. This motivates the development of surrogate models capable of leaping forward in time, by skipping several consecutive time steps at-once. In this paper, we propose U-Shaped Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (U-AFNO), a machine learning (ML) model inspired by recent advances in neural operator learning. U-AFNO employs U-Nets for extracting and reconstructing local features within the physical fields, and passes the latent space through a vision transformer (ViT) implemented in the Fourier space (AFNO). We use U-AFNOs to learn the dynamics mapping the field at a current time step into a later time step. We also identify global quantities of interest (QoI) describing the corrosion process (e.g. the deformation of the liquid-metal interface) and show that our proposed U-AFNO model is able to accurately predict the field dynamics, in-spite of the chaotic nature of LMD. Our model reproduces the key micro-structure statistics and QoIs with a level of accuracy on-par with the high-fidelity numerical solver. We also investigate the opportunity of using hybrid simulations, in which we alternate forward leap in time using the U-AFNO with high-fidelity time stepping. We demonstrate that while advantageous for some surrogate model design choices, our proposed U-AFNO model in fully auto-regressive settings consistently outperforms hybrid schemes.

- **Summary**: Spurious bias, a tendency to use spurious correlations between non-essential input attributes and target variables for predictions, has revealed a severe robustness pitfall in deep learning models trained on single modality data. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrate both vision and language models, have demonstrated strong capability in joint vision-language understanding. However, whether spurious biases are prevalent in MLLMs remains under-explored. We mitigate this gap by analyzing the spurious biases in a multimodal setting, uncovering the specific test data patterns that can manifest this problem when biases in the vision model cascade into the alignment between visual and text tokens in MLLMs. To better understand this problem, we introduce MM-SpuBench, a comprehensive visual question-answering (VQA) benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' reliance on nine distinct categories of spurious correlations from five open-source image datasets. The VQA dataset is built from human-understandable concept information (attributes). Leveraging this benchmark, we conduct a thorough evaluation of current state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our findings illuminate the persistence of the reliance on spurious correlations from these models and underscore the urge for new methodologies to mitigate spurious biases. To support the MLLM robustness research, we release our VQA benchmark at https://huggingface.co/datasets/mmbench/MM-SpuBench.

- **Summary**: Vastextures is a vast repository of 500,000 textures and PBR materials extracted from real-world images using an unsupervised process. The extracted materials and textures are extremely diverse and cover a vast range of real-world patterns, but at the same time less refined compared to existing repositories. The repository is composed of 2D textures cropped from natural images and SVBRDF/PBR materials generated from these textures. Textures and PBR materials are essential for CGI. Existing materials repositories focus on games, animation, and arts, that demand a limited amount of high-quality assets. However, virtual worlds and synthetic data are becoming increasingly important for training A.I systems for computer vision. This application demands a huge amount of diverse assets but at the same time less affected by noisy and unrefined assets. Vastexture aims to address this need by creating a free, huge, and diverse assets repository that covers as many real-world materials as possible. The materials are automatically extracted from natural images in two steps: 1) Automatically scanning a giant amount of images to identify and crop regions with uniform textures. This is done by splitting the image into a grid of cells and identifying regions in which all of the cells share a similar statistical distribution. 2) Extracting the properties of the PBR material from the cropped texture. This is done by randomly guessing every correlation between the properties of the texture image and the properties of the PBR material. The resulting PBR materials exhibit a vast amount of real-world patterns as well as unexpected emergent properties. Neutral nets trained on this repository outperformed nets trained using handcrafted assets.

- **Summary**: In LaTeX text recognition using Transformer-based architectures, this paper identifies certain "bias" issues. For instance, $e-t$ is frequently misrecognized as $e^{-t}$. This bias stems from the inherent characteristics of the dataset. To mitigate this bias, we propose a LaTeX printed text recognition model trained on a mixed dataset of pseudo-formulas and pseudo-text. The model employs a Swin Transformer as the encoder and a RoBERTa model as the decoder. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach reduces "bias", enhancing the accuracy and robustness of text recognition. For clear images, the model strictly adheres to the image content; for blurred images, it integrates both image and contextual information to produce reasonable recognition results.

- **Summary**: This contribution gives an overview of an ongoing project using machine learning and computer vision components for improving the electronic waste recycling process. In circular economy, the "virtual mines" concept refers to production cycles where interesting raw materials are reclaimed in an efficient and cost-effective manner from end-of-life items. In particular, the growth of e-waste, due to the increasingly shorter life cycle of hi-tech goods, is a global problem. In this paper, we describe a pipeline based on deep learning model to recycle printed circuit boards at the component level. A pre-trained YOLOv5 model is used to analyze the results of the locally developed dataset. With a different distribution of class instances, YOLOv5 managed to achieve satisfactory precision and recall, with the ability to optimize with large component instances.

- **Summary**: The manifestation of symptoms associated with lung diseases can vary in different depths for individual patients, highlighting the significance of 3D information in CT scans for medical image classification. While Vision Transformer has shown superior performance over convolutional neural networks in image classification tasks, their effectiveness is often demonstrated on sufficiently large 2D datasets and they easily encounter overfitting issues on small medical image datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a Diffusion-based 3D Vision Transformer (Diff3Dformer), which utilizes the latent space of the Diffusion model to form the slice sequence for 3D analysis and incorporates clustering attention into ViT to aggregate repetitive information within 3D CT scans, thereby harnessing the power of the advanced transformer in 3D classification tasks on small datasets. Our method exhibits improved performance on two different scales of small datasets of 3D lung CT scans, surpassing the state of the art 3D methods and other transformer-based approaches that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating its robust and superior performance across different scales of data. Experimental results underscore the superiority of our proposed method, indicating its potential for enhancing medical image classification tasks in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Novel dataset creation for all multi-object tracking, crowd-counting, and industrial-based videos is arduous and time-consuming when faced with a unique class that densely populates a video sequence. We propose a time efficient method called POPCat that exploits the multi-target and temporal features of video data to produce a semi-supervised pipeline for segmentation or box-based video annotation. The method retains the accuracy level associated with human level annotation while generating a large volume of semi-supervised annotations for greater generalization. The method capitalizes on temporal features through the use of a particle tracker to expand the domain of human-provided target points. This is done through the use of a particle tracker to reassociate the initial points to a set of images that follow the labeled frame. A YOLO model is then trained with this generated data, and then rapidly infers on the target video. Evaluations are conducted on GMOT-40, AnimalTrack, and Visdrone-2019 benchmarks. These multi-target video tracking/detection sets contain multiple similar-looking targets, camera movements, and other features that would commonly be seen in "wild" situations. We specifically choose these difficult datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of the pipeline and for comparison purposes. The method applied on GMOT-40, AnimalTrack, and Visdrone shows a margin of improvement on recall/mAP50/mAP over the best results by a value of 24.5%/9.6%/4.8%, -/43.1%/27.8%, and 7.5%/9.4%/7.5% where metrics were collected.
