- **Summary**: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is a vital task in computer vision, focusing on distinguishing foreground objects from the background across video frames. Our work draws inspiration from the Cutie model, and we investigate the effects of object memory, the total number of memory frames, and input resolution on segmentation performance. This report validates the effectiveness of our inference method on the coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSE) dataset, which features complex occlusions. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a J\&F score of 0.8139 on the test set, securing the third position in the final ranking. These findings highlight the robustness and accuracy of our method in handling challenging VOS scenarios.

- **Summary**: Protecting digital identities of human face from various attack vectors is paramount, and face anti-spoofing plays a crucial role in this endeavor. Current approaches primarily focus on detecting spoofing attempts within individual frames to detect presentation attacks. However, the emergence of hyper-realistic generative models capable of real-time operation has heightened the risk of digitally generated attacks. In light of these evolving threats, this paper aims to address two key aspects. First, it sheds light on the vulnerabilities of state-of-the-art face anti-spoofing methods against digital attacks. Second, it presents a comprehensive taxonomy of common threats encountered in face anti-spoofing systems. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the limitations of current face anti-spoofing detection techniques and their failure to generalize to novel digital attack scenarios. Notably, the existing models struggle with digital injection attacks including adversarial noise, realistic deepfake attacks, and digital replay attacks. To aid in the design and implementation of robust face anti-spoofing systems resilient to these emerging vulnerabilities, the paper proposes key design principles from model accuracy and robustness to pipeline robustness and even platform robustness. Especially, we suggest to implement the proactive face anti-spoofing system using active sensors to significant reduce the risks for unseen attack vectors and improve the user experience.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce DRR-RATE, a large-scale synthetic chest X-ray dataset derived from the recently released CT-RATE dataset. DRR-RATE comprises of 50,188 frontal Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) from 21,304 unique patients. Each image is paired with a corresponding radiology text report and binary labels for 18 pathology classes. Given the controllable nature of DRR generation, it facilitates the inclusion of lateral view images and images from any desired viewing position. This opens up avenues for research into new and novel multimodal applications involving paired CT, X-ray images from various views, text, and binary labels. We demonstrate the applicability of DRR-RATE alongside existing large-scale chest X-ray resources, notably the CheXpert dataset and CheXnet model. Experiments demonstrate that CheXnet, when trained and tested on the DRR-RATE dataset, achieves sufficient to high AUC scores for the six common pathologies cited in common literature: Atelectasis, Cardiomegaly, Consolidation, Lung Lesion, Lung Opacity, and Pleural Effusion. Additionally, CheXnet trained on the CheXpert dataset can accurately identify several pathologies, even when operating out of distribution. This confirms that the generated DRR images effectively capture the essential pathology features from CT images. The dataset and labels are publicly accessible at https://huggingface.co/datasets/farrell236/DRR-RATE.

- **Summary**: Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) recovers high-dimensional (3D) data cubes from a single 2D measurement, enabling diverse applications like video and hyperspectral imaging to go beyond standard techniques in terms of acquisition speed and efficiency. In this paper, we focus on SCI recovery algorithms that employ untrained neural networks (UNNs), such as deep image prior (DIP), to model source structure. Such UNN-based methods are appealing as they have the potential of avoiding the computationally intensive retraining required for different source models and different measurement scenarios. We first develop a theoretical framework for characterizing the performance of such UNN-based methods. The theoretical framework, on the one hand, enables us to optimize the parameters of data-modulating masks, and on the other hand, provides a fundamental connection between the number of data frames that can be recovered from a single measurement to the parameters of the untrained NN. We also employ the recently proposed bagged-deep-image-prior (bagged-DIP) idea to develop SCI Bagged Deep Video Prior (SCI-BDVP) algorithms that address the common challenges faced by standard UNN solutions. Our experimental results show that in video SCI our proposed solution achieves state-of-the-art among UNN methods, and in the case of noisy measurements, it even outperforms supervised solutions.

- **Summary**: Rendering novel view images in dynamic scenes is a crucial yet challenging task. Current methods mainly utilize NeRF-based methods to represent the static scene and an additional time-variant MLP to model scene deformations, resulting in relatively low rendering quality as well as slow inference speed. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Superpoint Gaussian Splatting (SP-GS). Specifically, our framework first employs explicit 3D Gaussians to reconstruct the scene and then clusters Gaussians with similar properties (e.g., rotation, translation, and location) into superpoints. Empowered by these superpoints, our method manages to extend 3D Gaussian splatting to dynamic scenes with only a slight increase in computational expense. Apart from achieving state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering under high resolutions, the superpoint representation provides a stronger manipulation capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

- **Summary**: Atrous convolutions are employed as a method to increase the receptive field in semantic segmentation tasks. However, in previous works of semantic segmentation, it was rarely employed in the shallow layers of the model. We revisit the design of atrous convolutions in modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and demonstrate that the concept of using large kernels to apply atrous convolutions could be a more powerful paradigm. We propose three guidelines to apply atrous convolutions more efficiently. Following these guidelines, we propose DSNet, a Dual-Branch CNN architecture, which incorporates atrous convolutions in the shallow layers of the model architecture, as well as pretraining the nearly entire encoder on ImageNet to achieve better performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, our models achieve a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and speed on ADE20K, Cityscapes and BDD datasets. Specifically, DSNet achieves 40.0% mIOU with inference speed of 179.2 FPS on ADE20K, and 80.4% mIOU with speed of 81.9 FPS on Cityscapes.

- **Summary**: In this study, we investigate the vulnerability of image watermarks to diffusion-model-based image editing, a challenge exacerbated by the computational cost of accessing gradient information and the closed-source nature of many diffusion models. To address this issue, we introduce JIGMARK. This first-of-its-kind watermarking technique enhances robustness through contrastive learning with pairs of images, processed and unprocessed by diffusion models, without needing a direct backpropagation of the diffusion process. Our evaluation reveals that JIGMARK significantly surpasses existing watermarking solutions in resilience to diffusion-model edits, demonstrating a True Positive Rate more than triple that of leading baselines at a 1% False Positive Rate while preserving image quality. At the same time, it consistently improves the robustness against other conventional perturbations (like JPEG, blurring, etc.) and malicious watermark attacks over the state-of-the-art, often by a large margin. Furthermore, we propose the Human Aligned Variation (HAV) score, a new metric that surpasses traditional similarity measures in quantifying the number of image derivatives from image editing.



### Attribute-Aware Implicit Modality Alignment for Text Attribute Person Search

- **Summary**: Text attribute person search aims to find specific pedestrians through given textual attributes, which is very meaningful in the scene of searching for designated pedestrians through witness descriptions. The key challenge is the significant modality gap between textual attributes and images. Previous methods focused on achieving explicit representation and alignment through unimodal pre-trained models. Nevertheless, the absence of inter-modality correspondence in these models may lead to distortions in the local information of intra-modality. Moreover, these methods only considered the alignment of inter-modality and ignored the differences between different attribute categories. To mitigate the above problems, we propose an Attribute-Aware Implicit Modality Alignment (AIMA) framework to learn the correspondence of local representations between textual attributes and images and combine global representation matching to narrow the modality gap. Firstly, we introduce the CLIP model as the backbone and design prompt templates to transform attribute combinations into structured sentences. This facilitates the model's ability to better understand and match image details. Next, we design a Masked Attribute Prediction (MAP) module that predicts the masked attributes after the interaction of image and masked textual attribute features through multi-modal interaction, thereby achieving implicit local relationship alignment. Finally, we propose an Attribute-IoU Guided Intra-Modal Contrastive (A-IoU IMC) loss, aligning the distribution of different textual attributes in the embedding space with their IoU distribution, achieving better semantic arrangement. Extensive experiments on the Market-1501 Attribute, PETA, and PA100K datasets show that the performance of our proposed method significantly surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Extensions of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to model dynamic scenes have enabled their near photo-realistic, free-viewpoint rendering. Although these methods have shown some potential in creating immersive experiences, two drawbacks limit their ubiquity: (i) a significant reduction in reconstruction quality when the computing budget is limited, and (ii) a lack of semantic understanding of the underlying scenes. To address these issues, we introduce Gear-NeRF, which leverages semantic information from powerful image segmentation models. Our approach presents a principled way for learning a spatio-temporal (4D) semantic embedding, based on which we introduce the concept of gears to allow for stratified modeling of dynamic regions of the scene based on the extent of their motion. Such differentiation allows us to adjust the spatio-temporal sampling resolution for each region in proportion to its motion scale, achieving more photo-realistic dynamic novel view synthesis. At the same time, almost for free, our approach enables free-viewpoint tracking of objects of interest - a functionality not yet achieved by existing NeRF-based methods. Empirical studies validate the effectiveness of our method, where we achieve state-of-the-art rendering and tracking performance on multiple challenging datasets.

- **Summary**: With the development of large models, watermarks are increasingly employed to assert copyright, verify authenticity, or monitor content distribution. As applications become more multimodal, the utility of watermarking techniques becomes even more critical. The effectiveness and reliability of these watermarks largely depend on their robustness to various disturbances. However, the robustness of these watermarks in real-world scenarios, particularly under perturbations and corruption, is not well understood. To highlight the significance of robustness in watermarking techniques, our study evaluated the robustness of watermarked content generated by image and text generation models against common real-world image corruptions and text perturbations. Our results could pave the way for the development of more robust watermarking techniques in the future. Our project website can be found at \url{https://mmwatermark-robustness.github.io/}.

- **Summary**: The expansion of neural network sizes and the enhancement of image resolution through modern camera sensors result in heightened memory and power demands for neural networks. Reducing peak memory, which is the maximum memory consumed during the execution of a neural network, is critical to deploy neural networks on edge devices with limited memory budget. A naive approach to reducing peak memory is aggressive down-sampling of feature maps via pooling with large stride, which often results in unacceptable degradation in network performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose residual encoded distillation (ReDistill) for peak memory reduction in a teacher-student framework, in which a student network with less memory is derived from the teacher network using aggressive pooling. We apply our distillation method to multiple problems in computer vision including image classification and diffusion based image generation. For image classification, our method yields 2x-3.2x measured peak memory on an edge GPU with negligible degradation in accuracy for most CNN based architectures. Additionally, our method yields improved test accuracy for tiny vision transformer (ViT) based models distilled from large CNN based teacher architectures. For diffusion-based image generation, our proposed distillation method yields a denoising network with 4x lower theoretical peak memory while maintaining decent diversity and fidelity for image generation. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance compared to other feature-based and response-based distillation methods.

- **Summary**: Teeth segmentation and recognition are critical in various dental applications and dental diagnosis. Automatic and accurate segmentation approaches have been made possible by integrating deep learning models. Although teeth segmentation has been studied in the past, only some techniques were able to effectively classify and segment teeth simultaneously. This article offers a pipeline of two deep learning models, U-Net and YOLOv8, which results in BB-UNet, a new architecture for the classification and segmentation of teeth on panoramic X-rays that is efficient and reliable. We have improved the quality and reliability of teeth segmentation by utilising the YOLOv8 and U-Net capabilities. The proposed networks have been evaluated using the mean average precision (mAP) and dice coefficient for YOLOv8 and BB-UNet, respectively. We have achieved a 3\% increase in mAP score for teeth classification compared to existing methods, and a 10-15\% increase in dice coefficient for teeth segmentation compared to U-Net across different categories of teeth. A new Dental dataset was created based on UFBA-UESC dataset with Bounding-Box and Polygon annotations of 425 dental panoramic X-rays. The findings of this research pave the way for a wider adoption of object detection models in the field of dental diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Millions of news articles published online daily can overwhelm readers. Headlines and entity (topic) tags are essential for guiding readers to decide if the content is worth their time. While headline generation has been extensively studied, tag generation remains largely unexplored, yet it offers readers better access to topics of interest. The need for conciseness in capturing readers' attention necessitates improved content selection strategies for identifying salient and relevant segments within lengthy articles, thereby guiding language models effectively. To address this, we propose to leverage auxiliary information such as images and captions embedded in the articles to retrieve relevant sentences and utilize instruction tuning with variations to generate both headlines and tags for news articles in a multilingual context. To make use of the auxiliary information, we have compiled a dataset named XL-HeadTags, which includes 20 languages across 6 diverse language families. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our plug-and-play multimodal-multilingual retrievers for both tasks. Additionally, we have developed a suite of tools for processing and evaluating multilingual texts, significantly contributing to the research community by enabling more accurate and efficient analysis across languages.

- **Summary**: Though dataset distillation has witnessed rapid development in recent years, the distillation of multimodal data, e.g., image-text pairs, poses unique and under-explored challenges. Unlike unimodal data, image-text contrastive learning (ITC) data lack inherent categorization and should instead place greater emphasis on modality correspondence. In this work, we propose Low-Rank Similarity Mining (LoRS) for multimodal dataset distillation, that concurrently distills a ground truth similarity matrix with image-text pairs, and leverages low-rank factorization for efficiency and scalability. The proposed approach brings significant improvement to the existing algorithms, marking a significant contribution to the field of visual-language dataset distillation. We advocate adopting LoRS as a foundational synthetic data setup for image-text dataset distillation. Our code is available at https://github.com/silicx/LoRS_Distill.

- **Summary**: Hybrid dynamical systems are prevalent in science and engineering to express complex systems with continuous and discrete states. To learn the laws of systems, all previous methods for equation discovery in hybrid systems follow a two-stage paradigm, i.e. they first group time series into small cluster fragments and then discover equations in each fragment separately through methods in non-hybrid systems. Although effective, these methods do not fully take advantage of the commonalities in the shared dynamics of multiple fragments that are driven by the same equations. Besides, the two-stage paradigm breaks the interdependence between categorizing and representing dynamics that jointly form hybrid systems. In this paper, we reformulate the problem and propose an end-to-end learning framework, i.e. Amortized Equation Discovery (AMORE), to jointly categorize modes and discover equations characterizing the dynamics of each mode by all segments of the mode. Experiments on four hybrid and six non-hybrid systems show that our method outperforms previous methods on equation discovery, segmentation, and forecasting.

- **Summary**: Accurate and robust localization remains a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles. The cost of sensors and limitations in local computational efficiency make it difficult to scale to large commercial applications. Traditional vision-based approaches focus on texture features that are susceptible to changes in lighting, season, perspective, and appearance. Additionally, the large storage size of maps with descriptors and complex optimization processes hinder system performance. To balance efficiency and accuracy, we propose a novel lightweight visual semantic localization algorithm that employs stable semantic features instead of low-level texture features. First, semantic maps are constructed offline by detecting semantic objects, such as ground markers, lane lines, and poles, using cameras or LiDAR sensors. Then, online visual localization is performed through data association of semantic features and map objects. We evaluated our proposed localization framework in the publicly available KAIST Urban dataset and in scenarios recorded by ourselves. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is a reliable and practical localization solution in various autonomous driving localization tasks.

- **Summary**: Human Activity Recognition is a longstanding problem in AI with applications in a broad range of areas: from healthcare, sports and fitness, security, and human computer interaction to robotics. The performance of HAR in real-world settings is strongly dependent on the type and quality of the input signal that can be acquired. Given an unobstructed, high-quality camera view of a scene, computer vision systems, in particular in conjunction with foundational models (e.g., CLIP), can today fairly reliably distinguish complex activities. On the other hand, recognition using modalities such as wearable sensors (which are often more broadly available, e.g, in mobile phones and smartwatches) is a more difficult problem, as the signals often contain less information and labeled training data is more difficult to acquire. In this work, we show how we can improve HAR performance across different modalities using multimodal contrastive pretraining. Our approach MuJo (Multimodal Joint Feature Space Learning), learns a multimodal joint feature space with video, language, pose, and IMU sensor data. The proposed approach combines contrastive and multitask learning methods and analyzes different multitasking strategies for learning a compact shared representation. A large dataset with parallel video, language, pose, and sensor data points is also introduced to support the research, along with an analysis of the robustness of the multimodal joint space for modal-incomplete and low-resource data. On the MM-Fit dataset, our model achieves an impressive Macro F1-Score of up to 0.992 with only 2% of the train data and 0.999 when using all available training data for classification tasks. Moreover, in the scenario where the MM-Fit dataset is unseen, we demonstrate a generalization performance of up to 0.638.

- **Summary**: The AEFishBIT tri-axial accelerometer was externally attached to the operculum to assess the divergent activity and respiratory patterns of two marine farmed fish, the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) and European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Analysis of raw data from exercised fish highlighted the large amplitude of operculum aperture and body tail movements in European sea bass, which were overall more stable at low-medium exercise intensity levels. Cosinor analysis in free-swimming fish (on-board data processing) highlighted a pronounced daily rhythmicity of locomotor activity and respiratory frequency in both gilthead sea bream and European sea bass. Acrophases of activity and respiration were coupled in gilthead sea bream, acting feeding time (once daily at 11:00 h) as a main synchronizing factor. By contrast, locomotor activity and respiratory frequency were out of phase in European sea bass with activity acrophase on early morning and respiration acrophase on the afternoon. The daily range of activity and respiration variation was also higher in European sea bass, probably as part of the adaptation of this fish species to act as a fast swimming predator. In any case, lower locomotor activity and enhanced respiration were associated with larger body weight in both fish species. This agrees with the notion that selection for fast growth in farming conditions is accompanied by a lower activity profile, which may favor an efficient feed conversion for growth purposes. Therefore, the use of behavioral monitoring is becoming a reliable and large-scale promising tool for selecting more efficient farmed fish, allowing researchers and farmers to establish stricter criteria of welfare for more sustainable and ethical fish production.

- **Summary**: Semantic communication, as a revolutionary communication architecture, is considered a promising novel communication paradigm. Unlike traditional symbol-based error-free communication systems, semantic-based visual communication systems extract, compress, transmit, and reconstruct images at the semantic level. However, widely used image similarity evaluation metrics, whether pixel-based MSE or PSNR or structure-based MS-SSIM, struggle to accurately measure the loss of semantic-level information of the source during system transmission. This presents challenges in evaluating the performance of visual semantic communication systems, especially when comparing them with traditional communication systems. To address this, we propose a semantic evaluation metric -- SeSS (Semantic Similarity Score), based on Scene Graph Generation and graph matching, which shifts the similarity scores between images into semantic-level graph matching scores. Meanwhile, semantic similarity scores for tens of thousands of image pairs are manually annotated to fine-tune the hyperparameters in the graph matching algorithm, aligning the metric more closely with human semantic perception. The performance of the SeSS is tested on different datasets, including (1)images transmitted by traditional and semantic communication systems at different compression rates, (2)images transmitted by traditional and semantic communication systems at different signal-to-noise ratios, (3)images generated by large-scale model with different noise levels introduced, and (4)cases of images subjected to certain special transformations. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SeSS, indicating that the metric can measure the semantic-level differences in semantic-level information of images and can be used for evaluation in visual semantic communication systems.

- **Summary**: Designing 3D indoor layouts is a crucial task with significant applications in virtual reality, interior design, and automated space planning. Existing methods for 3D layout design either rely on diffusion models, which utilize spatial relationship priors, or heavily leverage the inferential capabilities of proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs), which require extensive prompt engineering and in-context exemplars via black-box trials. These methods often face limitations in generalization and dynamic scene editing. In this paper, we introduce LLplace, a novel 3D indoor scene layout designer based on lightweight fine-tuned open-source LLM Llama3. LLplace circumvents the need for spatial relationship priors and in-context exemplars, enabling efficient and credible room layout generation based solely on user inputs specifying the room type and desired objects. We curated a new dialogue dataset based on the 3D-Front dataset, expanding the original data volume and incorporating dialogue data for adding and removing objects. This dataset can enhance the LLM's spatial understanding. Furthermore, through dialogue, LLplace activates the LLM's capability to understand 3D layouts and perform dynamic scene editing, enabling the addition and removal of objects. Our approach demonstrates that LLplace can effectively generate and edit 3D indoor layouts interactively and outperform existing methods in delivering high-quality 3D design solutions. Code and dataset will be released.

- **Summary**: Implicit neural representations have emerged as a powerful paradigm to represent signals such as images and sounds. This approach aims to utilize neural networks to parameterize the implicit function of the signal. However, when representing implicit functions, traditional neural networks such as ReLU-based multilayer perceptrons face challenges in accurately modeling high-frequency components of signals. Recent research has begun to explore the use of Fourier Neural Networks (FNNs) to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we propose Quantum Implicit Representation Network (QIREN), a novel quantum generalization of FNNs. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that QIREN possesses a quantum advantage over classical FNNs. Lastly, we conducted experiments in signal representation, image superresolution, and image generation tasks to show the superior performance of QIREN compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Our work not only incorporates quantum advantages into implicit neural representations but also uncovers a promising application direction for Quantum Neural Networks.



### Bench2Drive: Towards Multi-Ability Benchmarking of Closed-Loop End-To-End Autonomous Driving

- **Summary**: In an era marked by the rapid scaling of foundation models, autonomous driving technologies are approaching a transformative threshold where end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) emerges due to its potential of scaling up in the data-driven manner. However, existing E2E-AD methods are mostly evaluated under the open-loop log-replay manner with L2 errors and collision rate as metrics (e.g., in nuScenes), which could not fully reflect the driving performance of algorithms as recently acknowledged in the community. For those E2E-AD methods evaluated under the closed-loop protocol, they are tested in fixed routes (e.g., Town05Long and Longest6 in CARLA) with the driving score as metrics, which is known for high variance due to the unsmoothed metric function and large randomness in the long route. Besides, these methods usually collect their own data for training, which makes algorithm-level fair comparison infeasible.   To fulfill the paramount need of comprehensive, realistic, and fair testing environments for Full Self-Driving (FSD), we present Bench2Drive, the first benchmark for evaluating E2E-AD systems' multiple abilities in a closed-loop manner. Bench2Drive's official training data consists of 2 million fully annotated frames, collected from 10000 short clips uniformly distributed under 44 interactive scenarios (cut-in, overtaking, detour, etc), 23 weathers (sunny, foggy, rainy, etc), and 12 towns (urban, village, university, etc) in CARLA v2. Its evaluation protocol requires E2E-AD models to pass 44 interactive scenarios under different locations and weathers which sums up to 220 routes and thus provides a comprehensive and disentangled assessment about their driving capability under different situations. We implement state-of-the-art E2E-AD models and evaluate them in Bench2Drive, providing insights regarding current status and future directions.

- **Summary**: Current structured pruning methods often result in considerable accuracy drops due to abrupt network changes and loss of information from pruned structures. To address these issues, we introduce the Decay Pruning Method (DPM), a novel smooth pruning approach with a self-rectifying mechanism. DPM consists of two key components: (i) Smooth Pruning: It converts conventional single-step pruning into multi-step smooth pruning, gradually reducing redundant structures to zero over N steps with ongoing optimization. (ii) Self-Rectifying: This procedure further enhances the aforementioned process by rectifying sub-optimal pruning based on gradient information. Our approach demonstrates strong generalizability and can be easily integrated with various existing pruning methods. We validate the effectiveness of DPM by integrating it with three popular pruning methods: OTOv2, Depgraph, and Gate Decorator. Experimental results show consistent improvements in performance compared to the original pruning methods, along with further reductions of FLOPs in most scenarios.

  Segmentation
- **Summary**: This paper describes a solution for the MedAI competition, in which participants were required to segment both polyps and surgical instruments from endoscopic images. Our approach relies on a double encoder-decoder neural network which we have previously applied for polyp segmentation, but with a series of enhancements: a more powerful encoder architecture, an improved optimization procedure, and the post-processing of segmentations based on tempered model ensembling. Experimental results show that our method produces segmentations that show a good agreement with manual delineations provided by medical experts.

- **Summary**: Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is an important imaging technology widely used in medical scenarios, such as diagnosis and preoperative planning. Using fewer projection views to reconstruct CT, also known as sparse-view reconstruction, can reduce ionizing radiation and further benefit interventional radiology. Compared with sparse-view reconstruction for traditional parallel/fan-beam CT, CBCT reconstruction is more challenging due to the increased dimensionality caused by the measurement process based on cone-shaped X-ray beams. As a 2D-to-3D reconstruction problem, although implicit neural representations have been introduced to enable efficient training, only local features are considered and different views are processed equally in previous works, resulting in spatial inconsistency and poor performance on complicated anatomies. To this end, we propose C^2RV by leveraging explicit multi-scale volumetric representations to enable cross-regional learning in the 3D space. Additionally, the scale-view cross-attention module is introduced to adaptively aggregate multi-scale and multi-view features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our C^2RV achieves consistent and significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods on datasets with diverse anatomy.

- **Summary**: As current computing capabilities increase, modern machine learning and computer vision system tend to increase in complexity, mostly by means of larger models and advanced optimization strategies. Although often neglected, in many problems there is also much to be gained by considering potential improvements in understanding and better leveraging already-available training data, including annotations. This so-called data-centric approach can lead to substantial performance increases, sometimes beyond what can be achieved by larger models. In this paper we adopt such an approach for the task of justifiable glaucoma screening from retinal images. In particular, we focus on how to combine information from multiple annotators of different skills into a tailored label smoothing scheme that allows us to better employ a large collection of fundus images, instead of discarding samples suffering from inter-rater variability. Internal validation results indicate that our bespoke label smoothing approach surpasses the performance of a standard resnet50 model and also the same model trained with conventional label smoothing techniques, in particular for the multi-label scenario of predicting clinical reasons of glaucoma likelihood in a highly imbalanced screening context.

- **Summary**: Contextual cues related to a person's pose and interactions with objects and other people in the scene can provide valuable information for gaze following. While existing methods have focused on dedicated cue extraction methods, in this work we investigate the zero-shot capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for extracting a wide array of contextual cues to improve gaze following performance. We first evaluate various VLMs, prompting strategies, and in-context learning (ICL) techniques for zero-shot cue recognition performance. We then use these insights to extract contextual cues for gaze following, and investigate their impact when incorporated into a state of the art model for the task. Our analysis indicates that BLIP-2 is the overall top performing VLM and that ICL can improve performance. We also observe that VLMs are sensitive to the choice of the text prompt although ensembling over multiple text prompts can provide more robust performance. Additionally, we discover that using the entire image along with an ellipse drawn around the target person is the most effective strategy for visual prompting. For gaze following, incorporating the extracted cues results in better generalization performance, especially when considering a larger set of cues, highlighting the potential of this approach.

- **Summary**: With the rise of digital communication, memes have become a significant medium for cultural and political expression that is often used to mislead audiences. Identification of such misleading and persuasive multimodal content has become more important among various stakeholders, including social media platforms, policymakers, and the broader society as they often cause harm to individuals, organizations, and/or society. While there has been effort to develop AI-based automatic systems for resource-rich languages (e.g., English), it is relatively little to none for medium to low resource languages. In this study, we focused on developing an Arabic memes dataset with manual annotations of propagandistic content. We annotated ~6K Arabic memes collected from various social media platforms, which is a first resource for Arabic multimodal research. We provide a comprehensive analysis aiming to develop computational tools for their detection. We will make them publicly available for the community.

- **Summary**: The successful application of semantic segmentation technology in the real world has been among the most exciting achievements in the computer vision community over the past decade. Although the long-tailed phenomenon has been investigated in many fields, e.g., classification and object detection, it has not received enough attention in semantic segmentation and has become a non-negligible obstacle to applying semantic segmentation technology in autonomous driving and virtual reality. Therefore, in this work, we focus on a relatively under-explored task setting, long-tailed semantic segmentation (LTSS). We first establish three representative datasets from different aspects, i.e., scene, object, and human. We further propose a dual-metric evaluation system and construct the LTSS benchmark to demonstrate the performance of semantic segmentation methods and long-tailed solutions. We also propose a transformer-based algorithm to improve LTSS, frequency-based matcher, which solves the oversuppression problem by one-to-many matching and automatically determines the number of matching queries for each class. Given the comprehensiveness of this work and the importance of the issues revealed, this work aims to promote the empirical study of semantic segmentation tasks. Our datasets, codes, and models will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Transformer models are increasingly used for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Several adaptations have been proposed, all of which suffer from the typical problems of Transformers, such as quadratic memory and time complexity. Furthermore, all prevalent architectures for PDE solving lack at least one of several desirable properties of an ideal surrogate model, such as (i) generalization to PDE parameters not seen during training, (ii) spatial and temporal zero-shot super-resolution, (iii) continuous temporal extrapolation, (iv) support for 1D, 2D, and 3D PDEs, and (v) efficient inference for longer temporal rollouts. To address these limitations, we propose Vectorized Conditional Neural Fields (VCNeFs), which represent the solution of time-dependent PDEs as neural fields. Contrary to prior methods, however, VCNeFs compute, for a set of multiple spatio-temporal query points, their solutions in parallel and model their dependencies through attention mechanisms. Moreover, VCNeF can condition the neural field on both the initial conditions and the parameters of the PDEs. An extensive set of experiments demonstrates that VCNeFs are competitive with and often outperform existing ML-based surrogate models.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based image compression algorithms typically focus on designing encoding and decoding networks and improving the accuracy of entropy model estimation to enhance the rate-distortion (RD) performance. However, few algorithms leverage the compression distortion prior from existing compression algorithms to improve RD performance. In this paper, we propose a latent diffusion model-based remote sensing image compression (LDM-RSIC) method, which aims to enhance the final decoding quality of RS images by utilizing the generated distortion prior from a LDM. Our approach consists of two stages. In the first stage, a self-encoder learns prior from the high-quality input image. In the second stage, the prior is generated through an LDM, conditioned on the decoded image of an existing learning-based image compression algorithm, to be used as auxiliary information for generating the texture-rich enhanced image. To better utilize the prior, a channel attention and gate-based dynamic feature attention module (DFAM) is embedded into a Transformer-based multi-scale enhancement network (MEN) for image enhancement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed LDM-RSIC significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art traditional and learning-based image compression algorithms in terms of both subjective perception and objective metrics. Additionally, we use the LDM-based scheme to improve the traditional image compression algorithm JPEG2000 and obtain 32.00% bit savings on the DOTA testing set.

- **Summary**: The evaluation of lymph node metastases plays a crucial role in achieving precise cancer staging, influencing subsequent decisions regarding treatment options. Lymph node detection poses challenges due to the presence of unclear boundaries and the diverse range of sizes and morphological characteristics, making it a resource-intensive process. As part of the LNQ 2023 MICCAI challenge, we propose the use of anatomical priors as a tool to address the challenges that persist in mediastinal lymph node segmentation in combination with the partial annotation of the challenge training data. The model ensemble using all suggested modifications yields a Dice score of 0.6033 and segments 57% of the ground truth lymph nodes, compared to 27% when training on CT only. Segmentation accuracy is improved significantly by incorporating a probabilistic lymph node atlas in loss weighting and post-processing. The largest performance gains are achieved by oversampling fully annotated data to account for the partial annotation of the challenge training data, as well as adding additional data augmentation to address the high heterogeneity of the CT images and lymph node appearance.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we use matrix information theory as an analytical tool to analyze the dynamics of the information interplay between data representations and classification head vectors in the supervised learning process. Specifically, inspired by the theory of Neural Collapse, we introduce matrix mutual information ratio (MIR) and matrix entropy difference ratio (HDR) to assess the interactions of data representation and class classification heads in supervised learning, and we determine the theoretical optimal values for MIR and HDR when Neural Collapse happens. Our experiments show that MIR and HDR can effectively explain many phenomena occurring in neural networks, for example, the standard supervised training dynamics, linear mode connectivity, and the performance of label smoothing and pruning. Additionally, we use MIR and HDR to gain insights into the dynamics of grokking, which is an intriguing phenomenon observed in supervised training, where the model demonstrates generalization capabilities long after it has learned to fit the training data. Furthermore, we introduce MIR and HDR as loss terms in supervised and semi-supervised learning to optimize the information interactions among samples and classification heads. The empirical results provide evidence of the method's effectiveness, demonstrating that the utilization of MIR and HDR not only aids in comprehending the dynamics throughout the training process but can also enhances the training procedure itself.

- **Summary**: In the realm of large vision language models (LVLMs), jailbreak attacks serve as a red-teaming approach to bypass guardrails and uncover safety implications. Existing jailbreaks predominantly focus on the visual modality, perturbing solely visual inputs in the prompt for attacks. However, they fall short when confronted with aligned models that fuse visual and textual features simultaneously for generation. To address this limitation, this paper introduces the Bi-Modal Adversarial Prompt Attack (BAP), which executes jailbreaks by optimizing textual and visual prompts cohesively. Initially, we adversarially embed universally harmful perturbations in an image, guided by a few-shot query-agnostic corpus (e.g., affirmative prefixes and negative inhibitions). This process ensures that image prompt LVLMs to respond positively to any harmful queries. Subsequently, leveraging the adversarial image, we optimize textual prompts with specific harmful intent. In particular, we utilize a large language model to analyze jailbreak failures and employ chain-of-thought reasoning to refine textual prompts through a feedback-iteration manner. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we conducted extensive evaluations on various datasets and LVLMs, demonstrating that our method significantly outperforms other methods by large margins (+29.03% in attack success rate on average). Additionally, we showcase the potential of our attacks on black-box commercial LVLMs, such as Gemini and ChatGLM.

Our method utilizes object masks and individual descriptions, coupled with a global text prompt, to generate images with high fidelity. Zero-Painter employs a two-stage process involving our novel Prompt-Adjusted Cross-Attention (PACA) and Region-Grouped Cross-Attention (ReGCA) blocks, ensuring precise alignment of generated objects with textual prompts and mask shapes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Zero-Painter surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in preserving textual details and adhering to mask shapes.

- **Summary**: Cuneiform tablets, emerging in ancient Mesopotamia around the late fourth millennium BCE, represent one of humanity's earliest writing systems. Characterized by wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets, these artifacts provided insight into Mesopotamian civilization across various domains. Traditionally, the analysis and dating of these tablets rely on subjective assessment of shape and writing style, leading to uncertainties in pinpointing their exact temporal origins. Recent advances in digitization have revolutionized the study of cuneiform by enhancing accessibility and analytical capabilities. Our research uniquely focuses on the silhouette of tablets as significant indicators of their historical periods, diverging from most studies that concentrate on textual content. Utilizing an unprecedented dataset of over 94,000 images from the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative collection, we apply deep learning methods to classify cuneiform tablets, covering over 3,000 years of history. By leveraging statistical, computational techniques, and generative modeling through Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), we achieve substantial advancements in the automatic classification of these ancient documents, focusing on the tablets' silhouettes as key predictors. Our classification approach begins with a Decision Tree using height-to-width ratios and culminates with a ResNet50 model, achieving a 61% macro F1-score for tablet silhouettes. Moreover, we introduce novel VAE-powered tools to enhance explainability and enable researchers to explore changes in tablet shapes across different eras and genres. This research contributes to document analysis and diplomatics by demonstrating the value of large-scale data analysis combined with statistical methods. These insights offer valuable tools for historians and epigraphists, enriching our understanding of cuneiform tablets and the cultures that produced them.

- **Summary**: The Semmeldetector, is a machine learning application that utilizes object detection models to detect, classify and count baked goods in images. Our application allows commercial bakers to track unsold baked goods, which allows them to optimize production and increase resource efficiency. We compiled a dataset comprising 1151 images that distinguishes between 18 different types of baked goods to train our detection models. To facilitate model training, we used a Copy-Paste augmentation pipeline to expand our dataset. We trained the state-of-the-art object detection model YOLOv8 on our detection task. We tested the impact of different training data, model scale, and online image augmentation pipelines on model performance. Our overall best performing model, achieved an AP@0.5 of 89.1% on our test set. Based on our results, we conclude that machine learning can be a valuable tool even for unforeseen industries like bakeries, even with very limited datasets.



### Interpretable Lightweight Transformer via Unrolling of Learned Graph Smoothness Priors

- **Summary**: We build interpretable and lightweight transformer-like neural networks by unrolling iterative optimization algorithms that minimize graph smoothness priors -- the quadratic graph Laplacian regularizer (GLR) and the $\ell_1$-norm graph total variation (GTV) -- subject to an interpolation constraint. The crucial insight is that a normalized signal-dependent graph learning module amounts to a variant of the basic self-attention mechanism in conventional transformers. Unlike "black-box" transformers that require learning of large key, query and value matrices to compute scaled dot products as affinities and subsequent output embeddings, resulting in huge parameter sets, our unrolled networks employ shallow CNNs to learn low-dimensional features per node to establish pairwise Mahalanobis distances and construct sparse similarity graphs. At each layer, given a learned graph, the target interpolated signal is simply a low-pass filtered output derived from the minimization of an assumed graph smoothness prior, leading to a dramatic reduction in parameter count. Experiments for two image interpolation applications verify the restoration performance, parameter efficiency and robustness to covariate shift of our graph-based unrolled networks compared to conventional transformers.

- **Summary**: Ultrasound imaging has been widely used in clinical examinations owing to the advantages of being portable, real-time, and radiation-free. Considering the potential of extensive deployment of autonomous examination systems in hospitals, robotic US imaging has attracted increased attention. However, due to the inter-patient variations, it is still challenging to have an optimal path for each patient, particularly for thoracic applications with limited acoustic windows, e.g., intercostal liver imaging. To address this problem, a class-aware cartilage bone segmentation network with geometry-constraint post-processing is presented to capture patient-specific rib skeletons. Then, a dense skeleton graph-based non-rigid registration is presented to map the intercostal scanning path from a generic template to individual patients. By explicitly considering the high-acoustic impedance bone structures, the transferred scanning path can be precisely located in the intercostal space, enhancing the visibility of internal organs by reducing the acoustic shadow. To evaluate the proposed approach, the final path mapping performance is validated on five distinct CTs and two volunteer US data, resulting in ten pairs of CT-US combinations. Results demonstrate that the proposed graph-based registration method can robustly and precisely map the path from CT template to individual patients (Euclidean error: $2.21\pm1.11~mm$).

- **Journal**: CVPR 2024
- **Summary**: In recent years, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in representing 3D scenes. To expedite the rendering process, learnable explicit representations have been introduced for combination with implicit NeRF representation, which however results in a large storage space requirement. In this paper, we introduce the Context-based NeRF Compression (CNC) framework, which leverages highly efficient context models to provide a storage-friendly NeRF representation. Specifically, we excavate both level-wise and dimension-wise context dependencies to enable probability prediction for information entropy reduction. Additionally, we exploit hash collision and occupancy grids as strong prior knowledge for better context modeling. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to construct and exploit context models for NeRF compression. We achieve a size reduction of 100$\times$ and 70$\times$ with improved fidelity against the baseline Instant-NGP on Synthesic-NeRF and Tanks and Temples datasets, respectively. Additionally, we attain 86.7\% and 82.3\% storage size reduction against the SOTA NeRF compression method BiRF. Our code is available here: https://github.com/YihangChen-ee/CNC.

- **Summary**: We present a new method for making diffusion models faster to sample. The method distills many-step diffusion models into few-step models by matching conditional expectations of the clean data given noisy data along the sampling trajectory. Our approach extends recently proposed one-step methods to the multi-step case, and provides a new perspective by interpreting these approaches in terms of moment matching. By using up to 8 sampling steps, we obtain distilled models that outperform not only their one-step versions but also their original many-step teacher models, obtaining new state-of-the-art results on the Imagenet dataset. We also show promising results on a large text-to-image model where we achieve fast generation of high resolution images directly in image space, without needing autoencoders or upsamplers.

- **Summary**: Due to its cloud-penetrating capability and independence from solar illumination, satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is the preferred data source for large-scale flood mapping, providing global coverage and including various land cover classes. However, most studies on large-scale SAR-derived flood mapping using deep learning algorithms have primarily focused on flooded open areas, utilizing available open-access datasets (e.g., Sen1Floods11) and with limited attention to urban floods. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{UrbanSARFloods}, a floodwater dataset featuring pre-processed Sentinel-1 intensity data and interferometric coherence imagery acquired before and during flood events. It contains 8,879 $512\times 512$ chips covering 807,500 $km^2$ across 20 land cover classes and 5 continents, spanning 18 flood events. We used UrbanSARFloods to benchmark existing state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for segmenting open and urban flood areas. Our findings indicate that prevalent approaches, including the Weighted Cross-Entropy (WCE) loss and the application of transfer learning with pretrained models, fall short in overcoming the obstacles posed by imbalanced data and the constraints of a small training dataset. Urban flood detection remains challenging. Future research should explore strategies for addressing imbalanced data challenges and investigate transfer learning's potential for SAR-based large-scale flood mapping. Besides, expanding this dataset to include additional flood events holds promise for enhancing its utility and contributing to advancements in flood mapping techniques.

- **Summary**: Texture mapping is a common technology in the area of computer graphics, it maps the 3D surface space onto the 2D texture space. However, the loose texture space will reduce the efficiency of data storage and GPU memory addressing in the rendering process. Many of the existing methods focus on repacking given textures, but they still suffer from high computational cost and hardly produce a wholly tight texture space. In this paper, we propose a method to optimize the texture space and produce a new texture mapping which is compact based on global parameterization. The proposed method is computationally robust and efficient. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method and the potency in improving the storage and rendering efficiency.

- **Summary**: Lensless cameras, innovatively replacing traditional lenses for ultra-thin, flat optics, encode light directly onto sensors, producing images that are not immediately recognizable. This compact, lightweight, and cost-effective imaging solution offers inherent privacy advantages, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive applications like face verification. Typical lensless face verification adopts a two-stage process of reconstruction followed by verification, incurring privacy risks from reconstructed faces and high computational costs. This paper presents an end-to-end optimization approach for privacy-preserving face verification directly on encoded lensless captures, ensuring that the entire software pipeline remains encoded with no visible faces as intermediate results. To achieve this, we propose several techniques to address unique challenges from the lensless setup which precludes traditional face detection and alignment. Specifically, we propose a face center alignment scheme, an augmentation curriculum to build robustness against variations, and a knowledge distillation method to smooth optimization and enhance performance. Evaluations under both simulation and real environment demonstrate our method outperforms two-stage lensless verification while enhancing privacy and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Visual perspective taking (VPT) is the ability to perceive and reason about the perspectives of others. It is an essential feature of human intelligence, which develops over the first decade of life and requires an ability to process the 3D structure of visual scenes. A growing number of reports have indicated that deep neural networks (DNNs) become capable of analyzing 3D scenes after training on large image datasets. We investigated if this emergent ability for 3D analysis in DNNs is sufficient for VPT with the 3D perception challenge (3D-PC): a novel benchmark for 3D perception in humans and DNNs. The 3D-PC is comprised of three 3D-analysis tasks posed within natural scene images: 1. a simple test of object depth order, 2. a basic VPT task (VPT-basic), and 3. another version of VPT (VPT-Strategy) designed to limit the effectiveness of "shortcut" visual strategies. We tested human participants (N=33) and linearly probed or text-prompted over 300 DNNs on the challenge and found that nearly all of the DNNs approached or exceeded human accuracy in analyzing object depth order. Surprisingly, DNN accuracy on this task correlated with their object recognition performance. In contrast, there was an extraordinary gap between DNNs and humans on VPT-basic. Humans were nearly perfect, whereas most DNNs were near chance. Fine-tuning DNNs on VPT-basic brought them close to human performance, but they, unlike humans, dropped back to chance when tested on VPT-perturb. Our challenge demonstrates that the training routines and architectures of today's DNNs are well-suited for learning basic 3D properties of scenes and objects but are ill-suited for reasoning about these properties like humans do. We release our 3D-PC datasets and code to help bridge this gap in 3D perception between humans and machines.

- **Summary**: Joint space and task space control are the two dominant action modes for controlling robot arms within the robot learning literature. Actions in joint space provide precise control over the robot's pose, but tend to suffer from inefficient training; actions in task space boast data-efficient training but sacrifice the ability to perform tasks in confined spaces due to limited control over the full joint configuration. This work analyses the criteria for designing action spaces for robot manipulation and introduces ER (End-effector Redundancy), a novel action space formulation that, by addressing the redundancies present in the manipulator, aims to combine the advantages of both joint and task spaces, offering fine-grained comprehensive control with overactuated robot arms whilst achieving highly efficient robot learning. We present two implementations of ER, ERAngle (ERA) and ERJoint (ERJ), and we show that ERJ in particular demonstrates superior performance across multiple settings, especially when precise control over the robot configuration is required. We validate our results both in simulated and real robotic environments.

- **Summary**: Geometry-agnostic system identification is a technique for identifying the geometry and physical properties of an object from video sequences without any geometric assumptions. Recently, physics-augmented continuum neural radiance fields (PAC-NeRF) has demonstrated promising results for this technique by utilizing a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian representation, in which the geometry is represented by the Eulerian grid representations of NeRF, the physics is described by a material point method (MPM), and they are connected via Lagrangian particles. However, a notable limitation of PAC-NeRF is that its performance is sensitive to the learning of the geometry from the first frames owing to its two-step optimization. First, the grid representations are optimized with the first frames of video sequences, and then the physical properties are optimized through video sequences utilizing the fixed first-frame grid representations. This limitation can be critical when learning of the geometric structure is difficult, for example, in a few-shot (sparse view) setting. To overcome this limitation, we propose Lagrangian particle optimization (LPO), in which the positions and features of particles are optimized through video sequences in Lagrangian space. This method allows for the optimization of the geometric structure across the entire video sequence within the physical constraints imposed by the MPM. The experimental results demonstrate that the LPO is useful for geometric correction and physical identification in sparse-view settings.

- **Summary**: Multi-baseline SAR 3D imaging faces significant challenges due to data sparsity. In recent years, deep learning techniques have achieved notable success in enhancing the quality of sparse SAR 3D imaging. However, previous work typically rely on full-aperture high-resolution radar images to supervise the training of deep neural networks (DNNs), utilizing only single-modal information from radar data. Consequently, imaging performance is limited, and acquiring full-aperture data for multi-baseline SAR is costly and sometimes impractical in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Modal Reconstruction Network (CMR-Net), which integrates differentiable render and cross-modal supervision with optical images to reconstruct highly sparse multi-baseline SAR 3D images of vehicle targets into visually structured and high-resolution images. We meticulously designed the network architecture and training strategies to enhance network generalization capability. Remarkably, CMR-Net, trained solely on simulated data, demonstrates high-resolution reconstruction capabilities on both publicly available simulation datasets and real measured datasets, outperforming traditional sparse reconstruction algorithms based on compressed sensing and other learning-based methods. Additionally, using optical images as supervision provides a cost-effective way to build training datasets, reducing the difficulty of method dissemination. Our work showcases the broad prospects of deep learning in multi-baseline SAR 3D imaging and offers a novel path for researching radar imaging based on cross-modal learning theory.

- **Summary**: This study presents a new computational approach for simulating the microbial decomposition of organic matter, from 3D micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) images of soil. The method employs a valuated graph of connected voxels to simulate transformation and diffusion processes involved in microbial decomposition within the complex soil matrix. The resulting model can be adapted to simulate any diffusion-transformation processes in porous media. We implemented parallelization strategies and explored different numerical methods, including implicit, explicit, synchronous, and asynchronous schemes. To validate our method, we compared simulation outputs with those provided by LBioS and by Mosaic models. LBioS uses a lattice-Boltzmann method for diffusion and Mosaic takes benefit of Pore Network Geometrical Modelling (PNGM) by means of geometrical primitives such as spheres and ellipsoids. This approach achieved comparable results to traditional LBM-based simulations, but required only one-fourth of the computing time. Compared to Mosaic simulation, the proposed method is slower but more accurate and does not require any calibration. Furthermore, we present a theoretical framework and an application example to enhance PNGM-based simulations. This is accomplished by approximating the diffusional conductance coefficients using stochastic gradient descent and data generated by the current approach.

- **Summary**: Implicit neural representation (INR) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for signal representations, which takes coordinates as inputs and generates corresponding signal values. Since these coordinates contain no semantic features, INR fails to take any semantic information into consideration. However, semantic information has been proven critical in many vision tasks, especially for visual signal representation. This paper proposes a reparameterization method termed as SPW, which encodes the semantic priors to the weights of INR, thus making INR contain semantic information implicitly and enhancing its representational capacity. Specifically, SPW uses the Semantic Neural Network (SNN) to extract both low- and high-level semantic information of the target visual signal and generates the semantic vector, which is input into the Weight Generation Network (WGN) to generate the weights of INR model. Finally, INR uses the generated weights with semantic priors to map the coordinates to the signal values. After training, we only retain the generated weights while abandoning both SNN and WGN, thus SPW introduces no extra costs in inference. Experimental results show that SPW can improve the performance of various INR models significantly on various tasks, including image fitting, CT reconstruction, MRI reconstruction, and novel view synthesis. Further experiments illustrate that model with SPW has lower weight redundancy and learns more novel representations, validating the effectiveness of SPW.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models are now the undisputed state-of-the-art for image generation and image restoration. However, they require large amounts of computational power for training and inference. In this paper, we propose lightweight diffusion models for image inpainting that can be trained on a single image, or a few images. We show that our approach competes with large state-of-the-art models in specific cases. We also show that training a model on a single image is particularly relevant for image acquisition modality that differ from the RGB images of standard learning databases. We show results in three different contexts: texture images, line drawing images, and materials BRDF, for which we achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of realism, with a computational load that is greatly reduced compared to concurrent methods.

- **Summary**: Recently, the Mamba architecture based on state space models has demonstrated remarkable performance in a series of natural language processing tasks and has been rapidly applied to remote sensing change detection (CD) tasks. However, most methods enhance the global receptive field by directly modifying the scanning mode of Mamba, neglecting the crucial role that local information plays in dense prediction tasks (e.g., CD). In this article, we propose a model called CDMamba, which effectively combines global and local features for handling CD tasks. Specifically, the Scaled Residual ConvMamba (SRCM) block is proposed to utilize the ability of Mamba to extract global features and convolution to enhance the local details, to alleviate the issue that current Mamba-based methods lack detailed clues and are difficult to achieve fine detection in dense prediction tasks. Furthermore, considering the characteristics of bi-temporal feature interaction required for CD, the Adaptive Global Local Guided Fusion (AGLGF) block is proposed to dynamically facilitate the bi-temporal interaction guided by other temporal global/local features. Our intuition is that more discriminative change features can be acquired with the guidance of other temporal features. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our proposed CDMamba outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be open-sourced at https://github.com/zmoka-zht/CDMamba.

- **Summary**: The robust association of the same objects across video frames in complex scenes is crucial for many applications, especially Multiple Object Tracking (MOT). Current methods predominantly rely on labeled domain-specific video datasets, which limits the cross-domain generalization of learned similarity embeddings. We propose MASA, a novel method for robust instance association learning, capable of matching any objects within videos across diverse domains without tracking labels. Leveraging the rich object segmentation from the Segment Anything Model (SAM), MASA learns instance-level correspondence through exhaustive data transformations. We treat the SAM outputs as dense object region proposals and learn to match those regions from a vast image collection. We further design a universal MASA adapter which can work in tandem with foundational segmentation or detection models and enable them to track any detected objects. Those combinations present strong zero-shot tracking ability in complex domains. Extensive tests on multiple challenging MOT and MOTS benchmarks indicate that the proposed method, using only unlabeled static images, achieves even better performance than state-of-the-art methods trained with fully annotated in-domain video sequences, in zero-shot association.

- **Summary**: In the effort to learn from extensive collections of distributed data, federated learning has emerged as a promising approach for preserving privacy by using a gradient-sharing mechanism instead of exchanging raw data. However, recent studies show that private training data can be leaked through many gradient attacks. While previous analytical-based attacks have successfully reconstructed input data from fully connected layers, their effectiveness diminishes when applied to convolutional layers. This paper introduces an advanced data leakage method to efficiently exploit convolutional layers' gradients. We present a surprising finding: even with non-fully invertible activation functions, such as ReLU, we can analytically reconstruct training samples from the gradients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analytical approach that successfully reconstructs convolutional layer inputs directly from the gradients, bypassing the need to reconstruct layers' outputs. Prior research has mainly concentrated on the weight constraints of convolution layers, overlooking the significance of gradient constraints. Our findings demonstrate that existing analytical methods used to estimate the risk of gradient attacks lack accuracy. In some layers, attacks can be launched with less than 5% of the reported constraints.

- **Summary**: Satellite-based remote sensing has revolutionised the way we address global challenges in a rapidly evolving world. Huge quantities of Earth Observation (EO) data are generated by satellite sensors daily, but processing these large datasets for use in ML pipelines is technically and computationally challenging. Specifically, different types of EO data are often hosted on a variety of platforms, with differing availability for Python preprocessing tools. In addition, spatial alignment across data sources and data tiling can present significant technical hurdles for novice users. While some preprocessed EO datasets exist, their content is often limited to optical or near-optical wavelength data, which is ineffective at night or in adverse weather conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), an active sensing technique based on microwave length radiation, offers a viable alternative. However, the application of machine learning to SAR has been limited due to a lack of ML-ready data and pipelines, particularly for the full diversity of SAR data, including polarimetry, coherence and interferometry. We introduce M3LEO, a multi-modal, multi-label EO dataset that includes polarimetric, interferometric, and coherence SAR data derived from Sentinel-1, alongside Sentinel-2 RGB imagery and a suite of labelled tasks for model evaluation. M3LEO spans 17.5TB and contains approximately 10M data chips across six geographic regions. The dataset is complemented by a flexible PyTorch Lightning framework, with configuration management using Hydra. We provide tools to process any dataset available on popular platforms such as Google Earth Engine for integration with our framework. Initial experiments validate the utility of our data and framework, showing that SAR imagery contains information additional to that extractable from RGB data.

- **Summary**: Understanding the mechanisms of information storage and transfer in Transformer-based models is important for driving model understanding progress. Recent work has studied these mechanisms for Large Language Models (LLMs), revealing insights on how information is stored in a model's parameters and how information flows to and from these parameters in response to specific prompts. However, these studies have not yet been extended to Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Given their expanding capabilities and real-world use, we start by studying one aspect of these models -- how MLLMs process information in a factual visual question answering task. We use a constraint-based formulation which views a visual question as having a set of visual or textual constraints that the model's generated answer must satisfy to be correct (e.g. What movie directed by the director in this photo has won a Golden Globe?). Under this setting, we contribute i) a method that extends causal information tracing from pure language to the multi-modal setting, and ii) VQA-Constraints, a test-bed of 9.7K visual questions annotated with constraints. We use these tools to study two open-source MLLMs, LLaVa and multi-modal Phi-2. Our key findings show that these MLLMs rely on MLP and self-attention blocks in much earlier layers for information storage, compared to LLMs whose mid-layer MLPs are more important. We also show that a consistent small subset of visual tokens output by the vision encoder are responsible for transferring information from the image to these causal blocks. We validate these mechanisms by introducing MultEdit, a model-editing algorithm that can correct errors and insert new long-tailed information into MLLMs by targeting these causal blocks.

- **Summary**: Implicit neural representation (INR) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for signal representations. Typically, INR is parameterized by a multiplayer perceptron (MLP) which takes the coordinates as the inputs and generates corresponding attributes of a signal. However, MLP-based INRs face two critical issues: i) individually considering each coordinate while ignoring the connections; ii) suffering from the spectral bias thus failing to learn high-frequency components. While target visual signals usually exhibit strong local structures and neighborhood dependencies, and high-frequency components are significant in these signals, the issues harm the representational capacity of INRs. This paper proposes Conv-INR, the first INR model fully based on convolution. Due to the inherent attributes of convolution, Conv-INR can simultaneously consider adjacent coordinates and learn high-frequency components effectively. Compared to existing MLP-based INRs, Conv-INR has better representational capacity and trainability without requiring primary function expansion. We conduct extensive experiments on four tasks, including image fitting, CT/MRI reconstruction, and novel view synthesis, Conv-INR all significantly surpasses existing MLP-based INRs, validating the effectiveness. Finally, we raise three reparameterization methods that can further enhance the performance of the vanilla Conv-INR without introducing any extra inference cost.

- **Summary**: Point management is a critical component in optimizing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models, as the point initiation (e.g., via structure from motion) is distributionally inappropriate. Typically, the Adaptive Density Control (ADC) algorithm is applied, leveraging view-averaged gradient magnitude thresholding for point densification, opacity thresholding for pruning, and regular all-points opacity reset. However, we reveal that this strategy is limited in tackling intricate/special image regions (e.g., transparent) as it is unable to identify all the 3D zones that require point densification, and lacking an appropriate mechanism to handle the ill-conditioned points with negative impacts (occlusion due to false high opacity). To address these limitations, we propose a Localized Point Management (LPM) strategy, capable of identifying those error-contributing zones in the highest demand for both point addition and geometry calibration. Zone identification is achieved by leveraging the underlying multiview geometry constraints, with the guidance of image rendering errors. We apply point densification in the identified zone, whilst resetting the opacity of those points residing in front of these regions so that a new opportunity is created to correct ill-conditioned points. Serving as a versatile plugin, LPM can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D Gaussian Splatting models. Experimental evaluation across both static 3D and dynamic 4D scenes validate the efficacy of our LPM strategy in boosting a variety of existing 3DGS models both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, LPM improves both vanilla 3DGS and SpaceTimeGS to achieve state-of-the-art rendering quality while retaining real-time speeds, outperforming on challenging datasets such as Tanks & Temples and the Neural 3D Video Dataset.

- **Summary**: 3D modeling has long been an important area in computer vision and computer graphics. Recently, thanks to the breakthroughs in neural representations and generative models, we witnessed a rapid development of 3D modeling. 3D human modeling, lying at the core of many real-world applications, such as gaming and animation, has attracted significant attention. Over the past few years, a large body of work on creating 3D human avatars has been introduced, forming a new and abundant knowledge base for 3D human modeling. The scale of the literature makes it difficult for individuals to keep track of all the works. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of these emerging techniques for 3D human avatar modeling, from both reconstruction and generation perspectives. Firstly, we review representative methods for 3D human reconstruction, including methods based on pixel-aligned implicit function, neural radiance field, and 3D Gaussian Splatting, etc. We then summarize representative methods for 3D human generation, especially those using large language models like CLIP, diffusion models, and various 3D representations, which demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we discuss our reflection on existing methods and open challenges for 3D human avatar modeling, shedding light on future research.

- **Summary**: We introduce a new generative approach for synthesizing 3D geometry and images from single-view collections. Most existing approaches predict volumetric density to render multi-view consistent images. By employing volumetric rendering using neural radiance fields, they inherit a key limitation: the generated geometry is noisy and unconstrained, limiting the quality and utility of the output meshes. To address this issue, we propose GeoGen, a new SDF-based 3D generative model trained in an end-to-end manner. Initially, we reinterpret the volumetric density as a Signed Distance Function (SDF). This allows us to introduce useful priors to generate valid meshes. However, those priors prevent the generative model from learning details, limiting the applicability of the method to real-world scenarios. To alleviate that problem, we make the transformation learnable and constrain the rendered depth map to be consistent with the zero-level set of the SDF. Through the lens of adversarial training, we encourage the network to produce higher fidelity details on the output meshes. For evaluation, we introduce a synthetic dataset of human avatars captured from 360-degree camera angles, to overcome the challenges presented by real-world datasets, which often lack 3D consistency and do not cover all camera angles. Our experiments on multiple datasets show that GeoGen produces visually and quantitatively better geometry than the previous generative models based on neural radiance fields.

- **Summary**: The evaluation of Long Video Understanding (LVU) performance poses an important but challenging research problem. Despite previous efforts, the existing video understanding benchmarks are severely constrained by several issues, especially the insufficient lengths of videos, a lack of diversity in video types and evaluation tasks, and the inappropriateness for evaluating LVU performances. To address the above problems, we propose a new benchmark, called MLVU (Multi-task Long Video Understanding Benchmark), for the comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of LVU. MLVU presents the following critical values: 1) The substantial and flexible extension of video lengths, which enables the benchmark to evaluate LVU performance across a wide range of durations. 2) The inclusion of various video genres, e.g., movies, surveillance footage, egocentric videos, cartoons, game videos, etc., which reflects the models' LVU performances in different scenarios. 3) The development of diversified evaluation tasks, which enables a comprehensive examination of MLLMs' key abilities in long-video understanding. The empirical study with 20 latest MLLMs reveals significant room for improvement in today's technique, as all existing methods struggle with most of the evaluation tasks and exhibit severe performance degradation when handling longer videos. Additionally, it suggests that factors such as context length, image-understanding quality, and the choice of LLM backbone can play critical roles in future advancements. We anticipate that MLVU will advance the research of long video understanding by providing a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of MLLMs.

- **Summary**: High-quality human-annotated data is crucial for modern deep learning pipelines, yet the human annotation process is both costly and time-consuming. Given a constrained human labeling budget, selecting an informative and representative data subset for labeling can significantly reduce human annotation effort. Well-performing state-of-the-art (SOTA) coreset selection methods require ground-truth labels over the whole dataset, failing to reduce the human labeling burden. Meanwhile, SOTA label-free coreset selection methods deliver inferior performance due to poor geometry-based scores. In this paper, we introduce ELFS, a novel label-free coreset selection method. ELFS employs deep clustering to estimate data difficulty scores without ground-truth labels. Furthermore, ELFS uses a simple but effective double-end pruning method to mitigate bias on calculated scores, which further improves the performance on selected coresets. We evaluate ELFS on five vision benchmarks and show that ELFS consistently outperforms SOTA label-free baselines. For instance, at a 90% pruning rate, ELFS surpasses the best-performing baseline by 5.3% on CIFAR10 and 7.1% on CIFAR100. Moreover, ELFS even achieves comparable performance to supervised coreset selection at low pruning rates (e.g., 30% and 50%) on CIFAR10 and ImageNet-1K.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated great success in text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, existing methods may face challenges when handling complex (long) video generation scenarios that involve multiple objects or dynamic changes in object numbers. To address these limitations, we propose VideoTetris, a novel framework that enables compositional T2V generation. Specifically, we propose spatio-temporal compositional diffusion to precisely follow complex textual semantics by manipulating and composing the attention maps of denoising networks spatially and temporally. Moreover, we propose an enhanced video data preprocessing to enhance the training data regarding motion dynamics and prompt understanding, equipped with a new reference frame attention mechanism to improve the consistency of auto-regressive video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VideoTetris achieves impressive qualitative and quantitative results in compositional T2V generation.

- **Summary**: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is an effective and widely used approach for weakly supervised machine learning. In histopathology, MIL models have achieved remarkable success in tasks like tumor detection, biomarker prediction, and outcome prognostication. However, MIL explanation methods are still lagging behind, as they are limited to small bag sizes or disregard instance interactions. We revisit MIL through the lens of explainable AI (XAI) and introduce xMIL, a refined framework with more general assumptions. We demonstrate how to obtain improved MIL explanations using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) and conduct extensive evaluation experiments on three toy settings and four real-world histopathology datasets. Our approach consistently outperforms previous explanation attempts with particularly improved faithfulness scores on challenging biomarker prediction tasks. Finally, we showcase how xMIL explanations enable pathologists to extract insights from MIL models, representing a significant advance for knowledge discovery and model debugging in digital histopathology.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral image segmentation is crucial for many fields such as agriculture, remote sensing, biomedical imaging, battlefield sensing and astronomy. However, the challenge of hyper and multi spectral imaging is its large data footprint. We propose both a novel camera design and a vision transformer-based (ViT) algorithm that alleviate both the captured data footprint and the computational load for hyperspectral segmentation. Our camera is able to adaptively sample image regions or patches at different resolutions, instead of capturing the entire hyperspectral cube at one high resolution. Our segmentation algorithm works in concert with the camera, applying ViT-based segmentation only to adaptively selected patches. We show results both in simulation and on a real hardware platform demonstrating both accurate segmentation results and reduced computational burden.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal retrieval becomes increasingly popular in practice. However, the existing retrievers are mostly text-oriented, which lack the capability to process visual information. Despite the presence of vision-language models like CLIP, the current methods are severely limited in representing the text-only and image-only data. In this work, we present a new embedding model VISTA for universal multi-modal retrieval. Our work brings forth threefold technical contributions. Firstly, we introduce a flexible architecture which extends a powerful text encoder with the image understanding capability by introducing visual token embeddings. Secondly, we develop two data generation strategies, which bring high-quality composed image-text to facilitate the training of the embedding model. Thirdly, we introduce a multi-stage training algorithm, which first aligns the visual token embedding with the text encoder using massive weakly labeled data, and then develops multi-modal representation capability using the generated composed image-text data. In our experiments, VISTA achieves superior performances across a variety of multi-modal retrieval tasks in both zero-shot and supervised settings.

- **Summary**: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to enhance the performance of source-domain pretrained models when tested on unknown shifted target domains. Traditional TTA methods primarily adapt model weights based on target data streams, making model performance sensitive to the amount and order of target data. Recently, diffusion-driven TTA methods have demonstrated strong performance by using an unconditional diffusion model, which is also trained on the source domain to transform target data into synthetic data as a source domain projection. This allows the source model to make predictions without weight adaptation. In this paper, we argue that the domains of the source model and the synthetic data in diffusion-driven TTA methods are not aligned. To adapt the source model to the synthetic domain of the unconditional diffusion model, we introduce a Synthetic-Domain Alignment (SDA) framework to fine-tune the source model with synthetic data. Specifically, we first employ a conditional diffusion model to generate labeled samples, creating a synthetic dataset. Subsequently, we use the aforementioned unconditional diffusion model to add noise to and denoise each sample before fine-tuning. This process mitigates the potential domain gap between the conditional and unconditional models. Extensive experiments across various models and benchmarks demonstrate that SDA achieves superior domain alignment and consistently outperforms existing diffusion-driven TTA methods.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing surfaces from sparse view inputs, where ambiguity and occlusions due to missing information pose significant hurdles. We present a novel approach, named EpiS, that incorporates Epipolar information into the reconstruction process. Existing methods in sparse-view neural surface learning have mainly focused on mean and variance considerations using cost volumes for feature extraction. In contrast, our method aggregates coarse information from the cost volume into Epipolar features extracted from multiple source views, enabling the generation of fine-grained Signal Distance Function (SDF)-aware features. Additionally, we employ an attention mechanism along the line dimension to facilitate feature fusion based on the SDF feature. Furthermore, to address the information gaps in sparse conditions, we integrate depth information from monocular depth estimation using global and local regularization techniques. The global regularization utilizes a triplet loss function, while the local regularization employs a derivative loss function. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in cases with sparse and generalizable conditions.

- **Summary**: Transformers are widely used as generic backbones in computer vision, despite initially introduced for natural language processing. Recently, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been extended to a scalable and performant architecture - the xLSTM - which overcomes long-standing LSTM limitations via exponential gating and parallelizable matrix memory structure. In this report, we introduce Vision-LSTM (ViL), an adaption of the xLSTM building blocks to computer vision. ViL comprises a stack of xLSTM blocks where odd blocks process the sequence of patch tokens from top to bottom while even blocks go from bottom to top. Experiments show that ViL holds promise to be further deployed as new generic backbone for computer vision architectures.

- **Summary**: The common trade-offs of state-of-the-art methods for multi-shape representation (a single model "packing" multiple objects) involve trading modeling accuracy against memory and storage. We show how to encode multiple shapes represented as continuous neural fields with a higher degree of precision than previously possible and with low memory usage. Key to our approach is a recursive hierarchical formulation that exploits object self-similarity, leading to a highly compressed and efficient shape latent space. Thanks to the recursive formulation, our method supports spatial and global-to-local latent feature fusion without needing to initialize and maintain auxiliary data structures, while still allowing for continuous field queries to enable applications such as raytracing. In experiments on a set of diverse datasets, we provide compelling qualitative results and demonstrate state-of-the-art multi-scene reconstruction and compression results with a single network per dataset.

- **Summary**: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have made significant advancements in recent years, but they still struggle to accurately capture intricate details specified in complex compositional prompts. While fine-tuning T2I models with reward objectives has shown promise, it suffers from "reward hacking" and may not generalize well to unseen prompt distributions. In this work, we propose Reward-based Noise Optimization (ReNO), a novel approach that enhances T2I models at inference by optimizing the initial noise based on the signal from one or multiple human preference reward models. Remarkably, solving this optimization problem with gradient ascent for 50 iterations yields impressive results on four different one-step models across two competitive benchmarks, T2I-CompBench and GenEval. Within a computational budget of 20-50 seconds, ReNO-enhanced one-step models consistently surpass the performance of all current open-source Text-to-Image models. Extensive user studies demonstrate that our model is preferred nearly twice as often compared to the popular SDXL model and is on par with the proprietary Stable Diffusion 3 with 8B parameters. Moreover, given the same computational resources, a ReNO-optimized one-step model outperforms widely-used open-source models such as SDXL and PixArt-$\alpha$, highlighting the efficiency and effectiveness of ReNO in enhancing T2I model performance at inference time.

- **Summary**: AI systems can take harmful actions and are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We present an approach, inspired by recent advances in representation engineering, that interrupts the models as they respond with harmful outputs with "circuit breakers." Existing techniques aimed at improving alignment, such as refusal training, are often bypassed. Techniques such as adversarial training try to plug these holes by countering specific attacks. As an alternative to refusal training and adversarial training, circuit-breaking directly controls the representations that are responsible for harmful outputs in the first place. Our technique can be applied to both text-only and multimodal language models to prevent the generation of harmful outputs without sacrificing utility -- even in the presence of powerful unseen attacks. Notably, while adversarial robustness in standalone image recognition remains an open challenge, circuit breakers allow the larger multimodal system to reliably withstand image "hijacks" that aim to produce harmful content. Finally, we extend our approach to AI agents, demonstrating considerable reductions in the rate of harmful actions when they are under attack. Our approach represents a significant step forward in the development of reliable safeguards to harmful behavior and adversarial attacks.

- **Summary**: Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has extended its success from aligning large language models (LLMs) to aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences. Unlike most existing DPO methods that assume all diffusion steps share a consistent preference order with the final generated images, we argue that this assumption neglects step-specific denoising performance and that preference labels should be tailored to each step's contribution. To address this limitation, we propose Step-aware Preference Optimization (SPO), a novel post-training approach that independently evaluates and adjusts the denoising performance at each step, using a step-aware preference model and a step-wise resampler to ensure accurate step-aware supervision. Specifically, at each denoising step, we sample a pool of images, find a suitable win-lose pair, and, most importantly, randomly select a single image from the pool to initialize the next denoising step. This step-wise resampler process ensures the next win-lose image pair comes from the same image, making the win-lose comparison independent of the previous step. To assess the preferences at each step, we train a separate step-aware preference model that can be applied to both noisy and clean images. Our experiments with Stable Diffusion v1.5 and SDXL demonstrate that SPO significantly outperforms the latest Diffusion-DPO in aligning generated images with complex, detailed prompts and enhancing aesthetics, while also achieving more than 20x times faster in training efficiency.

- **Summary**: 6D Object Pose Estimation is a crucial yet challenging task in computer vision, suffering from a significant lack of large-scale datasets. This scarcity impedes comprehensive evaluation of model performance, limiting research advancements. Furthermore, the restricted number of available instances or categories curtails its applications. To address these issues, this paper introduces Omni6DPose, a substantial dataset characterized by its diversity in object categories, large scale, and variety in object materials. Omni6DPose is divided into three main components: ROPE (Real 6D Object Pose Estimation Dataset), which includes 332K images annotated with over 1.5M annotations across 581 instances in 149 categories; SOPE(Simulated 6D Object Pose Estimation Dataset), consisting of 475K images created in a mixed reality setting with depth simulation, annotated with over 5M annotations across 4162 instances in the same 149 categories; and the manually aligned real scanned objects used in both ROPE and SOPE. Omni6DPose is inherently challenging due to the substantial variations and ambiguities. To address this challenge, we introduce GenPose++, an enhanced version of the SOTA category-level pose estimation framework, incorporating two pivotal improvements: Semantic-aware feature extraction and Clustering-based aggregation. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive benchmarking analysis to evaluate the performance of previous methods on this large-scale dataset in the realms of 6D object pose estimation and pose tracking.

- **Summary**: Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, despite its proven diagnostic utility, remains an inaccessible imaging modality for disease surveillance at the population level. A major factor rendering MR inaccessible is lengthy scan times. An MR scanner collects measurements associated with the underlying anatomy in the Fourier space, also known as the k-space. Creating a high-fidelity image requires collecting large quantities of such measurements, increasing the scan time. Traditionally to accelerate an MR scan, image reconstruction from under-sampled k-space data is the method of choice. However, recent works show the feasibility of bypassing image reconstruction and directly learning to detect disease directly from a sparser learned subset of the k-space measurements. In this work, we propose Adaptive Sampling for MR (ASMR), a sampling method that learns an adaptive policy to sequentially select k-space samples to optimize for target disease detection. On 6 out of 8 pathology classification tasks spanning the Knee, Brain, and Prostate MR scans, ASMR reaches within 2% of the performance of a fully sampled classifier while using only 8% of the k-space, as well as outperforming prior state-of-the-art work in k-space sampling such as EMRT, LOUPE, and DPS.

- **Summary**: In this work, we systematically study music generation conditioned solely on the video. First, we present a large-scale dataset comprising 190K video-music pairs, including various genres such as movie trailers, advertisements, and documentaries. Furthermore, we propose VidMuse, a simple framework for generating music aligned with video inputs. VidMuse stands out by producing high-fidelity music that is both acoustically and semantically aligned with the video. By incorporating local and global visual cues, VidMuse enables the creation of musically coherent audio tracks that consistently match the video content through Long-Short-Term modeling. Through extensive experiments, VidMuse outperforms existing models in terms of audio quality, diversity, and audio-visual alignment.

- **Summary**: We present DIRECT-3D, a diffusion-based 3D generative model for creating high-quality 3D assets (represented by Neural Radiance Fields) from text prompts. Unlike recent 3D generative models that rely on clean and well-aligned 3D data, limiting them to single or few-class generation, our model is directly trained on extensive noisy and unaligned `in-the-wild' 3D assets, mitigating the key challenge (i.e., data scarcity) in large-scale 3D generation. In particular, DIRECT-3D is a tri-plane diffusion model that integrates two innovations: 1) A novel learning framework where noisy data are filtered and aligned automatically during the training process. Specifically, after an initial warm-up phase using a small set of clean data, an iterative optimization is introduced in the diffusion process to explicitly estimate the 3D pose of objects and select beneficial data based on conditional density. 2) An efficient 3D representation that is achieved by disentangling object geometry and color features with two separate conditional diffusion models that are optimized hierarchically. Given a prompt input, our model generates high-quality, high-resolution, realistic, and complex 3D objects with accurate geometric details in seconds. We achieve state-of-the-art performance in both single-class generation and text-to-3D generation. We also demonstrate that DIRECT-3D can serve as a useful 3D geometric prior of objects, for example to alleviate the well-known Janus problem in 2D-lifting methods such as DreamFusion.

- **Summary**: Training autonomous agents with sparse rewards is a long-standing problem in online reinforcement learning (RL), due to low data efficiency. Prior work overcomes this challenge by extracting useful knowledge from offline data, often accomplished through the learning of action distribution from offline data and utilizing the learned distribution to facilitate online RL. However, since the offline data are given and fixed, the extracted knowledge is inherently limited, making it difficult to generalize to new tasks. We propose a novel approach that leverages offline data to learn a generative diffusion model, coined as Adaptive Trajectory Diffuser (ATraDiff). This model generates synthetic trajectories, serving as a form of data augmentation and consequently enhancing the performance of online RL methods. The key strength of our diffuser lies in its adaptability, allowing it to effectively handle varying trajectory lengths and mitigate distribution shifts between online and offline data. Because of its simplicity, ATraDiff seamlessly integrates with a wide spectrum of RL methods. Empirical evaluation shows that ATraDiff consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of environments, with particularly pronounced improvements in complicated settings.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based video generation models have demonstrated remarkable success in obtaining high-fidelity videos through the iterative denoising process. However, these models require multiple denoising steps during sampling, resulting in high computational costs. In this work, we propose a novel approach to obtain single-step video generation models by leveraging adversarial training to fine-tune pre-trained video diffusion models. We show that, through the adversarial training, the multi-steps video diffusion model, i.e., Stable Video Diffusion (SVD), can be trained to perform single forward pass to synthesize high-quality videos, capturing both temporal and spatial dependencies in the video data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive generation quality of synthesized videos with significantly reduced computational overhead for the denoising process (i.e., around $23\times$ speedup compared with SVD and $6\times$ speedup compared with existing works, with even better generation quality), paving the way for real-time video synthesis and editing.

- **Summary**: We present the ShareGPT4Video series, aiming to facilitate the video understanding of large video-language models (LVLMs) and the video generation of text-to-video models (T2VMs) via dense and precise captions. The series comprises: 1) ShareGPT4Video, 40K GPT4V annotated dense captions of videos with various lengths and sources, developed through carefully designed data filtering and annotating strategy. 2) ShareCaptioner-Video, an efficient and capable captioning model for arbitrary videos, with 4.8M high-quality aesthetic videos annotated by it. 3) ShareGPT4Video-8B, a simple yet superb LVLM that reached SOTA performance on three advancing video benchmarks. To achieve this, taking aside the non-scalable costly human annotators, we find using GPT4V to caption video with a naive multi-frame or frame-concatenation input strategy leads to less detailed and sometimes temporal-confused results. We argue the challenge of designing a high-quality video captioning strategy lies in three aspects: 1) Inter-frame precise temporal change understanding. 2) Intra-frame detailed content description. 3) Frame-number scalability for arbitrary-length videos. To this end, we meticulously designed a differential video captioning strategy, which is stable, scalable, and efficient for generating captions for videos with arbitrary resolution, aspect ratios, and length. Based on it, we construct ShareGPT4Video, which contains 40K high-quality videos spanning a wide range of categories, and the resulting captions encompass rich world knowledge, object attributes, camera movements, and crucially, detailed and precise temporal descriptions of events. Based on ShareGPT4Video, we further develop ShareCaptioner-Video, a superior captioner capable of efficiently generating high-quality captions for arbitrary videos...

- **Summary**: Image pyramids are commonly used in modern computer vision tasks to obtain multi-scale features for precise understanding of images. However, image pyramids process multiple resolutions of images using the same large-scale model, which requires significant computational cost. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel network architecture known as the Parameter-Inverted Image Pyramid Networks (PIIP). Our core idea is to use models with different parameter sizes to process different resolution levels of the image pyramid, thereby balancing computational efficiency and performance. Specifically, the input to PIIP is a set of multi-scale images, where higher resolution images are processed by smaller networks. We further propose a feature interaction mechanism to allow features of different resolutions to complement each other and effectively integrate information from different spatial scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the PIIP achieves superior performance in tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and image classification, compared to traditional image pyramid methods and single-branch networks, while reducing computational cost. Notably, when applying our method on a large-scale vision foundation model InternViT-6B, we improve its performance by 1%-2% on detection and segmentation with only 40%-60% of the original computation. These results validate the effectiveness of the PIIP approach and provide a new technical direction for future vision computing tasks.

- **Summary**: The ability to learn compact, high-quality, and easy-to-optimize representations for visual data is paramount to many applications such as novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. Recent work has shown substantial success in using tensor networks to design such compact and high-quality representations. However, the ability to optimize tensor-based representations, and in particular, the highly compact tensor train representation, is still lacking. This has prevented practitioners from deploying the full potential of tensor networks for visual data. To this end, we propose 'Prolongation Upsampling Tensor Train (PuTT)', a novel method for learning tensor train representations in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our method involves the prolonging or `upsampling' of a learned tensor train representation, creating a sequence of 'coarse-to-fine' tensor trains that are incrementally refined. We evaluate our representation along three axes: (1). compression, (2). denoising capability, and (3). image completion capability. To assess these axes, we consider the tasks of image fitting, 3D fitting, and novel view synthesis, where our method shows an improved performance compared to state-of-the-art tensor-based methods.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based image generation models have achieved great success in recent years by showing the capability of synthesizing high-quality content. However, these models contain a huge number of parameters, resulting in a significantly large model size. Saving and transferring them is a major bottleneck for various applications, especially those running on resource-constrained devices. In this work, we develop a novel weight quantization method that quantizes the UNet from Stable Diffusion v1.5 to 1.99 bits, achieving a model with 7.9X smaller size while exhibiting even better generation quality than the original one. Our approach includes several novel techniques, such as assigning optimal bits to each layer, initializing the quantized model for better performance, and improving the training strategy to dramatically reduce quantization error. Furthermore, we extensively evaluate our quantized model across various benchmark datasets and through human evaluation to demonstrate its superior generation quality.

- **Summary**: Most large multimodal models (LMMs) are implemented by feeding visual tokens as a sequence into the first layer of a large language model (LLM). The resulting architecture is simple but significantly increases computation and memory costs, as it has to handle a large number of additional tokens in its input layer. This paper presents a new architecture DeepStack for LMMs. Considering $N$ layers in the language and vision transformer of LMMs, we stack the visual tokens into $N$ groups and feed each group to its aligned transformer layer \textit{from bottom to top}. Surprisingly, this simple method greatly enhances the power of LMMs to model interactions among visual tokens across layers but with minimal additional cost. We apply DeepStack to both language and vision transformer in LMMs, and validate the effectiveness of DeepStack LMMs with extensive empirical results. Using the same context length, our DeepStack 7B and 13B parameters surpass their counterparts by \textbf{2.7} and \textbf{2.9} on average across \textbf{9} benchmarks, respectively. Using only one-fifth of the context length, DeepStack rivals closely to the counterparts that use the full context length. These gains are particularly pronounced on high-resolution tasks, e.g., \textbf{4.2}, \textbf{11.0}, and \textbf{4.0} improvements on TextVQA, DocVQA, and InfoVQA compared to LLaVA-1.5-7B, respectively. We further apply DeepStack to vision transformer layers, which brings us a similar amount of improvements, \textbf{3.8} on average compared with LLaVA-1.5-7B.

- **Summary**: Despite the advances in text-to-image synthesis, particularly with diffusion models, generating visual instructions that require consistent representation and smooth state transitions of objects across sequential steps remains a formidable challenge. This paper introduces a simple, training-free framework to tackle the issues, capitalizing on the advancements in diffusion models and large language models (LLMs). Our approach systematically integrates text comprehension and image generation to ensure visual instructions are visually appealing and maintain consistency and accuracy throughout the instruction sequence. We validate the effectiveness by testing multi-step instructions and comparing the text alignment and consistency with several baselines. Our experiments show that our approach can visualize coherent and visually pleasing instructions

- **Summary**: In recent years, there has been rapid development in 3D generation models, opening up new possibilities for applications such as simulating the dynamic movements of 3D objects and customizing their behaviors. However, current 3D generative models tend to focus only on surface features such as color and shape, neglecting the inherent physical properties that govern the behavior of objects in the real world. To accurately simulate physics-aligned dynamics, it is essential to predict the physical properties of materials and incorporate them into the behavior prediction process. Nonetheless, predicting the diverse materials of real-world objects is still challenging due to the complex nature of their physical attributes. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Physics3D}, a novel method for learning various physical properties of 3D objects through a video diffusion model. Our approach involves designing a highly generalizable physical simulation system based on a viscoelastic material model, which enables us to simulate a wide range of materials with high-fidelity capabilities. Moreover, we distill the physical priors from a video diffusion model that contains more understanding of realistic object materials. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both elastic and plastic materials. Physics3D shows great potential for bridging the gap between the physical world and virtual neural space, providing a better integration and application of realistic physical principles in virtual environments.

- **Summary**: A fundamental objective in robot manipulation is to enable models to comprehend visual scenes and execute actions. Although existing robot Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can handle a range of basic tasks, they still face challenges in two areas: 1) inadequate reasoning ability to tackle complex tasks, and 2) high computational costs for MLLM fine-tuning and inference. The recently proposed state space model (SSM) known as Mamba demonstrates promising capabilities in non-trivial sequence modeling with linear inference complexity. Inspired by this, we introduce RoboMamba, an end-to-end robotic MLLM that leverages the Mamba model to deliver both robotic reasoning and action capabilities, while maintaining efficient fine-tuning and inference. Specifically, we first integrate the vision encoder with Mamba, aligning visual data with language embedding through co-training, empowering our model with visual common sense and robot-related reasoning. To further equip RoboMamba with action pose prediction abilities, we explore an efficient fine-tuning strategy with a simple policy head. We find that once RoboMamba possesses sufficient reasoning capability, it can acquire manipulation skills with minimal fine-tuning parameters (0.1\% of the model) and time (20 minutes). In experiments, RoboMamba demonstrates outstanding reasoning capabilities on general and robotic evaluation benchmarks. Meanwhile, our model showcases impressive pose prediction results in both simulation and real-world experiments, achieving inference speeds 7 times faster than existing robot MLLMs. Our project web page: https://sites.google.com/view/robomamba-web

- **Summary**: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) methods are a family of visual localization methods that directly regress 2D-3D matches for camera pose estimation. They are effective in small-scale scenes but face significant challenges in large-scale scenes that are further amplified in the absence of ground truth 3D point clouds for supervision. Here, the model can only rely on reprojection constraints and needs to implicitly triangulate the points. The challenges stem from a fundamental dilemma: The network has to be invariant to observations of the same landmark at different viewpoints and lighting conditions, etc., but at the same time discriminate unrelated but similar observations. The latter becomes more relevant and severe in larger scenes. In this work, we tackle this problem by introducing the concept of co-visibility to the network. We propose GLACE, which integrates pre-trained global and local encodings and enables SCR to scale to large scenes with only a single small-sized network. Specifically, we propose a novel feature diffusion technique that implicitly groups the reprojection constraints with co-visibility and avoids overfitting to trivial solutions. Additionally, our position decoder parameterizes the output positions for large-scale scenes more effectively. Without using 3D models or depth maps for supervision, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on large-scale scenes with a low-map-size model. On Cambridge landmarks, with a single model, we achieve 17% lower median position error than Poker, the ensemble variant of the state-of-the-art SCR method ACE.

- **Summary**: We interpret the function of individual neurons in CLIP by automatically describing them using text. Analyzing the direct effects (i.e. the flow from a neuron through the residual stream to the output) or the indirect effects (overall contribution) fails to capture the neurons' function in CLIP. Therefore, we present the "second-order lens", analyzing the effect flowing from a neuron through the later attention heads, directly to the output. We find that these effects are highly selective: for each neuron, the effect is significant for <2% of the images. Moreover, each effect can be approximated by a single direction in the text-image space of CLIP. We describe neurons by decomposing these directions into sparse sets of text representations. The sets reveal polysemantic behavior - each neuron corresponds to multiple, often unrelated, concepts (e.g. ships and cars). Exploiting this neuron polysemy, we mass-produce "semantic" adversarial examples by generating images with concepts spuriously correlated to the incorrect class. Additionally, we use the second-order effects for zero-shot segmentation and attribute discovery in images. Our results indicate that a scalable understanding of neurons can be used for model deception and for introducing new model capabilities.

- **Summary**: Modality differences have led to the development of heterogeneous architectures for vision and language models. While images typically require 2D non-causal modeling, texts utilize 1D causal modeling. This distinction poses significant challenges in constructing unified multi-modal models. This paper explores the feasibility of representing images using 1D causal modeling. We identify an "over-focus" issue in existing 1D causal vision models, where attention overly concentrates on a small proportion of visual tokens. The issue of "over-focus" hinders the model's ability to extract diverse visual features and to receive effective gradients for optimization. To address this, we propose De-focus Attention Networks, which employ learnable bandpass filters to create varied attention patterns. During training, large and scheduled drop path rates, and an auxiliary loss on globally pooled features for global understanding tasks are introduced. These two strategies encourage the model to attend to a broader range of tokens and enhance network optimization. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating that 1D causal visual representation can perform comparably to 2D non-causal representation in tasks such as global perception, dense prediction, and multi-modal understanding.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose Flash3D, a method for scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis from a single image which is both very generalisable and efficient. For generalisability, we start from a "foundation" model for monocular depth estimation and extend it to a full 3D shape and appearance reconstructor. For efficiency, we base this extension on feed-forward Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, we predict a first layer of 3D Gaussians at the predicted depth, and then add additional layers of Gaussians that are offset in space, allowing the model to complete the reconstruction behind occlusions and truncations. Flash3D is very efficient, trainable on a single GPU in a day, and thus accessible to most researchers. It achieves state-of-the-art results when trained and tested on RealEstate10k. When transferred to unseen datasets like NYU it outperforms competitors by a large margin. More impressively, when transferred to KITTI, Flash3D achieves better PSNR than methods trained specifically on that dataset. In some instances, it even outperforms recent methods that use multiple views as input. Code, models, demo, and more results are available at https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/flash3d/.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Motivated by the large progress made by large language models (LLMs), we introduce the framework of verbalized machine learning (VML). In contrast to conventional machine learning models that are typically optimized over a continuous parameter space, VML constrains the parameter space to be human-interpretable natural language. Such a constraint leads to a new perspective of function approximation, where an LLM with a text prompt can be viewed as a function parameterized by the text prompt. Guided by this perspective, we revisit classical machine learning problems, such as regression and classification, and find that these problems can be solved by an LLM-parameterized learner and optimizer. The major advantages of VML include (1) easy encoding of inductive bias: prior knowledge about the problem and hypothesis class can be encoded in natural language and fed into the LLM-parameterized learner; (2) automatic model class selection: the optimizer can automatically select a concrete model class based on data and verbalized prior knowledge, and it can update the model class during training; and (3) interpretable learner updates: the LLM-parameterized optimizer can provide explanations for why each learner update is performed. We conduct several studies to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of VML, and hope that VML can serve as a stepping stone to stronger interpretability and trustworthiness in ML.

  Projector"
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel general-purpose stereo and depth data fusion paradigm that mimics the active stereo principle by replacing the unreliable physical pattern projector with a depth sensor. It works by projecting virtual patterns consistent with the scene geometry onto the left and right images acquired by a conventional stereo camera, using the sparse hints obtained from a depth sensor, to facilitate the visual correspondence. Purposely, any depth sensing device can be seamlessly plugged into our framework, enabling the deployment of a virtual active stereo setup in any possible environment and overcoming the severe limitations of physical pattern projection, such as the limited working range and environmental conditions. Exhaustive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets featuring both long and close range, including those providing raw, unfiltered depth hints from off-the-shelf depth sensors, highlight the effectiveness of our approach in notably boosting the robustness and accuracy of algorithms and deep stereo without any code modification and even without re-training. Additionally, we assess the performance of our strategy on active stereo evaluation datasets with conventional pattern projection. Indeed, in all these scenarios, our virtual pattern projection paradigm achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source code is available at: https://github.com/bartn8/vppstereo.

- **Summary**: Drawing upon StyleGAN's expressivity and disentangled latent space, existing 2D approaches employ textual prompting to edit facial images with different attributes. In contrast, 3D-aware approaches that generate faces at different target poses require attribute-specific classifiers, learning separate model weights for each attribute, and are not scalable for novel attributes. In this work, we propose an efficient, plug-and-play, 3D-aware face editing framework based on attribute-specific prompt learning, enabling the generation of facial images with controllable attributes across various target poses. To this end, we introduce a text-driven learnable style token-based latent attribute editor (LAE). The LAE harnesses a pre-trained vision-language model to find text-guided attribute-specific editing direction in the latent space of any pre-trained 3D-aware GAN. It utilizes learnable style tokens and style mappers to learn and transform this editing direction to 3D latent space. To train LAE with multiple attributes, we use directional contrastive loss and style token loss. Furthermore, to ensure view consistency and identity preservation across different poses and attributes, we employ several 3D-aware identity and pose preservation losses. Our experiments show that our proposed framework generates high-quality images with 3D awareness and view consistency while maintaining attribute-specific features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on different facial attributes, including hair color and style, expression, and others.

- **Summary**: The tasks of object detection and trajectory forecasting play a crucial role in understanding the scene for autonomous driving. These tasks are typically executed in a cascading manner, making them prone to compounding errors. Furthermore, there is usually a very thin interface between the two tasks, creating a lossy information bottleneck. To address these challenges, our approach formulates the union of the two tasks as a trajectory refinement problem, where the first pose is the detection (current time), and the subsequent poses are the waypoints of the multiple forecasts (future time). To tackle this unified task, we design a refinement transformer that infers the presence, pose, and multi-modal future behaviors of objects directly from LiDAR point clouds and high-definition maps. We call this model DeTra, short for object Detection and Trajectory forecasting. In our experiments, we observe that \ourmodel{} outperforms the state-of-the-art on Argoverse 2 Sensor and Waymo Open Dataset by a large margin, across a broad range of metrics. Last but not least, we perform extensive ablation studies that show the value of refinement for this task, that every proposed component contributes positively to its performance, and that key design choices were made.

- **Summary**: Radiology reporting is a complex task that requires detailed image understanding, integration of multiple inputs, including comparison with prior imaging, and precise language generation. This makes it ideal for the development and use of generative multimodal models. Here, we extend report generation to include the localisation of individual findings on the image - a task we call grounded report generation. Prior work indicates that grounding is important for clarifying image understanding and interpreting AI-generated text. Therefore, grounded reporting stands to improve the utility and transparency of automated report drafting. To enable evaluation of grounded reporting, we propose a novel evaluation framework - RadFact - leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). RadFact assesses the factuality of individual generated sentences, as well as correctness of generated spatial localisations when present. We introduce MAIRA-2, a large multimodal model combining a radiology-specific image encoder with a LLM, and trained for the new task of grounded report generation on chest X-rays. MAIRA-2 uses more comprehensive inputs than explored previously: the current frontal image, the current lateral image, the prior frontal image and prior report, as well as the Indication, Technique and Comparison sections of the current report. We demonstrate that these additions significantly improve report quality and reduce hallucinations, establishing a new state of the art on findings generation (without grounding) on MIMIC-CXR while demonstrating the feasibility of grounded reporting as a novel and richer task.

- **Summary**: This study assesses the ability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to differentiate between AI-generated and human-generated images. It introduces a new automated benchmark construction method for this evaluation. The experiment compared common LVLMs with human participants using a mixed dataset of AI and human-created images. Results showed that LVLMs could distinguish between the image types to some extent but exhibited a rightward bias, and perform significantly worse compared to humans. To build on these findings, we developed an automated benchmark construction process using AI. This process involved topic retrieval, narrative script generation, error embedding, and image generation, creating a diverse set of text-image pairs with intentional errors. We validated our method through constructing two caparable benchmarks. This study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of LVLMs in real-world understanding and advances benchmark construction techniques, providing a scalable and automatic approach for AI model evaluation.

- **Summary**: Data often arrives in sequence over time in real-world deep learning applications such as autonomous driving. When new training data is available, training the model from scratch undermines the benefit of leveraging the learned knowledge, leading to significant training costs. Warm-starting from a previously trained checkpoint is the most intuitive way to retain knowledge and advance learning. However, existing literature suggests that this warm-starting degrades generalization. In this paper, we advocate for warm-starting but stepping out of the previous converging point, thus allowing a better adaptation to new data without compromising previous knowledge. We propose Knowledge Consolidation and Acquisition (CKCA), a continuous model improvement algorithm with two novel components. First, a novel feature regularization (FeatReg) to retain and refine knowledge from existing checkpoints; Second, we propose adaptive knowledge distillation (AdaKD), a novel approach to forget mitigation and knowledge transfer. We tested our method on ImageNet using multiple splits of the training data. Our approach achieves up to $8.39\%$ higher top1 accuracy than the vanilla warm-starting and consistently outperforms the prior art with a large margin.

- **Summary**: Generative AI has made remarkable strides to revolutionize fields such as image and video generation. These advancements are driven by innovative algorithms, architecture, and data. However, the rapid proliferation of generative models has highlighted a critical gap: the absence of trustworthy evaluation metrics. Current automatic assessments such as FID, CLIP, FVD, etc often fail to capture the nuanced quality and user satisfaction associated with generative outputs. This paper proposes an open platform GenAI-Arena to evaluate different image and video generative models, where users can actively participate in evaluating these models. By leveraging collective user feedback and votes, GenAI-Arena aims to provide a more democratic and accurate measure of model performance. It covers three arenas for text-to-image generation, text-to-video generation, and image editing respectively. Currently, we cover a total of 27 open-source generative models. GenAI-Arena has been operating for four months, amassing over 6000 votes from the community. We describe our platform, analyze the data, and explain the statistical methods for ranking the models. To further promote the research in building model-based evaluation metrics, we release a cleaned version of our preference data for the three tasks, namely GenAI-Bench. We prompt the existing multi-modal models like Gemini, GPT-4o to mimic human voting. We compute the correlation between model voting with human voting to understand their judging abilities. Our results show existing multimodal models are still lagging in assessing the generated visual content, even the best model GPT-4o only achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.22 in the quality subscore, and behaves like random guessing in others.

- **Summary**: In the fields of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), integrating multilingual capabilities remains a critical challenge, especially when considering languages with complex scripts such as Arabic. This paper introduces the Comprehensive Post-OCR Parsing and Receipt Understanding Dataset (CORU), a novel dataset specifically designed to enhance OCR and information extraction from receipts in multilingual contexts involving Arabic and English. CORU consists of over 20,000 annotated receipts from diverse retail settings, including supermarkets and clothing stores, alongside 30,000 annotated images for OCR that were utilized to recognize each detected line, and 10,000 items annotated for detailed information extraction. These annotations capture essential details such as merchant names, item descriptions, total prices, receipt numbers, and dates. They are structured to support three primary computational tasks: object detection, OCR, and information extraction. We establish the baseline performance for a range of models on CORU to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional methods, like Tesseract OCR, and more advanced neural network-based approaches. These baselines are crucial for processing the complex and noisy document layouts typical of real-world receipts and for advancing the state of automated multilingual document processing. Our datasets are publicly accessible (https://github.com/Update-For-Integrated-Business-AI/CORU).

- **Summary**: Image classification is a fundamental building block for a majority of computer vision applications. With the growing popularity and capacity of machine learning models, people can easily access trained image classifiers as a service online or offline. However, model use comes with a cost and classifiers of higher capacity usually incur higher inference costs. To harness the respective strengths of different classifiers, we propose a principled approach, OCCAM, to compute the best classifier assignment strategy over image classification queries (termed as the optimal model portfolio) so that the aggregated accuracy is maximized, under user-specified cost budgets. Our approach uses an unbiased and low-variance accuracy estimator and effectively computes the optimal solution by solving an integer linear programming problem. On a variety of real-world datasets, OCCAM achieves 40% cost reduction with little to no accuracy drop.

- **Summary**: The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has accelerated the progress of handwritten character classification/recognition. Handwritten character recognition (HCR) has found applications in various domains, such as traffic signal detection, language translation, and document information extraction. However, the widespread use of existing HCR technology is yet to be seen as it does not provide reliable character recognition with outstanding accuracy. One of the reasons for unreliable HCR is that existing HCR methods do not take the handwriting styles of non-native writers into account. Hence, further improvement is needed to ensure the reliability and extensive deployment of character recognition technologies for critical tasks. In this work, the classification of English characters written by non-native users is performed by proposing a custom-tailored CNN model. We train this CNN with a new dataset called the handwritten isolated English character (HIEC) dataset. This dataset consists of 16,496 images collected from 260 persons. This paper also includes an ablation study of our CNN by adjusting hyperparameters to identify the best model for the HIEC dataset. The proposed model with five convolutional layers and one hidden layer outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of character recognition accuracy and achieves an accuracy of $\mathbf{97.04}$%. Compared with the second-best model, the relative improvement of our model in terms of classification accuracy is $\mathbf{4.38}$%.

- **Summary**: In the field of self-supervised depth estimation, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have traditionally been dominant. However, both architectures struggle with efficiently handling long-range dependencies due to their local focus or computational demands. To overcome this limitation, we present MambaDepth, a versatile network tailored for self-supervised depth estimation. Drawing inspiration from the strengths of the Mamba architecture, renowned for its adept handling of lengthy sequences and its ability to capture global context efficiently through a State Space Model (SSM), we introduce MambaDepth. This innovative architecture combines the U-Net's effectiveness in self-supervised depth estimation with the advanced capabilities of Mamba. MambaDepth is structured around a purely Mamba-based encoder-decoder framework, incorporating skip connections to maintain spatial information at various levels of the network. This configuration promotes an extensive feature learning process, enabling the capture of fine details and broader contexts within depth maps. Furthermore, we have developed a novel integration technique within the Mamba blocks to facilitate uninterrupted connectivity and information flow between the encoder and decoder components, thereby improving depth accuracy. Comprehensive testing across the established KITTI dataset demonstrates MambaDepth's superiority over leading CNN and Transformer-based models in self-supervised depth estimation task, allowing it to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, MambaDepth proves its superior generalization capacities on other datasets such as Make3D and Cityscapes. MambaDepth's performance heralds a new era in effective long-range dependency modeling for self-supervised depth estimation.

- **Summary**: We present M&M VTO, a mix and match virtual try-on method that takes as input multiple garment images, text description for garment layout and an image of a person. An example input includes: an image of a shirt, an image of a pair of pants, "rolled sleeves, shirt tucked in", and an image of a person. The output is a visualization of how those garments (in the desired layout) would look like on the given person. Key contributions of our method are: 1) a single stage diffusion based model, with no super resolution cascading, that allows to mix and match multiple garments at 1024x512 resolution preserving and warping intricate garment details, 2) architecture design (VTO UNet Diffusion Transformer) to disentangle denoising from person specific features, allowing for a highly effective finetuning strategy for identity preservation (6MB model per individual vs 4GB achieved with, e.g., dreambooth finetuning); solving a common identity loss problem in current virtual try-on methods, 3) layout control for multiple garments via text inputs specifically finetuned over PaLI-3 for virtual try-on task. Experimental results indicate that M&M VTO achieves state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively, as well as opens up new opportunities for virtual try-on via language-guided and multi-garment try-on.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a short-range FMCW radar-based facial authentication and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection framework. Our pipeline jointly estimates the correct classes for the in-distribution (ID) samples and detects the OOD samples to prevent their inaccurate prediction. Our reconstruction-based architecture consists of a main convolutional block with one encoder and multi-decoder configuration, and intermediate linear encoder-decoder parts. Together, these elements form an accurate human face classifier and a robust OOD detector. For our dataset, gathered using a 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar, our network achieves an average classification accuracy of 98.07% in identifying in-distribution human faces. As an OOD detector, it achieves an average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve of 98.50% and an average False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate (FPR95) of 6.20%. Also, our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms previous OOD detectors in terms of common OOD detection metrics.

- **Summary**: With the growing popularity of text-to-image generative models, there has been increasing focus on understanding their risks and biases. Recent work has found that state-of-the-art models struggle to depict everyday objects with the true diversity of the real world and have notable gaps between geographic regions. In this work, we aim to increase the diversity of generated images of common objects such that per-region variations are representative of the real world. We introduce an inference time intervention, contextualized Vendi Score Guidance (c-VSG), that guides the backwards steps of latent diffusion models to increase the diversity of a sample as compared to a "memory bank" of previously generated images while constraining the amount of variation within that of an exemplar set of real-world contextualizing images. We evaluate c-VSG with two geographically representative datasets and find that it substantially increases the diversity of generated images, both for the worst performing regions and on average, while simultaneously maintaining or improving image quality and consistency. Additionally, qualitative analyses reveal that diversity of generated images is significantly improved, including along the lines of reductive region portrayals present in the original model. We hope that this work is a step towards text-to-image generative models that reflect the true geographic diversity of the world.
