- **Summary**: Video anomaly detection aims to develop automated models capable of identifying abnormal events in surveillance videos. The benchmark setup for this task is extremely challenging due to: i) the limited size of the training sets, ii) weak supervision provided in terms of video-level labels, and iii) intrinsic class imbalance induced by the scarcity of abnormal events. In this work, we show that distilling knowledge from aggregated representations of multiple backbones into a relatively simple model achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, we develop a bi-level distillation approach along with a novel disentangled cross-attention-based feature aggregation network. Our proposed approach, DAKD (Distilling Aggregated Knowledge with Disentangled Attention), demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets. Notably, we achieve significant improvements of 1.36%, 0.78%, and 7.02% on the UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech, and XD-Violence datasets, respectively.

- **Summary**: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) target detection has long been impeded by inherent speckle noise and the prevalence of diminutive, ambiguous targets. While deep neural networks have advanced SAR target detection, their intrinsic low-frequency bias and static post-training weights falter with coherent noise and preserving subtle details across heterogeneous terrains. Motivated by traditional SAR image denoising, we propose DenoDet, a network aided by explicit frequency domain transform to calibrate convolutional biases and pay more attention to high-frequencies, forming a natural multi-scale subspace representation to detect targets from the perspective of multi-subspace denoising. We design TransDeno, a dynamic frequency domain attention module that performs as a transform domain soft thresholding operation, dynamically denoising across subspaces by preserving salient target signals and attenuating noise. To adaptively adjust the granularity of subspace processing, we also propose a deformable group fully-connected layer (DeGroFC) that dynamically varies the group conditioned on the input features. Without bells and whistles, our plug-and-play TransDeno sets state-of-the-art scores on multiple SAR target detection datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/GrokCV/GrokSAR.

- **Summary**: Identifying the origin of data is crucial for data provenance, with applications including data ownership protection, media forensics, and detecting AI-generated content. A standard approach involves embedding-based retrieval techniques that match query data with entries in a reference dataset. However, this method is not robust against benign and malicious edits. To address this, we propose Data Retrieval with Error-corrected codes and Watermarking (DREW). DREW randomly clusters the reference dataset, injects unique error-controlled watermark keys into each cluster, and uses these keys at query time to identify the appropriate cluster for a given sample. After locating the relevant cluster, embedding vector similarity retrieval is performed within the cluster to find the most accurate matches. The integration of error control codes (ECC) ensures reliable cluster assignments, enabling the method to perform retrieval on the entire dataset in case the ECC algorithm cannot detect the correct cluster with high confidence. This makes DREW maintain baseline performance, while also providing opportunities for performance improvements due to the increased likelihood of correctly matching queries to their origin when performing retrieval on a smaller subset of the dataset. Depending on the watermark technique used, DREW can provide substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy (up to 40\% for some datasets and modification types) across multiple datasets and state-of-the-art embedding models (e.g., DinoV2, CLIP), making our method a promising solution for secure and reliable source identification.

- **Summary**: We propose Conditional Idempotent Generative Networks (CIGN), a novel approach that expands upon Idempotent Generative Networks (IGN) to enable conditional generation. While IGNs offer efficient single-pass generation, they lack the ability to control the content of the generated data. CIGNs address this limitation by incorporating conditioning mechanisms, allowing users to steer the generation process towards specific types of data.   We establish the theoretical foundations for CIGNs, outlining their scope, loss function design, and evaluation metrics. We then present two potential architectures for implementing CIGNs: channel conditioning and filter conditioning. Finally, we discuss experimental results on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of both approaches. Our findings pave the way for further exploration of CIGNs on larger datasets and with more powerful computing resources to determine the optimal implementation strategy.

- **Summary**: Foundation models have emerged as powerful tools across various domains including language, vision, and multimodal tasks. While prior works have addressed unsupervised image segmentation, they significantly lag behind supervised models. In this paper, we use a diffusion UNet encoder as a foundation vision encoder and introduce DiffCut, an unsupervised zero-shot segmentation method that solely harnesses the output features from the final self-attention block. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the utilization of these diffusion features in a graph based segmentation algorithm, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot segmentation. Specifically, we leverage a recursive Normalized Cut algorithm that softly regulates the granularity of detected objects and produces well-defined segmentation maps that precisely capture intricate image details. Our work highlights the remarkably accurate semantic knowledge embedded within diffusion UNet encoders that could then serve as foundation vision encoders for downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) is fragile in scenarios with insufficient labeled samples. A vanilla extension of ERM to unlabeled samples is Entropy Minimization (EntMin), which employs the soft-labels of unlabeled samples to guide their learning. However, EntMin emphasizes prediction discriminability while neglecting prediction diversity. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, we rethink the guidance information to utilize unlabeled samples. By analyzing the learning objective of ERM, we find that the guidance information for labeled samples in a specific category is the corresponding label encoding. Inspired by this finding, we propose a Label-Encoding Risk Minimization (LERM). It first estimates the label encodings through prediction means of unlabeled samples and then aligns them with their corresponding ground-truth label encodings. As a result, the LERM ensures both prediction discriminability and diversity, and it can be integrated into existing methods as a plugin. Theoretically, we analyze the relationships between LERM and ERM as well as EntMin. Empirically, we verify the superiority of the LERM under several label insufficient scenarios.

- **Summary**: We specify the conditions when a manifold M embedded in an inner product space E is an invariant manifold of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) on E, linking it with the notion of second-order differential operators on M. When M is given a Riemannian metric, we derive a simple formula for the Laplace-Beltrami operator in terms of the gradient and Hessian on E and construct the Riemannian Brownian motions on M as solutions of conservative Stratonovich and Ito SDEs on E. We derive explicitly the SDE for Brownian motions on several important manifolds in applications, including left-invariant matrix Lie groups using embedded coordinates. Numerically, we propose three simulation schemes to solve SDEs on manifolds. In addition to the stochastic projection method, to simulate Riemannian Brownian motions, we construct a second-order tangent retraction of the Levi-Civita connection using a given E-tubular retraction. We also propose the retractive Euler-Maruyama method to solve a SDE, taking into account the second-order term of a tangent retraction. We provide software to implement the methods in the paper, including Brownian motions of the manifolds discussed. We verify numerically that on several compact Riemannian manifolds, the long-term limit of Brownian simulation converges to the uniform distributions, suggesting a method to sample Riemannian uniform distributions

- **Summary**: Audio-driven talking face generation has garnered significant interest within the domain of digital human research. Existing methods are encumbered by intricate model architectures that are intricately dependent on each other, complicating the process of re-editing image or video inputs. In this work, we present ControlTalk, a talking face generation method to control face expression deformation based on driven audio, which can construct the head pose and facial expression including lip motion for both single image or sequential video inputs in a unified manner. By utilizing a pre-trained video synthesis renderer and proposing the lightweight adaptation, ControlTalk achieves precise and naturalistic lip synchronization while enabling quantitative control over mouth opening shape. Our experiments show that our method is superior to state-of-the-art performance on widely used benchmarks, including HDTF and MEAD. The parameterized adaptation demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities, effectively handling expression deformation across same-ID and cross-ID scenarios, and extending its utility to out-of-domain portraits, regardless of languages.

- **Summary**: The remarkable advancement in text-to-image generation models significantly boosts the research in ID customization generation. However, existing personalization methods cannot simultaneously satisfy high fidelity and high-efficiency requirements. Their main bottleneck lies in the prompt image encoder, which produces weak alignment signals with the text-to-image model and significantly increased model size. Towards this end, we propose a lightweight Inv-Adapter, which first extracts diffusion-domain representations of ID images utilizing a pre-trained text-to-image model via DDIM image inversion, without additional image encoder. Benefiting from the high alignment of the extracted ID prompt features and the intermediate features of the text-to-image model, we then embed them efficiently into the base text-to-image model by carefully designing a lightweight attention adapter. We conduct extensive experiments to assess ID fidelity, generation loyalty, speed, and training parameters, all of which show that the proposed Inv-Adapter is highly competitive in ID customization generation and model scale.

- **Summary**: Layout generation is the keystone in achieving automated graphic design, requiring arranging the position and size of various multi-modal design elements in a visually pleasing and constraint-following manner. Previous approaches are either inefficient for large-scale applications or lack flexibility for varying design requirements. Our research introduces a unified framework for automated graphic layout generation, leveraging the multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to accommodate diverse design tasks. In contrast, our data-driven method employs structured text (JSON format) and visual instruction tuning to generate layouts under specific visual and textual constraints, including user-defined natural language specifications. We conducted extensive experiments and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on public multi-modal layout generation benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, recognizing existing datasets' limitations in capturing the complexity of real-world graphic designs, we propose two new datasets for much more challenging tasks (user-constrained generation and complicated poster), further validating our model's utility in real-life settings. Marking by its superior accessibility and adaptability, this approach further automates large-scale graphic design tasks. The code and datasets will be publicly available on https://github.com/posterllava/PosterLLaVA.

- **Summary**: Dataset bias is a significant problem in training fair classifiers. When attributes unrelated to classification exhibit strong biases towards certain classes, classifiers trained on such dataset may overfit to these bias attributes, substantially reducing the accuracy for minority groups. Mitigation techniques can be categorized according to the availability of bias information (\ie, prior knowledge). Although scenarios with unknown biases are better suited for real-world settings, previous work in this field often suffers from a lack of interpretability regarding biases and lower performance. In this study, we propose a framework to identify potential biases as keywords without prior knowledge based on the partial occurrence in the captions. We further propose two debiasing methods: (a) handing over to an existing debiasing approach which requires prior knowledge by assigning pseudo-labels, and (b) employing data augmentation via text-to-image generative models, using acquired bias keywords as prompts. Despite its simplicity, experimental results show that our framework not only outperforms existing methods without prior knowledge, but also is even comparable with a method that assumes prior knowledge.

- **Summary**: In low-visibility marine environments characterized by turbidity and darkness, acoustic cameras serve as visual sensors capable of generating high-resolution 2D sonar images. However, acoustic camera images are interfered with by complex noise and are difficult to be directly ingested by downstream visual algorithms. This paper introduces a novel strategy for denoising acoustic camera images using deep learning techniques, which comprises two principal components: a self-supervised denoising framework and a fine feature-guided block. Additionally, the study explores the relationship between the level of image denoising and the improvement in feature-matching performance. Experimental results show that the proposed denoising strategy can effectively filter acoustic camera images without prior knowledge of the noise model. The denoising process is nearly end-to-end without complex parameter tuning and post-processing. It successfully removes noise while preserving fine feature details, thereby enhancing the performance of local feature matching.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: It has recently been discovered that using a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), e.g., CLIP, to align a whole query image with several finer text descriptions generated by a large language model can significantly enhance zero-shot performance. However, in this paper, we empirically find that the finer descriptions tend to align more effectively with local areas of the query image rather than the whole image, and then we theoretically validate this finding. Thus, we present a method called weighted visual-text cross alignment (WCA). This method begins with a localized visual prompting technique, designed to identify local visual areas within the query image. The local visual areas are then cross-aligned with the finer descriptions by creating a similarity matrix using the pre-trained VLM. To determine how well a query image aligns with each category, we develop a score function based on the weighted similarities in this matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves zero-shot performance across various datasets, achieving results that are even comparable to few-shot learning methods.

- **Summary**: U-Net has become a cornerstone in various visual applications such as image segmentation and diffusion probability models. While numerous innovative designs and improvements have been introduced by incorporating transformers or MLPs, the networks are still limited to linearly modeling patterns as well as the deficient interpretability. To address these challenges, our intuition is inspired by the impressive results of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in terms of accuracy and interpretability, which reshape the neural network learning via the stack of non-linear learnable activation functions derived from the Kolmogorov-Anold representation theorem. Specifically, in this paper, we explore the untapped potential of KANs in improving backbones for vision tasks. We investigate, modify and re-design the established U-Net pipeline by integrating the dedicated KAN layers on the tokenized intermediate representation, termed U-KAN. Rigorous medical image segmentation benchmarks verify the superiority of U-KAN by higher accuracy even with less computation cost. We further delved into the potential of U-KAN as an alternative U-Net noise predictor in diffusion models, demonstrating its applicability in generating task-oriented model architectures. These endeavours unveil valuable insights and sheds light on the prospect that with U-KAN, you can make strong backbone for medical image segmentation and generation.

- **Summary**: Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) aims to enable classifiers to identify unseen classes by enhancing data efficiency at the class level. This is achieved by generating image features from pre-defined semantics of unseen classes. However, most current approaches heavily depend on the number of samples from seen classes, i.e. they do not consider instance-level effectiveness. In this paper, we demonstrate that limited seen examples generally result in deteriorated performance of generative models. To overcome these challenges, we propose ZeroDiff, a Diffusion-based Generative ZSL model. This unified framework incorporates diffusion models to improve data efficiency at both the class and instance levels. Specifically, for instance-level effectiveness, ZeroDiff utilizes a forward diffusion chain to transform limited data into an expanded set of noised data. For class-level effectiveness, we design a two-branch generation structure that consists of a Diffusion-based Feature Generator (DFG) and a Diffusion-based Representation Generator (DRG). DFG focuses on learning and sampling the distribution of cross-entropy-based features, whilst DRG learns the supervised contrastive-based representation to boost the zero-shot capabilities of DFG. Additionally, we employ three discriminators to evaluate generated features from various aspects and introduce a Wasserstein-distance-based mutual learning loss to transfer knowledge among discriminators, thereby enhancing guidance for generation. Demonstrated through extensive experiments on three popular ZSL benchmarks, our ZeroDiff not only achieves significant improvements over existing ZSL methods but also maintains robust performance even with scarce training data. Code will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Extracting building contours from remote sensing imagery is a significant challenge due to buildings' complex and diverse shapes, occlusions, and noise. Existing methods often struggle with irregular contours, rounded corners, and redundancy points, necessitating extensive post-processing to produce regular polygonal building contours. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel, streamlined pipeline that generates regular building contours without post-processing. Our approach begins with the segmentation of generic geometric primitives (which can include vertices, lines, and corners), followed by the prediction of their sequence. This allows for the direct construction of regular building contours by sequentially connecting the segmented primitives. Building on this pipeline, we developed P2PFormer, which utilizes a transformer-based architecture to segment geometric primitives and predict their order. To enhance the segmentation of primitives, we introduce a unique representation called group queries. This representation comprises a set of queries and a singular query position, which improve the focus on multiple midpoints of primitives and their efficient linkage. Furthermore, we propose an innovative implicit update strategy for the query position embedding aimed at sharpening the focus of queries on the correct positions and, consequently, enhancing the quality of primitive segmentation. Our experiments demonstrate that P2PFormer achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the WHU, CrowdAI, and WHU-Mix datasets, surpassing the previous SOTA PolyWorld by a margin of 2.7 AP and 6.5 AP75 on the largest CrowdAI dataset. We intend to make the code and trained weights publicly available to promote their use and facilitate further research.

- **Summary**: Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women and predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) after anti-cancer treatment is crucial for patient prognosis and treatment customization. Deep learning has shown promise in medical imaging diagnosis, particularly when utilizing multiple imaging modalities to enhance accuracy. This study presents a model that predicts pCR in breast cancer patients using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Radiomics features are established hand-crafted features of the tumor region and thus could be useful in medical image analysis. Our approach extracts features from both DCE MRI and ADC using an encoder with a self-attention mechanism, leveraging radiomics to guide feature extraction from tumor-related regions. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our model in predicting pCR compared to other baseline methods.

- **Summary**: With the rapid growth in deepfake video content, we require improved and generalizable methods to detect them. Most existing detection methods either use uni-modal cues or rely on supervised training to capture the dissonance between the audio and visual modalities. While the former disregards the audio-visual correspondences entirely, the latter predominantly focuses on discerning audio-visual cues within the training corpus, thereby potentially overlooking correspondences that can help detect unseen deepfakes. We present Audio-Visual Feature Fusion (AVFF), a two-stage cross-modal learning method that explicitly captures the correspondence between the audio and visual modalities for improved deepfake detection. The first stage pursues representation learning via self-supervision on real videos to capture the intrinsic audio-visual correspondences. To extract rich cross-modal representations, we use contrastive learning and autoencoding objectives, and introduce a novel audio-visual complementary masking and feature fusion strategy. The learned representations are tuned in the second stage, where deepfake classification is pursued via supervised learning on both real and fake videos. Extensive experiments and analysis suggest that our novel representation learning paradigm is highly discriminative in nature. We report 98.6% accuracy and 99.1% AUC on the FakeAVCeleb dataset, outperforming the current audio-visual state-of-the-art by 14.9% and 9.9%, respectively.

- **Summary**: The concept of negative prompts, emerging from conditional generation models like Stable Diffusion, allows users to specify what to exclude from the generated images.%, demonstrating significant practical efficacy. Despite the widespread use of negative prompts, their intrinsic mechanisms remain largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive study to uncover how and when negative prompts take effect. Our extensive empirical analysis identifies two primary behaviors of negative prompts. Delayed Effect: The impact of negative prompts is observed after positive prompts render corresponding content. Deletion Through Neutralization: Negative prompts delete concepts from the generated image through a mutual cancellation effect in latent space with positive prompts. These insights reveal significant potential real-world applications; for example, we demonstrate that negative prompts can facilitate object inpainting with minimal alterations to the background via a simple adaptive algorithm. We believe our findings will offer valuable insights for the community in capitalizing on the potential of negative prompts.

- **Summary**: Most advances in 3D Generative Adversarial Networks (3D GANs) largely depend on ray casting-based volume rendering, which incurs demanding rendering costs. One promising alternative is rasterization-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), providing a much faster rendering speed and explicit 3D representation. In this paper, we exploit Gaussian as a 3D representation for 3D GANs by leveraging its efficient and explicit characteristics. However, in an adversarial framework, we observe that a na\"ive generator architecture suffers from training instability and lacks the capability to adjust the scale of Gaussians. This leads to model divergence and visual artifacts due to the absence of proper guidance for initialized positions of Gaussians and densification to manage their scales adaptively. To address these issues, we introduce a generator architecture with a hierarchical multi-scale Gaussian representation that effectively regularizes the position and scale of generated Gaussians. Specifically, we design a hierarchy of Gaussians where finer-level Gaussians are parameterized by their coarser-level counterparts; the position of finer-level Gaussians would be located near their coarser-level counterparts, and the scale would monotonically decrease as the level becomes finer, modeling both coarse and fine details of the 3D scene. Experimental results demonstrate that ours achieves a significantly faster rendering speed (x100) compared to state-of-the-art 3D consistent GANs with comparable 3D generation capability.

- **Summary**: The recent emergence of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) leverages the advantage of explicit point-based representations, which significantly improves the rendering speed and quality of novel-view synthesis. However, 3D radiance field rendering in environments with high-dynamic motion or challenging illumination condition remains problematic in real-world robotic tasks. The reason is that fast egomotion is prevalent real-world robotic tasks, which induces motion blur, leading to inaccuracies and artifacts in the reconstructed structure. To alleviate this problem, we propose Event3DGS, the first method that learns Gaussian Splatting solely from raw event streams. By exploiting the high temporal resolution of event cameras and explicit point-based representation, Event3DGS can reconstruct high-fidelity 3D structures solely from the event streams under fast egomotion. Our sparsity-aware sampling and progressive training approaches allow for better reconstruction quality and consistency. To further enhance the fidelity of appearance, we explicitly incorporate the motion blur formation process into a differentiable rasterizer, which is used with a limited set of blurred RGB images to refine the appearance. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the superior rendering quality of Event3DGS compared with existing approaches, with over 95% lower training time and faster rendering speed in orders of magnitude.

- **Summary**: Cooperation between temporal convolutional networks (TCN) and graph convolutional networks (GCN) as a processing module has shown promising results in skeleton-based video anomaly detection (SVAD). However, to maintain a lightweight model with low computational and storage complexity, shallow GCN and TCN blocks are constrained by small receptive fields and a lack of cross-dimension interaction capture. To tackle this limitation, we propose a lightweight module called the Dual Attention Module (DAM) for capturing cross-dimension interaction relationships in spatio-temporal skeletal data. It employs the frame attention mechanism to identify the most significant frames and the skeleton attention mechanism to capture broader relationships across fixed partitions with minimal parameters and flops. Furthermore, the proposed Dual Attention Normalizing Flow (DA-Flow) integrates the DAM as a post-processing unit after GCN within the normalizing flow framework. Simulations show that the proposed model is robust against noise and negative samples. Experimental results show that DA-Flow reaches competitive or better performance than the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of the micro AUC metric with the fewest number of parameters. Moreover, we found that even without training, simply using random projection without dimensionality reduction on skeleton data enables substantial anomaly detection capabilities.

- **Summary**: As robotics and augmented reality applications increasingly rely on precise and efficient 6D object pose estimation, real-time performance on edge devices is required for more interactive and responsive systems. Our proposed Sparse Color-Code Net (SCCN) embodies a clear and concise pipeline design to effectively address this requirement. SCCN performs pixel-level predictions on the target object in the RGB image, utilizing the sparsity of essential object geometry features to speed up the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) computation process. Additionally, it introduces a novel pixel-level geometry-based object symmetry representation that seamlessly integrates with the initial pose predictions, effectively addressing symmetric object ambiguities. SCCN notably achieves an estimation rate of 19 frames per second (FPS) and 6 FPS on the benchmark LINEMOD dataset and the Occlusion LINEMOD dataset, respectively, for an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier, while consistently maintaining high estimation accuracy at these rates.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL), which aims to learn meaningful prior representations from unlabeled data, has been proven effective for label-efficient skeleton-based action understanding. Different from the image domain, skeleton data possesses sparser spatial structures and diverse representation forms, with the absence of background clues and the additional temporal dimension. This presents the new challenges for the pretext task design of spatial-temporal motion representation learning. Recently, many endeavors have been made for skeleton-based SSL and remarkable progress has been achieved. However, a systematic and thorough review is still lacking. In this paper, we conduct, for the first time, a comprehensive survey on self-supervised skeleton-based action representation learning, where various literature is organized according to their pre-training pretext task methodologies. Following the taxonomy of context-based, generative learning, and contrastive learning approaches, we make a thorough review and benchmark of existing works and shed light on the future possible directions. Our investigation demonstrates that most SSL works rely on the single paradigm, learning representations of a single level, and are evaluated on the action recognition task solely, which leaves the generalization power of skeleton SSL models under-explored. To this end, a novel and effective SSL method for skeleton is further proposed, which integrates multiple pretext tasks to jointly learn versatile representations of different granularity, substantially boosting the generalization capacity for different downstream tasks. Extensive experiments under three large-scale datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the superior generalization performance on various downstream tasks, including recognition, retrieval, detection, and few-shot learning.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved SOTA performance in various visual language tasks by fusing the visual representations with LLMs leveraging some visual adapters. In this paper, we first establish that adapters using query-based Transformers such as Q-former is a simplified Multi-instance Learning method without considering instance heterogeneity/correlation. We then propose a general component termed Multi-instance Visual Prompt Generator (MIVPG) to incorporate enriched visual representations into LLMs by taking advantage of instance correlation between images or patches for the same sample. Quantatitive evaluation on three public vision-language (VL) datasets from different scenarios shows that the proposed MIVPG improves Q-former in main VL tasks.

- **Summary**: Predicting genetic mutations from whole slide images is indispensable for cancer diagnosis. However, existing work training multiple binary classification models faces two challenges: (a) Training multiple binary classifiers is inefficient and would inevitably lead to a class imbalance problem. (b) The biological relationships among genes are overlooked, which limits the prediction performance. To tackle these challenges, we innovatively design a Biological-knowledge enhanced PathGenomic multi-label Transformer to improve genetic mutation prediction performances. BPGT first establishes a novel gene encoder that constructs gene priors by two carefully designed modules: (a) A gene graph whose node features are the genes' linguistic descriptions and the cancer phenotype, with edges modeled by genes' pathway associations and mutation consistencies. (b) A knowledge association module that fuses linguistic and biomedical knowledge into gene priors by transformer-based graph representation learning, capturing the intrinsic relationships between different genes' mutations. BPGT then designs a label decoder that finally performs genetic mutation prediction by two tailored modules: (a) A modality fusion module that firstly fuses the gene priors with critical regions in WSIs and obtains gene-wise mutation logits. (b) A comparative multi-label loss that emphasizes the inherent comparisons among mutation status to enhance the discrimination capabilities. Sufficient experiments on The Cancer Genome Atlas benchmark demonstrate that BPGT outperforms the state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: In this paper we introduce a new dataset for 360-degree video summarization: the transformation of 360-degree video content to concise 2D-video summaries that can be consumed via traditional devices, such as TV sets and smartphones. The dataset includes ground-truth human-generated summaries, that can be used for training and objectively evaluating 360-degree video summarization methods. Using this dataset, we train and assess two state-of-the-art summarization methods that were originally proposed for 2D-video summarization, to serve as a baseline for future comparisons with summarization methods that are specifically tailored to 360-degree video. Finally, we present an interactive tool that was developed to facilitate the data annotation process and can assist other annotation activities that rely on video fragment selection.

- **Summary**: The goal of multi-task learning is to learn diverse tasks within a single unified network. As each task has its own unique objective function, conflicts emerge during training, resulting in negative transfer among them. Earlier research identified these conflicting gradients in shared parameters between tasks and attempted to realign them in the same direction. However, we prove that such optimization strategies lead to sub-optimal Pareto solutions due to their inability to accurately determine the individual contributions of each parameter across various tasks. In this paper, we propose the concept of task priority to evaluate parameter contributions across different tasks. To learn task priority, we identify the type of connections related to links between parameters influenced by task-specific losses during backpropagation. The strength of connections is gauged by the magnitude of parameters to determine task priority. Based on these, we present a new method named connection strength-based optimization for multi-task learning which consists of two phases. The first phase learns the task priority within the network, while the second phase modifies the gradients while upholding this priority. This ultimately leads to finding new Pareto optimal solutions for multiple tasks. Through extensive experiments, we show that our approach greatly enhances multi-task performance in comparison to earlier gradient manipulation methods.

- **Summary**: Real-time video analytics systems typically place models with fewer weights on edge devices to reduce latency. The distribution of video content features may change over time for various reasons (i.e. light and weather change) , leading to accuracy degradation of existing models, to solve this problem, recent work proposes a framework that uses a remote server to continually train and adapt the lightweight model at edge with the help of complex model. However, existing analytics approaches leave two challenges untouched: firstly, retraining task is compute-intensive, resulting in large model update delays; secondly, new model may not fit well enough with the data distribution of the current video stream. To address these challenges, in this paper, we present EdgeSync, EdgeSync filters the samples by considering both timeliness and inference results to make training samples more relevant to the current video content as well as reduce the update delay, to improve the quality of training, EdgeSync also designs a training management module that can efficiently adjusts the model training time and training order on the runtime. By evaluating real datasets with complex scenes, our method improves about 3.4% compared to existing methods and about 10% compared to traditional means.

- **Summary**: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is an important neuroimaging technique with high acquisition costs. Deep learning approaches have been used to enhance dMRI and predict diffusion biomarkers through undersampled dMRI. To generate more comprehensive raw dMRI, generative adversarial network based methods are proposed to include b-values and b-vectors as conditions, but they are limited by unstable training and less desirable diversity. The emerging diffusion model (DM) promises to improve generative performance. However, it remains challenging to include essential information in conditioning DM for more relevant generation, i.e., the physical principles of dMRI and white matter tract structures. In this study, we propose a physics-guided diffusion model to generate high-quality dMRI. Our model introduces the physical principles of dMRI in the noise evolution in the diffusion process and introduce a query-based conditional mapping within the difussion model. In addition, to enhance the anatomical fine detials of the generation, we introduce the XTRACT atlas as prior of white matter tracts by adopting an adapter technique. Our experiment results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and has the potential to advance dMRI enhancement.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in foundation models (FMs) have unlocked new prospects in autonomous driving, yet the experimental settings of these studies are preliminary, over-simplified, and fail to capture the complexity of real-world driving scenarios in human environments. It remains under-explored whether FM agents can handle long-horizon navigation tasks with free-from dialogue and deal with unexpected situations caused by environmental dynamics or task changes. To explore the capabilities and boundaries of FMs faced with the challenges above, we introduce DriVLMe, a video-language-model-based agent to facilitate natural and effective communication between humans and autonomous vehicles that perceive the environment and navigate. We develop DriVLMe from both embodied experiences in a simulated environment and social experiences from real human dialogue. While DriVLMe demonstrates competitive performance in both open-loop benchmarks and closed-loop human studies, we reveal several limitations and challenges, including unacceptable inference time, imbalanced training data, limited visual understanding, challenges with multi-turn interactions, simplified language generation from robotic experiences, and difficulties in handling on-the-fly unexpected situations like environmental dynamics and task changes.

- **Summary**: This work investigates efficient score-based black-box adversarial attacks with a high Attack Success Rate (ASR) and good generalizability. We design a novel attack method based on a \textit{Hierarchical} \textbf{Di}sentangled \textbf{F}eature space and \textit{cross domain}, called \textbf{DifAttack++}, which differs significantly from the existing ones operating over the entire feature space. Specifically, DifAttack++ firstly disentangles an image's latent feature into an \textit{adversarial feature} (AF) and a \textit{visual feature} (VF) via an autoencoder equipped with our specially designed \textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{D}ecouple-\textbf{F}usion (HDF) module, where the AF dominates the adversarial capability of an image, while the VF largely determines its visual appearance. We train such autoencoders for the clean and adversarial image domains respectively, meanwhile realizing feature disentanglement, by using pairs of clean images and their Adversarial Examples (AEs) generated from available surrogate models via white-box attack methods. Eventually, in the black-box attack stage, DifAttack++ iteratively optimizes the AF according to the query feedback from the victim model until a successful AE is generated, while keeping the VF unaltered. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior ASR and query efficiency than SOTA methods, meanwhile exhibiting much better visual quality of AEs.

- **Summary**: Oracle Bone Inscriptions is one of the oldest existing forms of writing in the world. However, due to the great antiquity of the era, a large number of Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBI) remain undeciphered, making it one of the global challenges in the field of paleography today. This paper introduces a novel approach, namely Puzzle Pieces Picker (P$^3$), to decipher these enigmatic characters through radical reconstruction. We deconstruct OBI into foundational strokes and radicals, then employ a Transformer model to reconstruct them into their modern (conterpart)\textcolor{blue}{counterparts}, offering a groundbreaking solution to ancient script analysis. To further this endeavor, a new Ancient Chinese Character Puzzles (ACCP) dataset was developed, comprising an extensive collection of character images from seven key historical stages, annotated with detailed radical sequences. The experiments have showcased considerable promising insights, underscoring the potential and effectiveness of our approach in deciphering the intricacies of ancient Chinese scripts. Through this novel dataset and methodology, we aim to bridge the gap between traditional philology and modern document analysis techniques, offering new insights into the rich history of Chinese linguistic heritage.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to explore the semantic-visual interactions to discover comprehensive knowledge transferred from seen categories to classify unseen categories. Recently, prompt engineering has emerged in ZSL, demonstrating impressive potential as it enables the zero-shot transfer of diverse visual concepts to downstream tasks. However, these methods are still not well generalized to broad unseen domains. A key reason is that the fixed adaption of learnable prompts on seen domains makes it tend to over-emphasize the primary visual features observed during training. In this work, we propose a \textbf{P}rompt-to-\textbf{P}rompt generation methodology (\textbf{P2P}), which addresses this issue by further embracing the instruction-following technique to distill instructive visual prompts for comprehensive transferable knowledge discovery. The core of P2P is to mine semantic-related instruction from prompt-conditioned visual features and text instruction on modal-sharing semantic concepts and then inversely rectify the visual representations with the guidance of the learned instruction prompts. This enforces the compensation for missing visual details to primary contexts and further eliminates the cross-modal disparity, endowing unseen domain generalization. Through extensive experimental results, we demonstrate the efficacy of P2P in achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Pose-controllable character video generation is in high demand with extensive applications for fields such as automatic advertising and content creation on social media platforms. While existing character image animation methods using pose sequences and reference images have shown promising performance, they tend to struggle with incoherent animation in complex scenarios, such as multiple character animation and body occlusion. Additionally, current methods request large-scale high-quality videos with stable backgrounds and temporal consistency as training datasets, otherwise, their performance will greatly deteriorate. These two issues hinder the practical utilization of character image animation tools. In this paper, we propose a practical and robust framework Follow-Your-Pose v2, which can be trained on noisy open-sourced videos readily available on the internet. Multi-condition guiders are designed to address the challenges of background stability, body occlusion in multi-character generation, and consistency of character appearance. Moreover, to fill the gap of fair evaluation of multi-character pose animation, we propose a new benchmark comprising approximately 4,000 frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a margin of over 35\% across 2 datasets and on 7 metrics. Meanwhile, qualitative assessments reveal a significant improvement in the quality of generated video, particularly in scenarios involving complex backgrounds and body occlusion of multi-character, suggesting the superiority of our approach.

- **Summary**: Every task demands distinct feature representations, ranging from low-level to high-level attributes, so it is vital to address the specific needs of each task, especially in the Multi-task Learning (MTL) framework. This work, therefore, introduces Layer-Optimized Multi-Task (LOMT) models that utilize structured sparsity to refine feature selection for individual tasks and enhance the performance of all tasks in a multi-task scenario. Structured or group sparsity systematically eliminates parameters from trivial channels and, eventually, entire layers within a convolution neural network during training. Consequently, the remaining layers provide the most optimal features for a given task. In this two-step approach, we subsequently leverage this sparsity-induced optimal layer information to build the LOMT models by connecting task-specific decoders to these strategically identified layers, deviating from conventional approaches that uniformly connect decoders at the end of the network. This tailored architecture optimizes the network, focusing on essential features while reducing redundancy. We validate the efficacy of the proposed approach on two datasets, ie NYU-v2 and CelebAMask-HD datasets, for multiple heterogeneous tasks. A detailed performance analysis of the LOMT models, in contrast to the conventional MTL models, reveals that the LOMT models outperform for most task combinations. The excellent qualitative and quantitative outcomes highlight the effectiveness of employing structured sparsity for optimal layer (or feature) selection.

- **Summary**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become increasingly important as foundation models continue to grow in both popularity and size. Adapter has been particularly well-received due to their potential for parameter reduction and adaptability across diverse tasks. However, striking a balance between high efficiency and robust generalization across tasks remains a challenge for adapter-based methods. We analyze existing methods and find that: 1) parameter sharing is the key to reducing redundancy; 2) more tunable parameters, dynamic allocation, and block-specific design are keys to improving performance. Unfortunately, no previous work considers all these factors. Inspired by this insight, we introduce a novel framework named Adapter-X. First, a Sharing Mixture of Adapters (SMoA) module is proposed to fulfill token-level dynamic allocation, increased tunable parameters, and inter-block sharing at the same time. Second, some block-specific designs like Prompt Generator (PG) are introduced to further enhance the ability of adaptation. Extensive experiments across 2D image and 3D point cloud modalities demonstrate that Adapter-X represents a significant milestone as it is the first to outperform full fine-tuning in both 2D image and 3D point cloud modalities with significantly fewer parameters, i.e., only 0.20% and 1.88% of original trainable parameters for 2D and 3D classification tasks. Our code will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Instance-incremental learning (IIL) focuses on learning continually with data of the same classes. Compared to class-incremental learning (CIL), the IIL is seldom explored because IIL suffers less from catastrophic forgetting (CF). However, besides retaining knowledge, in real-world deployment scenarios where the class space is always predefined, continual and cost-effective model promotion with the potential unavailability of previous data is a more essential demand. Therefore, we first define a new and more practical IIL setting as promoting the model's performance besides resisting CF with only new observations. Two issues have to be tackled in the new IIL setting: 1) the notorious catastrophic forgetting because of no access to old data, and 2) broadening the existing decision boundary to new observations because of concept drift. To tackle these problems, our key insight is to moderately broaden the decision boundary to fail cases while retain old boundary. Hence, we propose a novel decision boundary-aware distillation method with consolidating knowledge to teacher to ease the student learning new knowledge. We also establish the benchmarks on existing datasets Cifar-100 and ImageNet. Notably, extensive experiments demonstrate that the teacher model can be a better incremental learner than the student model, which overturns previous knowledge distillation-based methods treating student as the main role.

- **Summary**: How to accurately and efficiently assess AI-generated images (AIGIs) remains a critical challenge for generative models. Given the high costs and extensive time commitments required for user studies, many researchers have turned towards employing large multi-modal models (LMMs) as AIGI evaluators, the precision and validity of which are still questionable. Furthermore, traditional benchmarks often utilize mostly natural-captured content rather than AIGIs to test the abilities of LMMs, leading to a noticeable gap for AIGIs. Therefore, we introduce A-Bench in this paper, a benchmark designed to diagnose whether LMMs are masters at evaluating AIGIs. Specifically, A-Bench is organized under two key principles: 1) Emphasizing both high-level semantic understanding and low-level visual quality perception to address the intricate demands of AIGIs. 2) Various generative models are utilized for AIGI creation, and various LMMs are employed for evaluation, which ensures a comprehensive validation scope. Ultimately, 2,864 AIGIs from 16 text-to-image models are sampled, each paired with question-answers annotated by human experts, and tested across 18 leading LMMs. We hope that A-Bench will significantly enhance the evaluation process and promote the generation quality for AIGIs. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Q-Future/A-Bench.

- **Summary**: In this paper we address image classification tasks leveraging knowledge encoded in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). More specifically, we use the MiniGPT-4 model to extract semantic descriptions for the images, in a multimodal prompting fashion. In the current literature, vision language models such as CLIP, among other approaches, are utilized as feature extractors, using only the image encoder, for solving image classification tasks. In this paper, we propose to additionally use the text encoder to obtain the text embeddings corresponding to the MiniGPT-4-generated semantic descriptions. Thus, we use both the image and text embeddings for solving the image classification task. The experimental evaluation on three datasets validates the improved classification performance achieved by exploiting LMM-based knowledge.

- **Summary**: Lossless image compression is required in various applications to reduce storage or transmission costs of images, while requiring the reconstructed images to have zero information loss compared to the original. Existing lossless image compression methods either have simple design but poor compression performance, or complex design, better performance, but with no performance guarantees. In our endeavor to develop a lossless image compression method with low complexity and guaranteed performance, we argue that compressibility of a color image is essentially derived from the patterns in its spatial structure, intensity variations, and color variations. Thus, we divide the overall design of a lossless image compression scheme into three parts that exploit corresponding redundancies. We further argue that the binarized version of an image captures its fundamental spatial structure and in this work, we propose a scheme for lossless compression of binary images.   The proposed scheme first learns dictionaries of $16\times16$, $8\times8$, $4\times4$, and $2\times 2$ square pixel patterns from various datasets of binary images. It then uses these dictionaries to encode binary images. These dictionaries have various interesting properties that are further exploited to construct an efficient scheme. Our preliminary results show that the proposed scheme consistently outperforms existing conventional and learning based lossless compression approaches, and provides, on average, as much as $1.5\times$ better performance than a common general purpose lossless compression scheme (WebP), more than $3\times$ better performance than a state of the art learning based scheme, and better performance than a specialized scheme for binary image compression (JBIG2).

- **Summary**: Surgical tool detection is a fundamental task for understanding egocentric open surgery videos. However, detecting surgical tools presents significant challenges due to their highly imbalanced class distribution, similar shapes and similar textures, and heavy occlusion. The lack of a comprehensive large-scale dataset compounds these challenges. In this paper, we introduce EgoSurgery-Tool, an extension of the existing EgoSurgery-Phase dataset, which contains real open surgery videos captured using an egocentric camera attached to the surgeon's head, along with phase annotations. EgoSurgery-Tool has been densely annotated with surgical tools and comprises over 49K surgical tool bounding boxes across 15 categories, constituting a large-scale surgical tool detection dataset. EgoSurgery-Tool also provides annotations for hand detection with over 46K hand-bounding boxes, capturing hand-object interactions that are crucial for understanding activities in egocentric open surgery. EgoSurgery-Tool is superior to existing datasets due to its larger scale, greater variety of surgical tools, more annotations, and denser scenes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of EgoSurgery-Tool using nine popular object detectors to assess their effectiveness in both surgical tool and hand detection. The dataset will be released at https://github.com/Fujiry0/EgoSurgery.

- **Summary**: The integrity of the reconstructed human epidermis generated in vitro could be assessed using histological analyses combined with immunohistochemical staining of keratinocyte differentiation markers. Computer-based analysis of scanned tissue saves the expert time and may improve the accuracy of quantification by eliminating interrater reliability issues. However, technical differences during the preparation and capture of stained images and the presence of multiple artifacts may influence the outcome of computational methods. Using a dataset with 598 unannotated images showing cross-sections of in vitro reconstructed human epidermis stained with DAB-based immunohistochemistry reaction to visualize 4 different keratinocyte differentiation marker proteins (filaggrin, keratin 10, Ki67, HSPA2) and counterstained with hematoxylin, we developed an unsupervised method for the detection and quantification of immunohistochemical staining. The proposed pipeline includes the following steps: (i) color normalization to reduce the variability of pixel intensity values in different samples; (ii) color deconvolution to acquire color channels of the stains used; (iii) morphological operations to find the background area of the image; (iv) automatic image rotation; and (v) finding markers of human epidermal differentiation with clustering. Also, we created a method to exclude images without DAB-stained areas. The most effective combination of methods includes: (i) Reinhard's normalization; (ii) Ruifrok and Johnston color deconvolution method; (iii) proposed image rotation method based on boundary distribution of image intensity; (iv) k-means clustering using DAB stain intensity. These results should enhance the performance of quantitative analysis of protein markers in reconstructed human epidermis samples and enable comparison of their spatial distribution between different experimental conditions.

- **Summary**: 3D lane detection and topology reasoning are essential tasks in autonomous driving scenarios, requiring not only detecting the accurate 3D coordinates on lane lines, but also reasoning the relationship between lanes and traffic elements. Current vision-based methods, whether explicitly constructing BEV features or not, all establish the lane anchors/queries in 3D space while ignoring the 2D lane priors. In this study, we propose Topo2D, a novel framework based on Transformer, leveraging 2D lane instances to initialize 3D queries and 3D positional embeddings. Furthermore, we explicitly incorporate 2D lane features into the recognition of topology relationships among lane centerlines and between lane centerlines and traffic elements. Topo2D achieves 44.5% OLS on multi-view topology reasoning benchmark OpenLane-V2 and 62.6% F-Socre on single-view 3D lane detection benchmark OpenLane, exceeding the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have become a promising paradigm when developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications. However, DNN applications are vulnerable to fake data that are crafted with adversarial attack algorithms. Under adversarial attacks, the prediction accuracy of DNN applications suffers, making them unreliable. In order to defend against adversarial attacks, we introduce a novel noise-reduction procedure, Vector Quantization U-Net (VQUNet), to reduce adversarial noise and reconstruct data with high fidelity. VQUNet features a discrete latent representation learning through a multi-scale hierarchical structure for both noise reduction and data reconstruction. The empirical experiments show that the proposed VQUNet provides better robustness to the target DNN models, and it outperforms other state-of-the-art noise-reduction-based defense methods under various adversarial attacks for both Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. When there is no adversarial attack, the defense method has less than 1% accuracy degradation for both datasets.

- **Summary**: Vision-based autonomous driving requires reliable and efficient object detection. This work proposes a DiffusionDet-based framework that exploits data fusion from the monocular camera and depth sensor to provide the RGB and depth (RGB-D) data. Within this framework, ground truth bounding boxes are randomly reshaped as part of the training phase, allowing the model to learn the reverse diffusion process of noise addition. The system methodically enhances a randomly generated set of boxes at the inference stage, guiding them toward accurate final detections. By integrating the textural and color features from RGB images with the spatial depth information from the LiDAR sensors, the proposed framework employs a feature fusion that substantially enhances object detection of automotive targets. The $2.3$ AP gain in detecting automotive targets is achieved through comprehensive experiments using the KITTI dataset. Specifically, the improved performance of the proposed approach in detecting small objects is demonstrated.

- **Summary**: Adversarial purification is a kind of defense technique that can defend various unseen adversarial attacks without modifying the victim classifier. Existing methods often depend on external generative models or cooperation between auxiliary functions and victim classifiers. However, retraining generative models, auxiliary functions, or victim classifiers relies on the domain of the fine-tuned dataset and is computation-consuming. In this work, we suppose that adversarial images are outliers of the natural image manifold and the purification process can be considered as returning them to this manifold. Following this assumption, we present a simple adversarial purification method without further training to purify adversarial images, called ZeroPur. ZeroPur contains two steps: given an adversarial example, Guided Shift obtains the shifted embedding of the adversarial example by the guidance of its blurred counterparts; after that, Adaptive Projection constructs a directional vector by this shifted embedding to provide momentum, projecting adversarial images onto the manifold adaptively. ZeroPur is independent of external models and requires no retraining of victim classifiers or auxiliary functions, relying solely on victim classifiers themselves to achieve purification. Extensive experiments on three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K) using various classifier architectures (ResNet, WideResNet) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art robust performance. The code will be publicly available.



### Tiny models from tiny data: Textual and null-text inversion for few-shot distillation

- **Summary**: Few-shot image classification involves classifying images using very few training examples. Recent vision foundation models show excellent few-shot transfer abilities, but are large and slow at inference. Using knowledge distillation, the capabilities of high-performing but slow models can be transferred to tiny, efficient models. However, common distillation methods require a large set of unlabeled data, which is not available in the few-shot setting. To overcome this lack of data, there has been a recent interest in using synthetic data.   We expand on this work by presenting a novel diffusion model inversion technique (TINT) combining the diversity of textual inversion with the specificity of null-text inversion. Using this method in a few-shot distillation pipeline leads to state-of-the-art accuracy among small student models on popular benchmarks, while being significantly faster than prior work. This allows us to push even tiny models to high accuracy using only a tiny application-specific dataset, albeit relying on extra data for pre-training.   Popular few-shot benchmarks involve evaluation over a large number of episodes, which is computationally cumbersome for methods involving synthetic data generation. Therefore, we also present a theoretical analysis on how the variance of the accuracy estimator depends on the number of episodes and query examples, and use these results to lower the computational effort required for method evaluation. In addition, to further motivate the use of generative models in few-shot distillation, we demonstrate that our method performs better compared to training on real data mined from the dataset used to train the diffusion model.

- **Summary**: Visual reprogramming (VR) is a prompting technique that aims to re-purpose a pre-trained model (e.g., a classifier on ImageNet) to target tasks (e.g., medical data prediction) by learning a small-scale pattern added into input images instead of tuning considerable parameters within the model. The location of the pattern within input samples is usually determined by a pre-defined mask shared across all samples. In this paper, we show that the shared mask potentially limits VR's generalization and increases its approximation error due to the lack of sample-level adaptation. Motivated by this finding, we design a new framework for VR called sample-specific multi-channel masks (SMM). Specifically, SMM employs a lightweight ConvNet and patch-wise interpolation to generate sample-specific three-channel masks instead of a shared and pre-defined mask. Since we generate different masks for individual samples, SMM is theoretically shown to reduce approximation error for the target tasks compared with existing state-of-the-art VR methods. We also empirically demonstrate its performance gain on both ResNet and ViT. The success of SMM further highlights the broader applicability of VR in leveraging the latent knowledge of pre-trained models for various target tasks.

- **Summary**: This thesis aims to investigate the feasibility of knowledge transfer between neural networks for medical image segmentation tasks, specifically focusing on the transfer from a larger multi-task "Teacher" network to a smaller "Student" network. In the context of medical imaging, where the data volumes are often limited, leveraging knowledge from a larger pre-trained network could be useful. The primary objective is to enhance the performance of a smaller student model by incorporating knowledge representations acquired by a teacher model that adopts a multi-task pre-trained architecture trained on CT images, to a more resource-efficient student network, which can essentially be a smaller version of the same, trained on a mere 50% of the data than that of the teacher model.   To facilitate knowledge transfer between the two models, we devised an architecture incorporating multi-scale feature distillation and supervised contrastive learning. Our study aims to improve the student model's performance by integrating knowledge representations from the teacher model. We investigate whether this approach is particularly effective in scenarios with limited computational resources and limited training data availability. To assess the impact of multi-scale feature distillation, we conducted extensive experiments. We also conducted a detailed ablation study to determine whether it is essential to distil knowledge at various scales, including low-level features from encoder layers, for effective knowledge transfer. In addition, we examine different losses in the knowledge distillation process to gain insights into their effects on overall performance.

Existing works are not well suited for applications like mixed-reality or closed-loop simulation due to their limited visual quality and non-interactive rendering speeds. Recently, rasterization-based approaches have achieved high-quality NVS at impressive speeds. However, these methods are limited to small-scale, homogeneous data, i.e. they cannot handle severe appearance and geometry variations due to weather, season, and lighting and do not scale to larger, dynamic areas with thousands of images. We propose 4DGF, a neural scene representation that scales to large-scale dynamic urban areas, handles heterogeneous input data, and substantially improves rendering speeds. We use 3D Gaussians as an efficient geometry scaffold while relying on neural fields as a compact and flexible appearance model. We integrate scene dynamics via a scene graph at global scale while modeling articulated motions on a local level via deformations. This decomposed approach enables flexible scene composition suitable for real-world applications. In experiments, we surpass the state-of-the-art by over 3 dB in PSNR and more than 200 times in rendering speed.

- **Summary**: Prohibited Item detection in X-ray images is one of the most effective security inspection methods.However, differing from natural light images, the unique overlapping phenomena in X-ray images lead to the coupling of foreground and background features, thereby lowering the accuracy of general object detectors.Therefore, we propose a Multi-Class Min-Margin Contrastive Learning (MMCL) method that, by clarifying the category semantic information of content queries under the deformable DETR architecture, aids the model in extracting specific category foreground information from coupled features.Specifically, after grouping content queries by the number of categories, we employ the Multi-Class Inter-Class Exclusion (MIE) loss to push apart content queries from different groups. Concurrently, the Intra-Class Min-Margin Clustering (IMC) loss is utilized to attract content queries within the same group, while ensuring the preservation of necessary disparity. As training, the inherent Hungarian matching of the model progressively strengthens the alignment between each group of queries and the semantic features of their corresponding category of objects. This evolving coherence ensures a deep-seated grasp of category characteristics, consequently bolstering the anti-overlapping detection capabilities of models.MMCL is versatile and can be easily plugged into any deformable DETR-based model with dozens of lines of code. Extensive experiments on the PIXray and OPIXray datasets demonstrate that MMCL significantly enhances the performance of various state-of-the-art models without increasing complexity. The code has been released at https://github.com/anonymity0403/MMCL.

- **Summary**: Eye tracking is crucial for human-computer interaction in different domains. Conventional cameras encounter challenges such as power consumption and image quality during different eye movements, prompting the need for advanced solutions with ultra-fast, low-power, and accurate eye trackers. Event cameras, fundamentally designed to capture information about moving objects, exhibit low power consumption and high temporal resolution. This positions them as an alternative to traditional cameras in the realm of eye tracking. Nevertheless, existing event-based eye tracking networks neglect the pivotal sparse and fine-grained temporal information in events, resulting in unsatisfactory performance. Moreover, the energy-efficient features are further compromised by the use of excessively complex models, hindering efficient deployment on edge devices. In this paper, we utilize Point Cloud as the event representation to harness the high temporal resolution and sparse characteristics of events in eye tracking tasks. We rethink the point-based architecture PEPNet with preprocessing the long-term relationships between samples, leading to the innovative design of FAPNet. A frequency adaptive mechanism is designed to realize adaptive tracking according to the speed of the pupil movement and the Inter Sample LSTM module is introduced to utilize the temporal correlation between samples. In the Event-based Eye Tracking Challenge, we utilize vanilla PEPNet, which is the former work to achieve the $p_{10}$ accuracy of 97.95\%. On the SEET synthetic dataset, FAPNet can achieve state-of-the-art while consuming merely 10\% of the PEPNet's computational resources. Notably, the computational demand of FAPNet is independent of the sensor's spatial resolution, enhancing its applicability on resource-limited edge devices.

- **Summary**: Computing an optimal cycle in a given homology class, also referred to as the homology localization problem, is known to be an NP-hard problem in general. Furthermore, there is currently no known optimality criterion that localizes classes geometrically and admits a stability property under the setting of persistent homology. We present a geometric optimization of the cycles that is computable in polynomial time and is stable in an approximate sense. Tailoring our search criterion to different settings, we obtain various optimization problems like optimal homologous cycle, minimum homology basis, and minimum persistent homology basis. In practice, the (trivial) exact algorithm is computationally expensive despite having a worst case polynomial runtime. Therefore, we design approximation algorithms for the above problems and study their performance experimentally. These algorithms have reasonable runtimes for moderate sized datasets and the cycles computed by these algorithms are consistently of high quality as demonstrated via experiments on multiple datasets.

- **Summary**: Existing single image-to-3D creation methods typically involve a two-stage process, first generating multi-view images, and then using these images for 3D reconstruction. However, training these two stages separately leads to significant data bias in the inference phase, thus affecting the quality of reconstructed results. We introduce a unified 3D generation framework, named Ouroboros3D, which integrates diffusion-based multi-view image generation and 3D reconstruction into a recursive diffusion process. In our framework, these two modules are jointly trained through a self-conditioning mechanism, allowing them to adapt to each other's characteristics for robust inference. During the multi-view denoising process, the multi-view diffusion model uses the 3D-aware maps rendered by the reconstruction module at the previous timestep as additional conditions. The recursive diffusion framework with 3D-aware feedback unites the entire process and improves geometric consistency.Experiments show that our framework outperforms separation of these two stages and existing methods that combine them at the inference phase.

- **Summary**: We introduce Situation Monitor, a novel zero-shot Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection approach for transformer-based object detection models to enhance reliability in safety-critical machine learning applications such as autonomous driving. The Situation Monitor utilizes the Diversity-based Budding Ensemble Architecture (DBEA) and increases the OOD performance by integrating a diversity loss into the training process on top of the budding ensemble architecture, detecting Far-OOD samples and minimizing false positives on Near-OOD samples. Moreover, utilizing the resulting DBEA increases the model's OOD performance and improves the calibration of confidence scores, particularly concerning the intersection over union of the detected objects. The DBEA model achieves these advancements with a 14% reduction in trainable parameters compared to the vanilla model. This signifies a substantial improvement in efficiency without compromising the model's ability to detect OOD instances and calibrate the confidence scores accurately.

- **Summary**: The order in which the trajectory is executed is a powerful source of information for recognizers. However, there is still no general approach for recovering the trajectory of complex and long handwriting from static images. Complex specimens can result in multiple pen-downs and in a high number of trajectory crossings yielding agglomerations of pixels (also known as clusters). While the scientific literature describes a wide range of approaches for recovering the writing order in handwriting, these approaches nevertheless lack a common evaluation metric. In this paper, we introduce a new system to estimate the order recovery of thinned static trajectories, which allows to effectively resolve the clusters and select the order of the executed pen-downs. We evaluate how knowing the starting points of the pen-downs affects the quality of the recovered writing. Once the stability and sensitivity of the system is analyzed, we describe a series of experiments with three publicly available databases, showing competitive results in all cases. We expect the proposed system, whose code is made publicly available to the research community, to reduce potential confusion when the order of complex trajectories are recovered, and this will in turn make the trajectories recovered to be viable for further applications, such as velocity estimation.

- **Summary**: The conservation of stone-based cultural heritage sites is a critical concern for preserving cultural and historical landmarks. With the advent of Large Multimodal Models, as GPT-4omni (OpenAI), Claude 3 Opus (Anthropic) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (Google), it is becoming increasingly important to define the operational capabilities of these models. In this work, we systematically evaluate the abilities of the main foundational multimodal models to recognise and classify anomalies and deterioration patterns of the stone elements that are useful in the practice of conservation and restoration of world heritage. After defining a taxonomy of the main stone deterioration patterns and anomalies, we asked the foundational models to identify a curated selection of 354 highly representative images of stone-built heritage, offering them a careful selection of labels to choose from. The result, which varies depending on the type of pattern, allowed us to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these models in the field of heritage conservation and restoration.

- **Summary**: Significant advancements in video diffusion models have brought substantial progress to the field of text-to-video (T2V) synthesis. However, existing T2V synthesis model struggle to accurately generate complex motion dynamics, leading to a reduction in video realism. One possible solution is to collect massive data and train the model on it, but this would be extremely expensive. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we reformulate the typical T2V generation process as a search-based generation pipeline. Instead of scaling up the model training, we employ existing videos as the motion prior database. Specifically, we divide T2V generation process into two steps: (i) For a given prompt input, we search existing text-video datasets to find videos with text labels that closely match the prompt motions. We propose a tailored search algorithm that emphasizes object motion features. (ii) Retrieved videos are processed and distilled into motion priors to fine-tune a pre-trained base T2V model, followed by generating desired videos using input prompt. By utilizing the priors gleaned from the searched videos, we enhance the realism of the generated videos' motion. All operations can be finished on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. We validate our method against state-of-the-art T2V models across diverse prompt inputs. The code will be public.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation is a relevant problem, with deep learning being an exponent. However, the necessity of a high volume of fully annotated images for training massive models can be a problem, especially for applications whose images present a great diversity, such as brain tumors, which can occur in different sizes and shapes. In contrast, a recent methodology, Feature Learning from Image Markers (FLIM), has involved an expert in the learning loop, producing small networks that require few images to train the convolutional layers. In this work, We employ an interactive method for image selection and training based on FLIM, exploring the user's knowledge. The results demonstrated that with our methodology, we could choose a small set of images to train the encoder of a U-shaped network, obtaining performance equal to manual selection and even surpassing the same U-shaped network trained with backpropagation and all training images.

- **Summary**: As transformer-based object detection models progress, their impact in critical sectors like autonomous vehicles and aviation is expected to grow. Soft errors causing bit flips during inference have significantly impacted DNN performance, altering predictions. Traditional range restriction solutions for CNNs fall short for transformers. This study introduces the Global Clipper and Global Hybrid Clipper, effective mitigation strategies specifically designed for transformer-based models. It significantly enhances their resilience to soft errors and reduces faulty inferences to ~ 0\%. We also detail extensive testing across over 64 scenarios involving two transformer models (DINO-DETR and Lite-DETR) and two CNN models (YOLOv3 and SSD) using three datasets, totalling approximately 3.3 million inferences, to assess model robustness comprehensively. Moreover, the paper explores unique aspects of attention blocks in transformers and their operational differences from CNNs.

- **Summary**: In High Energy Physics simulations play a crucial role in unraveling the complexities of particle collision experiments within CERN's Large Hadron Collider. Machine learning simulation methods have garnered attention as promising alternatives to traditional approaches. While existing methods mainly employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), recent advancements highlight the efficacy of diffusion models as state-of-the-art generative machine learning methods. We present the first simulation for Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) at the ALICE experiment based on diffusion models, achieving the highest fidelity compared to existing baselines. We perform an analysis of trade-offs between generation times and the simulation quality. The results indicate a significant potential of latent diffusion model due to its rapid generation time.

- **Summary**: Overfitting in RL has become one of the main obstacles to applications in reinforcement learning(RL). Existing methods do not provide explicit semantic constrain for the feature extractor, hindering the agent from learning a unified cross-domain representation and resulting in performance degradation on unseen domains. Besides, abundant data from multiple domains are needed. To address these issues, in this work, we propose prompt-based visual alignment (PVA), a robust framework to mitigate the detrimental domain bias in the image for zero-shot policy transfer. Inspired that Visual-Language Model (VLM) can serve as a bridge to connect both text space and image space, we leverage the semantic information contained in a text sequence as an explicit constraint to train a visual aligner. Thus, the visual aligner can map images from multiple domains to a unified domain and achieve good generalization performance. To better depict semantic information, prompt tuning is applied to learn a sequence of learnable tokens. With explicit constraints of semantic information, PVA can learn unified cross-domain representation under limited access to cross-domain data and achieves great zero-shot generalization ability in unseen domains. We verify PVA on a vision-based autonomous driving task with CARLA simulator. Experiments show that the agent generalizes well on unseen domains under limited access to multi-domain data.

- **Summary**: Visual anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous regions in images through unsupervised learning paradigms, with increasing application demand and value in fields such as industrial inspection and medical lesion detection. Despite significant progress in recent years, there is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks to adequately evaluate the performance of various mainstream methods across different datasets under the practical multi-class setting. The absence of standardized experimental setups can lead to potential biases in training epochs, resolution, and metric results, resulting in erroneous conclusions. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a comprehensive visual anomaly detection benchmark, \textbf{\textit{ADer}}, which is a modular framework that is highly extensible for new methods. The benchmark includes multiple datasets from industrial and medical domains, implementing fifteen state-of-the-art methods and nine comprehensive metrics. Additionally, we have open-sourced the GPU-assisted \href{https://pypi.org/project/ADEval}{ADEval} package to address the slow evaluation problem of metrics like time-consuming mAU-PRO on large-scale data, significantly reducing evaluation time by more than \textit{1000-fold}. Through extensive experimental results, we objectively reveal the strengths and weaknesses of different methods and provide insights into the challenges and future directions of multi-class visual anomaly detection. We hope that \textbf{\textit{ADer}} will become a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field, promoting the development of more robust and generalizable anomaly detection systems.

- **Summary**: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner-workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The current reliance on statistical Monte-Carlo simulations strains CERN's computational grid, underscoring the urgency for more efficient alternatives. Addressing these challenges, recent proposals advocate for generative machine learning methods. In this study, we present an innovative deep learning simulation approach tailored for the proton Zero Degree Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Leveraging a Generative Adversarial Network model with Selective Diversity Increase loss, we directly simulate calorimeter responses. To enhance its capabilities in modeling a broad range of calorimeter response intensities, we expand the SDI-GAN architecture with additional regularization. Moreover, to improve the spatial fidelity of the generated data, we introduce an auxiliary regressor network. Our method offers a significant speedup when comparing to the traditional Monte-Carlo based approaches.

- **Summary**: Image copy-move is an operation that replaces one part of the image with another part of the same image, which can be used for illegal purposes due to the potential semantic changes. Recent studies have shown that keypoint-based algorithms achieved excellent and robust localization performance even when small or smooth tampered areas were involved. However, when the input image is low-resolution, most existing keypoint-based algorithms are difficult to generate sufficient keypoints, resulting in more missed detections. In addition, existing algorithms are usually unable to distinguish between Similar but Genuine Objects (SGO) images and tampered images, resulting in more false alarms. This is mainly due to the lack of further verification of local homography matrix in forgery localization stage. To tackle these problems, this paper firstly proposes an excessive keypoint extraction strategy to overcome missed detection. Subsequently, a group matching algorithm is used to speed up the matching of excessive keypoints. Finally, a new iterative forgery localization algorithm is introduced to quickly form pixel-level localization results while ensuring a lower false alarm. Extensive experimental results show that our scheme has superior performance than state-of-the-art algorithms in overcoming missed detection and false alarm.

- **Summary**: Current datasets for vehicular applications are mostly collected in North America or Europe. Models trained or evaluated on these datasets might suffer from geographical bias when deployed in other regions. Specifically, for scene classification, a highway in a Latin American country differs drastically from an Autobahn, for example, both in design and maintenance levels. We propose VWise, a novel benchmark for road-type classification and scene classification tasks, in addition to tasks focused on external contexts related to vehicular applications in LatAm. We collected over 520 video clips covering diverse urban and rural environments across Latin American countries, annotated with six classes of road types. We also evaluated several state-of-the-art classification models in baseline experiments, obtaining over 84% accuracy. With this dataset, we aim to enhance research on vehicular tasks in Latin America.

- **Summary**: Large-scale diffusion models have achieved remarkable performance in generative tasks. Beyond their initial training applications, these models have proven their ability to function as versatile plug-and-play priors. For instance, 2D diffusion models can serve as loss functions to optimize 3D implicit models. Rectified flow, a novel class of generative models, enforces a linear progression from the source to the target distribution and has demonstrated superior performance across various domains. Compared to diffusion-based methods, rectified flow approaches surpass in terms of generation quality and efficiency, requiring fewer inference steps. In this work, we present theoretical and experimental evidence demonstrating that rectified flow based methods offer similar functionalities to diffusion models - they can also serve as effective priors. Besides the generative capabilities of diffusion priors, motivated by the unique time-symmetry properties of rectified flow models, a variant of our method can additionally perform image inversion. Experimentally, our rectified flow-based priors outperform their diffusion counterparts - the SDS and VSD losses - in text-to-3D generation.

- **Summary**: Point cloud registration is a prerequisite for many applications in computer vision and robotics. Most existing methods focus on pairwise registration of two point clouds with high overlap. Although there have been some methods for low overlap cases, they struggle in degraded scenarios. This paper introduces a novel framework named L-PR, designed to register unordered low overlap multiview point clouds leveraging LiDAR fiducial markers. We refer to them as LiDAR fiducial markers, but they are the same as the popular AprilTag and ArUco markers, thin sheets of paper that do not affect the 3D geometry of the environment. We first propose an improved adaptive threshold marker detection method to provide robust detection results when the viewpoints among point clouds change dramatically. Then, we formulate the unordered multiview point cloud registration problem as a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) problem and develop a framework consisting of two levels of graphs to address it. The first-level graph, constructed as a weighted graph, is designed to efficiently and optimally infer initial values of scan poses from the unordered set. The second-level graph is constructed as a factor graph. By globally optimizing the variables on the graph, including scan poses, marker poses, and marker corner positions, we tackle the MAP problem. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superiority over competitors in four aspects: registration accuracy, instance reconstruction quality, localization accuracy, and robustness to the degraded scene. To benefit the community, we open-source our method and dataset at https://github.com/yorklyb/LiDAR-SFM.

- **Summary**: Visual prompting infuses visual information into the input image to adapt models toward specific predictions and tasks. Recently, manually crafted markers such as red circles are shown to guide the model to attend to a target region on the image. However, these markers only work on models trained with data containing those markers. Moreover, finding these prompts requires guesswork or prior knowledge of the domain on which the model is trained. This work circumvents manual design constraints by proposing to learn the visual prompts for guiding the attention of vision transformers. The learned visual prompt, added to any input image would redirect the attention of the pre-trained vision transformer to its spatial location on the image. Specifically, the prompt is learned in a self-supervised manner without requiring annotations and without fine-tuning the vision transformer. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization-based visual prompting strategy across various pre-trained vision encoders.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is an essential component of medical image analysis research, with recent deep learning algorithms offering out-of-the-box applicability across diverse datasets. Despite these advancements, segmentation failures remain a significant concern for real-world clinical applications, necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmarking framework aimed at evaluating failure detection methodologies within medical image segmentation. Through our analysis, we identify the strengths and limitations of current failure detection metrics, advocating for the risk-coverage analysis as a holistic evaluation approach. Utilizing a collective dataset comprising five public 3D medical image collections, we assess the efficacy of various failure detection strategies under realistic test-time distribution shifts. Our findings highlight the importance of pixel confidence aggregation and we observe superior performance of the pairwise Dice score (Roy et al., 2019) between ensemble predictions, positioning it as a simple and robust baseline for failure detection in medical image segmentation. To promote ongoing research, we make the benchmarking framework available to the community.

- **Summary**: We present EngineBench, the first machine learning (ML) oriented database to use high quality experimental data for the study of turbulent flows inside combustion machinery. Prior datasets for ML in fluid mechanics are synthetic or use overly simplistic geometries. EngineBench is comprised of real-world particle image velocimetry (PIV) data that captures the turbulent airflow patterns in a specially-designed optical engine. However, in PIV data from internal flows, such as from engines, it is often challenging to achieve a full field of view and large occlusions can be present. In order to design optimal combustion systems, insight into the turbulent flows in these obscured areas is needed, which can be provided via inpainting models. Here we propose a novel inpainting task using random edge gaps, a technique that emphasises realism by introducing occlusions at random sizes and orientations at the edges of the PIV images. We test five ML methods on random edge gaps using pixel-wise, vector-based, and multi-scale performance metrics. We find that UNet-based models are more accurate than the industry-norm non-parametric approach and the context encoder at this task on both small and large gap sizes. The dataset and inpainting task presented in this paper support the development of more general-purpose pre-trained ML models for engine design problems. The method comparisons allow for more informed selection of ML models for problems in experimental flow diagnostics. All data and code are publicly available at https://eng.ox.ac.uk/tpsrg/research/enginebench/.

- **Summary**: Due to the high similarity of disparity between consecutive frames in video sequences, the area where disparity changes is defined as the residual map, which can be calculated. Based on this, we propose RecSM, a network based on residual estimation with a flexible recursive structure for video stereo matching. The RecSM network accelerates stereo matching using a Multi-scale Residual Estimation Module (MREM), which employs the temporal context as a reference and rapidly calculates the disparity for the current frame by computing only the residual values between the current and previous frames. To further reduce the error of estimated disparities, we use the Disparity Optimization Module (DOM) and Temporal Attention Module (TAM) to enforce constraints between each module, and together with MREM, form a flexible Stackable Computation Structure (SCS), which allows for the design of different numbers of SCS based on practical scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that with a stack count of 3, RecSM achieves a 4x speed improvement compared to ACVNet, running at 0.054 seconds based on one NVIDIA RTX 2080TI GPU, with an accuracy decrease of only 0.7%. Code is available at https://github.com/Y0uchenZ/RecSM.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel framework for processing volumetric medical information using Visual Transformers (ViTs). First, We extend the state-of-the-art Swin Transformer model to the 3D medical domain. Second, we propose a new approach for processing volumetric information and encoding position in ViTs for 3D applications. We instantiate the proposed framework and present SuperFormer, a volumetric transformer-based approach for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Super-Resolution. Our method leverages the 3D information of the MRI domain and uses a local self-attention mechanism with a 3D relative positional encoding to recover anatomical details. In addition, our approach takes advantage of multi-domain information from volume and feature domains and fuses them to reconstruct the High-Resolution MRI. We perform an extensive validation on the Human Connectome Project dataset and demonstrate the superiority of volumetric transformers over 3D CNN-based methods.

- **Summary**: Depth maps produced by consumer-grade sensors suffer from inaccurate measurements and missing data from either system or scene-specific sources. Data-driven denoising algorithms can mitigate such problems. However, they require vast amounts of ground truth depth data. Recent research has tackled this limitation using self-supervised learning techniques, but it requires multiple RGB-D sensors. Moreover, most existing approaches focus on denoising single isolated depth maps or specific subjects of interest, highlighting a need for methods to effectively denoise depth maps in real-time dynamic environments. This paper extends state-of-the-art approaches for depth-denoising commodity depth devices, proposing SelfReDepth, a self-supervised deep learning technique for depth restoration, via denoising and hole-filling by inpainting full-depth maps captured with RGB-D sensors. The algorithm targets depth data in video streams, utilizing multiple sequential depth frames coupled with color data to achieve high-quality depth videos with temporal coherence. Finally, SelfReDepth is designed to be compatible with various RGB-D sensors and usable in real-time scenarios as a pre-processing step before applying other depth-dependent algorithms. Our results demonstrate our approach's real-time performance on real-world datasets. They show that it outperforms state-of-the-art denoising and restoration performance at over 30fps on Commercial Depth Cameras, with potential benefits for augmented and mixed-reality applications.

- **Summary**: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a fundamental task in radiotherapy, with existing methods often struggling to balance computational efficiency, registration accuracy, and speed effectively. We introduce a novel DIR approach employing parametric 3D Gaussian control points achieving a better tradeoff. It provides an explicit and flexible representation for spatial deformation fields between 3D volumetric medical images, producing a displacement vector field (DVF) across all volumetric positions. The movement of individual voxels is derived using linear blend skinning (LBS) through localized interpolation of transformations associated with neighboring Gaussians. This interpolation strategy not only simplifies the determination of voxel motions but also acts as an effective regularization technique. Our approach incorporates a unified optimization process through backpropagation, enabling iterative learning of both the parameters of the 3D Gaussians and their transformations. Additionally, the density of Gaussians is adjusted adaptively during the learning phase to accommodate varying degrees of motion complexity. We validated our approach on the 4D-CT lung DIR-Lab and cardiac ACDC datasets, achieving an average target registration error (TRE) of 1.06 mm within a much-improved processing time of 2.43 seconds for the DIR-Lab dataset over existing methods, demonstrating significant advancements in both accuracy and efficiency.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we primarily address the issue of dialogue-form context query within the interactive text-to-image retrieval task. Our methodology, PlugIR, actively utilizes the general instruction-following capability of LLMs in two ways. First, by reformulating the dialogue-form context, we eliminate the necessity of fine-tuning a retrieval model on existing visual dialogue data, thereby enabling the use of any arbitrary black-box model. Second, we construct the LLM questioner to generate non-redundant questions about the attributes of the target image, based on the information of retrieval candidate images in the current context. This approach mitigates the issues of noisiness and redundancy in the generated questions. Beyond our methodology, we propose a novel evaluation metric, Best log Rank Integral (BRI), for a comprehensive assessment of the interactive retrieval system. PlugIR demonstrates superior performance compared to both zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines in various benchmarks. Additionally, the two methodologies comprising PlugIR can be flexibly applied together or separately in various situations. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Saehyung-Lee/PlugIR.

- **Summary**: Computed tomography (CT) is a widely used medical imaging technique to scan internal structures of a body, typically involving collimation and mechanical rotation. Compton scatter tomography (CST) presents an interesting alternative to conventional CT by leveraging Compton physics instead of collimation to gather information from multiple directions. While CST introduces new imaging opportunities with several advantages such as high sensitivity, compactness, and entirely fixed systems, image reconstruction remains an open problem due to the mathematical challenges of CST modeling. In contrast, deep unrolling networks have demonstrated potential in CT image reconstruction, despite their computationally intensive nature. In this study, we investigate the efficiency of unrolling networks for CST image reconstruction. To address the important computational cost required for training, we propose UnWave-Net, a novel unrolled wavelet-based reconstruction network. This architecture includes a non-local regularization term based on wavelets, which captures long-range dependencies within images and emphasizes the multi-scale components of the wavelet transform. We evaluate our approach using a CST of circular geometry which stays completely static during data acquisition, where UnWave-Net facilitates image reconstruction in the absence of a specific reconstruction formula. Our method outperforms existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of SSIM and PSNR, and offers an improved computational efficiency compared to traditional unrolling networks.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces CoFie, a novel local geometry-aware neural surface representation. CoFie is motivated by the theoretical analysis of local SDFs with quadratic approximation. We find that local shapes are highly compressive in an aligned coordinate frame defined by the normal and tangent directions of local shapes. Accordingly, we introduce Coordinate Field, which is a composition of coordinate frames of all local shapes. The Coordinate Field is optimizable and is used to transform the local shapes from the world coordinate frame to the aligned shape coordinate frame. It largely reduces the complexity of local shapes and benefits the learning of MLP-based implicit representations. Moreover, we introduce quadratic layers into the MLP to enhance expressiveness concerning local shape geometry. CoFie is a generalizable surface representation. It is trained on a curated set of 3D shapes and works on novel shape instances during testing. When using the same amount of parameters with prior works, CoFie reduces the shape error by 48% and 56% on novel instances of both training and unseen shape categories. Moreover, CoFie demonstrates comparable performance to prior works when using only 70% fewer parameters.

- **Summary**: Post-hoc explainability methods such as Grad-CAM are popular because they do not influence the performance of a trained model. However, they mainly reveal "where" a model looks at for a given input, fail to explain "what" the model looks for (e.g., what is important to classify a bird image to a Scott Oriole?). Existing part-prototype networks leverage part-prototypes (e.g., characteristic Scott Oriole's wing and head) to answer both "where" and "what", but often under-perform their black box counterparts in the accuracy. Therefore, a natural question is: can one construct a network that answers both "where" and "what" in a post-hoc manner to guarantee the model's performance? To this end, we propose the first post-hoc part-prototype network via decomposing the classification head of a trained model into a set of interpretable part-prototypes. Concretely, we propose an unsupervised prototype discovery and refining strategy to obtain prototypes that can precisely reconstruct the classification head, yet being interpretable. Besides guaranteeing the performance, we show that our network offers more faithful explanations qualitatively and yields even better part-prototypes quantitatively than prior part-prototype networks.

- **Summary**: Sequence modeling plays a vital role across various domains, with recurrent neural networks being historically the predominant method of performing these tasks. However, the emergence of transformers has altered this paradigm due to their superior performance. Built upon these advances, transformers have conjoined CNNs as two leading foundational models for learning visual representations. However, transformers are hindered by the $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ complexity of their attention mechanisms, while CNNs lack global receptive fields and dynamic weight allocation. State Space Models (SSMs), specifically the \textit{\textbf{Mamba}} model with selection mechanisms and hardware-aware architecture, have garnered immense interest lately in sequential modeling and visual representation learning, challenging the dominance of transformers by providing infinite context lengths and offering substantial efficiency maintaining linear complexity in the input sequence. Capitalizing on the advances in computer vision, medical imaging has heralded a new epoch with Mamba models. Intending to help researchers navigate the surge, this survey seeks to offer an encyclopedic review of Mamba models in medical imaging. Specifically, we start with a comprehensive theoretical review forming the basis of SSMs, including Mamba architecture and its alternatives for sequence modeling paradigms in this context. Next, we offer a structured classification of Mamba models in the medical field and introduce a diverse categorization scheme based on their application, imaging modalities, and targeted organs. Finally, we summarize key challenges, discuss different future research directions of the SSMs in the medical domain, and propose several directions to fulfill the demands of this field. In addition, we have compiled the studies discussed in this paper along with their open-source implementations on our GitHub repository.

- **Summary**: To address this challenge, we introduce CattleFace-RGBT, a RGB-T Cattle Facial Landmark dataset consisting of 2,300 RGB-T image pairs, a total of 4,600 images. Creating a landmark dataset is time-consuming, but AI-assisted annotation can help. However, applying AI to thermal images is challenging due to suboptimal results from direct thermal training and infeasible RGB-thermal alignment due to different camera views. Therefore, we opt to transfer models trained on RGB to thermal images and refine them using our AI-assisted annotation tool following a semi-automatic annotation approach. Accurately localizing facial key points on both RGB and thermal images enables us to not only discern the cattle's respiratory signs but also measure temperatures to assess the animal's thermal state. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset for the cattle facial landmark on RGB-T images. We conduct benchmarking of the CattleFace-RGBT dataset across various backbone architectures, with the objective of establishing baselines for future research, analysis, and comparison. The dataset and models are at https://github.com/UARK-AICV/CattleFace-RGBT-benchmark

- **Summary**: Event cameras are advantageous for tasks that require vision sensors with low-latency and sparse output responses. However, the development of deep network algorithms using event cameras has been slow because of the lack of large labelled event camera datasets for network training. This paper reports a method for creating new labelled event datasets by using a text-to-X model, where X is one or multiple output modalities, in the case of this work, events. Our proposed text-to-events model produces synthetic event frames directly from text prompts. It uses an autoencoder which is trained to produce sparse event frames representing event camera outputs. By combining the pretrained autoencoder with a diffusion model architecture, the new text-to-events model is able to generate smooth synthetic event streams of moving objects. The autoencoder was first trained on an event camera dataset of diverse scenes. In the combined training with the diffusion model, the DVS gesture dataset was used. We demonstrate that the model can generate realistic event sequences of human gestures prompted by different text statements. The classification accuracy of the generated sequences, using a classifier trained on the real dataset, ranges between 42% to 92%, depending on the gesture group. The results demonstrate the capability of this method in synthesizing event datasets.

- **Summary**: This paper demonstrates a self-supervised approach for learning semantic video representations. Recent vision studies show that a masking strategy for vision and natural language supervision has contributed to developing transferable visual pretraining. Our goal is to achieve a more semantic video representation by leveraging the text related to the video content during the pretraining in a fully self-supervised manner. To this end, we present FILS, a novel self-supervised video Feature prediction In semantic Language Space (FILS). The vision model can capture valuable structured information by correctly predicting masked feature semantics in language space. It is learned using a patch-wise video-text contrastive strategy, in which the text representations act as prototypes for transforming vision features into a language space, which are then used as targets for semantically meaningful feature prediction using our masked encoder-decoder structure. FILS demonstrates remarkable transferability on downstream action recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art on challenging egocentric datasets, like Epic-Kitchens, Something-SomethingV2, Charades-Ego, and EGTEA, using ViT-Base. Our efficient method requires less computation and smaller batches compared to previous works.

Our approach leverages recent advanced techniques, such as training-effective techniques, e.g., improved loss and pretraining, and interleaved window and global attentions for reducing the ViT encoder complexity. We improve the ViT encoder by aggregating multi-level feature maps, and the intermediate and final feature maps in the ViT encoder, forming richer feature maps, and introduce window-major feature map organization for improving the efficiency of interleaved attention computation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior over existing real-time detectors, e.g., YOLO and its variants, on COCO and other benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Lidar has become a cornerstone sensing modality for 3D vision, especially for large outdoor scenarios and autonomous driving. Conventional lidar sensors are capable of providing centimeter-accurate distance information by emitting laser pulses into a scene and measuring the time-of-flight (ToF) of the reflection. However, the polarization of the received light that depends on the surface orientation and material properties is usually not considered. As such, the polarization modality has the potential to improve scene reconstruction beyond distance measurements. In this work, we introduce a novel long-range polarization wavefront lidar sensor (PolLidar) that modulates the polarization of the emitted and received light. Departing from conventional lidar sensors, PolLidar allows access to the raw time-resolved polarimetric wavefronts. We leverage polarimetric wavefronts to estimate normals, distance, and material properties in outdoor scenarios with a novel learned reconstruction method. To train and evaluate the method, we introduce a simulated and real-world long-range dataset with paired raw lidar data, ground truth distance, and normal maps. We find that the proposed method improves normal and distance reconstruction by 53\% mean angular error and 41\% mean absolute error compared to existing shape-from-polarization (SfP) and ToF methods.

- **Summary**: Due to the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), recent works have focused on employing MLLM-based agents for autonomous driving in large-scale and dynamic environments. However, prevalent approaches often directly translate high-level instructions into low-level vehicle control signals, which deviates from the inherent language generation paradigm of MLLMs and fails to fully harness their emergent powers. As a result, the generalizability of these methods is highly restricted by autonomous driving datasets used during fine-tuning. To tackle this challenge, we propose to connect high-level instructions and low-level control signals with mid-level language-driven commands, which are more fine-grained than high-level instructions but more universal and explainable than control signals, and thus can effectively bridge the gap in between. We implement this idea through a hierarchical multi-agent driving system named AD-H, including a MLLM planner for high-level reasoning and a lightweight controller for low-level execution. The hierarchical design liberates the MLLM from low-level control signal decoding and therefore fully releases their emergent capability in high-level perception, reasoning, and planning. We build a new dataset with action hierarchy annotations. Comprehensive closed-loop evaluations demonstrate several key advantages of our proposed AD-H system. First, AD-H can notably outperform state-of-the-art methods in achieving exceptional driving performance, even exhibiting self-correction capabilities during vehicle operation, a scenario not encountered in the training dataset. Second, AD-H demonstrates superior generalization under long-horizon instructions and novel environmental conditions, significantly surpassing current state-of-the-art methods. We will make our data and code publicly accessible at https://github.com/zhangzaibin/AD-H

- **Summary**: Our review explores the comparative analysis between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) in the domain of image classification, with a particular focus on clothing classification within the e-commerce sector. Utilizing the Fashion MNIST dataset, we delve into the unique attributes of CNNs and ViTs. While CNNs have long been the cornerstone of image classification, ViTs introduce an innovative self-attention mechanism enabling nuanced weighting of different input data components. Historically, transformers have primarily been associated with Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Through a comprehensive examination of existing literature, our aim is to unveil the distinctions between ViTs and CNNs in the context of image classification. Our analysis meticulously scrutinizes state-of-the-art methodologies employing both architectures, striving to identify the factors influencing their performance. These factors encompass dataset characteristics, image dimensions, the number of target classes, hardware infrastructure, and the specific architectures along with their respective top results. Our key goal is to determine the most appropriate architecture between ViT and CNN for classifying images in the Fashion MNIST dataset within the e-commerce industry, while taking into account specific conditions and needs. We highlight the importance of combining these two architectures with different forms to enhance overall performance. By uniting these architectures, we can take advantage of their unique strengths, which may lead to more precise and reliable models for e-commerce applications. CNNs are skilled at recognizing local patterns, while ViTs are effective at grasping overall context, making their combination a promising strategy for boosting image classification performance.
