- **Summary**: Synthetic data generation has gained significant attention recently for its utility in training large vision and language models. However, the application of synthetic data to the training of multimodal context-augmented generation systems has been relatively unexplored. This gap in existing work is important because existing vision and language models (VLMs) are not trained specifically for context-augmented generation. Resources for adapting such models are therefore crucial for enabling their use in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) settings, where a retriever is used to gather relevant information that is then subsequently provided to a generative model via context augmentation. To address this challenging problem, we generate SK-VQA: a large synthetic multimodal dataset containing over 2 million question-answer pairs which require external knowledge to determine the final answer. Our dataset is both larger and significantly more diverse than existing resources of its kind, possessing over 11x more unique questions and containing images from a greater variety of sources than previously-proposed datasets. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our synthetic dataset can not only serve as a challenging benchmark, but is also highly effective for adapting existing generative multimodal models for context-augmented generation.

- **Summary**: Facilitated by the powerful feature extraction ability of neural networks, deep clustering has achieved great success in analyzing high-dimensional and complex real-world data. The performance of deep clustering methods is affected by various factors such as network structures and learning objectives. However, as pointed out in this survey, the essence of deep clustering lies in the incorporation and utilization of prior knowledge, which is largely ignored by existing works. From pioneering deep clustering methods based on data structure assumptions to recent contrastive clustering methods based on data augmentation invariances, the development of deep clustering intrinsically corresponds to the evolution of prior knowledge. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of deep clustering methods by categorizing them into six types of prior knowledge. We find that in general the prior innovation follows two trends, namely, i) from mining to constructing, and ii) from internal to external. Besides, we provide a benchmark on five widely-used datasets and analyze the performance of methods with diverse priors. By providing a novel prior knowledge perspective, we hope this survey could provide some novel insights and inspire future research in the deep clustering community.

- **Summary**: The Video comprises approximately ~85\% of all internet traffic, but video encoding/compression is being historically done with hard coded rules, which has worked well but only to a certain limit. We have seen a surge in video compression algorithms using ML-based models in the last few years and many of them have outperformed several legacy codecs. The models range from encoding video end to end using an ML approach or replacing some intermediate steps in legacy codecs using ML models to increase the efficiency of those steps.   Optimizing video storage is an essential aspect of video processing, so we are proposing one of the possible approaches to achieve it is by avoiding redundant data at each frame. In this paper, we want to introduce the approach of redundancies removal in subsequent frames for a given video as a main approach for video compression. We call this method Redundancy Removal using Shift (R\textsuperscript2S). This method can be utilized across various Machine Learning model algorithms, and make the compression more accessible and adaptable. In this study, we have utilized a computer vision-based pixel point tracking method to identify redundant pixels to encode video for optimal storage.

- **Summary**: The ascension of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in various fields necessitates effective UAV image segmentation, which faces challenges due to the dynamic perspectives of UAV-captured images. Traditional segmentation algorithms falter as they cannot accurately mimic the complexity of UAV perspectives, and the cost of obtaining multi-perspective labeled datasets is prohibitive. To address these issues, we introduce the PPTFormer, a novel \textbf{P}seudo Multi-\textbf{P}erspective \textbf{T}rans\textbf{former} network that revolutionizes UAV image segmentation. Our approach circumvents the need for actual multi-perspective data by creating pseudo perspectives for enhanced multi-perspective learning. The PPTFormer network boasts Perspective Decomposition, novel Perspective Prototypes, and a specialized encoder and decoder that together achieve superior segmentation results through Pseudo Multi-Perspective Attention (PMP Attention) and fusion. Our experiments demonstrate that PPTFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across five UAV segmentation datasets, confirming its capability to effectively simulate UAV flight perspectives and significantly advance segmentation precision. This work presents a pioneering leap in UAV scene understanding and sets a new benchmark for future developments in semantic segmentation.

- **Comment**: Special Mention at the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge 2024
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We propose an approach to simulating trajectories of multiple interacting agents (road users) based on transformers and probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), and apply it to the Waymo SimAgents challenge. The transformer baseline is based on the MTR model, which predicts multiple future trajectories conditioned on the past trajectories and static road layout features. We then improve upon these generated trajectories using a PGM, which contains factors which encode prior knowledge, such as a preference for smooth trajectories, and avoidance of collisions with static obstacles and other moving agents. We perform (approximate) MAP inference in this PGM using the Gauss-Newton method. Finally we sample $K=32$ trajectories for each of the $N \sim 100$ agents for the next $T=8 \Delta$ time steps, where $\Delta=10$ is the sampling rate per second. Following the Model Predictive Control (MPC) paradigm, we only return the first element of our forecasted trajectories at each step, and then we replan, so that the simulation can constantly adapt to its changing environment. We therefore call our approach "Model Predictive Simulation" or MPS. We show that MPS improves upon the MTR baseline, especially in safety critical metrics such as collision rate. Furthermore, our approach is compatible with any underlying forecasting model, and does not require extra training, so we believe it is a valuable contribution to the community.

- **Summary**: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) employs weak supervision, such as image-level labels, to train the segmentation model. Despite the impressive achievement in recent WSSS methods, we identify that introducing weak labels with high mean Intersection of Union (mIoU) does not guarantee high segmentation performance. Existing studies have emphasized the importance of prioritizing precision and reducing noise to improve overall performance. In the same vein, we propose ORANDNet, an advanced ensemble approach tailored for WSSS. ORANDNet combines Class Activation Maps (CAMs) from two different classifiers to increase the precision of pseudo-masks (PMs). To further mitigate small noise in the PMs, we incorporate curriculum learning. This involves training the segmentation model initially with pairs of smaller-sized images and corresponding PMs, gradually transitioning to the original-sized pairs. By combining the original CAMs of ResNet-50 and ViT, we significantly improve the segmentation performance over the single-best model and the naive ensemble model, respectively. We further extend our ensemble method to CAMs from AMN (ResNet-like) and MCTformer (ViT-like) models, achieving performance benefits in advanced WSSS models. It highlights the potential of our ORANDNet as a final add-on module for WSSS models.

- **Journal**: International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2024
- **Summary**: Current Event Stream Super-Resolution (ESR) methods overlook the redundant and complementary information present in positive and negative events within the event stream, employing a direct mixing approach for super-resolution, which may lead to detail loss and inefficiency. To address these issues, we propose an efficient Recursive Multi-Branch Information Fusion Network (RMFNet) that separates positive and negative events for complementary information extraction, followed by mutual supplementation and refinement. Particularly, we introduce Feature Fusion Modules (FFM) and Feature Exchange Modules (FEM). FFM is designed for the fusion of contextual information within neighboring event streams, leveraging the coupling relationship between positive and negative events to alleviate the misleading of noises in the respective branches. FEM efficiently promotes the fusion and exchange of information between positive and negative branches, enabling superior local information enhancement and global information complementation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves over 17% and 31% improvement on synthetic and real datasets, accompanied by a 2.3X acceleration. Furthermore, we evaluate our method on two downstream event-driven applications, \emph{i.e.}, object recognition and video reconstruction, achieving remarkable results that outperform existing methods.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has shown considerable potential in medical image segmentation, primarily leveraging consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling. However, many SSL approaches only pay attention to low-level consistency and overlook the significance of pseudo-label reliability. Therefore, in this work, we propose an adversarial self-training consistency framework (AstMatch). Firstly, we design an adversarial consistency regularization (ACR) approach to enhance knowledge transfer and strengthen prediction consistency under varying perturbation intensities. Second, we apply a feature matching loss for adversarial training to incorporate high-level consistency regularization. Additionally, we present the pyramid channel attention (PCA) and efficient channel and spatial attention (ECSA) modules to improve the discriminator's performance. Finally, we propose an adaptive self-training (AST) approach to ensure the pseudo-labels' quality. The proposed AstMatch has been extensively evaluated with cutting-edge SSL methods on three public-available datasets. The experimental results under different labeled ratios indicate that AstMatch outperforms other existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be available at https://github.com/GuanghaoZhu663/AstMatch.

- **Summary**: Recent deep learning-based object detection approaches have led to significant progress in multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. The current MOT methods mainly focus on pedestrian or vehicle scenes, but basketball sports scenes are usually accompanied by three or more object occlusion problems with similar appearances and high-intensity complex motions, which we call complex multi-object occlusion (CMOO). Here, we propose an online and robust MOT approach, named Basketball-SORT, which focuses on the CMOO problems in basketball videos. To overcome the CMOO problem, instead of using the intersection-over-union-based (IoU-based) approach, we use the trajectories of neighboring frames based on the projected positions of the players. Our method designs the basketball game restriction (BGR) and reacquiring Long-Lost IDs (RLLI) based on the characteristics of basketball scenes, and we also solve the occlusion problem based on the player trajectories and appearance features. Experimental results show that our method achieves a Higher Order Tracking Accuracy (HOTA) score of 63.48$\%$ on the basketball fixed video dataset and outperforms other recent popular approaches. Overall, our approach solved the CMOO problem more effectively than recent MOT algorithms.

- **Summary**: Video instance segmentation requires detecting, segmenting, and tracking objects in videos, typically relying on costly video annotations. This paper introduces a method that eliminates video annotations by utilizing image datasets. The PM-VIS algorithm is adapted to handle both bounding box and instance-level pixel annotations dynamically. We introduce ImageNet-bbox to supplement missing categories in video datasets and propose the PM-VIS+ algorithm to adjust supervision based on annotation types. To enhance accuracy, we use pseudo masks and semi-supervised optimization techniques on unannotated video data. This method achieves high video instance segmentation performance without manual video annotations, offering a cost-effective solution and new perspectives for video instance segmentation applications.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral imaging, capturing detailed spectral information for each pixel, is pivotal in diverse scientific and industrial applications. Yet, the acquisition of high-resolution (HR) hyperspectral images (HSIs) often needs to be addressed due to the hardware limitations of existing imaging systems. A prevalent workaround involves capturing both a high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) and a low-resolution (LR) HSI, subsequently fusing them to yield the desired HR-HSI. Although deep learning-based methods have shown promising in HR-MSI/LR-HSI fusion and LR-HSI super-resolution (SR), their substantial model complexities hinder deployment on resource-constrained imaging devices. This paper introduces a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework for HR-MSI/LR-HSI fusion to achieve SR of LR-HSI. Our KD framework integrates the proposed Cross-Layer Residual Aggregation (CLRA) block to enhance efficiency for constructing Dual Two-Streamed (DTS) network structure, designed to extract joint and distinct features from LR-HSI and HR-MSI simultaneously. To fully exploit the spatial and spectral feature representations of LR-HSI and HR-MSI, we propose a novel Cross Self-Attention (CSA) fusion module to adaptively fuse those features to improve the spatial and spectral quality of the reconstructed HR-HSI. Finally, the proposed KD-based joint loss function is employed to co-train the teacher and student networks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the student model not only achieves comparable or superior LR-HSI SR performance but also significantly reduces the model-size and computational requirements. This marks a substantial advancement over existing state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/ming053l/CSAKD.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) models achieve high-fidelity generation through extensive training on large datasets. However, these models may unintentionally pick up undesirable biases of their training data, such as over-representation of particular identities in gender or ethnicity neutral prompts. Existing alignment methods such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fail to address this problem effectively because they operate on pairwise preferences consisting of individual samples, while the aforementioned biases can only be measured at a population level. For example, a single sample for the prompt "doctor" could be male or female, but a model generating predominantly male doctors even with repeated sampling reflects a gender bias. To address this limitation, we introduce PopAlign, a novel approach for population-level preference optimization, while standard optimization would prefer entire sets of samples over others. We further derive a stochastic lower bound that directly optimizes for individual samples from preferred populations over others for scalable training. Using human evaluation and standard image quality and bias metrics, we show that PopAlign significantly mitigates the bias of pretrained T2I models while largely preserving the generation quality.

- **Summary**: Recently, finger knuckle prints (FKPs) have gained attention due to their rich textural patterns, positioning them as a promising biometric for identity recognition. Prior FKP recognition methods predominantly leverage first-order feature descriptors, which capture intricate texture details but fail to account for structural information. Emerging research, however, indicates that second-order textures, which describe the curves and arcs of the textures, encompass this overlooked structural information. This paper introduces a novel FKP recognition approach, the Dual-Order Texture Competition Network (DOTCNet), designed to capture texture information in FKP images comprehensively. DOTCNet incorporates three dual-order texture competitive modules (DTCMs), each targeting textures at different scales. Each DTCM employs a learnable texture descriptor, specifically a learnable Gabor filter (LGF), to extract texture features. By leveraging LGFs, the network extracts first and second order textures to describe fine textures and structural features thoroughly. Furthermore, an attention mechanism enhances relevant features in the first-order features, thereby highlighting significant texture details. For second-order features, a competitive mechanism emphasizes structural information while reducing noise from higher-order features. Extensive experimental results reveal that DOTCNet significantly outperforms several standard algorithms on the publicly available PolyU-FKP dataset.

- **Summary**: In recent years, generative artificial intelligence has achieved significant advancements in the field of image generation, spawning a variety of applications. However, video generation still faces considerable challenges in various aspects, such as controllability, video length, and richness of details, which hinder the application and popularization of this technology. In this work, we propose a controllable video generation framework, dubbed MimicMotion, which can generate high-quality videos of arbitrary length mimicking specific motion guidance. Compared with previous methods, our approach has several highlights. Firstly, we introduce confidence-aware pose guidance that ensures high frame quality and temporal smoothness. Secondly, we introduce regional loss amplification based on pose confidence, which significantly reduces image distortion. Lastly, for generating long and smooth videos, we propose a progressive latent fusion strategy. By this means, we can produce videos of arbitrary length with acceptable resource consumption. With extensive experiments and user studies, MimicMotion demonstrates significant improvements over previous approaches in various aspects.

- **Summary**: Human-AI collaboration to identify and correct perceptual errors in chest radiographs has not been previously explored. This study aimed to develop a collaborative AI system, CoRaX, which integrates eye gaze data and radiology reports to enhance diagnostic accuracy in chest radiology by pinpointing perceptual errors and refining the decision-making process. Using public datasets REFLACX and EGD-CXR, the study retrospectively developed CoRaX, employing a large multimodal model to analyze image embeddings, eye gaze data, and radiology reports. The system's effectiveness was evaluated based on its referral-making process, the quality of referrals, and performance in collaborative diagnostic settings. CoRaX was tested on a simulated error dataset of 271 samples with 28% (93 of 332) missed abnormalities. The system corrected 21% (71 of 332) of these errors, leaving 7% (22 of 312) unresolved. The Referral-Usefulness score, indicating the accuracy of predicted regions for all true referrals, was 0.63 (95% CI 0.59, 0.68). The Total-Usefulness score, reflecting the diagnostic accuracy of CoRaX's interactions with radiologists, showed that 84% (237 of 280) of these interactions had a score above 0.40. In conclusion, CoRaX efficiently collaborates with radiologists to address perceptual errors across various abnormalities, with potential applications in the education and training of novice radiologists.

- **Summary**: Brain tumors are one of the most common diseases that lead to early death if not diagnosed at an early stage. Traditional diagnostic approaches are extremely time-consuming and prone to errors. In this context, computer vision-based approaches have emerged as an effective tool for accurate brain tumor classification. While some of the existing solutions demonstrate noteworthy accuracy, the models become infeasible to deploy in areas where computational resources are limited. This research addresses the need for accurate and fast classification of brain tumors with a priority of deploying the model in technologically underdeveloped regions. The research presents a novel architecture for precise brain tumor classification fusing pretrained ResNet152V2 and modified VGG16 models. The proposed architecture undergoes a diligent fine-tuning process that ensures fine gradients are preserved in deep neural networks, which are essential for effective brain tumor classification. The proposed solution incorporates various image processing techniques to improve image quality and achieves an astounding accuracy of 98.36% and 98.04% in Figshare and Kaggle datasets respectively. This architecture stands out for having a streamlined profile, with only 2.8 million trainable parameters. We have leveraged 8-bit quantization to produce a model of size 73.881 MB, significantly reducing it from the previous size of 289.45 MB, ensuring smooth deployment in edge devices even in resource-constrained areas. Additionally, the use of Grad-CAM improves the interpretability of the model, offering insightful information regarding its decision-making process. Owing to its high discriminative ability, this model can be a reliable option for accurate brain tumor classification.

- **Summary**: It is fundamentally challenging for robots to serve as useful assistants in human environments because this requires addressing a spectrum of sub-problems across robotics, including perception, language understanding, reasoning, and planning. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their exceptional abilities in solving complex mathematical problems, mastering commonsense and abstract reasoning. This has led to the recent utilization of MLLMs as the brain in robotic systems, enabling these models to conduct high-level planning prior to triggering low-level control actions for task execution. However, it remains uncertain whether existing MLLMs are reliable in serving the brain role of robots. In this study, we introduce the first benchmark for evaluating Multimodal LLM for Robotic (MMRo) benchmark, which tests the capability of MLLMs for robot applications. Specifically, we identify four essential capabilities perception, task planning, visual reasoning, and safety measurement that MLLMs must possess to qualify as the robot's central processing unit. We have developed several scenarios for each capability, resulting in a total of 14 metrics for evaluation. We present experimental results for various MLLMs, including both commercial and open-source models, to assess the performance of existing systems. Our findings indicate that no single model excels in all areas, suggesting that current MLLMs are not yet trustworthy enough to serve as the cognitive core for robots.

- **Summary**: Monocular Human Pose Estimation (HPE) aims at determining the 3D positions of human joints from a single 2D image captured by a camera. However, a single 2D point in the image may correspond to multiple points in 3D space. Typically, the uniqueness of the 2D-3D relationship is approximated using an orthographic or weak-perspective camera model. In this study, instead of relying on approximations, we advocate for utilizing the full perspective camera model. This involves estimating camera parameters and establishing a precise, unambiguous 2D-3D relationship. To do so, we introduce the EPOCH framework, comprising two main components: the pose lifter network (LiftNet) and the pose regressor network (RegNet). LiftNet utilizes the full perspective camera model to precisely estimate the 3D pose in an unsupervised manner. It takes a 2D pose and camera parameters as inputs and produces the corresponding 3D pose estimation. These inputs are obtained from RegNet, which starts from a single image and provides estimates for the 2D pose and camera parameters. RegNet utilizes only 2D pose data as weak supervision. Internally, RegNet predicts a 3D pose, which is then projected to 2D using the estimated camera parameters. This process enables RegNet to establish the unambiguous 2D-3D relationship. Our experiments show that modeling the lifting as an unsupervised task with a camera in-the-loop results in better generalization to unseen data. We obtain state-of-the-art results for the 3D HPE on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets. Our code is available at: [Github link upon acceptance, see supplementary materials].

- **Summary**: This paper introduces MM-Instruct, a large-scale dataset of diverse and high-quality visual instruction data designed to enhance the instruction-following capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). While existing visual instruction datasets often focus on question-answering, they struggle to generalize to broader application scenarios such as creative writing, summarization, or image analysis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to constructing MM-Instruct that leverages the strong instruction-following capabilities of existing LLMs to generate novel visual instruction data from large-scale but conventional image captioning datasets. MM-Instruct first leverages ChatGPT to automatically generate diverse instructions from a small set of seed instructions through augmenting and summarization. It then matches these instructions with images and uses an open-sourced large language model (LLM) to generate coherent answers to the instruction-image pairs. The LLM is grounded by the detailed text descriptions of images in the whole answer generation process to guarantee the alignment of the instruction data. Moreover, we introduce a benchmark based on the generated instruction data to evaluate the instruction-following capabilities of existing LMMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MM-Instruct by training a LLaVA-1.5 model on the generated data, denoted as LLaVA-Instruct, which exhibits significant improvements in instruction-following capabilities compared to LLaVA-1.5 models. The MM-Instruct dataset, benchmark, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/jihaonew/MM-Instruct.

- **Summary**: Automatic vessel segmentation is paramount for developing next-generation interventional navigation systems. However, current approaches suffer from suboptimal segmentation performances due to significant challenges in intraoperative images (i.e., low signal-to-noise ratio, small or slender vessels, and strong interference). In this paper, a novel spatial-frequency learning and topological channel interaction network (SPIRONet) is proposed to address the above issues. Specifically, dual encoders are utilized to comprehensively capture local spatial and global frequency vessel features. Then, a cross-attention fusion module is introduced to effectively fuse spatial and frequency features, thereby enhancing feature discriminability. Furthermore, a topological channel interaction module is designed to filter out task-irrelevant responses based on graph neural networks. Extensive experimental results on several challenging datasets (CADSA, CAXF, DCA1, and XCAD) demonstrate state-of-the-art performances of our method. Moreover, the inference speed of SPIRONet is 21 FPS with a 512x512 input size, surpassing clinical real-time requirements (6~12FPS). These promising outcomes indicate SPIRONet's potential for integration into vascular interventional navigation systems. Code is available at https://github.com/Dxhuang-CASIA/SPIRONet.

- **Summary**: The complex structure of the heart leads to significant challenges in echocardiography, especially in acquisition cardiac ultrasound images. Successful echocardiography requires a thorough understanding of the structures on the two-dimensional plane and the spatial relationships between planes in three-dimensional space. In this paper, we innovatively propose a large-scale self-supervised pre-training method to acquire a cardiac structure-aware world model. The core innovation lies in constructing a self-supervised task that requires structural inference by predicting masked structures on a 2D plane and imagining another plane based on pose transformation in 3D space. To support large-scale pre-training, we collected over 1.36 million echocardiograms from ten standard views, along with their 3D spatial poses. In the downstream probe guidance task, we demonstrate that our pre-trained model consistently reduces guidance errors across the ten most common standard views on the test set with 0.29 million samples from 74 routine clinical scans, indicating that structure-aware pre-training benefits the scanning.

- **Summary**: Generalist segmentation models are increasingly favored for diverse tasks involving various objects from different image sources. Task-Incremental Learning (TIL) offers a privacy-preserving training paradigm using tasks arriving sequentially, instead of gathering them due to strict data sharing policies. However, the task evolution can span a wide scope that involves shifts in both image appearance and segmentation semantics with intricate correlation, causing concurrent appearance and semantic forgetting. To solve this issue, we propose a Comprehensive Generative Replay (CGR) framework that restores appearance and semantic knowledge by synthesizing image-mask pairs to mimic past task data, which focuses on two aspects: modeling image-mask correspondence and promoting scalability for diverse tasks. Specifically, we introduce a novel Bayesian Joint Diffusion (BJD) model for high-quality synthesis of image-mask pairs with their correspondence explicitly preserved by conditional denoising. Furthermore, we develop a Task-Oriented Adapter (TOA) that recalibrates prompt embeddings to modulate the diffusion model, making the data synthesis compatible with different tasks. Experiments on incremental tasks (cardiac, fundus and prostate segmentation) show its clear advantage for alleviating concurrent appearance and semantic forgetting.

- **Summary**: Human activities are inherently complex, and even simple household tasks involve numerous object interactions. To better understand these activities and behaviors, it is crucial to model their dynamic interactions with the environment. The recent availability of affordable head-mounted cameras and egocentric data offers a more accessible and efficient means to understand dynamic human-object interactions in 3D environments. However, most existing methods for human activity modeling either focus on reconstructing 3D models of hand-object or human-scene interactions or on mapping 3D scenes, neglecting dynamic interactions with objects. The few existing solutions often require inputs from multiple sources, including multi-camera setups, depth-sensing cameras, or kinesthetic sensors. To this end, we introduce EgoGaussian, the first method capable of simultaneously reconstructing 3D scenes and dynamically tracking 3D object motion from RGB egocentric input alone. We leverage the uniquely discrete nature of Gaussian Splatting and segment dynamic interactions from the background. Our approach employs a clip-level online learning pipeline that leverages the dynamic nature of human activities, allowing us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the scene in chronological order and track rigid object motion. Additionally, our method automatically segments object and background Gaussians, providing 3D representations for both static scenes and dynamic objects. EgoGaussian outperforms previous NeRF and Dynamic Gaussian methods in challenging in-the-wild videos and we also qualitatively demonstrate the high quality of the reconstructed models.

- **Summary**: The emerging task of fine-grained image classification in low-data regimes assumes the presence of low inter-class variance and large intra-class variation along with a highly limited amount of training samples per class. However, traditional ways of separately dealing with fine-grained categorisation and extremely scarce data may be inefficient under both these harsh conditions presented together. In this paper, we present a novel framework, called AD-Net, aiming to enhance deep neural network performance on this challenge by leveraging the power of Augmentation and Distillation techniques. Specifically, our approach is designed to refine learned features through self-distillation on augmented samples, mitigating harmful overfitting. We conduct comprehensive experiments on popular fine-grained image classification benchmarks where our AD-Net demonstrates consistent improvement over traditional fine-tuning and state-of-the-art low-data techniques. Remarkably, with the smallest data available, our framework shows an outstanding relative accuracy increase of up to 45 % compared to standard ResNet-50 and up to 27 % compared to the closest SOTA runner-up. We emphasise that our approach is practically architecture-independent and adds zero extra cost at inference time. Additionally, we provide an extensive study on the impact of every framework's component, highlighting the importance of each in achieving optimal performance.

- **Summary**: Adversarial attack on skeletal motion is a hot topic. However, existing researches only consider part of dynamic features when measuring distance between skeleton graph sequences, which results in poor imperceptibility. To this end, we propose a novel adversarial attack method to attack action recognizers for skeletal motions. Firstly, our method systematically proposes a dynamic distance function to measure the difference between skeletal motions. Meanwhile, we innovatively introduce emotional features for complementary information. In addition, we use Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers(ADMM) to solve the constrained optimization problem, which generates adversarial samples with better imperceptibility to deceive the classifiers. Experiments show that our method is effective on multiple action classifiers and datasets. When the perturbation magnitude measured by l norms is the same, the dynamic perturbations generated by our method are much lower than that of other methods. What's more, we are the first to prove the effectiveness of emotional features, and provide a new idea for measuring the distance between skeletal motions.

- **Summary**: We present LightStereo, a cutting-edge stereo-matching network crafted to accelerate the matching process. Departing from conventional methodologies that rely on aggregating computationally intensive 4D costs, LightStereo adopts the 3D cost volume as a lightweight alternative. While similar approaches have been explored previously, our breakthrough lies in enhancing performance through a dedicated focus on the channel dimension of the 3D cost volume, where the distribution of matching costs is encapsulated. Our exhaustive exploration has yielded plenty of strategies to amplify the capacity of the pivotal dimension, ensuring both precision and efficiency. We compare the proposed LightStereo with existing state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks, which demonstrate its superior performance in speed, accuracy, and resource utilization. LightStereo achieves a competitive EPE metric in the SceneFlow datasets while demanding a minimum of only 22 GFLOPs, with an inference time of just 17 ms. Our comprehensive analysis reveals the effect of 2D cost aggregation for stereo matching, paving the way for real-world applications of efficient stereo systems.

- **Summary**: 3D multi-object tracking and trajectory prediction are two crucial modules in autonomous driving systems. Generally, the two tasks are handled separately in traditional paradigms and a few methods have started to explore modeling these two tasks in a joint manner recently. However, these approaches suffer from the limitations of single-frame training and inconsistent coordinate representations between tracking and prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose a streaming and unified framework for joint 3D Multi-Object Tracking and trajectory Prediction (StreamMOTP) to address the above challenges. Firstly, we construct the model in a streaming manner and exploit a memory bank to preserve and leverage the long-term latent features for tracked objects more effectively. Secondly, a relative spatio-temporal positional encoding strategy is introduced to bridge the gap of coordinate representations between the two tasks and maintain the pose-invariance for trajectory prediction. Thirdly, we further improve the quality and consistency of predicted trajectories with a dual-stream predictor. We conduct extensive experiments on popular nuSences dataset and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of StreamMOTP, which outperforms previous methods significantly on both tasks. Furthermore, we also prove that the proposed framework has great potential and advantages in actual applications of autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: Motion prediction in soccer involves capturing complex dynamics from player and ball interactions. We present FootBots, an encoder-decoder transformer-based architecture addressing motion prediction and conditioned motion prediction through equivariance properties. FootBots captures temporal and social dynamics using set attention blocks and multi-attention block decoder. Our evaluation utilizes two datasets: a real soccer dataset and a tailored synthetic one. Insights from the synthetic dataset highlight the effectiveness of FootBots' social attention mechanism and the significance of conditioned motion prediction. Empirical results on real soccer data demonstrate that FootBots outperforms baselines in motion prediction and excels in conditioned tasks, such as predicting the players based on the ball position, predicting the offensive (defensive) team based on the ball and the defensive (offensive) team, and predicting the ball position based on all players. Our evaluation connects quantitative and qualitative findings. https://youtu.be/9kaEkfzG3L8

- **Summary**: Understanding long videos, ranging from tens of minutes to several hours, presents unique challenges in video comprehension. Despite the increasing importance of long-form video content, existing benchmarks primarily focus on shorter clips. To address this gap, we introduce InfiniBench a comprehensive benchmark for very long video understanding which presents 1)The longest video duration, averaging 76.34 minutes; 2) The largest number of question-answer pairs, 108.2K; 3) Diversity in questions that examine nine different skills and include both multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions; 4) Humancentric, as the video sources come from movies and daily TV shows, with specific human-level question designs such as Movie Spoiler Questions that require critical thinking and comprehensive understanding. Using InfiniBench, we comprehensively evaluate existing Large MultiModality Models (LMMs) on each skill, including the commercial model Gemini 1.5 Flash and the open-source models. The evaluation shows significant challenges in our benchmark.Our results show that the best AI models such Gemini struggles to perform well with 42.72% average accuracy and 2.71 out of 5 average score. We hope this benchmark will stimulate the LMMs community towards long video and human-level understanding. Our benchmark can be accessed at https://vision-cair.github.io/InfiniBench/

- **Summary**: The count of mitotic figures (MFs) observed in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides is an important prognostic marker as it is a measure for tumor cell proliferation. However, the identification of MFs has a known low inter-rater agreement. Deep learning algorithms can standardize this task, but they require large amounts of annotated data for training and validation. Furthermore, label noise introduced during the annotation process may impede the algorithm's performance. Unlike H&E, the mitosis-specific antibody phospho-histone H3 (PHH3) specifically highlights MFs. Counting MFs on slides stained against PHH3 leads to higher agreement among raters and has therefore recently been used as a ground truth for the annotation of MFs in H&E. However, as PHH3 facilitates the recognition of cells indistinguishable from H&E stain alone, the use of this ground truth could potentially introduce noise into the H&E-related dataset, impacting model performance. This study analyzes the impact of PHH3-assisted MF annotation on inter-rater reliability and object level agreement through an extensive multi-rater experiment. We found that the annotators' object-level agreement increased when using PHH3-assisted labeling. Subsequently, MF detectors were evaluated on the resulting datasets to investigate the influence of PHH3-assisted labeling on the models' performance. Additionally, a novel dual-stain MF detector was developed to investigate the interpretation-shift of PHH3-assisted labels used in H&E, which clearly outperformed single-stain detectors. However, the PHH3-assisted labels did not have a positive effect on solely H&E-based models. The high performance of our dual-input detector reveals an information mismatch between the H&E and PHH3-stained images as the cause of this effect.

- **Summary**: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has gained increasing attention in the study of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). It uses a sparse model to replace the dense model, achieving comparable performance while activating fewer parameters during inference, thus significantly reducing the inference cost. Existing MoE methods in LVLMs encourage different experts to handle different tokens, and thus they employ a router to predict the routing for each token. However, the predictions are based solely on sample features and do not truly reveal the optimization direction of tokens. This can lead to severe optimization conflicts between different tokens within an expert. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel method based on token-level gradient analysis. Specifically, we first use token-level gradients to identify conflicting tokens in experts. Then, we add a specialized loss tailored to eliminate conflicts among tokens within each expert. Our method can serve as a plug-in for diverse Large Vision-Language Models, and extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/longrongyang/STGC.

In this paper, we propose a novel image stitching method using multi-homography warping guided by image segmentation. Specifically, we leverage the Segment Anything Model to segment the target image into numerous contents and partition the feature points into multiple subsets via the energy-based multi-homography fitting algorithm. The multiple subsets of feature points are used to calculate the corresponding multiple homographies. For each segmented content in the overlapping region, we select its best-fitting homography with the lowest photometric error. For each segmented content in the non-overlapping region, we calculate a weighted combination of the linearized homographies. Finally, the target image is warped via the best-fitting homographies to align with the reference image, and the final panorama is generated via linear blending. Comprehensive experimental results on the public datasets demonstrate that our method provides the best alignment accuracy by a large margin, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: As DeepFake video manipulation techniques escalate, posing profound threats, the urgent need to develop efficient detection strategies is underscored. However, one particular issue lies with facial images being mis-detected, often originating from degraded videos or adversarial attacks, leading to unexpected temporal artifacts that can undermine the efficacy of DeepFake video detection techniques. This paper introduces a novel method for robust DeepFake video detection, harnessing the power of the proposed Graph-Regularized Attentive Convolutional Entanglement (GRACE) based on the graph convolutional network with graph Laplacian to address the aforementioned challenges. First, conventional Convolution Neural Networks are deployed to perform spatiotemporal features for the entire video. Then, the spatial and temporal features are mutually entangled by constructing a graph with sparse constraint, enforcing essential features of valid face images in the noisy face sequences remaining, thus augmenting stability and performance for DeepFake video detection. Furthermore, the Graph Laplacian prior is proposed in the graph convolutional network to remove the noise pattern in the feature space to further improve the performance. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to illustrate that our proposed method delivers state-of-the-art performance in DeepFake video detection under noisy face sequences.

- **Summary**: This study evaluates the performance of conventional SyN ANTs and learning-based registration methods in the context of pediatric neuroimaging, specifically focusing on intrasubject deformable registration. The comparison involves three approaches: without (NR), with rigid (RR), and with rigid and affine (RAR) initializations. In addition to initialization, performances are evaluated in terms of accuracy, speed, and the impact of age intervals and sex per pair. Data consists of the publicly available MRI scans from the Calgary Preschool dataset, which includes 63 children aged 2-7 years, allowing for 431 registration pairs. We implemented the unsupervised DL framework with a U-Net architecture using DeepReg and it was 5-fold cross-validated. Evaluation includes Dice scores for tissue segmentation from 18 smaller regions obtained by SynthSeg, analysis of log Jacobian determinants, and registration pro-rated training and inference times. Learning-based approaches, with or without linear initializations, exhibit slight superiority over SyN ANTs in terms of Dice scores. Indeed, DL-based implementations with RR and RAR initializations significantly outperform SyN ANTs. Both SyN ANTs and DL-based registration involve parameter optimization, but the choice between these methods depends on the scale of registration: network-based for broader coverage or SyN ANTs for specific structures. Both methods face challenges with larger age intervals due to greater growth changes. The main takeaway is that while DL-based methods show promise with faster and more accurate registrations, SyN ANTs remains robust and generalizable without the need for extensive training, highlighting the importance of method selection based on specific registration needs in the pediatric context.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown significant potential in assisting medical diagnosis by leveraging extensive biomedical datasets. However, the advancement of medical image understanding and reasoning critically depends on building high-quality visual instruction data, which is costly and labor-intensive to obtain, particularly in the medical domain. To mitigate this data-starving issue, we introduce Self-Training Large Language and Vision Assistant for Medical (STLLaVA-Med). The proposed method is designed to train a policy model (an LVLM) capable of auto-generating medical visual instruction data to improve data efficiency, guided through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Specifically, a more powerful and larger LVLM (e.g., GPT-4o) is involved as a biomedical expert to oversee the DPO fine-tuning process on the auto-generated data, encouraging the policy model to align efficiently with human preferences. We validate the efficacy and data efficiency of STLLaVA-Med across three major medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks, demonstrating competitive zero-shot performance with the utilization of only 9% of the medical data.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we take a new approach to autoregressive image generation that is based on two main ingredients. The first is wavelet image coding, which allows to tokenize the visual details of an image from coarse to fine details by ordering the information starting with the most significant bits of the most significant wavelet coefficients. The second is a variant of a language transformer whose architecture is re-designed and optimized for token sequences in this 'wavelet language'. The transformer learns the significant statistical correlations within a token sequence, which are the manifestations of well-known correlations between the wavelet subbands at various resolutions. We show experimental results with conditioning on the generation process.

- **Summary**: Malaria remains one of the most pressing public health concerns globally, causing significant morbidity and mortality, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and disease management. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as microscopic examination of blood smears, are labor-intensive and require significant expertise, which may not be readily available in resource-limited settings. This project aims to automate the detection of malaria-infected cells using a deep learning approach. We employed a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the ResNet50 architecture, leveraging transfer learning to enhance performance. The Malaria Cell Images Dataset from Kaggle, containing 27,558 images categorized into infected and uninfected cells, was used for training and evaluation. Our model demonstrated high accuracy, precision, and recall, indicating its potential as a reliable tool for assisting in malaria diagnosis. Additionally, a web application was developed using Streamlit to allow users to upload cell images and receive predictions about malaria infection, making the technology accessible and user-friendly. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the methodology, experiments, and results, highlighting the effectiveness of deep learning in medical image analysis.

- **Summary**: The unique complementarity of frame-based and event cameras for high frame rate object tracking has recently inspired some research attempts to develop multi-modal fusion approaches. However, these methods directly fuse both modalities and thus ignore the environmental attributes, e.g., motion blur, illumination variance, occlusion, scale variation, etc. Meanwhile, no interaction between search and template features makes distinguishing target objects and backgrounds difficult. As a result, performance degradation is induced especially in challenging conditions. This paper proposes a novel and effective Transformer-based event-guided tracking framework, called eMoE-Tracker, which achieves new SOTA performance under various conditions. Our key idea is to disentangle the environment into several learnable attributes to dynamically learn the attribute-specific features for better interaction and discriminability between the target information and background. To achieve the goal, we first propose an environmental Mix-of-Experts (eMoE) module that is built upon the environmental Attributes Disentanglement to learn attribute-specific features and environmental Attributes Gating to assemble the attribute-specific features by the learnable attribute scores dynamically. The eMoE module is a subtle router that fine-tunes the transformer backbone more efficiently. We then introduce a contrastive relation modeling (CRM) module to improve interaction and discriminability between the target information and background. Extensive experiments on diverse event-based benchmark datasets showcase the superior performance of our eMoE-Tracker compared to the prior arts.

- **Summary**: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is pivotal for probing the microstructure of the rapidly-developing fetal brain. However, fetal motion during scans and its interaction with magnetic field inhomogeneities result in artifacts and data scattering across spatial and angular domains. The effects of those artifacts are more pronounced in high-angular resolution fetal dMRI, where signal-to-noise ratio is very low. Those effects lead to biased estimates and compromise the consistency and reliability of dMRI analysis. This work presents HAITCH, the first and the only publicly available tool to correct and reconstruct multi-shell high-angular resolution fetal dMRI data. HAITCH offers several technical advances that include a blip-reversed dual-echo acquisition for dynamic distortion correction, advanced motion correction for model-free and robust reconstruction, optimized multi-shell design for enhanced information capture and increased tolerance to motion, and outlier detection for improved reconstruction fidelity. The framework is open-source, flexible, and can be used to process any type of fetal dMRI data including single-echo or single-shell acquisitions, but is most effective when used with multi-shell multi-echo fetal dMRI data that cannot be processed with any of the existing tools. Validation experiments on real fetal dMRI scans demonstrate significant improvements and accurate correction across diverse fetal ages and motion levels. HAITCH successfully removes artifacts and reconstructs high-fidelity fetal dMRI data suitable for advanced diffusion modeling, including fiber orientation distribution function estimation. These advancements pave the way for more reliable analysis of the fetal brain microstructure and tractography under challenging imaging conditions.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a promising technique for 3D reconstruction, offering efficient training and rendering speeds, making it suitable for real-time applications.However, current methods require highly controlled environments (no moving people or wind-blown elements, and consistent lighting) to meet the inter-view consistency assumption of 3DGS. This makes reconstruction of real-world captures problematic. We present SpotlessSplats, an approach that leverages pre-trained and general-purpose features coupled with robust optimization to effectively ignore transient distractors. Our method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality both visually and quantitatively, on casual captures.

- **Summary**: NeRF-based methods reconstruct 3D scenes by building a radiance field with implicit or explicit representations. While NeRF-based methods can perform novel view synthesis (NVS) at arbitrary scale, the performance in high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS) with low-resolution (LR) optimization often results in oversmoothing. On the other hand, single-image super-resolution (SR) aims to enhance LR images to HR counterparts but lacks multi-view consistency. To address these challenges, we propose Arbitrary-Scale Super-Resolution NeRF (ASSR-NeRF), a novel framework for super-resolution novel view synthesis (SRNVS). We propose an attention-based VoxelGridSR model to directly perform 3D super-resolution (SR) on the optimized volume. Our model is trained on diverse scenes to ensure generalizability. For unseen scenes trained with LR views, we then can directly apply our VoxelGridSR to further refine the volume and achieve multi-view consistent SR. We demonstrate quantitative and qualitatively that the proposed method achieves significant performance in SRNVS.

- **Summary**: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has attracted widespread attention for its superior interactive segmentation capabilities with visual prompts while lacking further exploration of text prompts. In this paper, we empirically investigate what text prompt encoders (e.g., CLIP or LLM) are good for adapting SAM for referring expression segmentation and introduce the Early Vision-language Fusion-based SAM (EVF-SAM). EVF-SAM is a simple yet effective referring segmentation method which exploits multimodal prompts (i.e., image and text) and comprises a pre-trained vision-language model to generate referring prompts and a SAM model for segmentation. Surprisingly, we observe that: (1) multimodal prompts and (2) vision-language models with early fusion (e.g., BEIT-3) are beneficial for prompting SAM for accurate referring segmentation. Our experiments show that the proposed EVF-SAM based on BEIT-3 can obtain state-of-the-art performance on RefCOCO/+/g for referring expression segmentation and demonstrate the superiority of prompting SAM with early vision-language fusion. In addition, the proposed EVF-SAM with 1.32B parameters achieves remarkably higher performance while reducing nearly 82% of parameters compared to previous SAM methods based on large multimodal models.

- **Summary**: We introduce HouseCrafter, a novel approach that can lift a floorplan into a complete large 3D indoor scene (e.g., a house). Our key insight is to adapt a 2D diffusion model, which is trained on web-scale images, to generate consistent multi-view color (RGB) and depth (D) images across different locations of the scene. Specifically, the RGB-D images are generated autoregressively in a batch-wise manner along sampled locations based on the floorplan, where previously generated images are used as condition to the diffusion model to produce images at nearby locations. The global floorplan and attention design in the diffusion model ensures the consistency of the generated images, from which a 3D scene can be reconstructed. Through extensive evaluation on the 3D-Front dataset, we demonstrate that HouseCraft can generate high-quality house-scale 3D scenes. Ablation studies also validate the effectiveness of different design choices. We will release our code and model weights. Project page: https://neu-vi.github.io/houseCrafter/

- **Summary**: Existing face forgery detection usually follows the paradigm of training models in a single domain, which leads to limited generalization capacity when unseen scenarios and unknown attacks occur. In this paper, we elaborately investigate the generalization capacity of deepfake detection models when jointly trained on multiple face forgery detection datasets. We first find a rapid degradation of detection accuracy when models are directly trained on combined datasets due to the discrepancy across collection scenarios and generation methods. To address the above issue, a Generalized Multi-Scenario Deepfake Detection framework (GM-DF) is proposed to serve multiple real-world scenarios by a unified model. First, we propose a hybrid expert modeling approach for domain-specific real/forgery feature extraction. Besides, as for the commonality representation, we use CLIP to extract the common features for better aligning visual and textual features across domains. Meanwhile, we introduce a masked image reconstruction mechanism to force models to capture rich forged details. Finally, we supervise the models via a domain-aware meta-learning strategy to further enhance their generalization capacities. Specifically, we design a novel domain alignment loss to strongly align the distributions of the meta-test domains and meta-train domains. Thus, the updated models are able to represent both specific and common real/forgery features across multiple datasets. In consideration of the lack of study of multi-dataset training, we establish a new benchmark leveraging multi-source data to fairly evaluate the models' generalization capacity on unseen scenarios. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments on five datasets conducted on traditional protocols as well as the proposed benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: The Segmentation Anything Model (SAM) requires labor-intensive data labeling. We present Unsupervised SAM (UnSAM) for promptable and automatic whole-image segmentation that does not require human annotations. UnSAM utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy to "discover" the hierarchical structure of visual scenes. We first leverage top-down clustering methods to partition an unlabeled image into instance/semantic level segments. For all pixels within a segment, a bottom-up clustering method is employed to iteratively merge them into larger groups, thereby forming a hierarchical structure. These unsupervised multi-granular masks are then utilized to supervise model training. Evaluated across seven popular datasets, UnSAM achieves competitive results with the supervised counterpart SAM, and surpasses the previous state-of-the-art in unsupervised segmentation by 11% in terms of AR. Moreover, we show that supervised SAM can also benefit from our self-supervised labels. By integrating our unsupervised pseudo masks into SA-1B's ground-truth masks and training UnSAM with only 1% of SA-1B, a lightly semi-supervised UnSAM can often segment entities overlooked by supervised SAM, exceeding SAM's AR by over 6.7% and AP by 3.9% on SA-1B.

- **Summary**: We present PoliFormer (Policy Transformer), an RGB-only indoor navigation agent trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning at scale that generalizes to the real-world without adaptation despite being trained purely in simulation. PoliFormer uses a foundational vision transformer encoder with a causal transformer decoder enabling long-term memory and reasoning. It is trained for hundreds of millions of interactions across diverse environments, leveraging parallelized, multi-machine rollouts for efficient training with high throughput. PoliFormer is a masterful navigator, producing state-of-the-art results across two distinct embodiments, the LoCoBot and Stretch RE-1 robots, and four navigation benchmarks. It breaks through the plateaus of previous work, achieving an unprecedented 85.5% success rate in object goal navigation on the CHORES-S benchmark, a 28.5% absolute improvement. PoliFormer can also be trivially extended to a variety of downstream applications such as object tracking, multi-object navigation, and open-vocabulary navigation with no finetuning.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based models have shown great potential in generating high-quality images with various layouts, which can benefit downstream perception tasks. However, a fully automatic layout generation driven only by language and a suitable metric for measuring multiple generated instances has not been well explored. In this work, we present Auto Cherry-Picker (ACP), a novel framework that generates high-quality multi-modal training examples to augment perception and multi-modal training. Starting with a simple list of natural language concepts, we prompt large language models (LLMs) to generate a detailed description and design reasonable layouts. Next, we use an off-the-shelf text-to-image model to generate multiple images. Then, the generated data are refined using a comprehensively designed metric to ensure quality. In particular, we present a new metric, Composite Layout and Image Score (CLIS), to evaluate the generated images fairly. Our synthetic high-quality examples boost performance in various scenarios by customizing the initial concept list, especially in addressing challenges associated with long-tailed distribution and imbalanced datasets. Experiment results on downstream tasks demonstrate that Auto Cherry-Picker can significantly improve the performance of existing models. In addition, we have thoroughly investigated the correlation between CLIS and performance gains in downstream tasks, and we find that a better CLIS score results in better performance. This finding shows the potential for evaluation metrics as the role for various visual perception and MLLM tasks. Code will be available.

- **Summary**: While significant advancements have been made in compressed representations for text embeddings in large language models (LLMs), the compression of visual tokens in large multi-modal models (LMMs) has remained a largely overlooked area. In this work, we present the study on the analysis of redundancy concerning visual tokens and efficient training within these models. Our initial experiments show that eliminating up to 70% of visual tokens at the testing stage by simply average pooling only leads to a minimal 3% reduction in visual question answering accuracy on the GQA benchmark, indicating significant redundancy in visual context. Addressing this, we introduce Visual Context Compressor, which reduces the number of visual tokens during training to enhance training efficiency without sacrificing performance. To minimize information loss caused by the compression on visual tokens while maintaining training efficiency, we develop LLaVolta as a lite training scheme. LLaVolta incorporates stage-wise visual context compression to progressively compress the visual tokens from heavily to lightly, and finally no compression at the end of training, yielding no loss of information when testing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances the performance of MLLMs in both image-language and video-language understanding, while also significantly cutting training costs.

- **Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with extensive world knowledge and strong reasoning skills can tackle diverse tasks across domains, often by posing them as conversation-style instruction-response pairs. In this paper, we propose LLaRA: Large Language and Robotics Assistant, a framework which formulates robot action policy as conversations, and provides improved responses when trained with auxiliary data that complements policy learning. LLMs with visual inputs, i.e., Vision Language Models (VLMs), have the capacity to process state information as visual-textual prompts and generate optimal policy decisions in text. To train such action policy VLMs, we first introduce an automated pipeline to generate diverse high-quality robotics instruction data from existing behavior cloning data. A VLM finetuned with the resulting collection of datasets based on a conversation-style formulation tailored for robotics tasks, can generate meaningful robot action policy decisions. Our experiments across multiple simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed LLaRA framework.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive success across modalities such as image, video, and audio in a variety of understanding and generation tasks. However, current MLLMs are surprisingly poor at understanding webpage screenshots and generating their corresponding HTML code. To address this problem, we propose Web2Code, a benchmark consisting of a new large-scale webpage-to-code dataset for instruction tuning and an evaluation framework for the webpage understanding and HTML code translation abilities of MLLMs. For dataset construction, we leverage pretrained LLMs to enhance existing webpage-to-code datasets as well as generate a diverse pool of new webpages rendered into images. Specifically, the inputs are webpage images and instructions, while the responses are the webpage's HTML code. We further include diverse natural language QA pairs about the webpage content in the responses to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the web content. To evaluate model performance in these tasks, we develop an evaluation framework for testing MLLMs' abilities in webpage understanding and web-to-code generation. Extensive experiments show that our proposed dataset is beneficial not only to our proposed tasks but also in the general visual domain, while previous datasets result in worse performance. We hope our work will contribute to the development of general MLLMs suitable for web-based content generation and task automation. Our data and code will be available at https://github.com/MBZUAI-LLM/web2code.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel anomaly detection (AD) problem that focuses on identifying `odd-looking' objects relative to the other instances within a scene. Unlike the traditional AD benchmarks, in our setting, anomalies in this context are scene-specific, defined by the regular instances that make up the majority. Since object instances are often partly visible from a single viewpoint, our setting provides multiple views of each scene as input. To provide a testbed for future research in this task, we introduce two benchmarks, ToysAD-8K and PartsAD-15K. We propose a novel method that generates 3D object-centric representations for each instance and detects the anomalous ones through a cross-examination between the instances. We rigorously analyze our method quantitatively and qualitatively in the presented benchmarks.
