- **Summary**: The integration of thermal imaging data with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) constitutes an exciting opportunity for improving the safety and functionality of autonomous driving systems and many Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications. This study investigates whether MLLMs can understand complex images from RGB and thermal cameras and detect objects directly. Our goals were to 1) assess the ability of the MLLM to learn from information from various sets, 2) detect objects and identify elements in thermal cameras, 3) determine whether two independent modality images show the same scene, and 4) learn all objects using different modalities. The findings showed that both GPT-4 and Gemini were effective in detecting and classifying objects in thermal images. Similarly, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for pedestrian classification was 70.39% and 81.48%, respectively. Moreover, the MAPE for bike, car, and motorcycle detection were 78.4%, 55.81%, and 96.15%, respectively. Gemini produced MAPE of 66.53%, 59.35% and 78.18% respectively. This finding further demonstrates that MLLM can identify thermal images and can be employed in advanced imaging automation technologies for ITS applications.

- **Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the capacity of vision-language models to caption visual text. This generative approach to image caption enrichment further makes textual captions more descriptive, improving alignment with the visual context. However, while many studies focus on benefits of generative caption enrichment (GCE), are there any negative side effects? We compare standard-format captions and recent GCE processes from the perspectives of "gender bias" and "hallucination", showing that enriched captions suffer from increased gender bias and hallucination. Furthermore, models trained on these enriched captions amplify gender bias by an average of 30.9% and increase hallucination by 59.5%. This study serves as a caution against the trend of making captions more descriptive.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have leveraged extensive multimodal datasets to enhance capabilities in complex knowledge-driven tasks. However, persistent challenges in perceptual and reasoning errors limit their efficacy, particularly in interpreting intricate visual data and deducing multimodal relationships. Addressing these issues, we introduce a novel dataset format, PIN (Paired and INterleaved multimodal documents), designed to significantly improve both the depth and breadth of multimodal training. The PIN format is built on three foundational principles: knowledge intensity, scalability, and support for diverse training modalities. This innovative format combines markdown files and comprehensive images to enrich training data with a dense knowledge structure and versatile training strategies. We present PIN-14M, an open-source dataset comprising 14 million samples derived from a diverse range of Chinese and English sources, tailored to include complex web and scientific content. This dataset is constructed meticulously to ensure data quality and ethical integrity, aiming to facilitate advanced training strategies and improve model robustness against common multimodal training pitfalls. Our initial results, forming the basis of this technical report, suggest significant potential for the PIN format in refining LMM performance, with plans for future expansions and detailed evaluations of its impact on model capabilities.

- **Summary**: Motion Expression guided Video Segmentation is a challenging task that aims at segmenting objects in the video based on natural language expressions with motion descriptions. Unlike the previous referring video object segmentation (RVOS), this task focuses more on the motion in video content for language-guided video object segmentation, requiring an enhanced ability to model longer temporal, motion-oriented vision-language data. In this report, based on the RVOS methods, we successfully introduce mask information obtained from the video instance segmentation model as preliminary information for temporal enhancement and employ SAM for spatial refinement. Finally, our method achieved a score of 49.92 J &F in the validation phase and 54.20 J &F in the test phase, securing the final ranking of 2nd in the MeViS Track at the CVPR 2024 PVUW Challenge.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel vision-based framework for in-situ trunk identification and length measurement of sea cucumbers, which plays a crucial role in the monitoring of marine ranching resources and mechanized harvesting. To model sea cucumber trunk curves with varying degrees of bending, we utilize the parametric B\'{e}zier curve due to its computational simplicity, stability, and extensive range of transformation possibilities. Then, we propose an end-to-end unified framework that combines parametric B\'{e}zier curve modeling with the widely used You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) pipeline, abbreviated as TISC-Net, and incorporates effective funnel activation and efficient multi-scale attention modules to enhance curve feature perception and learning. Furthermore, we propose incorporating trunk endpoint loss as an additional constraint to effectively mitigate the impact of endpoint deviations on the overall curve. Finally, by utilizing the depth information of pixels located along the trunk curve captured by a binocular camera, we propose accurately estimating the in-situ length of sea cucumbers through space curve integration. We established two challenging benchmark datasets for curve-based in-situ sea cucumber trunk identification. These datasets consist of over 1,000 real-world marine environment images of sea cucumbers, accompanied by B\'{e}zier format annotations. We conduct evaluation on SC-ISTI, for which our method achieves mAP50 above 0.9 on both object detection and trunk identification tasks. Extensive length measurement experiments demonstrate that the average absolute relative error is around 0.15.

- **Summary**: Panoramic X-ray is a simple and effective tool for diagnosing dental diseases in clinical practice. When deep learning models are developed to assist dentist in interpreting panoramic X-rays, most of their performance suffers from the limited annotated data, which requires dentist's expertise and a lot of time cost. Although self-supervised learning (SSL) has been proposed to address this challenge, the two-stage process of pretraining and fine-tuning requires even more training time and computational resources. In this paper, we present a self-supervised auxiliary detection (SSAD) framework, which is plug-and-play and compatible with any detectors. It consists of a reconstruction branch and a detection branch. Both branches are trained simultaneously, sharing the same encoder, without the need for finetuning. The reconstruction branch learns to restore the tooth texture of healthy or diseased teeth, while the detection branch utilizes these learned features for diagnosis. To enhance the encoder's ability to capture fine-grained features, we incorporate the image encoder of SAM to construct a texture consistency (TC) loss, which extracts image embedding from the input and output of reconstruction branch, and then enforces both embedding into the same feature space. Extensive experiments on the public DENTEX dataset through three detection tasks demonstrate that the proposed SSAD framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to mainstream object detection methods and SSL methods.

- **Summary**: Non-contrast CT (NCCT) imaging may reduce image contrast and anatomical visibility, potentially increasing diagnostic uncertainty. In contrast, contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) facilitates the observation of regions of interest (ROI). Leading generative models, especially the conditional diffusion model, demonstrate remarkable capabilities in medical image modality transformation. Typical conditional diffusion models commonly generate images with guidance of segmentation labels for medical modal transformation. Limited access to authentic guidance and its low cardinality can pose challenges to the practical clinical application of conditional diffusion models. To achieve an equilibrium of generative quality and clinical practices, we propose a novel Syncretic generative model based on the latent diffusion model for medical image translation (S$^2$LDM), which can realize high-fidelity reconstruction without demand of additional condition during inference. S$^2$LDM enhances the similarity in distinct modal images via syncretic encoding and diffusing, promoting amalgamated information in the latent space and generating medical images with more details in contrast-enhanced regions. However, syncretic latent spaces in the frequency domain tend to favor lower frequencies, commonly locate in identical anatomic structures. Thus, S$^2$LDM applies adaptive similarity loss and dynamic similarity to guide the generation and supplements the shortfall in high-frequency details throughout the training process. Quantitative experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach in medical image translation. Our code will release lately.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal learning plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Current deep learning based multi-modal approaches are often limited by their abilities to model the complex correlations between genomics and histology data, addressing the intrinsic complexity of tumour ecosystem where both tumour and microenvironment contribute to malignancy. We propose a biologically interpretative and robust multi-modal learning framework to efficiently integrate histology images and genomics by decomposing the feature subspace of histology images and genomics, reflecting distinct tumour and microenvironment features. To enhance cross-modal interactions, we design a knowledge-driven subspace fusion scheme, consisting of a cross-modal deformable attention module and a gene-guided consistency strategy. Additionally, in pursuit of dynamically optimizing the subspace knowledge, we further propose a novel gradient coordination learning strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in three downstream tasks of glioma diagnosis, tumour grading, and survival analysis.

- **Summary**: Image anomaly detection is a popular research direction, with many methods emerging in recent years due to rapid advancements in computing. The use of artificial intelligence for image anomaly detection has been widely studied. By analyzing images of athlete posture and movement, it is possible to predict injury status and suggest necessary adjustments. Most existing methods rely on convolutional networks to extract information from irrelevant pixel data, limiting model accuracy. This paper introduces a network combining Residual Network (ResNet) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), which can predict potential injury types and provide early warnings by analyzing changes in muscle and bone poses from video images. To address the high complexity of this network, the Sparrow search algorithm was used for optimization. Experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrated that our model has the smallest error in image anomaly detection compared to other models, showing strong adaptability. This provides a new approach for anomaly detection and predictive analysis in images, contributing to the sustainable development of human health and performance.

- **Summary**: We introduce a fast Self-adapting Forward-Forward Network (SaFF-Net) for medical imaging analysis, mitigating power consumption and resource limitations, which currently primarily stem from the prevalent reliance on back-propagation for model training and fine-tuning. Building upon the recently proposed Forward-Forward Algorithm (FFA), we introduce the Convolutional Forward-Forward Algorithm (CFFA), a parameter-efficient reformulation that is suitable for advanced image analysis and overcomes the speed and generalisation constraints of the original FFA. To address hyper-parameter sensitivity of FFAs we are also introducing a self-adapting framework SaFF-Net fine-tuning parameters during warmup and training in parallel. Our approach enables more effective model training and eliminates the previously essential requirement for an arbitrarily chosen Goodness function in FFA. We evaluate our approach on several benchmarking datasets in comparison with standard Back-Propagation (BP) neural networks showing that FFA-based networks with notably fewer parameters and function evaluations can compete with standard models, especially, in one-shot scenarios and large batch sizes. The code will be available at the time of the conference.



### Gaze-directed Vision GNN for Mitigating Shortcut Learning in Medical Image

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance in medical image analysis. However, its susceptibility to spurious correlations due to shortcut learning raises concerns about network interpretability and reliability. Furthermore, shortcut learning is exacerbated in medical contexts where disease indicators are often subtle and sparse. In this paper, we propose a novel gaze-directed Vision GNN (called GD-ViG) to leverage the visual patterns of radiologists from gaze as expert knowledge, directing the network toward disease-relevant regions, and thereby mitigating shortcut learning. GD-ViG consists of a gaze map generator (GMG) and a gaze-directed classifier (GDC). Combining the global modelling ability of GNNs with the locality of CNNs, GMG generates the gaze map based on radiologists' visual patterns. Notably, it eliminates the need for real gaze data during inference, enhancing the network's practical applicability. Utilizing gaze as the expert knowledge, the GDC directs the construction of graph structures by incorporating both feature distances and gaze distances, enabling the network to focus on disease-relevant foregrounds. Thereby avoiding shortcut learning and improving the network's interpretability. The experiments on two public medical image datasets demonstrate that GD-ViG outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and effectively mitigates shortcut learning.

- **Summary**: Precise segmentation of medical images is fundamental for extracting critical clinical information, which plays a pivotal role in enhancing the accuracy of diagnoses, formulating effective treatment plans, and improving patient outcomes. Although Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and non-local attention methods have achieved notable success in medical image segmentation, they either struggle to capture long-range spatial dependencies due to their reliance on local features, or face significant computational and feature integration challenges when attempting to address this issue with global attention mechanisms. To overcome existing limitations in medical image segmentation, we propose a novel architecture, Perspective+ Unet. This framework is characterized by three major innovations: (i) It introduces a dual-pathway strategy at the encoder stage that combines the outcomes of traditional and dilated convolutions. This not only maintains the local receptive field but also significantly expands it, enabling better comprehension of the global structure of images while retaining detail sensitivity. (ii) The framework incorporates an efficient non-local transformer block, named ENLTB, which utilizes kernel function approximation for effective long-range dependency capture with linear computational and spatial complexity. (iii) A Spatial Cross-Scale Integrator strategy is employed to merge global dependencies and local contextual cues across model stages, meticulously refining features from various levels to harmonize global and local information. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Perspective+ Unet. The code is available in the supplementary material.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly improve performance in image comprehension tasks, such as formatted charts and rich-content images. Yet, Graphical User Interface (GUI) pose a greater challenge due to their structured format and detailed textual information. Existing LVLMs often overly depend on internal knowledge and neglect image content, resulting in hallucinations and incorrect responses in GUI comprehension. To address these issues, we introduce VGA, a fine-tuned model designed for comprehensive GUI understanding. Our model aims to enhance the interpretation of visual data of GUI and reduce hallucinations. We first construct a Vision Question Answering (VQA) dataset of 63.8k high-quality examples with our propose Referent Method, which ensures the model's responses are highly depend on visual content within the image. We then design a two-stage fine-tuning method called Foundation and Advanced Comprehension (FAC) to enhance both the model's ability to extract information from image content and alignment with human intent. Experiments show that our approach enhances the model's ability to extract information from images and achieves state-of-the-art results in GUI understanding tasks. Our dataset and fine-tuning script will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Dry eye disease is a common disorder of the ocular surface, leading patients to seek eye care. Clinical signs and symptoms are currently used to diagnose dry eye disease. Metabolomics, a method for analyzing biological systems, has been found helpful in identifying distinct metabolites in patients and in detecting metabolic profiles that may indicate dry eye disease at early stages. In this study, we explored using machine learning and metabolomics information to identify which cataract patients suffered from dry eye disease. As there is no one-size-fits-all machine learning model for metabolomics data, choosing the most suitable model can significantly affect the quality of predictions and subsequent metabolomics analyses. To address this challenge, we conducted a comparative analysis of nine machine learning models on three metabolomics data sets from cataract patients with and without dry eye disease. The models were evaluated and optimized using nested k-fold cross-validation. To assess the performance of these models, we selected a set of suitable evaluation metrics tailored to the data set's challenges. The logistic regression model overall performed the best, achieving the highest area under the curve score of 0.8378, balanced accuracy of 0.735, Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.5147, an F1-score of 0.8513, and a specificity of 0.5667. Additionally, following the logistic regression, the XGBoost and Random Forest models also demonstrated good performance.

- **Summary**: Prostate cancer is a highly prevalent cancer and ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men globally. Recently, the utilization of multi-modality transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) has gained significant traction as a valuable technique for guiding prostate biopsies. In this study, we propose a novel learning framework for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) classification using multi-modality TRUS. The proposed framework employs two separate 3D ResNet-50 to extract distinctive features from B-mode and shear wave elastography (SWE). Additionally, an attention module is incorporated to effectively refine B-mode features and aggregate the extracted features from both modalities. Furthermore, we utilize few shot segmentation task to enhance the capacity of classification encoder. Due to the limited availability of csPCa masks, a prototype correction module is employed to extract representative prototypes of csPCa. The performance of the framework is assessed on a large-scale dataset consisting of 512 TRUS videos with biopsy-proved prostate cancer. The results demonstrate the strong capability in accurately identifying csPCa, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86. Moreover, the framework generates visual class activation mapping (CAM), which can serve as valuable assistance for localizing csPCa. These CAM images may offer valuable guidance during TRUS-guided targeted biopsies, enhancing the efficacy of the biopsy procedure.The code is available at https://github.com/2313595986/SmileCode.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral remote sensing (HIS) enables the detailed capture of spectral information from the Earth's surface, facilitating precise classification and identification of surface crops due to its superior spectral diagnostic capabilities. However, current convolutional neural networks (CNNs) focus on local features in hyperspectral data, leading to suboptimal performance when classifying intricate crop types and addressing imbalanced sample distributions. In contrast, the Transformer framework excels at extracting global features from hyperspectral imagery. To leverage the strengths of both approaches, this research introduces the Convolutional Meet Transformer Network (CMTNet). This innovative model includes a spectral-spatial feature extraction module for shallow feature capture, a dual-branch structure combining CNN and Transformer branches for local and global feature extraction, and a multi-output constraint module that enhances classification accuracy through multi-output loss calculations and cross constraints across local, international, and joint features. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets (WHU-Hi-LongKou, WHU-Hi-HanChuan, and WHU-Hi-HongHu) demonstrate that CTDBNet significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art networks in classification performance, validating its effectiveness in hyperspectral crop classification.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in autoregressive networks with linear complexity have driven significant research progress, demonstrating exceptional performance in large language models. A representative model is the Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM), which incorporates gating mechanisms and memory structures, performing comparably to Transformer architectures in long-sequence language tasks. Autoregressive networks such as xLSTM can utilize image serialization to extend their application to visual tasks such as classification and segmentation. Although existing studies have demonstrated Vision-LSTM's impressive results in image classification, its performance in image semantic segmentation remains unverified. Our study represents the first attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of Vision-LSTM in the semantic segmentation of remotely sensed images. This evaluation is based on a specifically designed encoder-decoder architecture named Seg-LSTM, and comparisons with state-of-the-art segmentation networks. Our study found that Vision-LSTM's performance in semantic segmentation was limited and generally inferior to Vision-Transformers-based and Vision-Mamba-based models in most comparative tests. Future research directions for enhancing Vision-LSTM are recommended. The source code is available from https://github.com/zhuqinfeng1999/Seg-LSTM.

- **Summary**: Echocardiography (ECHO) video is widely used for cardiac examination. In clinical, this procedure heavily relies on operator experience, which needs years of training and maybe the assistance of deep learning-based systems for enhanced accuracy and efficiency. However, it is challenging since acquiring sufficient customized data (e.g., abnormal cases) for novice training and deep model development is clinically unrealistic. Hence, controllable ECHO video synthesis is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework named HeartBeat towards controllable and high-fidelity ECHO video synthesis. Our highlight is three-fold. First, HeartBeat serves as a unified framework that enables perceiving multimodal conditions simultaneously to guide controllable generation. Second, we factorize the multimodal conditions into local and global ones, with two insertion strategies separately provided fine- and coarse-grained controls in a composable and flexible manner. In this way, users can synthesize ECHO videos that conform to their mental imagery by combining multimodal control signals. Third, we propose to decouple the visual concepts and temporal dynamics learning using a two-stage training scheme for simplifying the model training. One more interesting thing is that HeartBeat can easily generalize to mask-guided cardiac MRI synthesis in a few shots, showcasing its scalability to broader applications. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show the efficacy of the proposed HeartBeat.

- **Summary**: Temporal prediction is one of the most important technologies for video compression. Various prediction coding modes are designed in traditional video codecs. Traditional video codecs will adaptively to decide the optimal coding mode according to the prediction quality and reference quality. Recently, learned video codecs have made great progress. However, they ignore the prediction and reference quality adaptation, which leads to incorrect utilization of temporal prediction and reconstruction error propagation. Therefore, in this paper, we first propose a confidence-based prediction quality adaptation (PQA) module to provide explicit discrimination for the spatial and channel-wise prediction quality difference. With this module, the prediction with low quality will be suppressed and that with high quality will be enhanced. The codec can adaptively decide which spatial or channel location of predictions to use. Then, we further propose a reference quality adaptation (RQA) module and an associated repeat-long training strategy to provide dynamic spatially variant filters for diverse reference qualities. With the filters, it is easier for our codec to achieve the target reconstruction quality according to reference qualities, thus reducing the propagation of reconstruction errors. Experimental results show that our codec obtains higher compression performance than the reference software of H.266/VVC and the previous state-of-the-art learned video codecs in both RGB and YUV420 colorspaces.

- **Summary**: During the process of classifying Hyperspectral Image (HSI), every pixel sample is categorized under a land-cover type. CNN-based techniques for HSI classification have notably advanced the field by their adept feature representation capabilities. However, acquiring deep features remains a challenge for these CNN-based methods. In contrast, transformer models are adept at extracting high-level semantic features, offering a complementary strength. This paper's main contribution is the introduction of an HSI classification model that includes two convolutional blocks, a Gate-Shift-Fuse (GSF) block and a transformer block. This model leverages the strengths of CNNs in local feature extraction and transformers in long-range context modelling. The GSF block is designed to strengthen the extraction of local and global spatial-spectral features. An effective attention mechanism module is also proposed to enhance the extraction of information from HSI cubes. The proposed method is evaluated on four well-known datasets (the Indian Pines, Pavia University, WHU-WHU-Hi-LongKou and WHU-Hi-HanChuan), demonstrating that the proposed framework achieves superior results compared to other models.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of video Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), numerous benchmarks have been proposed to assess their video understanding capability. However, due to the lack of rich events in the videos, these datasets may suffer from the short-cut bias that the answers can be deduced from a few frames, without the need to watch the entire video. To address this issue, we introduce Event-Bench, an event-oriented long video understanding benchmark built on existing datasets and human annotations. Event-Bench includes six event-related tasks and 2,190 test instances to comprehensively evaluate video event understanding ability. Additionally, we propose Video Instruction Merging~(VIM), a cost-effective method that enhances video MLLMs using merged, event-intensive video instructions, addressing the scarcity of human-annotated, event-intensive data. Extensive experiments show that the best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an overall accuracy of 53.33, significantly outperforming the best open-source model by 41.42%. Leveraging an effective instruction synthesis method and an adaptive model architecture, VIM surpasses both state-of-the-art open-source models and GPT-4V on the Event-Bench. All code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Event-Bench.

- **Summary**: Recently, advancements in video synthesis have attracted significant attention. Video synthesis models such as AnimateDiff and Stable Video Diffusion have demonstrated the practical applicability of diffusion models in creating dynamic visual content. The emergence of SORA has further spotlighted the potential of video generation technologies. Nonetheless, the extension of video lengths has been constrained by the limitations in computational resources. Most existing video synthesis models can only generate short video clips. In this paper, we propose a novel post-tuning methodology for video synthesis models, called ExVideo. This approach is designed to enhance the capability of current video synthesis models, allowing them to produce content over extended temporal durations while incurring lower training expenditures. In particular, we design extension strategies across common temporal model architectures respectively, including 3D convolution, temporal attention, and positional embedding. To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed post-tuning approach, we conduct extension training on the Stable Video Diffusion model. Our approach augments the model's capacity to generate up to $5\times$ its original number of frames, requiring only 1.5k GPU hours of training on a dataset comprising 40k videos. Importantly, the substantial increase in video length doesn't compromise the model's innate generalization capabilities, and the model showcases its advantages in generating videos of diverse styles and resolutions. We will release the source code and the enhanced model publicly.

- **Summary**: Child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) pose a significant threat to the safety and well-being of children worldwide. Detecting and preventing the distribution of such materials is a critical task for law enforcement agencies and technology companies. As content moderation is often manual, developing an automated detection system can help reduce human reviewers' exposure to potentially harmful images and accelerate the process of counteracting. This study presents methods for classifying sexually explicit content, which plays a crucial role in the automated CSAM detection system. Several approaches are explored to solve the task: an end-to-end classifier, a classifier with person detection and a private body parts detector. All proposed methods are tested on the images obtained from the online tool for reporting illicit content. Due to legal constraints, access to the data is limited, and all algorithms are executed remotely on the isolated server. The end-to-end classifier yields the most promising results, with an accuracy of 90.17%, after augmenting the training set with the additional neutral samples and adult pornography. While detection-based methods may not achieve higher accuracy rates and cannot serve as a final classifier on their own, their inclusion in the system can be beneficial. Human body-oriented approaches generate results that are easier to interpret, and obtaining more interpretable results is essential when analyzing models that are trained without direct access to data.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is an important computer vision task, particularly for scene understanding and navigation of autonomous vehicles and UAVs. Several variations of deep neural network architectures have been designed to tackle this task. However, due to their huge computational costs and their high memory consumption, these models are not meant to be deployed on resource-constrained systems. To address this limitation, we introduce an end-to-end biologically inspired semantic segmentation approach by combining Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs, a low-power alternative to classical neural networks) with event cameras whose output data can directly feed these neural network inputs. We have designed EvSegSNN, a biologically plausible encoder-decoder U-shaped architecture relying on Parametric Leaky Integrate and Fire neurons in an objective to trade-off resource usage against performance. The experiments conducted on DDD17 demonstrate that EvSegSNN outperforms the closest state-of-the-art model in terms of MIoU while reducing the number of parameters by a factor of $1.6$ and sparing a batch normalization stage.

- **Summary**: Recently, the Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM)-based methods have achieved substantial success in the field of medical image segmentation. However, most of these methods fail to enable the diffusion model to learn edge features and non-edge features effectively and to inject them efficiently into the diffusion backbone. Additionally, the domain gap between the images features and the diffusion model features poses a great challenge to prostate segmentation. In this paper, we proposed CriDiff, a two-stage feature injecting framework with a Crisscross Injection Strategy (CIS) and a Generative Pre-train (GP) approach for prostate segmentation. The CIS maximizes the use of multi-level features by efficiently harnessing the complementarity of high and low-level features. To effectively learn multi-level of edge features and non-edge features, we proposed two parallel conditioners in the CIS: the Boundary Enhance Conditioner (BEC) and the Core Enhance Conditioner (CEC), which discriminatively model the image edge regions and non-edge regions, respectively. Moreover, the GP approach eases the inconsistency between the images features and the diffusion model without adding additional parameters. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and achieve state-of-the-art performance on four evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: The emergence of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) marks significant strides towards achieving general artificial intelligence. However, these advancements are tempered by the outputs that often reflect biases, a concern not yet extensively investigated. Existing benchmarks are not sufficiently comprehensive in evaluating biases due to their limited data scale, single questioning format and narrow sources of bias. To address this problem, we introduce VLBiasBench, a benchmark aimed at evaluating biases in LVLMs comprehensively. In VLBiasBench, we construct a dataset encompassing nine distinct categories of social biases, including age, disability status, gender, nationality, physical appearance, race, religion, profession, social economic status and two intersectional bias categories (race x gender, and race x social economic status). To create a large-scale dataset, we use Stable Diffusion XL model to generate 46,848 high-quality images, which are combined with different questions to form 128,342 samples. These questions are categorized into open and close ended types, fully considering the sources of bias and comprehensively evaluating the biases of LVLM from multiple perspectives. We subsequently conduct extensive evaluations on 15 open-source models as well as one advanced closed-source model, providing some new insights into the biases revealing from these models. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/Xiangkui-Cao/VLBiasBench.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation has become an important task in computer vision with the growth of self-driving cars, medical image segmentation, etc. Although current models provide excellent results, they are still far from perfect and while there has been significant work in trying to improve the performance, both with respect to accuracy and speed of segmentation, there has been little work which analyses the failure cases of such systems. In this work, we aim to provide an analysis of how segmentation fails across different models and consider the question of whether these can be predicted reasonably at test time. To do so, we explore existing uncertainty-based metrics and see how well they correlate with misclassifications, allowing us to define the degree of trust we put in the output of our prediction models. Through several experiments on three different models across three datasets, we show that simple measures such as entropy can be used to capture misclassification with high recall rates.

- **Summary**: Dense video captioning is the task that involves the detection and description of events within video sequences. While traditional approaches focus on offline solutions where the entire video of analysis is available for the captioning model, in this work we introduce a paradigm shift towards Live Video Captioning (LVC). In LVC, dense video captioning models must generate captions for video streams in an online manner, facing important constraints such as having to work with partial observations of the video, the need for temporal anticipation and, of course, ensuring ideally a real-time response. In this work we formally introduce the novel problem of LVC and propose new evaluation metrics tailored for the online scenario, demonstrating their superiority over traditional metrics. We also propose an LVC model integrating deformable transformers and temporal filtering to address the LVC new challenges. Experimental evaluations on the ActivityNet Captions dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its performance in LVC compared to state-of-the-art offline methods. Results of our model as well as an evaluation kit with the novel metrics integrated are made publicly available to encourage further research on LVC.

- **Summary**: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that Alzheimer's Disease (AD) induces both localised and widespread neural degenerative changes throughout the brain. However, the absence of segmentation that highlights brain degenerative changes presents unique challenges for training CNN-based classifiers in a supervised fashion. In this work, we evaluated several unsupervised methods to train a feature extractor for downstream AD vs. CN classification. Using the 3D T1-weighted MRI data of cognitive normal (CN) subjects from the synthetic neuroimaging LDM100K dataset, lightweight 3D CNN-based models are trained for brain age prediction, brain image rotation classification, brain image reconstruction and a multi-head task combining all three tasks into one. Feature extractors trained on the LDM100K synthetic dataset achieved similar performance compared to the same model using real-world data. This supports the feasibility of utilising large-scale synthetic data for pretext task training. All the training and testing splits are performed on the subject-level to prevent data leakage issues. Alongside the simple preprocessing steps, the random cropping data augmentation technique shows consistent improvement across all experiments.

- **Summary**: In the rise of climate change, land cover mapping has become such an urgent need in environmental monitoring. The accuracy of land cover classification has gotten increasingly based on the improvement of remote sensing data. Land cover classification using satellite imageries has been explored and become more prevalent in recent years, but the methodologies remain some drawbacks of subjective and time-consuming. Some deep learning techniques have been utilized to overcome these limitations. However, most studies implemented just one image type to evaluate algorithms for land cover mapping. Therefore, our study conducted deep learning semantic segmentation in multispectral, hyperspectral, and high spatial aerial image datasets for landcover mapping. This research implemented a semantic segmentation method such as Unet, Linknet, FPN, and PSPnet for categorizing vegetation, water, and others (i.e., soil and impervious surface). The LinkNet model obtained high accuracy in IoU (Intersection Over Union) at 0.92 in all datasets, which is comparable with other mentioned techniques. In evaluation with different image types, the multispectral images showed higher performance with the IoU, and F1-score are 0.993 and 0.997, respectively. Our outcome highlighted the efficiency and broad applicability of LinkNet and multispectral image on land cover classification. This research contributes to establishing an approach on landcover segmentation via open source for long-term future application.



### Uncertainty and Self-Supervision in Single-View Depth

- **Summary**: Single-view depth estimation refers to the ability to derive three-dimensional information per pixel from a single two-dimensional image. Single-view depth estimation is an ill-posed problem because there are multiple depth solutions that explain 3D geometry from a single view. While deep neural networks have been shown to be effective at capturing depth from a single view, the majority of current methodologies are deterministic in nature. Accounting for uncertainty in the predictions can avoid disastrous consequences when applied to fields such as autonomous driving or medical robotics. We have addressed this problem by quantifying the uncertainty of supervised single-view depth for Bayesian deep neural networks. There are scenarios, especially in medicine in the case of endoscopic images, where such annotated data is not available. To alleviate the lack of data, we present a method that improves the transition from synthetic to real domain methods. We introduce an uncertainty-aware teacher-student architecture that is trained in a self-supervised manner, taking into account the teacher uncertainty. Given the vast amount of unannotated data and the challenges associated with capturing annotated depth in medical minimally invasive procedures, we advocate a fully self-supervised approach that only requires RGB images and the geometric and photometric calibration of the endoscope. In endoscopic imaging, the camera and light sources are co-located at a small distance from the target surfaces. This setup indicates that brighter areas of the image are nearer to the camera, while darker areas are further away. Building on this observation, we exploit the fact that for any given albedo and surface orientation, pixel brightness is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. We propose the use of illumination as a strong single-view self-supervisory signal for deep neural networks.

- **Summary**: Learning generalizable visual dynamic representation across different embodied environments is crucial for real-world robotic manipulation. As the scale and diversity of robot demonstration data are limited, recent works have turned to large-scale pre-training using human data. However, the morphological differences between humans and robots introduce a significant human-robot domain discrepancy, challenging the generalization of these human-data pre-trained models to downstream manipulation tasks. To address this, we propose a novel adaptation paradigm that utilizes readily available paired human-robot video data to bridge the discrepancy. Following this paradigm, our method exploits a human-robot contrastive alignment loss to align the semantics of human and robot videos, adapting pre-trained models to the robotic domain in a parameter-efficient manner. The experiments demonstrate significant improvements on 25 tasks across three different benchmarks, where the single-task, language-conditioned multi-task settings are covered, and two different pre-trained models are evaluated. On the large RLBench benchmark, our adaptation method achieves an average improvement of $8.9\%$ in success rate over the pre-trained R3M model across multiple tasks. We will release the code and models upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Computational efficiency in deep neural networks is critical for object detection, especially as newer models prioritize speed over efficient computation (FLOP). This evolution has somewhat left behind embedded and mobile-oriented AI object detection applications. In this paper, we focus on design choices of neural network architectures for efficient object detection computation based on FLOP and propose several optimizations to enhance the efficiency of YOLO-based models.   Firstly, we introduce an efficient backbone scaling inspired by inverted bottlenecks and theoretical insights from the Information Bottleneck principle. Secondly, we present the Fast Pyramidal Architecture Network (FPAN), designed to facilitate fast multiscale feature sharing while reducing computational resources. Lastly, we propose a Decoupled Network-in-Network (DNiN) detection head engineered to deliver rapid yet lightweight computations for classification and regression tasks.   Building upon these optimizations and leveraging more efficient backbones, this paper contributes to a new scaling paradigm for object detection and YOLO-centric models called LeYOLO.

- **Summary**: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) aims to guide autonomous agents through real-world environments by integrating visual and linguistic cues. While substantial progress has been made in understanding these interactive modalities in ground-level navigation, aerial navigation remains largely underexplored. This is primarily due to the scarcity of resources suitable for real-world, city-scale aerial navigation studies. To bridge this gap, we introduce CityNav, a new dataset for language-goal aerial navigation using a 3D point cloud representation from real-world cities. CityNav includes 32,637 natural language descriptions paired with human demonstration trajectories, collected from participants via a new web-based 3D simulator developed for this research. Each description specifies a navigation goal, leveraging the names and locations of landmarks within real-world cities. We also provide baseline models of navigation agents that incorporate an internal 2D spatial map representing landmarks referenced in the descriptions. We benchmark the latest aerial navigation baselines and our proposed model on the CityNav dataset. The results using this dataset reveal the following key findings: (i) Our aerial agent models trained on human demonstration trajectories outperform those trained on shortest path trajectories, highlighting the importance of human-driven navigation strategies; (ii) The integration of a 2D spatial map significantly enhances navigation efficiency at city scale.

- **Summary**: Online GUI navigation on mobile devices has driven a lot of attention recent years since it contributes to many real-world applications. With the rapid development of large language models (LLM), multimodal large language models (MLLM) have tremendous potential on this task. However, existing MLLMs need high quality data to improve its abilities of making the correct navigation decisions according to the human user inputs. In this paper, we developed a novel and highly valuable dataset, named \textbf{E-ANT}, as the first Chinese GUI navigation dataset that contains real human behaviour and high quality screenshots with annotations, containing nearly 40,000 real human traces over 5000+ different tinyAPPs. Furthermore, we evaluate various powerful MLLMs on E-ANT and show their experiments results with sufficient ablations. We believe that our proposed dataset will be beneficial for both the evaluation and development of GUI navigation and LLM/MLLM decision-making capabilities.

- **Summary**: Generating city-scale lane-level maps faces significant challenges due to the intricate urban environments, such as blurred or absent lane markings. Additionally, a standard lane-level map requires a comprehensive organization of lane groupings, encompassing lane direction, style, boundary, and topology, yet has not been thoroughly examined in prior research. These obstacles result in labor-intensive human annotation and high maintenance costs. This paper overcomes these limitations and presents an industrial-grade solution named DuMapNet that outputs standardized, vectorized map elements and their topology in an end-to-end paradigm. To this end, we propose a group-wise lane prediction (GLP) system that outputs vectorized results of lane groups by meticulously tailoring a transformer-based network. Meanwhile, to enhance generalization in challenging scenarios, such as road wear and occlusions, as well as to improve global consistency, a contextual prompts encoder (CPE) module is proposed, which leverages the predicted results of spatial neighborhoods as contextual information. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of DuMapNet. Additionally, DuMap-Net has already been deployed in production at Baidu Maps since June 2023, supporting lane-level map generation tasks for over 360 cities while bringing a 95% reduction in costs. This demonstrates that DuMapNet serves as a practical and cost-effective industrial solution for city-scale lane-level map generation.

- **Summary**: Self-ensemble adversarial training methods improve model robustness by ensembling models at different training epochs, such as model weight averaging (WA). However, previous research has shown that self-ensemble defense methods in adversarial training (AT) still suffer from robust overfitting, which severely affects the generalization performance. Empirically, in the late phases of training, the AT becomes more overfitting to the extent that the individuals for weight averaging also suffer from overfitting and produce anomalous weight values, which causes the self-ensemble model to continue to undergo robust overfitting due to the failure in removing the weight anomalies. To solve this problem, we aim to tackle the influence of outliers in the weight space in this work and propose an easy-to-operate and effective Median-Ensemble Adversarial Training (MEAT) method to solve the robust overfitting phenomenon existing in self-ensemble defense from the source by searching for the median of the historical model weights. Experimental results show that MEAT achieves the best robustness against the powerful AutoAttack and can effectively allievate the robust overfitting. We further demonstrate that most defense methods can improve robust generalization and robustness by combining with MEAT.

- **Summary**: With rich temporal-spatial information, video-based person re-identification methods have shown broad prospects. Although tracklets can be easily obtained with ready-made tracking models, annotating identities is still expensive and impractical. Therefore, some video-based methods propose using only a few identity annotations or camera labels to facilitate feature learning. They also simply average the frame features of each tracklet, overlooking unexpected variations and inherent identity consistency within tracklets. In this paper, we propose the Self-Supervised Refined Clustering (SSR-C) framework without relying on any annotation or auxiliary information to promote unsupervised video person re-identification. Specifically, we first propose the Noise-Filtered Tracklet Partition (NFTP) module to reduce the feature bias of tracklets caused by noisy tracking results, and sequentially partition the noise-filtered tracklets into "sub-tracklets". Then, we cluster and further merge sub-tracklets using the self-supervised signal from tracklet partition, which is enhanced through a progressive strategy to generate reliable pseudo labels, facilitating intra-class cross-tracklet aggregation. Moreover, we propose the Class Smoothing Classification (CSC) loss to efficiently promote model learning. Extensive experiments on the MARS and DukeMTMC-VideoReID datasets demonstrate that our proposed SSR-C for unsupervised video person re-identification achieves state-of-the-art results and is comparable to advanced supervised methods.

- **Summary**: High-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) imaging technique is a powerful tool for directly visualizing a broad range of materials in real-space. However, it faces challenges in denoising due to ultra-low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and scarce data availability. In this work, we propose Noise2SR, a zero-shot self-supervised learning (ZS-SSL) denoising framework for HREM. Within our framework, we propose a super-resolution (SR) based self-supervised training strategy, incorporating the Random Sub-sampler module. The Random Sub-sampler is designed to generate approximate infinite noisy pairs from a single noisy image, serving as an effective data augmentation in zero-shot denoising. Noise2SR trains the network with paired noisy images of different resolutions, which is conducted via SR strategy. The SR-based training facilitates the network adopting more pixels for supervision, and the random sub-sampling helps compel the network to learn continuous signals enhancing the robustness. Meanwhile, we mitigate the uncertainty caused by random-sampling by adopting minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation for the denoised results. With the distinctive integration of training strategy and proposed designs, Noise2SR can achieve superior denoising performance using a single noisy HREM image. We evaluate the performance of Noise2SR in both simulated and real HREM denoising tasks. It outperforms state-of-the-art ZS-SSL methods and achieves comparable denoising performance with supervised methods. The success of Noise2SR suggests its potential for improving the SNR of images in material imaging domains.

- **Summary**: Recent studies in speech-driven 3D talking head generation have achieved convincing results in verbal articulations. However, generating accurate lip-syncs degrades when applied to input speech in other languages, possibly due to the lack of datasets covering a broad spectrum of facial movements across languages. In this work, we introduce a novel task to generate 3D talking heads from speeches of diverse languages. We collect a new multilingual 2D video dataset comprising over 420 hours of talking videos in 20 languages. With our proposed dataset, we present a multilingually enhanced model that incorporates language-specific style embeddings, enabling it to capture the unique mouth movements associated with each language. Additionally, we present a metric for assessing lip-sync accuracy in multilingual settings. We demonstrate that training a 3D talking head model with our proposed dataset significantly enhances its multilingual performance.

- **Summary**: Domain adaptation has shown appealing performance by leveraging knowledge from a source domain with rich annotations. However, for a specific target task, it is cumbersome to collect related and high-quality source domains. In real-world scenarios, large-scale datasets corrupted with noisy labels are easy to collect, stimulating a great demand for automatic recognition in a generalized setting, i.e., weakly-supervised partial domain adaptation (WS-PDA), which transfers a classifier from a large source domain with noises in labels to a small unlabeled target domain. As such, the key issues of WS-PDA are: 1) how to sufficiently discover the knowledge from the noisy labeled source domain and the unlabeled target domain, and 2) how to successfully adapt the knowledge across domains. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective domain adaptation approach, termed as self-paced transfer classifier learning (SP-TCL), to address the above issues, which could be regarded as a well-performing baseline for several generalized domain adaptation tasks. The proposed model is established upon the self-paced learning scheme, seeking a preferable classifier for the target domain. Specifically, SP-TCL learns to discover faithful knowledge via a carefully designed prudent loss function and simultaneously adapts the learned knowledge to the target domain by iteratively excluding source examples from training under the self-paced fashion. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that SP-TCL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on several generalized domain adaptation tasks.

- **Summary**: Considering the increased workload in pathology laboratories today, automated tools such as artificial intelligence models can help pathologists with their tasks and ease the workload. In this paper, we are proposing a segmentation model (DRU-Net) that can provide a delineation of human non-small cell lung carcinomas and an augmentation method that can improve classification results. The proposed model is a fused combination of truncated pre-trained DenseNet201 and ResNet101V2 as a patch-wise classifier followed by a lightweight U-Net as a refinement model. We have used two datasets (Norwegian Lung Cancer Biobank and Haukeland University Hospital lung cancer cohort) to create our proposed model. The DRU-Net model achieves an average of 0.91 Dice similarity coefficient. The proposed spatial augmentation method (multi-lens distortion) improved the network performance by 3%. Our findings show that choosing image patches that specifically include regions of interest leads to better results for the patch-wise classifier compared to other sampling methods. The qualitative analysis showed that the DRU-Net model is generally successful in detecting the tumor. On the test set, some of the cases showed areas of false positive and false negative segmentation in the periphery, particularly in tumors with inflammatory and reactive changes.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce QuST-LLM, an innovative extension of QuPath that utilizes the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to analyze and interpret spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. This tool effectively simplifies the intricate and high-dimensional nature of ST data by offering a comprehensive workflow that includes data loading, region selection, gene expression analysis, and functional annotation. QuST-LLM employs LLMs to transform complex ST data into understandable and detailed biological narratives based on gene ontology annotations, thereby significantly improving the interpretability of ST data. Consequently, users can interact with their own ST data using natural language. Hence, QuST-LLM provides researchers with a potent functionality to unravel the spatial and functional complexities of tissues, fostering novel insights and advancements in biomedical research.

- **Summary**: Single-source domain generalization (SDG) in medical image segmentation (MIS) aims to generalize a model using data from only one source domain to segment data from an unseen target domain. Despite substantial advances in SDG with data augmentation, existing methods often fail to fully consider the details and uncertain areas prevalent in MIS, leading to mis-segmentation. This paper proposes a Fourier-based semantic augmentation method called FIESTA using uncertainty guidance to enhance the fundamental goals of MIS in an SDG context by manipulating the amplitude and phase components in the frequency domain. The proposed Fourier augmentative transformer addresses semantic amplitude modulation based on meaningful angular points to induce pertinent variations and harnesses the phase spectrum to ensure structural coherence. Moreover, FIESTA employs epistemic uncertainty to fine-tune the augmentation process, improving the ability of the model to adapt to diverse augmented data and concentrate on areas with higher ambiguity. Extensive experiments across three cross-domain scenarios demonstrate that FIESTA surpasses recent state-of-the-art SDG approaches in segmentation performance and significantly contributes to boosting the applicability of the model in medical imaging modalities.

- **Summary**: The increasing availability of biomedical data is helping to design more robust deep learning (DL) algorithms to analyze biomedical samples. Currently, one of the main limitations to train DL algorithms to perform a specific task is the need for medical experts to label data. Automatic methods to label data exist, however automatic labels can be noisy and it is not completely clear when automatic labels can be adopted to train DL models. This paper aims to investigate under which circumstances automatic labels can be adopted to train a DL model on the classification of Whole Slide Images (WSI). The analysis involves multiple architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT), and over 10000 WSIs, collected from three use cases: celiac disease, lung cancer and colon cancer, which one including respectively binary, multiclass and multilabel data. The results allow identifying 10% as the percentage of noisy labels that lead to train competitive models for the classification of WSIs. Therefore, an algorithm generating automatic labels needs to fit this criterion to be adopted. The application of the Semantic Knowledge Extractor Tool (SKET) algorithm to generate automatic labels leads to performance comparable to the one obtained with manual labels, since it generates a percentage of noisy labels between 2-5%. Automatic labels are as effective as manual ones, reaching solid performance comparable to the one obtained training models with manual labels.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) achieve impressive 3D representation learning and novel view synthesis results with high-quality multi-view images as input. However, motion blur in images often occurs in low-light and high-speed motion scenes, which significantly degrade the reconstruction quality of NeRF. Previous deblurring NeRF methods are struggling to estimate information during the exposure time, unable to accurately model the motion blur. In contrast, the bio-inspired event camera measuring intensity changes with high temporal resolution makes up this information deficiency. In this paper, we propose Event-driven Bundle Adjustment for Deblurring Neural Radiance Fields (EBAD-NeRF) to jointly optimize the learnable poses and NeRF parameters by leveraging the hybrid event-RGB data. An intensity-change-metric event loss and a photo-metric blur loss are introduced to strengthen the explicit modeling of camera motion blur. Experiment results on both synthetic data and real captured data demonstrate that EBAD-NeRF can obtain accurate camera poses during the exposure time and learn sharper 3D representations compared to prior works.

- **Summary**: Pathological lymph node delineation is crucial in cancer diagnosis, progression assessment, and treatment planning. The MICCAI 2023 Lymph Node Quantification Challenge published the first public dataset for pathological lymph node segmentation in the mediastinum. As lymph node annotations are expensive, the challenge was formed as a weakly supervised learning task, where only a subset of all lymph nodes in the training set have been annotated. For the challenge submission, multiple methods for training on these weakly supervised data were explored, including noisy label training, loss masking of unlabeled data, and an approach that integrated the TotalSegmentator toolbox as a form of pseudo labeling in order to reduce the number of unknown voxels. Furthermore, multiple public TCIA datasets were incorporated into the training to improve the performance of the deep learning model. Our submitted model achieved a Dice score of 0.628 and an average symmetric surface distance of 5.8~mm on the challenge test set. With our submitted model, we accomplished third rank in the MICCAI2023 LNQ challenge. A finding of our analysis was that the integration of all visible, including non-pathological, lymph nodes improved the overall segmentation performance on pathological lymph nodes of the test set. Furthermore, segmentation models trained only on clinically enlarged lymph nodes, as given in the challenge scenario, could not generalize to smaller pathological lymph nodes. The code and model for the challenge submission are available at \url{https://gitlab.lrz.de/compai/MediastinalLymphNodeSegmentation}.

- **Summary**: Pose estimation aims to accurately identify anatomical keypoints in humans and animals using monocular images, which is crucial for various applications such as human-machine interaction, embodied AI, and autonomous driving. While current models show promising results, they are typically trained and tested on clean data, potentially overlooking the corruption during real-world deployment and thus posing safety risks in practical scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce PoseBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of pose estimation models against real-world corruption. We evaluated 60 representative models, including top-down, bottom-up, heatmap-based, regression-based, and classification-based methods, across three datasets for human and animal pose estimation. Our evaluation involves 10 types of corruption in four categories: 1) blur and noise, 2) compression and color loss, 3) severe lighting, and 4) masks. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art models are vulnerable to common real-world corruptions and exhibit distinct behaviors when tackling human and animal pose estimation tasks. To improve model robustness, we delve into various design considerations, including input resolution, pre-training datasets, backbone capacity, post-processing, and data augmentations. We hope that our benchmark will serve as a foundation for advancing research in robust pose estimation. The benchmark and source code will be released at https://xymsh.github.io/PoseBench

- **Summary**: Automated signature verification on bank checks is critical for fraud prevention and ensuring transaction authenticity. This task is challenging due to the coexistence of signatures with other textual and graphical elements on real-world documents. Verification systems must first detect the signature and then validate its authenticity, a dual challenge often overlooked by current datasets and methodologies focusing only on verification. To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset specifically designed for signature verification on bank checks. This dataset includes a variety of signature styles embedded within typical check elements, providing a realistic testing ground for advanced detection methods. Moreover, we propose a novel approach for writer-independent signature verification using an object detection network. Our detection-based verification method treats genuine and forged signatures as distinct classes within an object detection framework, effectively handling both detection and verification. We employ a DINO-based network augmented with a dilation module to detect and verify signatures on check images simultaneously. Our approach achieves an AP of 99.2 for genuine and 99.4 for forged signatures, a significant improvement over the DINO baseline, which scored 93.1 and 89.3 for genuine and forged signatures, respectively. This improvement highlights our dilation module's effectiveness in reducing both false positives and negatives. Our results demonstrate substantial advancements in detection-based signature verification technology, offering enhanced security and efficiency in financial document processing.

- **Summary**: The application of deep learning in visual anomaly detection has gained widespread popularity due to its potential use in quality control and manufacturing. Current standard methods are Unsupervised, where a clean dataset is utilised to detect deviations and flag anomalies during testing. However, incorporating a few samples when the type of anomalies is known beforehand can significantly enhance performance. Thus, we propose ATAC-Net, a framework that trains to detect anomalies from a minimal set of known prior anomalies. Furthermore, we introduce attention-guided cropping, which provides a closer view of suspect regions during the training phase. Our framework is a reliable and easy-to-understand system for detecting anomalies, and we substantiate its superiority to some of the current state-of-the-art techniques in a comparable setting.

- **Summary**: Global Station Weather Forecasting (GSWF) is crucial for various sectors, including aviation, agriculture, energy, and disaster preparedness. Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of weather predictions by optimizing models based on public meteorological data. However, existing public datasets for GSWF optimization and benchmarking still suffer from significant limitations, such as small sizes, limited temporal coverage, and a lack of comprehensive variables. These shortcomings prevent them from effectively reflecting the benchmarks of current forecasting methods and fail to support the real needs of operational weather forecasting. To address these challenges, we present the WEATHER-5K dataset. This dataset comprises a comprehensive collection of data from 5,672 weather stations worldwide, spanning a 10-year period with one-hour intervals. It includes multiple crucial weather elements, providing a more reliable and interpretable resource for forecasting. Furthermore, our WEATHER-5K dataset can serve as a benchmark for comprehensively evaluating existing well-known forecasting models, extending beyond GSWF methods to support future time-series research challenges and opportunities. The dataset and benchmark implementation are publicly available at: https://github.com/taohan10200/WEATHER-5K.

- **Summary**: We introduce a new benchmark analysis focusing on 3D canine pose estimation from monocular in-the-wild images. A multi-modal dataset 3DDogs-Lab was captured indoors, featuring various dog breeds trotting on a walkway. It includes data from optical marker-based mocap systems, RGBD cameras, IMUs, and a pressure mat. While providing high-quality motion data, the presence of optical markers and limited background diversity make the captured video less representative of real-world conditions. To address this, we created 3DDogs-Wild, a naturalised version of the dataset where the optical markers are in-painted and the subjects are placed in diverse environments, enhancing its utility for training RGB image-based pose detectors. We show that using the 3DDogs-Wild to train the models leads to improved performance when evaluating on in-the-wild data. Additionally, we provide a thorough analysis using various pose estimation models, revealing their respective strengths and weaknesses. We believe that our findings, coupled with the datasets provided, offer valuable insights for advancing 3D animal pose estimation.

- **Summary**: Most prior motion prediction endeavors in autonomous driving have inadequately encoded future scenarios, leading to predictions that may fail to accurately capture the diverse movements of agents (e.g., vehicles or pedestrians). To address this, we propose FutureNet, which explicitly integrates initially predicted trajectories into the future scenario and further encodes these future contexts to enhance subsequent forecasting. Additionally, most previous motion forecasting works have focused on predicting independent futures for each agent. However, safe and smooth autonomous driving requires accurately predicting the diverse future behaviors of numerous surrounding agents jointly in complex dynamic environments. Given that all agents occupy certain potential travel spaces and possess lane driving priority, we propose Lane Occupancy Field (LOF), a new representation with lane semantics for motion forecasting in autonomous driving. LOF can simultaneously capture the joint probability distribution of all road participants' future spatial-temporal positions. Due to the high compatibility between lane occupancy field prediction and trajectory prediction, we propose a novel network with future context encoding for the joint prediction of these two tasks. Our approach ranks 1st on two large-scale motion forecasting benchmarks: Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2.

- **Summary**: In the landscape of generative artificial intelligence, diffusion-based models have emerged as a promising method for generating synthetic images. However, the application of diffusion models poses numerous challenges, particularly concerning data availability, computational requirements, and privacy. Traditional approaches to address these shortcomings, like federated learning, often impose significant computational burdens on individual clients, especially those with constrained resources. In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel approach for distributed collaborative diffusion models inspired by split learning. Our approach facilitates collaborative training of diffusion models while alleviating client computational burdens during image synthesis. This reduced computational burden is achieved by retaining data and computationally inexpensive processes locally at each client while outsourcing the computationally expensive processes to shared, more efficient server resources. Through experiments on the common CelebA dataset, our approach demonstrates enhanced privacy by reducing the necessity for sharing raw data. These capabilities hold significant potential across various application areas, including the design of edge computing solutions. Thus, our work advances distributed machine learning by contributing to the evolution of collaborative diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Stochastic video generation is particularly challenging when the camera is mounted on a moving platform, as camera motion interacts with observed image pixels, creating complex spatio-temporal dynamics and making the problem partially observable. Existing methods typically address this by focusing on raw pixel-level image reconstruction without explicitly modelling camera motion dynamics. We propose a solution by considering camera motion or action as part of the observed image state, modelling both image and action within a multi-modal learning framework. We introduce three models: Video Generation with Learning Action Prior (VG-LeAP) treats the image-action pair as an augmented state generated from a single latent stochastic process and uses variational inference to learn the image-action latent prior; Causal-LeAP, which establishes a causal relationship between action and the observed image frame at time $t$, learning an action prior conditioned on the observed image states; and RAFI, which integrates the augmented image-action state concept into flow matching with diffusion generative processes, demonstrating that this action-conditioned image generation concept can be extended to other diffusion-based models. We emphasize the importance of multi-modal training in partially observable video generation problems through detailed empirical studies on our new video action dataset, RoAM.

- **Summary**: Graph deep learning (GDL) has demonstrated impressive performance in predicting population-based brain disorders (BDs) through the integration of both imaging and non-imaging data. However, the effectiveness of GDL based methods heavily depends on the quality of modeling the multi-modal population graphs and tends to degrade as the graph scale increases. Furthermore, these methods often constrain interactions between imaging and non-imaging data to node-edge interactions within the graph, overlooking complex inter-modal correlations, leading to suboptimal outcomes. To overcome these challenges, we propose MM-GTUNets, an end-to-end graph transformer based multi-modal graph deep learning (MMGDL) framework designed for brain disorders prediction at large scale. Specifically, to effectively leverage rich multi-modal information related to diseases, we introduce Modality Reward Representation Learning (MRRL) which adaptively constructs population graphs using a reward system. Additionally, we employ variational autoencoder to reconstruct latent representations of non-imaging features aligned with imaging features. Based on this, we propose Adaptive Cross-Modal Graph Learning (ACMGL), which captures critical modality-specific and modality-shared features through a unified GTUNet encoder taking advantages of Graph UNet and Graph Transformer, and feature fusion module. We validated our method on two public multi-modal datasets ABIDE and ADHD-200, demonstrating its superior performance in diagnosing BDs.

- **Summary**: Analyzing sequential data is crucial in many domains, particularly due to the abundance of data collected from the Internet of Things paradigm. Time series classification, the task of categorizing sequential data, has gained prominence, with machine learning approaches demonstrating remarkable performance on public benchmark datasets. However, progress has primarily been in designing architectures for learning representations from raw data at fixed (or ideal) time scales, which can fail to generalize to longer sequences. This work introduces a \textit{compositional representation learning} approach trained on statistically coherent components extracted from sequential data. Based on a multi-scale change space, an unsupervised approach is proposed to segment the sequential data into chunks with similar statistical properties. A sequence-based encoder model is trained in a multi-task setting to learn compositional representations from these temporal components for time series classification. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on publicly available time series classification benchmarks. Evaluating the coherence of segmented components shows its competitive performance on the unsupervised segmentation task.

- **Summary**: This work addresses the problem of Social Activity Recognition (SAR), a critical component in real-world tasks like surveillance and assistive robotics. Unlike traditional event understanding approaches, SAR necessitates modeling individual actors' appearance and motions and contextualizing them within their social interactions. Traditional action localization methods fall short due to their single-actor, single-action assumption. Previous SAR research has relied heavily on densely annotated data, but privacy concerns limit their applicability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a self-supervised approach based on multi-actor predictive learning for SAR in streaming videos. Using a visual-semantic graph structure, we model social interactions, enabling relational reasoning for robust performance with minimal labeled data. The proposed framework achieves competitive performance on standard group activity recognition benchmarks. Evaluation on three publicly available action localization benchmarks demonstrates its generalizability to arbitrary action localization.

- **Summary**: To mitigate the risk of harmful outputs from large vision models (LVMs), we introduce the SafeSora dataset to promote research on aligning text-to-video generation with human values. This dataset encompasses human preferences in text-to-video generation tasks along two primary dimensions: helpfulness and harmlessness. To capture in-depth human preferences and facilitate structured reasoning by crowdworkers, we subdivide helpfulness into 4 sub-dimensions and harmlessness into 12 sub-categories, serving as the basis for pilot annotations. The SafeSora dataset includes 14,711 unique prompts, 57,333 unique videos generated by 4 distinct LVMs, and 51,691 pairs of preference annotations labeled by humans. We further demonstrate the utility of the SafeSora dataset through several applications, including training the text-video moderation model and aligning LVMs with human preference by fine-tuning a prompt augmentation module or the diffusion model. These applications highlight its potential as the foundation for text-to-video alignment research, such as human preference modeling and the development and validation of alignment algorithms.

- **Summary**: Analyzing the similarity of internal representations within and across different models has been an important technique for understanding the behavior of deep neural networks. Most existing methods for analyzing the similarity between representations of high dimensions, such as those based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and widely used Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), rely on statistical properties of the representations for a set of data points. In this paper, we focus on transformer models and study the similarity of representations between the hidden layers of individual transformers. In this context, we show that a simple sample-wise cosine similarity metric is capable of capturing the similarity and aligns with the complicated CKA. Our experimental results on common transformers reveal that representations across layers are positively correlated, albeit the similarity decreases when layers are far apart. We then propose an aligned training approach to enhance the similarity between internal representations, with trained models that enjoy the following properties: (1) the last-layer classifier can be directly applied right after any hidden layers, yielding intermediate layer accuracies much higher than those under standard training, (2) the layer-wise accuracies monotonically increase and reveal the minimal depth needed for the given task, (3) when served as multi-exit models, they achieve on-par performance with standard multi-exit architectures which consist of additional classifiers designed for early exiting in shallow layers. To our knowledge, our work is the first to show that one common classifier is sufficient for multi-exit models. We conduct experiments on both vision and NLP tasks to demonstrate the performance of the proposed aligned training.

- **Summary**: Small object detection (SOD) has been a longstanding yet challenging task for decades, with numerous datasets and algorithms being developed. However, they mainly focus on either visible or thermal modality, while visible-thermal (RGBT) bimodality is rarely explored. Although some RGBT datasets have been developed recently, the insufficient quantity, limited category, misaligned images and large target size cannot provide an impartial benchmark to evaluate multi-category visible-thermal small object detection (RGBT SOD) algorithms. In this paper, we build the first large-scale benchmark with high diversity for RGBT SOD (namely RGBT-Tiny), including 115 paired sequences, 93K frames and 1.2M manual annotations. RGBT-Tiny contains abundant targets (7 categories) and high-diversity scenes (8 types that cover different illumination and density variations). Note that, over 81% of targets are smaller than 16x16, and we provide paired bounding box annotations with tracking ID to offer an extremely challenging benchmark with wide-range applications, such as RGBT fusion, detection and tracking. In addition, we propose a scale adaptive fitness (SAFit) measure that exhibits high robustness on both small and large targets. The proposed SAFit can provide reasonable performance evaluation and promote detection performance. Based on the proposed RGBT-Tiny dataset and SAFit measure, extensive evaluations have been conducted, including 23 recent state-of-the-art algorithms that cover four different types (i.e., visible generic detection, visible SOD, thermal SOD and RGBT object detection).

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently dramatically pushed the state of the art in image captioning and many image understanding tasks (e.g., visual question answering). LVLMs, however, often \textit{hallucinate} and produce captions that mention concepts that cannot be found in the image. These hallucinations erode the trustworthiness of LVLMs and are arguably among the main obstacles to their ubiquitous adoption. Recent work suggests that addition of grounding objectives -- those that explicitly align image regions or objects to text spans -- reduces the amount of LVLM hallucination. Although intuitive, this claim is not empirically justified as the reduction effects have been established, we argue, with flawed evaluation protocols that (i) rely on data (i.e., MSCOCO) that has been extensively used in LVLM training and (ii) measure hallucination via question answering rather than open-ended caption generation. In this work, in contrast, we offer the first systematic analysis of the effect of fine-grained object grounding on LVLM hallucination under an evaluation protocol that more realistically captures LVLM hallucination in open generation. Our extensive experiments over three backbone LLMs reveal that grounding objectives have little to no effect on object hallucination in open caption generation.

- **Summary**: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate impressive abilities on numerous image understanding and reasoning tasks. The task of fine-grained object classification (e.g., distinction between \textit{animal species}), however, has been probed insufficiently, despite its downstream importance. We fill this evaluation gap by creating \texttt{FOCI} (\textbf{F}ine-grained \textbf{O}bject \textbf{C}lass\textbf{I}fication), a difficult multiple-choice benchmark for fine-grained object classification, from existing object classification datasets: (1) multiple-choice avoids ambiguous answers associated with casting classification as open-ended QA task; (2) we retain classification difficulty by mining negative labels with a CLIP model. \texttt{FOCI}\xspace complements five popular classification datasets with four domain-specific subsets from ImageNet-21k. We benchmark 12 public LVLMs on \texttt{FOCI} and show that it tests for a \textit{complementary skill} to established image understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, CLIP models exhibit dramatically better performance than LVLMs. Since the image encoders of LVLMs come from these CLIP models, this points to inadequate alignment for fine-grained object distinction between the encoder and the LLM and warrants (pre)training data with more fine-grained annotation. We release our code at \url{https://github.com/gregor-ge/FOCI-Benchmark}.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based generative models have recently shown remarkable image and video editing capabilities. However, local video editing, particularly removal of small attributes like glasses, remains a challenge. Existing methods either alter the videos excessively, generate unrealistic artifacts, or fail to perform the requested edit consistently throughout the video. In this work, we focus on consistent and identity-preserving removal of glasses in videos, using it as a case study for consistent local attribute removal in videos. Due to the lack of paired data, we adopt a weakly supervised approach and generate synthetic imperfect data, using an adjusted pretrained diffusion model. We show that despite data imperfection, by learning from our generated data and leveraging the prior of pretrained diffusion models, our model is able to perform the desired edit consistently while preserving the original video content. Furthermore, we exemplify the generalization ability of our method to other local video editing tasks by applying it successfully to facial sticker-removal. Our approach demonstrates significant improvement over existing methods, showcasing the potential of leveraging synthetic data and strong video priors for local video editing tasks.

- **Summary**: The advent of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has spurred research into their applications in multi-modal contexts, particularly in video understanding. Traditional VideoQA benchmarks, despite providing quantitative metrics, often fail to encompass the full spectrum of video content and inadequately assess models' temporal comprehension. To address these limitations, we introduce MMBench-Video, a quantitative benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LVLMs' proficiency in video understanding. MMBench-Video incorporates lengthy videos from YouTube and employs free-form questions, mirroring practical use cases. The benchmark is meticulously crafted to probe the models' temporal reasoning skills, with all questions human-annotated according to a carefully constructed ability taxonomy. We employ GPT-4 for automated assessment, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness over earlier LLM-based evaluations. Utilizing MMBench-Video, we have conducted comprehensive evaluations that include both proprietary and open-source LVLMs for images and videos. MMBench-Video stands as a valuable resource for the research community, facilitating improved evaluation of LVLMs and catalyzing progress in the field of video understanding. The evalutation code of MMBench-Video will be integrated into VLMEvalKit: https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit.

- **Summary**: Recent studies show that image and video generation models can be prompted to reproduce copyrighted content from their training data, raising serious legal concerns around copyright infringement. Copyrighted characters, in particular, pose a difficult challenge for image generation services, with at least one lawsuit already awarding damages based on the generation of these characters. Yet, little research has empirically examined this issue. We conduct a systematic evaluation to fill this gap. First, we build CopyCat, an evaluation suite consisting of diverse copyrighted characters and a novel evaluation pipeline. Our evaluation considers both the detection of similarity to copyrighted characters and generated image's consistency with user input. Our evaluation systematically shows that both image and video generation models can still generate characters even if characters' names are not explicitly mentioned in the prompt, sometimes with only two generic keywords (e.g., prompting with "videogame, plumber" consistently generates Nintendo's Mario character). We then introduce techniques to semi-automatically identify such keywords or descriptions that trigger character generation. Using our evaluation suite, we study runtime mitigation strategies, including both existing methods and new strategies we propose. Our findings reveal that commonly employed strategies, such as prompt rewriting in the DALL-E system, are not sufficient as standalone guardrails. These strategies must be coupled with other approaches, like negative prompting, to effectively reduce the unintended generation of copyrighted characters. Our work provides empirical grounding to the discussion of copyright mitigation strategies and offers actionable insights for model deployers actively implementing them.

- **Summary**: Large-scale generative language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs) excel in few-shot in-context learning for decision making and instruction following. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own prompt examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience insights from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a noisy demonstration in a new domain, VLMs abstract the trajectory into a general program by fixing inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: task relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task construals. These abstractions are refined and adapted interactively through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting abstractions, when used as exemplars in the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over the SOTA from 14.3% to 22.7%. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on expert-crafted examples and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such insights.

- **Summary**: A comprehensive guidance view for cardiac interventional surgery can be provided by the real-time fusion of the intraoperative 2D images and preoperative 3D volume based on the ultrasound frame-to-volume registration. However, cardiac ultrasound images are characterized by a low signal-to-noise ratio and small differences between adjacent frames, coupled with significant dimension variations between 2D frames and 3D volumes to be registered, resulting in real-time and accurate cardiac ultrasound frame-to-volume registration being a very challenging task. This paper introduces a lightweight end-to-end Cardiac Ultrasound frame-to-volume Registration network, termed CU-Reg. Specifically, the proposed model leverages epicardium prompt-guided anatomical clues to reinforce the interaction of 2D sparse and 3D dense features, followed by a voxel-wise local-global aggregation of enhanced features, thereby boosting the cross-dimensional matching effectiveness of low-quality ultrasound modalities. We further embed an inter-frame discriminative regularization term within the hybrid supervised learning to increase the distinction between adjacent slices in the same ultrasound volume to ensure registration stability. Experimental results on the reprocessed CAMUS dataset demonstrate that our CU-Reg surpasses existing methods in terms of registration accuracy and efficiency, meeting the guidance requirements of clinical cardiac interventional surgery.

- **Summary**: Diffusion distillation represents a highly promising direction for achieving faithful text-to-image generation in a few sampling steps. However, despite recent successes, existing distilled models still do not provide the full spectrum of diffusion abilities, such as real image inversion, which enables many precise image manipulation methods. This work aims to enrich distilled text-to-image diffusion models with the ability to effectively encode real images into their latent space. To this end, we introduce invertible Consistency Distillation (iCD), a generalized consistency distillation framework that facilitates both high-quality image synthesis and accurate image encoding in only 3-4 inference steps. Though the inversion problem for text-to-image diffusion models gets exacerbated by high classifier-free guidance scales, we notice that dynamic guidance significantly reduces reconstruction errors without noticeable degradation in generation performance. As a result, we demonstrate that iCD equipped with dynamic guidance may serve as a highly effective tool for zero-shot text-guided image editing, competing with more expensive state-of-the-art alternatives.

- **Summary**: Scalable robot learning in the real world is limited by the cost and safety issues of real robots. In addition, rolling out robot trajectories in the real world can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose to learn an interactive real-robot action simulator as an alternative. We introduce a novel method, IRASim, which leverages the power of generative models to generate extremely realistic videos of a robot arm that executes a given action trajectory, starting from an initial given frame. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we create a new benchmark, IRASim Benchmark, based on three real-robot datasets and perform extensive experiments on the benchmark. Results show that IRASim outperforms all the baseline methods and is more preferable in human evaluations. We hope that IRASim can serve as an effective and scalable approach to enhance robot learning in the real world. To promote research for generative real-robot action simulators, we open-source code, benchmark, and checkpoints at https: //gen-irasim.github.io.

- **Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable proficiency in addressing a wide array of visual questions, which requires strong perception and reasoning faculties. Assessing these two competencies independently is crucial for model refinement, despite the inherent difficulty due to the intertwined nature of seeing and reasoning in existing VLMs. To tackle this issue, we present Prism, an innovative framework designed to disentangle the perception and reasoning processes involved in visual question solving. Prism comprises two distinct stages: a perception stage that utilizes a VLM to extract and articulate visual information in textual form, and a reasoning stage that formulates responses based on the extracted visual information using a Large Language Model (LLM). This modular design enables the systematic comparison and assessment of both proprietary and open-source VLM for their perception and reasoning strengths. Our analytical framework provides several valuable insights, underscoring Prism's potential as a cost-effective solution for vision-language tasks. By combining a streamlined VLM focused on perception with a powerful LLM tailored for reasoning, Prism achieves superior results in general vision-language tasks while substantially cutting down on training and operational expenses. Quantitative evaluations show that Prism, when configured with a vanilla 2B LLaVA and freely accessible GPT-3.5, delivers performance on par with VLMs $10 \times$ larger on the rigorous multimodal benchmark MMStar.

- **Summary**: Consistency models (CMs) are an emerging class of generative models that offer faster sampling than traditional diffusion models. CMs enforce that all points along a sampling trajectory are mapped to the same initial point. But this target leads to resource-intensive training: for example, as of 2024, training a SoTA CM on CIFAR-10 takes one week on 8 GPUs. In this work, we propose an alternative scheme for training CMs, vastly improving the efficiency of building such models. Specifically, by expressing CM trajectories via a particular differential equation, we argue that diffusion models can be viewed as a special case of CMs with a specific discretization. We can thus fine-tune a consistency model starting from a pre-trained diffusion model and progressively approximate the full consistency condition to stronger degrees over the training process. Our resulting method, which we term Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT), achieves vastly improved training times while indeed improving upon the quality of previous methods: for example, ECT achieves a 2-step FID of 2.73 on CIFAR10 within 1 hour on a single A100 GPU, matching Consistency Distillation trained of hundreds of GPU hours. Owing to this computational efficiency, we investigate the scaling law of CMs under ECT, showing that they seem to obey classic power law scaling, hinting at their ability to improve efficiency and performance at larger scales. Code (https://github.com/locuslab/ect) is available.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of large language models has revolutionized natural language processing tasks, yet it raises profound concerns regarding data privacy and security. Language models are trained on extensive corpora including potentially sensitive or proprietary information, and the risk of data leakage -- where the model response reveals pieces of such information -- remains inadequately understood. This study examines susceptibility to data leakage by quantifying the phenomenon of memorization in machine learning models, focusing on the evolution of memorization patterns over training. We investigate how the statistical characteristics of training data influence the memories encoded within the model by evaluating how repetition influences memorization. We reproduce findings that the probability of memorizing a sequence scales logarithmically with the number of times it is present in the data. Furthermore, we find that sequences which are not apparently memorized after the first encounter can be uncovered throughout the course of training even without subsequent encounters. The presence of these latent memorized sequences presents a challenge for data privacy since they may be hidden at the final checkpoint of the model. To this end, we develop a diagnostic test for uncovering these latent memorized sequences by considering their cross entropy loss.

- **Summary**: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) involves classifying closely related sub-classes. This task is difficult due to the subtle differences between classes and the high intra-class variance. Moreover, FGVC datasets are typically small and challenging to gather, thus highlighting a significant need for effective data augmentation. Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models offer new possibilities for augmenting classification datasets. While these models have been used to generate training data for classification tasks, their effectiveness in full-dataset training of FGVC models remains under-explored. Recent techniques that rely on Text2Image generation or Img2Img methods, often struggle to generate images that accurately represent the class while modifying them to a degree that significantly increases the dataset's diversity. To address these challenges, we present SaSPA: Structure and Subject Preserving Augmentation. Contrary to recent methods, our method does not use real images as guidance, thereby increasing generation flexibility and promoting greater diversity. To ensure accurate class representation, we employ conditioning mechanisms, specifically by conditioning on image edges and subject representation. We conduct extensive experiments and benchmark SaSPA against both traditional and recent generative data augmentation methods. SaSPA consistently outperforms all established baselines across multiple settings, including full dataset training, contextual bias, and few-shot classification. Additionally, our results reveal interesting patterns in using synthetic data for FGVC models; for instance, we find a relationship between the amount of real data used and the optimal proportion of synthetic data.

- **Summary**: Image editing aims to edit the given synthetic or real image to meet the specific requirements from users. It is widely studied in recent years as a promising and challenging field of Artificial Intelligence Generative Content (AIGC). Recent significant advancement in this field is based on the development of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, which generate images according to text prompts. These models demonstrate remarkable generative capabilities and have become widely used tools for image editing. T2I-based image editing methods significantly enhance editing performance and offer a user-friendly interface for modifying content guided by multimodal inputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal-guided image editing techniques that leverage T2I diffusion models. First, we define the scope of image editing from a holistic perspective and detail various control signals and editing scenarios. We then propose a unified framework to formalize the editing process, categorizing it into two primary algorithm families. This framework offers a design space for users to achieve specific goals. Subsequently, we present an in-depth analysis of each component within this framework, examining the characteristics and applicable scenarios of different combinations. Given that training-based methods learn to directly map the source image to target one under user guidance, we discuss them separately, and introduce injection schemes of source image in different scenarios. Additionally, we review the application of 2D techniques to video editing, highlighting solutions for inter-frame inconsistency. Finally, we discuss open challenges in the field and suggest potential future research directions. We keep tracing related works at https://github.com/xinchengshuai/Awesome-Image-Editing.

- **Summary**: Despite real-time planners exhibiting remarkable performance in autonomous driving, the growing exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened avenues for enhancing the interpretability and controllability of motion planning. Nevertheless, LLM-based planners continue to encounter significant challenges, including elevated resource consumption and extended inference times, which pose substantial obstacles to practical deployment. In light of these challenges, we introduce AsyncDriver, a new asynchronous LLM-enhanced closed-loop framework designed to leverage scene-associated instruction features produced by LLM to guide real-time planners in making precise and controllable trajectory predictions. On one hand, our method highlights the prowess of LLMs in comprehending and reasoning with vectorized scene data and a series of routing instructions, demonstrating its effective assistance to real-time planners. On the other hand, the proposed framework decouples the inference processes of the LLM and real-time planners. By capitalizing on the asynchronous nature of their inference frequencies, our approach have successfully reduced the computational cost introduced by LLM, while maintaining comparable performance. Experiments show that our approach achieves superior closed-loop evaluation performance on nuPlan's challenging scenarios.

- **Summary**: When presented with questions involving visual thinking, humans naturally switch reasoning modalities, often forming mental images or drawing visual aids. Large language models have shown promising results in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning by expressing intermediate reasoning in text as a chain of thought, yet struggle to extend this capability to answer text queries that are easily solved by visual reasoning, even with extensive multimodal pretraining. We introduce a simple method, whiteboard-of-thought prompting, to unlock the visual reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models across modalities. Whiteboard-of-thought prompting provides multimodal large language models with a metaphorical `whiteboard' to draw out reasoning steps as images, then returns these images back to the model for further processing. We find this can be accomplished with no demonstrations or specialized modules, instead leveraging models' existing ability to write code with libraries such as Matplotlib and Turtle. This simple approach shows state-of-the-art results on four difficult natural language tasks that involve visual and spatial reasoning. We identify multiple settings where GPT-4o using chain-of-thought fails dramatically, including more than one where it achieves $0\%$ accuracy, while whiteboard-of-thought enables up to $92\%$ accuracy in these same settings. We present a detailed exploration of where the technique succeeds as well as its sources of error.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image models are becoming increasingly popular, revolutionizing the landscape of digital art creation by enabling highly detailed and creative visual content generation. These models have been widely employed across various domains, particularly in art generation, where they facilitate a broad spectrum of creative expression and democratize access to artistic creation. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{STYLEBREEDER}, a comprehensive dataset of 6.8M images and 1.8M prompts generated by 95K users on Artbreeder, a platform that has emerged as a significant hub for creative exploration with over 13M users. We introduce a series of tasks with this dataset aimed at identifying diverse artistic styles, generating personalized content, and recommending styles based on user interests. By documenting unique, user-generated styles that transcend conventional categories like 'cyberpunk' or 'Picasso,' we explore the potential for unique, crowd-sourced styles that could provide deep insights into the collective creative psyche of users worldwide. We also evaluate different personalization methods to enhance artistic expression and introduce a style atlas, making these models available in LoRA format for public use. Our research demonstrates the potential of text-to-image diffusion models to uncover and promote unique artistic expressions, further democratizing AI in art and fostering a more diverse and inclusive artistic community.

- **Summary**: Interleaved text-and-image generation has been an intriguing research direction, where the models are required to generate both images and text pieces in an arbitrary order. Despite the emerging advancements in interleaved generation, the progress in its evaluation still significantly lags behind. Existing evaluation benchmarks do not support arbitrarily interleaved images and text for both inputs and outputs, and they only cover a limited number of domains and use cases. Also, current works predominantly use similarity-based metrics which fall short in assessing the quality in open-ended scenarios. To this end, we introduce InterleavedBench, the first benchmark carefully curated for the evaluation of interleaved text-and-image generation. InterleavedBench features a rich array of tasks to cover diverse real-world use cases. In addition, we present InterleavedEval, a strong reference-free metric powered by GPT-4o to deliver accurate and explainable evaluation. We carefully define five essential evaluation aspects for InterleavedEval, including text quality, perceptual quality, image coherence, text-image coherence, and helpfulness, to ensure a comprehensive and fine-grained assessment. Through extensive experiments and rigorous human evaluation, we show that our benchmark and metric can effectively evaluate the existing models with a strong correlation with human judgments surpassing previous reference-based metrics. We also provide substantial findings and insights to foster future research in interleaved generation and its evaluation.

- **Summary**: Prototypical-part models are a popular interpretable alternative to black-box deep learning models for computer vision. However, they are difficult to train, with high sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning, inhibiting their application to new datasets and our understanding of which methods truly improve their performance. To facilitate the careful study of prototypical-part networks (ProtoPNets), we create a new framework for integrating components of prototypical-part models -- ProtoPNeXt. Using ProtoPNeXt, we show that applying Bayesian hyperparameter tuning and an angular prototype similarity metric to the original ProtoPNet is sufficient to produce new state-of-the-art accuracy for prototypical-part models on CUB-200 across multiple backbones. We further deploy this framework to jointly optimize for accuracy and prototype interpretability as measured by metrics included in ProtoPNeXt. Using the same resources, this produces models with substantially superior semantics and changes in accuracy between +1.3% and -1.5%. The code and trained models will be made publicly available upon publication.

- **Summary**: Diffusion distillation methods aim to compress the diffusion models into efficient one-step generators while trying to preserve quality. Among them, Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) offers a suitable framework for training general-form one-step generators, applicable beyond unconditional generation. In this work, we introduce its modification, called Regularized Distribution Matching Distillation, applicable to unpaired image-to-image (I2I) problems. We demonstrate its empirical performance in application to several translation tasks, including 2D examples and I2I between different image datasets, where it performs on par or better than multi-step diffusion baselines.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image generative models are capable of producing high-quality images that often faithfully depict concepts described using natural language. In this work, we comprehensively evaluate a range of text-to-image models on numerical reasoning tasks of varying difficulty, and show that even the most advanced models have only rudimentary numerical skills. Specifically, their ability to correctly generate an exact number of objects in an image is limited to small numbers, it is highly dependent on the context the number term appears in, and it deteriorates quickly with each successive number. We also demonstrate that models have poor understanding of linguistic quantifiers (such as "a few" or "as many as"), the concept of zero, and struggle with more advanced concepts such as partial quantities and fractional representations. We bundle prompts, generated images and human annotations into GeckoNum, a novel benchmark for evaluation of numerical reasoning.

- **Summary**: The forecasting of disease progression from images is a holy grail for clinical decision making. However, this task is complicated by the inherent high dimensionality, temporal sparsity and sampling irregularity in longitudinal image acquisitions. Existing methods often rely on extracting hand-crafted features and performing time-series analysis in this vector space, leading to a loss of rich spatial information within the images. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ImageFlowNet, a novel framework that learns latent-space flow fields that evolve multiscale representations in joint embedding spaces using neural ODEs and SDEs to model disease progression in the image domain. Notably, ImageFlowNet learns multiscale joint representation spaces by combining cohorts of patients together so that information can be transferred between the patient samples. The dynamics then provide plausible trajectories of progression, with the SDE providing alternative trajectories from the same starting point. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We then demonstrate ImageFlowNet's effectiveness through empirical evaluations on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in retinal geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma.
