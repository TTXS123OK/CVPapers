- **Summary**: Given a well-behaved neural network, is possible to identify its parent, based on which it was tuned? In this paper, we introduce a novel task known as neural lineage detection, aiming at discovering lineage relationships between parent and child models. Specifically, from a set of parent models, neural lineage detection predicts which parent model a child model has been fine-tuned from. We propose two approaches to address this task. (1) For practical convenience, we introduce a learning-free approach, which integrates an approximation of the finetuning process into the neural network representation similarity metrics, leading to a similarity-based lineage detection scheme. (2) For the pursuit of accuracy, we introduce a learning-based lineage detector comprising encoders and a transformer detector. Through experimentation, we have validated that our proposed learning-free and learning-based methods outperform the baseline in various learning settings and are adaptable to a variety of visual models. Moreover, they also exhibit the ability to trace cross-generational lineage, identifying not only parent models but also their ancestors.

- **Summary**: Deep generative models have garnered significant attention in low-level vision tasks due to their generative capabilities. Among them, diffusion model-based solutions, characterized by a forward diffusion process and a reverse denoising process, have emerged as widely acclaimed for their ability to produce samples of superior quality and diversity. This ensures the generation of visually compelling results with intricate texture information. Despite their remarkable success, a noticeable gap exists in a comprehensive survey that amalgamates these pioneering diffusion model-based works and organizes the corresponding threads. This paper proposes the comprehensive review of diffusion model-based techniques. We present three generic diffusion modeling frameworks and explore their correlations with other deep generative models, establishing the theoretical foundation. Following this, we introduce a multi-perspective categorization of diffusion models, considering both the underlying framework and the target task. Additionally, we summarize extended diffusion models applied in other tasks, including medical, remote sensing, and video scenarios. Moreover, we provide an overview of commonly used benchmarks and evaluation metrics. We conduct a thorough evaluation, encompassing both performance and efficiency, of diffusion model-based techniques in three prominent tasks. Finally, we elucidate the limitations of current diffusion models and propose seven intriguing directions for future research. This comprehensive examination aims to facilitate a profound understanding of the landscape surrounding denoising diffusion models in the context of low-level vision tasks. A curated list of diffusion model-based techniques in over 20 low-level vision tasks can be found at https://github.com/ChunmingHe/awesome-diffusion-models-in-low-level-vision.

- **Summary**: Efficient and robust grasp pose detection is vital for robotic manipulation. For general 6 DoF grasping, conventional methods treat all points in a scene equally and usually adopt uniform sampling to select grasp candidates. However, we discover that ignoring where to grasp greatly harms the speed and accuracy of current grasp pose detection methods. In this paper, we propose "graspness", a quality based on geometry cues that distinguishes graspable areas in cluttered scenes. A look-ahead searching method is proposed for measuring the graspness and statistical results justify the rationality of our method. To quickly detect graspness in practice, we develop a neural network named cascaded graspness model to approximate the searching process. Extensive experiments verify the stability, generality and effectiveness of our graspness model, allowing it to be used as a plug-and-play module for different methods. A large improvement in accuracy is witnessed for various previous methods after equipping our graspness model. Moreover, we develop GSNet, an end-to-end network that incorporates our graspness model for early filtering of low-quality predictions. Experiments on a large-scale benchmark, GraspNet-1Billion, show that our method outperforms previous arts by a large margin (30+ AP) and achieves a high inference speed. The library of GSNet has been integrated into AnyGrasp, which is at https://github.com/graspnet/anygrasp_sdk.

- **Summary**: Deep generator technology can produce high-quality fake videos that are indistinguishable, posing a serious social threat. Traditional forgery detection methods directly centralized training on data and lacked consideration of information sharing in non-public video data scenarios and data privacy. Naturally, the federated learning strategy can be applied for privacy protection, which aggregates model parameters of clients but not original data. However, simple federated learning can't achieve satisfactory performance because of poor generalization capabilities for the real hybrid-domain forgery dataset. To solve the problem, the paper proposes a novel federated face forgery detection learning with personalized representation. The designed Personalized Forgery Representation Learning aims to learn the personalized representation of each client to improve the detection performance of individual client models. In addition, a personalized federated learning training strategy is utilized to update the parameters of the distributed detection model. Here collaborative training is conducted on multiple distributed client devices, and shared representations of these client models are uploaded to the server side for aggregation. Experiments on several public face forgery detection datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared with state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Few-shot recognition aims to train a classification model with only a few labeled examples of pre-defined concepts, where annotation can be costly in a downstream task. In another related research area, zero-shot recognition, which assumes no access to any downstream-task data, has been greatly advanced by using pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this area, retrieval-augmented learning (RAL) effectively boosts zero-shot accuracy by retrieving and learning from external data relevant to downstream concepts. Motivated by these advancements, our work explores RAL for few-shot recognition. While seemingly straightforward despite being under-explored in the literature (till now!), we present novel challenges and opportunities for applying RAL for few-shot recognition. First, perhaps surprisingly, simply finetuning the VLM on a large amount of retrieved data barely surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot methods due to the imbalanced distribution of retrieved data and its domain gaps compared to few-shot annotated data. Second, finetuning a VLM on few-shot examples alone significantly outperforms prior methods, and finetuning on the mix of retrieved and few-shot data yields even better results. Third, to mitigate the imbalanced distribution and domain gap issue, we propose Stage-Wise Augmented fineTuning (SWAT) method, which involves end-to-end finetuning on mixed data for the first stage and retraining the classifier solely on the few-shot data in the second stage. Extensive experiments show that SWAT achieves the best performance on standard benchmark datasets, resoundingly outperforming prior works by ~10% in accuracy.

- **Summary**: Despite their remarkable successes, state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), including vision-and-language models (VLMs) and unimodal language models (ULMs), fail to understand precise semantics. For example, semantically equivalent sentences expressed using different lexical compositions elicit diverging representations. The degree of this divergence and its impact on encoded semantics is not very well understood. In this paper, we introduce the SUGARCREPE++ dataset to analyze the sensitivity of VLMs and ULMs to lexical and semantic alterations. Each sample in SUGARCREPE++ dataset consists of an image and a corresponding triplet of captions: a pair of semantically equivalent but lexically different positive captions and one hard negative caption. This poses a 3-way semantic (in)equivalence problem to the language models. We comprehensively evaluate VLMs and ULMs that differ in architecture, pre-training objectives and datasets to benchmark the performance of SUGARCREPE++ dataset. Experimental results highlight the difficulties of VLMs in distinguishing between lexical and semantic variations, particularly in object attributes and spatial relations. Although VLMs with larger pre-training datasets, model sizes, and multiple pre-training objectives achieve better performance on SUGARCREPE++, there is a significant opportunity for improvement. We show that all the models which achieve better performance on compositionality datasets need not perform equally well on SUGARCREPE++, signifying that compositionality alone may not be sufficient for understanding semantic and lexical alterations. Given the importance of the property that the SUGARCREPE++ dataset targets, it serves as a new challenge to the vision-and-language community.

  Pattern Recognition (pp. 3796-3806) 2024
- **Summary**: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation has witnessed great achievements with image-level labels. Several recent approaches use the CLIP model to generate pseudo labels for training an individual segmentation model, while there is no attempt to apply the CLIP model as the backbone to directly segment objects with image-level labels. In this paper, we propose WeCLIP, a CLIP-based single-stage pipeline, for weakly supervised semantic segmentation. Specifically, the frozen CLIP model is applied as the backbone for semantic feature extraction, and a new decoder is designed to interpret extracted semantic features for final prediction. Meanwhile, we utilize the above frozen backbone to generate pseudo labels for training the decoder. Such labels cannot be optimized during training. We then propose a refinement module (RFM) to rectify them dynamically. Our architecture enforces the proposed decoder and RFM to benefit from each other to boost the final performance. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms other approaches with less training cost. Additionally, our WeCLIP also obtains promising results for fully supervised settings.

- **Summary**: A recent frontier in computer vision has been the task of 3D video generation, which consists of generating a time-varying 3D representation of a scene. To generate dynamic 3D scenes, current methods explicitly model 3D temporal dynamics by jointly optimizing for consistency across both time and views of the scene. In this paper, we instead investigate whether it is necessary to explicitly enforce multiview consistency over time, as current approaches do, or if it is sufficient for a model to generate 3D representations of each timestep independently. We hence propose a model, Vid3D, that leverages 2D video diffusion to generate 3D videos by first generating a 2D "seed" of the video's temporal dynamics and then independently generating a 3D representation for each timestep in the seed video. We evaluate Vid3D against two state-of-the-art 3D video generation methods and find that Vid3D is achieves comparable results despite not explicitly modeling 3D temporal dynamics. We further ablate how the quality of Vid3D depends on the number of views generated per frame. While we observe some degradation with fewer views, performance degradation remains minor. Our results thus suggest that 3D temporal knowledge may not be necessary to generate high-quality dynamic 3D scenes, potentially enabling simpler generative algorithms for this task.

- **Summary**: Generative 3D Painting is among the top productivity boosters in high-resolution 3D asset management and recycling. Ever since text-to-image models became accessible for inference on consumer hardware, the performance of 3D Painting methods has consistently improved and is currently close to plateauing. At the core of most such models lies denoising diffusion in the latent space, an inherently time-consuming iterative process. Multiple techniques have been developed recently to accelerate generation and reduce sampling iterations by orders of magnitude. Designed for 2D generative imaging, these techniques do not come with recipes for lifting them into 3D. In this paper, we address this shortcoming by proposing a Latent Consistency Model (LCM) adaptation for the task at hand. We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed model and evaluate it quantitatively and qualitatively. Based on the Objaverse dataset samples study, our 3D painting method attains strong preference in all evaluations. Source code is available at https://github.com/kongdai123/consistency2.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We present a novel, training-free approach to scene change detection. Our method leverages tracking models, which inherently perform change detection between consecutive frames of video by identifying common objects and detecting new or missing objects. Specifically, our method takes advantage of the change detection effect of the tracking model by inputting reference and query images instead of consecutive frames. Furthermore, we focus on the content gap and style gap between two input images in change detection, and address both issues by proposing adaptive content threshold and style bridging layers, respectively. Finally, we extend our approach to video to exploit rich temporal information, enhancing scene change detection performance. We compare our approach and baseline through various experiments. While existing train-based baseline tend to specialize only in the trained domain, our method shows consistent performance across various domains, proving the competitiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: Severe convective weather events, such as hail, tornadoes, and thunderstorms, often occur quickly yet cause significant damage, costing billions of dollars every year. This highlights the importance of forecasting severe weather threats hours in advance to better prepare meteorologists and residents in at-risk areas. Can modern large foundation models perform such forecasting? Existing weather benchmarks typically focus only on predicting time-series changes in certain weather parameters (e.g., temperature, moisture) with text-only features. In this work, we introduce WeatherQA, the first multimodal dataset designed for machines to reason about complex combinations of weather parameters (a.k.a., ingredients) and predict severe weather in real-world scenarios. The dataset includes over 8,000 (multi-images, text) pairs for diverse severe weather events. Each pair contains rich information crucial for forecasting -- the images describe the ingredients capturing environmental instability, surface observations, and radar reflectivity, and the text contains forecast analyses written by human experts. With WeatherQA, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision language models , including GPT4, Claude3, Gemini-1.5, and a fine-tuned Llama3-based VLM, by designing two challenging tasks: (1) multi-choice QA for predicting affected area and (2) classification of the development potential of severe convection. These tasks require deep understanding of domain knowledge (e.g., atmospheric dynamics) and complex reasoning over multimodal data (e.g., interactions between weather parameters). We show a substantial gap between the strongest VLM, GPT4o, and human reasoning. Our comprehensive case study with meteorologists further reveals the weaknesses of the models, suggesting that better training and data integration are necessary to bridge this gap.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant promise in various applications, leading to broad interest from researchers and practitioners alike. However, a comprehensive evaluation of their long-context capabilities remains underexplored. To address these gaps, we introduce the MultiModal Needle-in-a-haystack (MMNeedle) benchmark, specifically designed to assess the long-context capabilities of MLLMs. Besides multi-image input, we employ image stitching to further increase the input context length, and develop a protocol to automatically generate labels for sub-image level retrieval. Essentially, MMNeedle evaluates MLLMs by stress-testing their capability to locate a target sub-image (needle) within a set of images (haystack) based on textual instructions and descriptions of image contents. This setup necessitates an advanced understanding of extensive visual contexts and effective information retrieval within long-context image inputs. With this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs, encompassing both API-based and open-source models. The findings reveal that GPT-4o consistently surpasses other models in long-context scenarios, but suffers from hallucination problems in negative samples, i.e., when needles are not in the haystacks. Our comprehensive long-context evaluation of MLLMs also sheds lights on the considerable performance gap between API-based and open-source models. All the code, data, and instructions required to reproduce the main results are available at https://github.com/Wang-ML-Lab/multimodal-needle-in-a-haystack.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel method designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of both image retrieval and pixel retrieval. Traditional diffusion methods struggle to propagate spatial information effectively in conventional graphs due to their reliance on scalar edge weights. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a hypergraph-based framework, uniquely capable of efficiently propagating spatial information using local features during query time, thereby accurately retrieving and localizing objects within a database.   Additionally, we innovatively utilize the structural information of the image graph through a technique we term "community selection". This approach allows for the assessment of the initial search result's uncertainty and facilitates an optimal balance between accuracy and speed. This is particularly crucial in real-world applications where such trade-offs are often necessary.   Our experimental results, conducted on the (P)ROxford and (P)RParis datasets, demonstrate the significant superiority of our method over existing diffusion techniques. We achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy in both image-level and pixel-level retrieval, while also maintaining impressive processing speed. This dual achievement underscores the effectiveness of our hypergraph-based framework and community selection technique, marking a notable advancement in the field of content-based image retrieval.

- **Summary**: Building an embodied agent system with a large language model (LLM) as its core is a promising direction. Due to the significant costs and uncontrollable factors associated with deploying and training such agents in the real world, we have decided to begin our exploration within the Minecraft environment. Our STEVE Series agents can complete basic tasks in a virtual environment and more challenging tasks such as navigation and even creative tasks, with an efficiency far exceeding previous state-of-the-art methods by a factor of $2.5\times$ to $7.3\times$. We begin our exploration with a vanilla large language model, augmenting it with a vision encoder and an action codebase trained on our collected high-quality dataset STEVE-21K. Subsequently, we enhanced it with a Critic and memory to transform it into a complex system. Finally, we constructed a hierarchical multi-agent system. Our recent work explored how to prune the agent system through knowledge distillation. In the future, we will explore more potential applications of STEVE agents in the real world.



### Mining Open Semantics from CLIP: A Relation Transition Perspective for Few-Shot Learning

- **Summary**: Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-training(CLIP) demonstrates impressive zero-shot capability. The key to improve the adaptation of CLIP to downstream task with few exemplars lies in how to effectively model and transfer the useful knowledge embedded in CLIP. Previous work mines the knowledge typically based on the limited visual samples and close-set semantics (i.e., within target category set of downstream task). However, the aligned CLIP image/text encoders contain abundant relationships between visual features and almost infinite open semantics, which may benefit the few-shot learning but remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose to mine open semantics as anchors to perform a relation transition from image-anchor relationship to image-target relationship to make predictions. Specifically, we adopt a transformer module which takes the visual feature as "Query", the text features of the anchors as "Key" and the similarity matrix between the text features of anchor and target classes as "Value". In this way, the output of such a transformer module represents the relationship between the image and target categories, i.e., the classification predictions. To avoid manually selecting the open semantics, we make the [CLASS] token of input text embedding learnable. We conduct extensive experiments on eleven representative classification datasets. The results show that our method performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts considering few-shot classification settings.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a novel path to $\textit{general}$ human motion generation by focusing on 2D space. Traditional methods have primarily generated human motions in 3D, which, while detailed and realistic, are often limited by the scope of available 3D motion data in terms of both the size and the diversity. To address these limitations, we exploit extensive availability of 2D motion data. We present $\textbf{Holistic-Motion2D}$, the first comprehensive and large-scale benchmark for 2D whole-body motion generation, which includes over 1M in-the-wild motion sequences, each paired with high-quality whole-body/partial pose annotations and textual descriptions. Notably, Holistic-Motion2D is ten times larger than the previously largest 3D motion dataset. We also introduce a baseline method, featuring innovative $\textit{whole-body part-aware attention}$ and $\textit{confidence-aware modeling}$ techniques, tailored for 2D $\underline{\text T}$ext-driv$\underline{\text{EN}}$ whole-bo$\underline{\text D}$y motion gen$\underline{\text{ER}}$ation, namely $\textbf{Tender}$. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of $\textbf{Holistic-Motion2D}$ and $\textbf{Tender}$ in generating expressive, diverse, and realistic human motions. We also highlight the utility of 2D motion for various downstream applications and its potential for lifting to 3D motion. The page link is: https://holistic-motion2d.github.io.

- **Summary**: Maintaining road pavement integrity is crucial for ensuring safe and efficient transportation. Conventional methods for assessing pavement condition are often laborious and susceptible to human error. This paper proposes YOLO9tr, a novel lightweight object detection model for pavement damage detection, leveraging the advancements of deep learning. YOLO9tr is based on the YOLOv9 architecture, incorporating a partial attention block that enhances feature extraction and attention mechanisms, leading to improved detection performance in complex scenarios. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising road damage images from multiple countries, including an expanded set of damage categories beyond the standard four. This broadened classification range allows for a more accurate and realistic assessment of pavement conditions. Comparative analysis demonstrates YOLO9tr's superior precision and inference speed compared to state-of-the-art models like YOLO8, YOLO9 and YOLO10, achieving a balance between computational efficiency and detection accuracy. The model achieves a high frame rate of up to 136 FPS, making it suitable for real-time applications such as video surveillance and automated inspection systems. The research presents an ablation study to analyze the impact of architectural modifications and hyperparameter variations on model performance, further validating the effectiveness of the partial attention block. The results highlight YOLO9tr's potential for practical deployment in real-time pavement condition monitoring, contributing to the development of robust and efficient solutions for maintaining safe and functional road infrastructure.

- **Summary**: Talking head generation based on the neural radiation fields model has shown promising visual effects. However, the slow rendering speed of NeRF seriously limits its application, due to the burdensome calculation process over hundreds of sampled points to synthesize one pixel. In this work, a novel Neural Light Dynamic Fields model is proposed aiming to achieve generating high quality 3D talking face with significant speedup. The NLDF represents light fields based on light segments, and a deep network is used to learn the entire light beam's information at once. In learning the knowledge distillation is applied and the NeRF based synthesized result is used to guide the correct coloration of light segments in NLDF. Furthermore, a novel active pool training strategy is proposed to focus on high frequency movements, particularly on the speaker mouth and eyebrows. The propose method effectively represents the facial light dynamics in 3D talking video generation, and it achieves approximately 30 times faster speed compared to state of the art NeRF based method, with comparable generation visual quality.

- **Summary**: We propose to use machine-generated instruction-following data to improve the zero-shot capabilities of a large multimodal model with additional support for generative and image editing tasks. We achieve this by curating a new multimodal instruction-following set using GPT-4V and existing datasets for image generation and editing. Using this instruction set and the existing LLaVA-Finetune instruction set for visual understanding tasks, we produce GenLLaVA, a Generative Large Language, and Visual Assistant. GenLLaVA is built through a strategy that combines three types of large pre-trained models through instruction finetuning: LLaMA for language modeling, SigLIP for image-text matching, and StableDiffusion for text-to-image generation. Our model demonstrates visual understanding capabilities on par with LLaVA and additionally demonstrates competitive results with native multimodal models such as Unified-IO 2, paving the way for building advanced general-purpose visual assistants by effectively re-using existing multimodal models. We open-source our dataset, codebase, and model checkpoints to foster further research and application in this domain.

- **Summary**: In 3D LiDAR-based robot self-localization, pole-like landmarks are gaining popularity as lightweight and discriminative landmarks. This work introduces a novel approach called "discriminative rotation-invariant poles," which enhances the discriminability of pole-like landmarks while maintaining their lightweight nature. Unlike conventional methods that model a pole landmark as a 3D line segment perpendicular to the ground, we propose a simple yet powerful approach that includes not only the line segment's main body but also its surrounding local region of interest (ROI) as part of the pole landmark. Specifically, we describe the appearance, geometry, and semantic features within this ROI to improve the discriminability of the pole landmark. Since such pole landmarks are no longer rotation-invariant, we introduce a novel rotation-invariant convolutional neural network that automatically and efficiently extracts rotation-invariant features from input point clouds for recognition. Furthermore, we train a pole dictionary through unsupervised learning and use it to compress poles into compact pole words, thereby significantly reducing real-time costs while maintaining optimal self-localization performance. Monte Carlo localization experiments using publicly available NCLT dataset demonstrate that the proposed method improves a state-of-the-art pole-based localization framework.

- **Summary**: Multimodal interleaved datasets featuring free-form interleaved sequences of images and text are crucial for training frontier large multimodal models (LMMs). Despite the rapid progression of open-source LMMs, there remains a pronounced scarcity of large-scale, diverse open-source multimodal interleaved datasets. In response, we introduce MINT-1T, the most extensive and diverse open-source Multimodal INTerleaved dataset to date. MINT-1T comprises one trillion text tokens and three billion images, a 10x scale-up from existing open-source datasets. Additionally, we include previously untapped sources such as PDFs and ArXiv papers. As scaling multimodal interleaved datasets requires substantial engineering effort, sharing the data curation process and releasing the dataset greatly benefits the community. Our experiments show that LMMs trained on MINT-1T rival the performance of models trained on the previous leading dataset, OBELICS. Our data and code will be released at https://github.com/mlfoundations/MINT-1T.

- **Summary**: Aligning Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) face challenges such as modality misalignment and verbose responses. Although iterative approaches such as self-rewarding or iterative direct preference optimization (DPO) recently showed a significant improvement in language model alignment, particularly on reasoning tasks, self-aligned models applied to large video-language models often result in lengthy and irrelevant responses. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that employs self-retrospection to enhance both response generation and preference modeling, and call iterative self-retrospective judgment (i-SRT). By revisiting and evaluating already generated content and preference in loop, i-SRT improves the alignment between textual and visual modalities, reduce verbosity, and enhances content relevance. Our empirical evaluations across diverse video question answering benchmarks demonstrate that i-SRT significantly outperforms prior arts. We are committed to opensourcing our code, models, and datasets to encourage further investigation.

- **Summary**: The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to resolve societal challenges, such as eradicating poverty and improving the lives of vulnerable populations in impoverished areas. Those areas rely on road infrastructure construction to promote accessibility and economic development. Although publicly available data like OpenStreetMap is available to monitor road status, data completeness in impoverished areas is limited. Meanwhile, the development of deep learning techniques and satellite imagery shows excellent potential for earth monitoring. To tackle the challenge of road network assessment in impoverished areas, we develop a systematic road extraction framework combining an encoder-decoder architecture and morphological operations on satellite imagery, offering an integrated workflow for interdisciplinary researchers. Extensive experiments of road network extraction on real-world data in impoverished regions achieve a 42.7% enhancement in the F1-score over the baseline methods and reconstruct about 80% of the actual roads. We also propose a comprehensive road network dataset covering approximately 794,178 km2 area and 17.048 million people in 382 impoverished counties in China. The generated dataset is further utilized to conduct socioeconomic analysis in impoverished counties, showing that road network construction positively impacts regional economic development.

- **Summary**: The field of self-supervised 3D representation learning has emerged as a promising solution to alleviate the challenge presented by the scarcity of extensive, well-annotated datasets. However, it continues to be hindered by the lack of diverse, large-scale, real-world 3D scene datasets for source data. To address this shortfall, we propose Generalizable Representation Learning (GRL), where we devise a generative Bayesian network to produce diverse synthetic scenes with real-world patterns, and conduct pre-training with a joint objective. By jointly learning a coarse-to-fine contrastive learning task and an occlusion-aware reconstruction task, the model is primed with transferable, geometry-informed representations. Post pre-training on synthetic data, the acquired knowledge of the model can be seamlessly transferred to two principal downstream tasks associated with 3D scene understanding, namely 3D object detection and 3D semantic segmentation, using real-world benchmark datasets. A thorough series of experiments robustly display our method's consistent superiority over existing state-of-the-art pre-training approaches.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have significantly improved multimodal reasoning tasks, such as visual question answering and image captioning. These models embed multimodal facts within their parameters, rather than relying on external knowledge bases to store factual information explicitly. However, the content discerned by LVLMs may deviate from actual facts due to inherent bias or incorrect inference. To address this issue, we introduce MFC-Bench, a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the factual accuracy of LVLMs across three tasks: Manipulation, Out-of-Context, and Veracity Classification. Through our evaluation on MFC-Bench, we benchmarked 12 diverse and representative LVLMs, uncovering that current models still fall short in multimodal fact-checking and demonstrate insensitivity to various forms of manipulated content. We hope that MFC-Bench could raise attention to the trustworthy artificial intelligence potentially assisted by LVLMs in the future. The MFC-Bench and accompanying resources are publicly accessible at https://github.com/wskbest/MFC-Bench, contributing to ongoing research in the multimodal fact-checking field.

- **Summary**: Despite significant breakthroughs in video analysis driven by the rapid development of large multimodal models (LMMs), there remains a lack of a versatile evaluation benchmark to comprehensively assess these models' performance in video understanding and reasoning. To address this, we present VideoVista, a video QA benchmark that integrates challenges across diverse content categories, durations, and abilities. Specifically, VideoVista comprises 25,000 questions derived from 3,400 videos spanning 14 categories (e.g., Howto, Film, and Entertainment) with durations ranging from a few seconds to over 10 minutes. Besides, it encompasses 19 types of understanding tasks (e.g., anomaly detection, interaction understanding) and 8 reasoning tasks (e.g., logical reasoning, causal reasoning). To achieve this, we present an automatic data construction framework, leveraging powerful GPT-4o alongside advanced analysis tools (e.g., video splitting, object segmenting, and tracking). We also utilize this framework to construct training data to enhance the capabilities of video-related LMMs (Video-LMMs). Through a comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of cutting-edge models, we reveal that: 1) Video-LMMs face difficulties in fine-grained video tasks involving temporal location, object tracking, and anomaly detection; 2) Video-LMMs present inferior logical and relation reasoning abilities; 3) Open-source Video-LMMs' performance is significantly lower than GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5, lagging by 20 points. This highlights the crucial role VideoVista will play in advancing LMMs that can accurately understand videos and perform precise reasoning.

- **Summary**: Large-scale pretrained vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot image classification capabilities across diverse domains. To enhance CLIP's performance while preserving the zero-shot paradigm, various test-time prompt tuning methods have been introduced to refine class embeddings through unsupervised learning objectives during inference. However, these methods often encounter challenges in selecting appropriate learning rates to prevent collapsed training in the absence of validation data during test-time adaptation. In this study, we propose a novel backpropagation-free algorithm BaFTA for test-time adaptation of vision-language models. Instead of fine-tuning text prompts to refine class embeddings, our approach directly estimates class centroids using online clustering within a projected embedding space that aligns text and visual embeddings. We dynamically aggregate predictions from both estimated and original class embeddings, as well as from distinct augmented views, by assessing the reliability of each prediction using R\'enyi Entropy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that BaFTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods in both effectiveness and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple institutes to train models collaboratively without sharing private data. Current FL research focuses on communication efficiency, privacy protection, and personalization and assumes that the data of FL have already been ideally collected. In medical scenarios, however, data annotation demands both expertise and intensive labor, which is a critical problem in FL. Active learning (AL), has shown promising performance in reducing the number of data annotations in medical image analysis. We propose a federated AL (FedAL) framework in which AL is executed periodically and interactively under FL. We exploit a local model in each hospital and a global model acquired from FL to construct an ensemble. We use ensemble-entropy-based AL as an efficient data-annotation strategy in FL. Therefore, our FedAL framework can decrease the amount of annotated data and preserve patient privacy while maintaining the performance of FL. To our knowledge, this is the first FedAL framework applied to medical images. We validated our framework on real-world dermoscopic datasets. Using only 50% of samples, our framework was able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a skin-lesion classification task. Our framework performed better than several state-of-the-art AL methods under FL and achieved comparable performance to full-data FL.

- **Summary**: The use of synthetic data in indoor 3D object detection offers the potential of greatly reducing the manual labor involved in 3D annotations and training effective zero-shot detectors. However, the complicated domain shifts across syn-to-real indoor datasets remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel Object-wise Hierarchical Domain Alignment (OHDA) framework for syn-to-real unsupervised domain adaptation in indoor 3D object detection. Our approach includes an object-aware augmentation strategy to effectively diversify the source domain data, and we introduce a two-branch adaptation framework consisting of an adversarial training branch and a pseudo labeling branch, in order to simultaneously reach holistic-level and class-level domain alignment. The pseudo labeling is further refined through two proposed schemes specifically designed for indoor UDA. Our adaptation results from synthetic dataset 3D-FRONT to real-world datasets ScanNetV2 and SUN RGB-D demonstrate remarkable mAP25 improvements of 9.7% and 9.1% over Source-Only baselines, respectively, and consistently outperform the methods adapted from 2D and 3D outdoor scenarios. The code will be publicly available upon paper acceptance.

- **Summary**: 3D object detection is crucial for applications like autonomous driving and robotics. However, in real-world environments, variations in sensor data distribution due to sensor upgrades, weather changes, and geographic differences can adversely affect detection performance. Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA) aims to mitigate these challenges by transferring knowledge from a source domain, abundant in labeled data, to a target domain where labels are scarce. This paper presents a new SSDA method referred to as Target-Oriented Domain Augmentation (TODA) specifically tailored for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. TODA efficiently utilizes all available data, including labeled data in the source domain, and both labeled data and unlabeled data in the target domain to enhance domain adaptation performance. TODA consists of two stages: TargetMix and AdvMix. TargetMix employs mixing augmentation accounting for LiDAR sensor characteristics to facilitate feature alignment between the source-domain and target-domain. AdvMix applies point-wise adversarial augmentation with mixing augmentation, which perturbs the unlabeled data to align the features within both labeled and unlabeled data in the target domain. Our experiments conducted on the challenging domain adaptation tasks demonstrate that TODA outperforms existing domain adaptation techniques designed for 3D object detection by significant margins.

- **Summary**: Given the lidar measurements from an autonomous vehicle, we can project the points and generate a sparse depth image. Depth completion aims at increasing the resolution of such a depth image by infilling and interpolating the sparse depth values. Like most existing approaches, we make use of camera images as guidance in very sparse or occluded regions. In addition, we propose a temporal algorithm that utilizes information from previous timesteps using recurrence. In this work, we show how a state-of-the-art method PENet can be modified to benefit from recurrency. Our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results on the KITTI depth completion dataset while adding only less than one percent of additional overhead in terms of both neural network parameters and floating point operations. The accuracy is especially improved for faraway objects and regions containing a low amount of lidar depth samples. Even in regions without any ground truth (like sky and rooftops) we observe large improvements which are not captured by the existing evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Utilizing Graphic User Interface (GUI) for human-computer interaction is essential for accessing a wide range of digital tools. Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) highlight the compelling potential to develop versatile agents to help humans finish GUI navigation tasks. However, current VLMs are challenged in terms of fundamental abilities (OCR and grounding) and GUI knowledge (the functions and control methods of GUI elements), preventing them from becoming practical GUI agents. To solve these challenges, we contribute GUICourse, a suite of datasets to train visual-based GUI agents from general VLMs. First, we introduce the GUIEnv dataset to strengthen the OCR and grounding capabilities of VLMs. Then, we introduce the GUIAct and GUIChat datasets to enrich their knowledge of GUI components and interactions. Experiments demonstrate that our GUI agents have better performance on common GUI tasks than their baseline VLMs. Even the small-size GUI agent (with 3.1B parameters) can still work well on single-step and multi-step GUI tasks. Finally, we analyze the different varieties in the training stage of this agent by ablation study. Our source codes and datasets are released at https://github.com/yiye3/GUICourse.

- **Summary**: Transmitting Earth observation image data from satellites to ground stations incurs significant costs in terms of power and bandwidth. For maritime ship detection, on-board data processing can identify ships and reduce the amount of data sent to the ground. However, most images captured on board contain only bodies of water or land, with the Airbus Ship Detection dataset showing only 22.1\% of images containing ships. We designed a low-power, two-stage system to optimize performance instead of relying on a single complex model. The first stage is a lightweight binary classifier that acts as a gating mechanism to detect the presence of ships. This stage runs on Brainchip's Akida 1.0, which leverages activation sparsity to minimize dynamic power consumption. The second stage employs a YOLOv5 object detection model to identify the location and size of ships. This approach achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 76.9\%, which increases to 79.3\% when evaluated solely on images containing ships, by reducing false positives. Additionally, we calculated that evaluating the full validation set on a NVIDIA Jetson Nano device requires 111.4 kJ of energy. Our two-stage system reduces this energy consumption to 27.3 kJ, which is less than a fourth, demonstrating the efficiency of a heterogeneous computing system.

Existing methods, including proxy encoding and geometry encoding, incorporate additional syntax to encode the object's location, bringing extra burdens in training MLLMs to communicate between language and vision. This study presents ClawMachine, offering a new methodology that notates an entity directly using the visual tokens. It allows us to unify the prompt and answer of visual referential tasks without additional syntax. Upon a joint vision-language vocabulary, ClawMachine unifies visual referring and grounding into an auto-regressive format and learns with a decoder-only architecture. Experiments validate that our model achieves competitive performance across visual referring and grounding tasks with a reduced demand for training data. Additionally, ClawMachine demonstrates a native ability to integrate multi-source information for complex visual reasoning, which prior MLLMs can hardly perform without specific adaptions.

- **Summary**: The field of image deblurring has seen tremendous progress with the rise of deep learning models. These models, albeit efficient, are computationally expensive and energy consuming. Dictionary based learning approaches have shown promising results in image denoising and Single Image Super-Resolution. We propose an extension of the Rapid and Accurate Image Super-Resolution (RAISR) algorithm introduced by Isidoro, Romano and Milanfar for the task of out-of-focus blur removal. We define a sharpness quality measure which aligns well with the perceptual quality of an image. A metric based blending strategy based on asset allocation management is also proposed. Our method demonstrates an average increase of approximately 13% (PSNR) and 10% (SSIM) compared to popular deblurring methods. Furthermore, our blending scheme curtails ringing artefacts post restoration.

- **Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP are powerful models; however they can exhibit unwanted biases, making them less safe when deployed directly in applications such as text-to-image, text-to-video retrievals, reverse search, or classification tasks. In this work, we propose a novel framework to generate synthetic counterfactual images to create a diverse and balanced dataset that can be used to fine-tune CLIP. Given a set of diverse synthetic base images from text-to-image models, we leverage off-the-shelf segmentation and inpainting models to place humans with diverse visual appearances in context. We show that CLIP trained on such datasets learns to disentangle the human appearance from the context of an image, i.e., what makes a doctor is not correlated to the person's visual appearance, like skin color or body type, but to the context, such as background, the attire they are wearing, or the objects they are holding. We demonstrate that our fine-tuned CLIP model, $CF_\alpha$, improves key fairness metrics such as MaxSkew, MinSkew, and NDKL by 40-66\% for image retrieval tasks, while still achieving similar levels of performance in downstream tasks. We show that, by design, our model retains maximal compatibility with the original CLIP models, and can be easily controlled to support different accuracy versus fairness trade-offs in a plug-n-play fashion.

- **Summary**: Recently, multimodal large language models have made significant advancements in video understanding tasks. However, their ability to understand unprocessed long videos is very limited, primarily due to the difficulty in supporting the enormous memory overhead. Although existing methods achieve a balance between memory and information by aggregating frames, they inevitably introduce the severe hallucination issue. To address this issue, this paper constructs a comprehensive hallucination mitigation pipeline based on existing MLLMs. Specifically, we use the CLIP Score to guide the frame sampling process with questions, selecting key frames relevant to the question. Then, We inject question information into the queries of the image Q-former to obtain more important visual features. Finally, during the answer generation stage, we utilize chain-of-thought and in-context learning techniques to explicitly control the generation of answers. It is worth mentioning that for the breakpoint mode, we found that image understanding models achieved better results than video understanding models. Therefore, we aggregated the answers from both types of models using a comparison mechanism. Ultimately, We achieved 84.2\% and 62.9\% for the global and breakpoint modes respectively on the MovieChat dataset, surpassing the official baseline model by 29.1\% and 24.1\%. Moreover the proposed method won the third place in the CVPR LOVEU 2024 Long-Term Video Question Answering Challenge. The code is avaiable at https://github.com/lntzm/CVPR24Track-LongVideo

- **Summary**: Driver action recognition has significantly advanced in enhancing driver-vehicle interactions and ensuring driving safety by integrating multiple modalities, such as infrared and depth. Nevertheless, compared to RGB modality only, it is always laborious and costly to collect extensive data for all types of non-RGB modalities in car cabin environments. Therefore, previous works have suggested independently learning each non-RGB modality by fine-tuning a model pre-trained on RGB videos, but these methods are less effective in extracting informative features when faced with newly-incoming modalities due to large domain gaps. In contrast, we propose a Continual Cross-Modal Mapping Network (CM2-Net) to continually learn each newly-incoming modality with instructive prompts from the previously-learned modalities. Specifically, we have developed Accumulative Cross-modal Mapping Prompting (ACMP), to map the discriminative and informative features learned from previous modalities into the feature space of newly-incoming modalities. Then, when faced with newly-incoming modalities, these mapped features are able to provide effective prompts for which features should be extracted and prioritized. These prompts are accumulating throughout the continual learning process, thereby boosting further recognition performances. Extensive experiments conducted on the Drive&Act dataset demonstrate the performance superiority of CM2-Net on both uni- and multi-modal driver action recognition.

- **Summary**: Humans can retain old knowledge while learning new information, but Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when post-pretrained or supervised fine-tuned (SFT) on domain-specific data. Moreover, for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) which are composed of the LLM base and visual projector (e.g. LLaVA), a significant decline in performance on language benchmarks was observed compared to their single-modality counterparts. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel model-agnostic self-decompression method, Tree Generation (TG), that decompresses knowledge within LLMs into the training corpus. This paper focuses on TG-SFT, which can synthetically generate SFT data for the instruction tuning steps. By incorporating the dumped corpus during SFT for MLLMs, we significantly reduce the forgetting problem.

- **Summary**: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) has been extensively explored and demonstrated, yet its application to polarization remains largely unexplored. Due to the selective transmission of light by polarized filters, longer exposure times are typically required to ensure sufficient light intensity, which consequently lower the temporal sample rates. Furthermore, because polarization reflected by objects varies with shooting perspective, focusing solely on estimating pixel displacement is insufficient to accurately reconstruct the intermediate polarization. To tackle these challenges, this study proposes a multi-stage and multi-scale network called Swin-VFI based on the Swin-Transformer and introduces a tailored loss function to facilitate the network's understanding of polarization changes. To ensure the practicality of our proposed method, this study evaluates its interpolated frames in Shape from Polarization (SfP) and Human Shape Reconstruction tasks, comparing them with other state-of-the-art methods such as CAIN, FLAVR, and VFIT. Experimental results demonstrate our approach's superior reconstruction accuracy across all tasks.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary part segmentation (OVPS) is an emerging research area focused on segmenting fine-grained entities based on diverse and previously unseen vocabularies. Our study highlights the inherent complexities of part segmentation due to intricate boundaries and diverse granularity, reflecting the knowledge-based nature of part identification. To address these challenges, we propose PartCLIPSeg, a novel framework utilizing generalized parts and object-level contexts to mitigate the lack of generalization in fine-grained parts. PartCLIPSeg integrates competitive part relationships and attention control techniques, alleviating ambiguous boundaries and underrepresented parts. Experimental results demonstrate that PartCLIPSeg outperforms existing state-of-the-art OVPS methods, offering refined segmentation and an advanced understanding of part relationships in images. Through extensive experiments, our model demonstrated an improvement over the state-of-the-art models on the Pascal-Part-116, ADE20K-Part-234, and PartImageNet datasets.

- **Summary**: In industrial scenarios, effective human-robot collaboration relies on multi-camera systems to robustly monitor human operators despite the occlusions that typically show up in a robotic workcell. In this scenario, precise localization of the person in the robot coordinate system is essential, making the hand-eye calibration of the camera network critical. This process presents significant challenges when high calibration accuracy should be achieved in short time to minimize production downtime, and when dealing with extensive camera networks used for monitoring wide areas, such as industrial robotic workcells. Our paper introduces an innovative and robust multi-camera hand-eye calibration method, designed to optimize each camera's pose relative to both the robot's base and to each other camera. This optimization integrates two types of key constraints: i) a single board-to-end-effector transformation, and ii) the relative camera-to-camera transformations. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method through comprehensive experiments employing the METRIC dataset and real-world data collected on industrial scenarios, showing notable advancements over state-of-the-art techniques even using less than 10 images. Additionally, we release an open-source version of our multi-camera hand-eye calibration algorithm at https://github.com/davidea97/Multi-Camera-Hand-Eye-Calibration.git.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Foundation Models (MMFMs) have shown remarkable performance on various computer vision and natural language processing tasks. However, their performance on particular tasks such as document understanding is still limited. They also require more compute, time, and engineering resources to finetune and deploy compared to traditional, unimodal models. In this report, we present Multimodal Structured Generation, a general framework which constrains the output logits of frozen MMFMs to force them to reason before responding with structured outputs that downstream APIs can parse and use. We provide a detailed account of our approach, including the technical details, theoretical discussions, and final evaluation results in the 2nd Multimodal Foundation Models Challenge hosted by the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) conference. Our approach achieved the second highest score in the hidden test set for Phase 2 and third highest overall. This shows the method's ability to generalize to unseen tasks. And that simple engineering can beat expensive & complicated modelling steps as we first discussed in our paper, Retrieval Augmented Structured Generation: Business Document Information Extraction as Tool Use.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces AnyTrans, an all-encompassing framework for the task-Translate AnyText in the Image (TATI), which includes multilingual text translation and text fusion within images. Our framework leverages the strengths of large-scale models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and text-guided diffusion models, to incorporate contextual cues from both textual and visual elements during translation. The few-shot learning capability of LLMs allows for the translation of fragmented texts by considering the overall context. Meanwhile, the advanced inpainting and editing abilities of diffusion models make it possible to fuse translated text seamlessly into the original image while preserving its style and realism. Additionally, our framework can be constructed entirely using open-source models and requires no training, making it highly accessible and easily expandable. To encourage advancement in the TATI task, we have meticulously compiled a test dataset called MTIT6, which consists of multilingual text image translation data from six language pairs.

- **Summary**: Large-scale point cloud consists of a multitude of individual objects, thereby encompassing rich structural and underlying semantic contextual information, resulting in a challenging problem in efficiently segmenting a point cloud. Most existing researches mainly focus on capturing intricate local features without giving due consideration to global ones, thus failing to leverage semantic context. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Weighted Convolution and local-global Fusion Network, named SWCF-Net, which takes into account both local and global features. We propose a Similarity-Weighted Convolution (SWConv) to effectively extract local features, where similarity weights are incorporated into the convolution operation to enhance the generalization capabilities. Then, we employ a downsampling operation on the K and V channels within the attention module, thereby reducing the quadratic complexity to linear, enabling the Transformer to deal with large-scale point clouds. At last, orthogonal components are extracted in the global features and then aggregated with local features, thereby eliminating redundant information between local and global features and consequently promoting efficiency. We evaluate SWCF-Net on large-scale outdoor datasets SemanticKITTI and Toronto3D. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network. Our method achieves a competitive result with less computational cost, and is able to handle large-scale point clouds efficiently.

- **Summary**: Video processing is generally divided into two main categories: processing of the entire video, which typically yields optimal classification outcomes, and real-time processing, where the objective is to make a decision as promptly as possible. The latter is often driven by the need to identify rapidly potential critical or dangerous situations. These could include machine failure, traffic accidents, heart problems, or dangerous behavior. Although the models dedicated to the processing of entire videos are typically well-defined and clearly presented in the literature, this is not the case for online processing, where a plethora of hand-devised methods exist. To address this, we present \our{}, a novel, unified, and theoretically-based adaptation framework for dealing with the online classification problem for video data. The initial phase of our study is to establish a robust mathematical foundation for the theory of classification of sequential data, with the potential to make a decision at an early stage. This allows us to construct a natural function that encourages the model to return an outcome much faster. The subsequent phase is to demonstrate a straightforward and readily implementable method for adapting offline models to online and recurrent operations. Finally, by comparing the proposed approach to the non-online state-of-the-art baseline, it is demonstrated that the use of \our{} encourages the network to make earlier classification decisions without compromising accuracy.

- **Summary**: Cardiac digital twins are personalized virtual representations used to understand complex heart mechanisms. Solving the ECG inverse problem is crucial for accurate virtual heart modelling, enabling the derivation of internal electrical activity information from recorded surface potentials. Despite challenges from cardiac complexity, noisy ECG data, and computational efficiency, recent advancements hold significant promise for enhancing virtual heart modelling, ultimately advancing precision medicine in cardiology. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the methods of solving ECG inverse problem, the validation strategies, the clinical applications, and future perspectives. For the computing methodologies, we broadly classify state-of-the-art approaches into two categories: deterministic and probabilistic methods, including conventional and deep learning-based techniques. Integrating physics laws with deep learning models holds promise, but challenges such as capturing dynamic electrophysiology accurately, accessing accurate domain knowledge, and quantifying prediction uncertainty persist. Integrating models into clinical workflows while ensuring interpretability and usability for healthcare professionals is essential. Overcoming these challenges will drive further research in cardiac digital twins.

- **Summary**: When Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are applied to multimodal medical generative tasks, they suffer from significant model hallucination issues. This severely impairs the model's generative accuracy, making it challenging for LVLMs to be implemented in real-world medical scenarios to assist doctors in diagnosis. Enhancing the training data for downstream medical generative tasks is an effective way to address model hallucination. Moreover, the limited availability of training data in the medical field and privacy concerns greatly hinder the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a method that mimics human cognitive processes to construct fine-grained instruction pairs and apply the concept of chain-of-thought (CoT) from inference scenarios to training scenarios, thereby proposing a method called MedThink. Our experiments on various LVLMs demonstrate that our novel data construction method tailored for the medical domain significantly improves the model's performance in medical image report generation tasks and substantially mitigates the hallucinations. All resources of this work will be released soon.

- **Summary**: We consider calibration of convolutional classifiers for diagnostic decision making. Clinical decision makers can use calibrated classifiers to minimise expected costs given their own cost function. Such functions are usually unknown at training time. If minimising expected costs is the primary aim, algorithms should focus on tuning calibration in regions of probability simplex likely to effect decisions. We give an example, modifying temperature scaling calibration, and demonstrate improved calibration where it matters using convnets trained to classify dermoscopy images.

- **Summary**: Interactive image segmentation enables users to interact minimally with a machine, facilitating the gradual refinement of the segmentation mask for a target of interest. Previous studies have demonstrated impressive performance in extracting a single target mask through interactive segmentation. However, the information cues of previously interacted objects have been overlooked in the existing methods, which can be further explored to speed up interactive segmentation for multiple targets in the same category. To this end, we introduce novel interactive segmentation frameworks for both a single object and multiple objects in the same category. Specifically, our model leverages transformer backbones to extract interaction-focused visual features from the image and the interactions to obtain a satisfactory mask of a target as an exemplar. For multiple objects, we propose an exemplar-informed module to enhance the learning of similarities among the objects of the target category. To combine attended features from different modules, we incorporate cross-attention blocks followed by a feature fusion module. Experiments conducted on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that our models achieve superior performance compared to previous methods. Particularly, our model reduces users' labor by around 15\%, requiring two fewer clicks to achieve target IoUs 85\% and 90\%. The results highlight our models' potential as a flexible and practical annotation tool. The source code will be released after publication.

- **Summary**: Large language models have seen widespread adoption in math problem-solving. However, in geometry problems that usually require visual aids for better understanding, even the most advanced multi-modal models currently still face challenges in effectively using image information. High-quality data is crucial for enhancing the geometric capabilities of multi-modal models, yet existing open-source datasets and related efforts are either too challenging for direct model learning or suffer from misalignment between text and images. To overcome this issue, we introduce a novel pipeline that leverages GPT-4 and GPT-4V to generate relatively basic geometry problems with aligned text and images, facilitating model learning. We have produced a dataset of 4.9K geometry problems and combined it with 19K open-source data to form our GeoGPT4V dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the GeoGPT4V dataset significantly improves the geometry performance of various models on the MathVista and MathVision benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Image anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in industrial inspection. Traditional approaches often demand distinct models for specific categories, resulting in substantial deployment costs. This raises concerns about multi-class anomaly detection, where a unified model is developed for multiple classes. However, applying conventional methods, particularly reconstruction-based models, directly to multi-class scenarios encounters challenges such as identical shortcut learning, hindering effective discrimination between normal and abnormal instances. To tackle this issue, our study introduces the Prior Normality Prompt Transformer (PNPT) method for multi-class image anomaly detection. PNPT strategically incorporates normal semantics prompting to mitigate the "identical mapping" problem. This entails integrating a prior normality prompt into the reconstruction process, yielding a dual-stream model. This innovative architecture combines normal prior semantics with abnormal samples, enabling dual-stream reconstruction grounded in both prior knowledge and intrinsic sample characteristics. PNPT comprises four essential modules: Class-Specific Normality Prompting Pool (CS-NPP), Hierarchical Patch Embedding (HPE), Semantic Alignment Coupling Encoding (SACE), and Contextual Semantic Conditional Decoding (CSCD). Experimental validation on diverse benchmark datasets and real-world industrial applications highlights PNPT's superior performance in multi-class industrial anomaly detection.

- **Summary**: Foundation models (FMs) are revolutionizing the analysis and understanding of remote sensing (RS) scenes, including aerial RGB, multispectral, and SAR images. However, hyperspectral images (HSIs), which are rich in spectral information, have not seen much application of FMs, with existing methods often restricted to specific tasks and lacking generality. To fill this gap, we introduce HyperSIGMA, a vision transformer-based foundation model for HSI interpretation, scalable to over a billion parameters. To tackle the spectral and spatial redundancy challenges in HSIs, we introduce a novel sparse sampling attention (SSA) mechanism, which effectively promotes the learning of diverse contextual features and serves as the basic block of HyperSIGMA. HyperSIGMA integrates spatial and spectral features using a specially designed spectral enhancement module. In addition, we construct a large-scale hyperspectral dataset, HyperGlobal-450K, for pre-training, which contains about 450K hyperspectral images, significantly surpassing existing datasets in scale. Extensive experiments on various high-level and low-level HSI tasks demonstrate HyperSIGMA's versatility and superior representational capability compared to current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, HyperSIGMA shows significant advantages in scalability, robustness, cross-modal transferring capability, and real-world applicability.

- **Summary**: The perturbation test remains the go-to evaluation approach for explanation methods in computer vision. This evaluation method has a major drawback of test-time distribution shift due to pixel-masking that is not present in the training set. To overcome this drawback, we propose a novel evaluation framework called \textbf{Inpainting the Gaps (InG)}. Specifically, we propose inpainting parts that constitute partial or complete objects in an image. In this way, one can perform meaningful image perturbations with lower test-time distribution shifts, thereby improving the efficacy of the perturbation test. InG is applied to the PartImageNet dataset to evaluate the performance of popular explanation methods for three training strategies of the Vision Transformer (ViT). Based on this evaluation, we found Beyond Intuition and Generic Attribution to be the two most consistent explanation models. Further, and interestingly, the proposed framework results in higher and more consistent evaluation scores across all the ViT models considered in this work. To the best of our knowledge, InG is the first semi-synthetic framework for the evaluation of ViT explanation methods.

- **Summary**: The dramatic surge in the utilisation of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) underscores the need for a secure and efficient mechanism to responsibly manage, use and disseminate multi-dimensional data generated by artificial intelligence (AI). In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based copyright traceability framework called ring oscillator-singular value decomposition (RO-SVD), which introduces decomposition computing to approximate low-rank matrices generated from hardware entropy sources and establishes an AI-generated content (AIGC) copyright traceability mechanism at the device level. By leveraging the parallelism and reconfigurability of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), our framework can be easily constructed on existing AI-accelerated devices and provide a low-cost solution to emerging copyright issues of AIGC. We developed a hardware-software (HW/SW) co-design prototype based on comprehensive analysis and on-board experiments with multiple AI-applicable FPGAs. Using AI-generated images as a case study, our framework demonstrated effectiveness and emphasised customisation, unpredictability, efficiency, management and reconfigurability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical hardware study discussing and implementing copyright traceability specifically for AI-generated content.

- **Summary**: The problem of artifacts in whole slide image acquisition, prevalent in both clinical workflows and research-oriented settings, necessitates human intervention and re-scanning. Overcoming this challenge requires developing quality control algorithms, that are hindered by the limited availability of relevant annotated data in histopathology. The manual annotation of ground-truth for artifact detection methods is expensive and time-consuming. This work addresses the issue by proposing a method dedicated to augmenting whole slide images with artifacts. The tool seamlessly generates and blends artifacts from an external library to a given histopathology dataset. The augmented datasets are then utilized to train artifact classification methods. The evaluation shows their usefulness in classification of the artifacts, where they show an improvement from 0.10 to 0.01 AUROC depending on the artifact type. The framework, model, weights, and ground-truth annotations are freely released to facilitate open science and reproducible research.

- **Summary**: The ability to reflect on and correct failures is crucial for robotic systems to interact stably with real-life objects.Observing the generalization and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), previous approaches have aimed to utilize these models to enhance robotic systems accordingly.However, these methods typically focus on high-level planning corrections using an additional MLLM, with limited utilization of failed samples to correct low-level contact poses. To address this gap, we propose an Autonomous Interactive Correction (AIC) MLLM, which makes use of previous low-level interaction experiences to correct SE(3) pose predictions. Specifically, AIC MLLM is initially fine-tuned to acquire both pose prediction and feedback prompt comprehension abilities.We carefully design two types of prompt instructions through interactions with objects: 1) visual masks to highlight unmovable parts for position correction, and 2)textual descriptions to indicate potential directions for rotation correction.During inference, a Feedback Information Extraction module is introduced to recognize the failure cause, allowing AIC MLLM to adaptively correct the pose prediction using the corresponding prompts.To further enhance manipulation stability, we devise a Test Time Adaptation strategy that enables AIC MLLM to better adapt to the current scene configuration.Finally, extensive experiments are conducted in both simulated and real-world environments to evaluate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that our AIC MLLM can efficiently correct failure samples by leveraging interaction experience prompts.Real-world demonstration can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/aic-mllm

- **Summary**: Fine-Grained Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (FG-SBIR) aims to minimize the distance between sketches and corresponding images in the embedding space. However, scalability is hindered by the growing complexity of solutions, mainly due to the abstract nature of fine-grained sketches. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient approach to narrow the gap between the two modes. It mainly facilitates unified mutual information sharing both intra- and inter-samples, rather than treating them as a single feature alignment problem between modalities. Specifically, our approach includes: (i) Employing dual weight-sharing networks to optimize alignment within sketch and image domain, which also effectively mitigates model learning saturation issues. (ii) Introducing an objective optimization function based on contrastive loss to enhance the model's ability to align features intra- and inter-samples. (iii) Presenting a learnable TRSM combined of self-attention and cross-attention to promote feature representations among tokens, further enhancing sample alignment in the embedding space. Our framework achieves excellent results on CNN- and ViT-based backbones. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority over existing methods. We also introduce Cloths-V1, the first professional fashion sketches and images dataset, utilized to validate our method and will be beneficial for other applications.

- **Summary**: Color image inpainting is a challenging task in imaging science. The existing method is based on real operation, and the red, green and blue channels of the color image are processed separately, ignoring the correlation between each channel. In order to make full use of the correlation between each channel, this paper proposes a Quaternion Generative Adversarial Neural Network (QGAN) model and related theory, and applies it to solve the problem of color image inpainting with large area missing. Firstly, the definition of quaternion deconvolution is given and the quaternion batch normalization is proposed. Secondly, the above two innovative modules are applied to generate adversarial networks to improve stability. Finally, QGAN is applied to color image inpainting and compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results show that QGAN has superiority in color image inpainting with large area missing.

- **Summary**: The vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks to adversarial perturbations presents significant security concerns, as the imperceptible perturbations can contaminate the feature space and lead to incorrect predictions. Recent studies have attempted to calibrate contaminated features by either suppressing or over-activating particular channels. Despite these efforts, we claim that adversarial attacks exhibit varying disruption levels across individual channels. Furthermore, we argue that harmonizing feature maps via graph and employing graph convolution can calibrate contaminated features. To this end, we introduce an innovative plug-and-play module called Feature Map-based Reconstructed Graph Convolution (FMR-GC). FMR-GC harmonizes feature maps in the channel dimension to reconstruct the graph, then employs graph convolution to capture neighborhood information, effectively calibrating contaminated features. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superior performance and scalability of FMR-GC. Moreover, our model can be combined with advanced adversarial training methods to considerably enhance robustness without compromising the model's clean accuracy.

- **Summary**: We introduce Duoduo CLIP, a model for 3D representation learning that learns shape encodings from multi-view images instead of point-clouds. The choice of multi-view images allows us to leverage 2D priors from off-the-shelf CLIP models to facilitate fine-tuning with 3D data. Our approach not only shows better generalization compared to existing point cloud methods, but also reduces GPU requirements and training time. In addition, we modify the model with cross-view attention to leverage information across multiple frames of the object which further boosts performance. Compared to the current SOTA point cloud method that requires 480 A100 hours to train 1 billion model parameters we only require 57 A5000 hours and 87 million parameters. Multi-view images also provide more flexibility in use cases compared to point clouds. This includes being able to encode objects with a variable number of images, with better performance when more views are used. This is in contrast to point cloud based methods, where an entire scan or model of an object is required. We showcase this flexibility with object retrieval from images of real-world objects. Our model also achieves better performance in more fine-grained text to shape retrieval, demonstrating better text-and-shape alignment than point cloud based models.

- **Summary**: In this research work we have proposed high-level ChildDiffusion framework capable of generating photorealistic child facial samples and further embedding several intelligent augmentations on child facial data using short text prompts, detailed textual guidance from LLMs, and further image to image transformation using text guidance control conditioning thus providing an opportunity to curate fully synthetic large scale child datasets. The framework is validated by rendering high-quality child faces representing ethnicity data, micro expressions, face pose variations, eye blinking effects, facial accessories, different hair colours and styles, aging, multiple and different child gender subjects in a single frame. Addressing privacy concerns regarding child data acquisition requires a comprehensive approach that involves legal, ethical, and technological considerations. Keeping this in view this framework can be adapted to synthesise child facial data which can be effectively used for numerous downstream machine learning tasks. The proposed method circumvents common issues encountered in generative AI tools, such as temporal inconsistency and limited control over the rendered outputs. As an exemplary use case we have open-sourced child ethnicity data consisting of 2.5k child facial samples of five different classes which includes African, Asian, White, South Asian/ Indian, and Hispanic races by deploying the model in production inference phase. The rendered data undergoes rigorous qualitative as well as quantitative tests to cross validate its efficacy and further fine-tuning Yolo architecture for detecting and classifying child ethnicity as an exemplary downstream machine learning task.

- **Summary**: Hierarchical semantic classification requires the prediction of a taxonomy tree instead of a single flat level of the tree, where both accuracies at individual levels and consistency across levels matter. We can train classifiers for individual levels, which has accuracy but not consistency, or we can train only the finest level classification and infer higher levels, which has consistency but not accuracy. Our key insight is that hierarchical recognition should not be treated as multi-task classification, as each level is essentially a different task and they would have to compromise with each other, but be grounded on image segmentations that are consistent across semantic granularities. Consistency can in fact improve accuracy. We build upon recent work on learning hierarchical segmentation for flat-level recognition, and extend it to hierarchical recognition. It naturally captures the intuition that fine-grained recognition requires fine image segmentation whereas coarse-grained recognition requires coarse segmentation; they can all be integrated into one recognition model that drives fine-to-coarse internal visual parsing.Additionally, we introduce a Tree-path KL Divergence loss to enforce consistent accurate predictions across levels. Our extensive experimentation and analysis demonstrate our significant gains on predicting an accurate and consistent taxonomy tree.

- **Summary**: Motion forecasting transforms sequences of past movements and environment context into future motion. Recent methods rely on learned representations, resulting in hidden states that are difficult to interpret. In this work, we use natural language to quantize motion features in a human-interpretable way, and measure the degree to which they are embedded in hidden states. Our experiments reveal that hidden states of motion sequences are arranged with respect to our discrete sets of motion features. Following these insights, we fit control vectors to motion features, which allow for controlling motion forecasts at inference. Consequently, our method enables controlling transformer-based motion forecasting models with textual inputs, providing a unique interface to interact with and understand these models.

- **Summary**: Scientific documents record research findings and valuable human knowledge, comprising a vast corpus of high-quality data. Leveraging multi-modality data extracted from these documents and assessing large models' abilities to handle scientific document-oriented tasks is therefore meaningful. Despite promising advancements, large models still perform poorly on multi-page scientific document extraction and understanding tasks, and their capacity to process within-document data formats such as charts and equations remains under-explored. To address these issues, we present DocGenome, a structured document benchmark constructed by annotating 500K scientific documents from 153 disciplines in the arXiv open-access community, using our custom auto-labeling pipeline. DocGenome features four key characteristics: 1) Completeness: It is the first dataset to structure data from all modalities including 13 layout attributes along with their LaTeX source codes. 2) Logicality: It provides 6 logical relationships between different entities within each scientific document. 3) Diversity: It covers various document-oriented tasks, including document classification, visual grounding, document layout detection, document transformation, open-ended single-page QA and multi-page QA. 4) Correctness: It undergoes rigorous quality control checks conducted by a specialized team. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the advantages of DocGenome and objectively evaluate the performance of large models on our benchmark.

- **Summary**: Segmentation models for brain lesions in MRI are commonly developed for a specific disease and trained on data with a predefined set of MRI modalities. Each such model cannot segment the disease using data with a different set of MRI modalities, nor can it segment any other type of disease. Moreover, this training paradigm does not allow a model to benefit from learning from heterogeneous databases that may contain scans and segmentation labels for different types of brain pathologies and diverse sets of MRI modalities. Is it feasible to use Federated Learning (FL) for training a single model on client databases that contain scans and labels of different brain pathologies and diverse sets of MRI modalities? We demonstrate promising results by combining appropriate, simple, and practical modifications to the model and training strategy: Designing a model with input channels that cover the whole set of modalities available across clients, training with random modality drop, and exploring the effects of feature normalization methods. Evaluation on 7 brain MRI databases with 5 different diseases shows that such FL framework can train a single model that is shown to be very promising in segmenting all disease types seen during training. Importantly, it is able to segment these diseases in new databases that contain sets of modalities different from those in training clients. These results demonstrate, for the first time, feasibility and effectiveness of using FL to train a single segmentation model on decentralised data with diverse brain diseases and MRI modalities, a necessary step towards leveraging heterogeneous real-world databases.

- **Summary**: Predominant methods for image-based drone detection frequently rely on employing generic object detection algorithms like YOLOv5. While proficient in identifying drones against homogeneous backgrounds, these algorithms often struggle in complex, highly textured environments. In such scenarios, drones seamlessly integrate into the background, creating camouflage effects that adversely affect the detection quality. To address this issue, we introduce a novel deep learning architecture called YOLO-FEDER FusionNet. Unlike conventional approaches, YOLO-FEDER FusionNet combines generic object detection methods with the specialized strength of camouflage object detection techniques to enhance drone detection capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations of YOLO-FEDER FusionNet show the efficiency of the proposed model and demonstrate substantial improvements in both reducing missed detections and false alarms.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image based object customization, aiming to generate images with the same identity (ID) as objects of interest in accordance with text prompts and reference images, has made significant progress. However, recent customizing research is dominated by specialized tasks, such as human customization or virtual try-on, leaving a gap in general object customization. To this end, we introduce AnyMaker, an innovative zero-shot object customization framework capable of generating general objects with high ID fidelity and flexible text editability. The efficacy of AnyMaker stems from its novel general ID extraction, dual-level ID injection, and ID-aware decoupling. Specifically, the general ID extraction module extracts sufficient ID information with an ensemble of self-supervised models to tackle the diverse customization tasks for general objects. Then, to provide the diffusion UNet with the extracted ID as much while not damaging the text editability in the generation process, we design a global-local dual-level ID injection module, in which the global-level semantic ID is injected into text descriptions while the local-level ID details are injected directly into the model through newly added cross-attention modules. In addition, we propose an ID-aware decoupling module to disentangle ID-related information from non-ID elements in the extracted representations for high-fidelity generation of both identity and text descriptions. To validate our approach and boost the research of general object customization, we create the first large-scale general ID dataset, Multi-Category ID-Consistent (MC-IDC) dataset, with 315k text-image samples and 10k categories. Experiments show that AnyMaker presents remarkable performance in general object customization and outperforms specialized methods in corresponding tasks. Code and dataset will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Seams are areas of overlapping fabric formed by stitching two or more pieces of fabric together in the cut-and-sew apparel manufacturing process. In SeamPose, we repurposed seams as capacitive sensors in a shirt for continuous upper-body pose estimation. Compared to previous all-textile motion-capturing garments that place the electrodes on the surface of clothing, our solution leverages existing seams inside of a shirt by machine-sewing insulated conductive threads over the seams. The unique invisibilities and placements of the seams afford the sensing shirt to look and wear the same as a conventional shirt while providing exciting pose-tracking capabilities. To validate this approach, we implemented a proof-of-concept untethered shirt. With eight capacitive sensing seams, our customized deep-learning pipeline accurately estimates the upper-body 3D joint positions relative to the pelvis. With a 12-participant user study, we demonstrated promising cross-user and cross-session tracking performance. SeamPose represents a step towards unobtrusive integration of smart clothing for everyday pose estimation.

- **Summary**: Intraoperative medical imaging, particularly Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), is an important tool facilitating computer aided interventions, despite a lower visual quality. While this degraded image quality can affect downstream segmentation, the availability of high quality preoperative scans represents potential for improvements. Here we consider a setting where preoperative CT and intraoperative CBCT scans are available, however, the alignment (registration) between the scans is imperfect. We propose a multimodal learning method that fuses roughly aligned CBCT and CT scans and investigate the effect of CBCT quality and misalignment (affine and elastic transformations facilitating misalignment) on the final segmentation performance. As an application scenario, we focus on the segmentation of liver and liver tumor semantic segmentation and evaluate the effect of intraoperative image quality and misalignment on segmentation performance. To accomplish this, high quality, labelled CTs are defined as preoperative and used as a basis to simulate intraoperative CBCT. We show that the fusion of preoperative CT and simulated, intraoperative CBCT mostly improves segmentation performance and that even clearly misaligned preoperative data has the potential to improve segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has gained significant attention in medical image segmentation. However, the limited availability of annotated training data presents a challenge to achieving accurate results. In efforts to overcome this challenge, data augmentation techniques have been proposed. However, the majority of these approaches primarily focus on image generation. For segmentation tasks, providing both images and their corresponding target masks is crucial, and the generation of diverse and realistic samples remains a complex task, especially when working with limited training datasets. To this end, we propose a new end-to-end hybrid architecture based on Hamiltonian Variational Autoencoders (HVAE) and a discriminative regularization to improve the quality of generated images. Our method provides an accuracte estimation of the joint distribution of the images and masks, resulting in the generation of realistic medical images with reduced artifacts and off-distribution instances. As generating 3D volumes requires substantial time and memory, our architecture operates on a slice-by-slice basis to segment 3D volumes, capitilizing on the richly augmented dataset. Experiments conducted on two public datasets, BRATS (MRI modality) and HECKTOR (PET modality), demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method on different medical imaging modalities with limited data.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) can respond to queries about images in many languages. However, beyond language, culture affects how we see things. For example, individuals from Western cultures focus more on the central figure in an image while individuals from Eastern cultures attend more to scene context. In this work, we present a novel investigation that demonstrates and localizes VLMs' Western bias in image understanding. We evaluate large VLMs across subjective and objective visual tasks with culturally diverse images and annotations. We find that VLMs perform better on the Western subset than the Eastern subset of each task. Controlled experimentation tracing the source of this bias highlights the importance of a diverse language mix in text-only pre-training for building equitable VLMs, even when inference is performed in English. Moreover, while prompting in the language of a target culture can lead to reductions in bias, it is not a substitute for building AI more representative of the world's languages.

- **Summary**: 3D reconstruction from multi-view images is one of the fundamental challenges in computer vision and graphics. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising technique capable of real-time rendering with high-quality 3D reconstruction. This method utilizes 3D Gaussian representation and tile-based splatting techniques, bypassing the expensive neural field querying. Despite its potential, 3DGS encounters challenges, including needle-like artifacts, suboptimal geometries, and inaccurate normals, due to the Gaussians converging into anisotropic Gaussians with one dominant variance. We propose using effective rank analysis to examine the shape statistics of 3D Gaussian primitives, and identify the Gaussians indeed converge into needle-like shapes with the effective rank 1. To address this, we introduce effective rank as a regularization, which constrains the structure of the Gaussians. Our new regularization method enhances normal and geometry reconstruction while reducing needle-like artifacts. The approach can be integrated as an add-on module to other 3DGS variants, improving their quality without compromising visual fidelity.

- **Summary**: This paper studies the problem of pre-training for small models, which is essential for many mobile devices. Current state-of-the-art methods on this problem transfer the representational knowledge of a large network (as a Teacher) into a smaller model (as a Student) using self-supervised distillation, improving the performance of the small model on downstream tasks. However, existing approaches are insufficient in extracting the crucial knowledge that is useful for discerning categories in downstream tasks during the distillation process. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce language guidance to the distillation process and propose a new method named Language-Guided Distillation (LGD) system, which uses category names of the target downstream task to help refine the knowledge transferred between the teacher and student. To this end, we utilize a pre-trained text encoder to extract semantic embeddings from language and construct a textual semantic space called Textual Semantics Bank (TSB). Furthermore, we design a Language-Guided Knowledge Aggregation (LGKA) module to construct the visual semantic space, also named Visual Semantics Bank (VSB). The task-related knowledge is transferred by driving a student encoder to mimic the similarity score distribution inferred by a teacher over TSB and VSB. Compared with other small models obtained by either ImageNet pre-training or self-supervised distillation, experiment results show that the distilled lightweight model using the proposed LGD method presents state-of-the-art performance and is validated on various downstream tasks, including classification, detection, and segmentation. We have made the code available at https://github.com/mZhenz/LGD.

- **Summary**: Trajectory prediction forecasts nearby agents' moves based on their historical trajectories. Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous vehicles. Existing attacks compromise the prediction model of a victim AV by directly manipulating the historical trajectory of an attacker AV, which has limited real-world applicability. This paper, for the first time, explores an indirect attack approach that induces prediction errors via attacks against the perception module of a victim AV. Although it has been shown that physically realizable attacks against LiDAR-based perception are possible by placing a few objects at strategic locations, it is still an open challenge to find an object location from the vast search space in order to launch effective attacks against prediction under varying victim AV velocities.   Through analysis, we observe that a prediction model is prone to an attack focusing on a single point in the scene. Consequently, we propose a novel two-stage attack framework to realize the single-point attack. The first stage of prediction-side attack efficiently identifies, guided by the distribution of detection results under object-based attacks against perception, the state perturbations for the prediction model that are effective and velocity-insensitive. In the second stage of location matching, we match the feasible object locations with the found state perturbations. Our evaluation using a public autonomous driving dataset shows that our attack causes a collision rate of up to 63% and various hazardous responses of the victim AV. The effectiveness of our attack is also demonstrated on a real testbed car. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first security analysis spanning from LiDAR-based perception to prediction in autonomous driving, leading to a realistic attack on prediction. To counteract the proposed attack, potential defenses are discussed.

- **Summary**: Depth completion is the task of generating a dense depth map given an image and a sparse depth map as inputs. It has important applications in various downstream tasks. In this paper, we present OGNI-DC, a novel framework for depth completion. The key to our method is "Optimization-Guided Neural Iterations" (OGNI). It consists of a recurrent unit that refines a depth gradient field and a differentiable depth integrator that integrates the depth gradients into a depth map. OGNI-DC exhibits strong generalization, outperforming baselines by a large margin on unseen datasets and across various sparsity levels. Moreover, OGNI-DC has high accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the NYUv2 and the KITTI benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/princeton-vl/OGNI-DC.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models are emerging as powerful solutions for generating high-fidelity and diverse images, often surpassing GANs under many circumstances. However, their slow inference speed hinders their potential for real-time applications. To address this, DiffusionGAN leveraged a conditional GAN to drastically reduce the denoising steps and speed up inference. Its advancement, Wavelet Diffusion, further accelerated the process by converting data into wavelet space, thus enhancing efficiency. Nonetheless, these models still fall short of GANs in terms of speed and image quality. To bridge these gaps, this paper introduces the Latent Denoising Diffusion GAN, which employs pre-trained autoencoders to compress images into a compact latent space, significantly improving inference speed and image quality. Furthermore, we propose a Weighted Learning strategy to enhance diversity and image quality. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, and LSUN-Church datasets prove that our model achieves state-of-the-art running speed among diffusion models. Compared to its predecessors, DiffusionGAN and Wavelet Diffusion, our model shows remarkable improvements in all evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: We present, for the first time, a novel theoretical approach to address the problem of correspondence free multivector cloud registration in conformal geometric algebra. Such formalism achieves several favorable properties. Primarily, it forms an orthogonal automorphism that extends beyond the typical vector space to the entire conformal geometric algebra while respecting the multivector grading. Concretely, the registration can be viewed as an orthogonal transformation (\it i.e., scale, translation, rotation) belonging to $SO(4,1)$ - group of special orthogonal transformations in conformal geometric algebra. We will show that such formalism is able to: $(i)$ perform the registration without directly accessing the input multivectors. Instead, we use primitives or geometric objects provided by the conformal model - the multivectors, $(ii)$ the geometric objects are obtained by solving a multilinear eigenvalue problem to find sets of eigenmultivectors. In this way, we can explicitly avoid solving the correspondences in the registration process. Most importantly, this offers rotation and translation equivariant properties between the input multivectors and the eigenmultivectors. Experimental evaluation is conducted in datasets commonly used in point cloud registration, to testify the usefulness of the approach with emphasis to ambiguities arising from high levels of noise. The code is available at https://github.com/Numerical-Geometric-Algebra/RegistrationGA . This work was submitted to the International Journal of Computer Vision and is currently under review.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have unmatched fidelity on large, real-world scenes. A common approach for scaling NeRFs is to partition the scene into regions, each of which is assigned its own parameters. When implemented naively, such an approach is limited by poor test-time scaling and inconsistent appearance and geometry. We instead propose InterNeRF, a novel architecture for rendering a target view using a subset of the model's parameters. Our approach enables out-of-core training and rendering, increasing total model capacity with only a modest increase to training time. We demonstrate significant improvements in multi-room scenes while remaining competitive on standard benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Detecting objects in real-world scenes is a complex task due to various challenges, including the vast range of object categories, and potential encounters with previously unknown or unseen objects. The challenges necessitate the development of public benchmarks and challenges to advance the field of object detection. Inspired by the success of previous COCO and LVIS Challenges, we organize the V3Det Challenge 2024 in conjunction with the 4th Open World Vision Workshop: Visual Perception via Learning in an Open World (VPLOW) at CVPR 2024, Seattle, US. This challenge aims to push the boundaries of object detection research and encourage innovation in this field. The V3Det Challenge 2024 consists of two tracks: 1) Vast Vocabulary Object Detection: This track focuses on detecting objects from a large set of 13204 categories, testing the detection algorithm's ability to recognize and locate diverse objects. 2) Open Vocabulary Object Detection: This track goes a step further, requiring algorithms to detect objects from an open set of categories, including unknown objects. In the following sections, we will provide a comprehensive summary and analysis of the solutions submitted by participants. By analyzing the methods and solutions presented, we aim to inspire future research directions in vast vocabulary and open-vocabulary object detection, driving progress in this field.

- **Summary**: We address the problem of estimating the relative 6D pose, i.e., position and orientation, of a target spacecraft, from a monocular image, a key capability for future autonomous Rendezvous and Proximity Operations. Due to the difficulty of acquiring large sets of real images, spacecraft pose estimation networks are exclusively trained on synthetic ones. However, because those images do not capture the illumination conditions encountered in orbit, pose estimation networks face a domain gap problem, i.e., they do not generalize to real images. Our work introduces a method that bridges this domain gap. It relies on a novel, end-to-end, neural-based architecture as well as a novel learning strategy. This strategy improves the domain generalization abilities of the network through multi-task learning and aggressive data augmentation policies, thereby enforcing the network to learn domain-invariant features. We demonstrate that our method effectively closes the domain gap, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the widespread SPEED+ dataset. Finally, ablation studies assess the impact of key components of our method on its generalization abilities.

- **Summary**: Neural implicit representations such as NeRF have revolutionized 3D scene representation with photo-realistic quality. However, existing methods for visual localization within NeRF representations suffer from inefficiency and scalability issues, particularly in large-scale environments. This work proposes MatLoc-NeRF, a novel matching-based localization framework using selected NeRF features. It addresses efficiency by employing a learnable feature selection mechanism that identifies informative NeRF features for matching with query images. This eliminates the need for all NeRF features or additional descriptors, leading to faster and more accurate pose estimation. To tackle large-scale scenes, MatLoc-NeRF utilizes a pose-aware scene partitioning strategy. It ensures that only the most relevant NeRF sub-block generates key features for a specific pose. Additionally, scene segmentation and a place predictor provide fast coarse initial pose estimation. Evaluations on public large-scale datasets demonstrate that MatLoc-NeRF achieves superior efficiency and accuracy compared to existing NeRF-based localization methods.

- **Summary**: A de facto standard in solving computer vision problems is to use a common high-resolution camera and choose its placement on an agent (i.e., position and orientation) based on human intuition. On the other hand, extremely simple and well-designed visual sensors found throughout nature allow many organisms to perform diverse, complex behaviors. In this work, motivated by these examples, we raise the following questions: 1. How effective simple visual sensors are in solving vision tasks? 2. What role does their design play in their effectiveness? We explore simple sensors with resolutions as low as one-by-one pixel, representing a single photoreceptor First, we demonstrate that just a few photoreceptors can be enough to solve many tasks, such as visual navigation and continuous control, reasonably well, with performance comparable to that of a high-resolution camera. Second, we show that the design of these simple visual sensors plays a crucial role in their ability to provide useful information and successfully solve these tasks. To find a well-performing design, we present a computational design optimization algorithm and evaluate its effectiveness across different tasks and domains, showing promising results. Finally, we perform a human survey to evaluate the effectiveness of intuitive designs devised manually by humans, showing that the computationally found design is among the best designs in most cases.

- **Summary**: Significant advancements in the field of wood species identification are needed worldwide to support sustainable timber trade. In this work we contribute to automate the identification of wood species via high-resolution macroscopic images of timber. The main challenge of this problem is that fine-grained patterns in timber are crucial in order to accurately identify wood species, and these patterns are not properly learned by traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on low/medium resolution images.   We propose a Timber Deep Learning Identification with Patch-based Inference Voting methodology, abbreviated TDLI-PIV methodology. Our proposal exploits the concept of patching and the availability of high-resolution macroscopic images of timber in order to overcome the inherent challenges that CNNs face in timber identification. The TDLI-PIV methodology is able to capture fine-grained patterns in timber and, moreover, boosts robustness and prediction accuracy via a collaborative voting inference process.   In this work we also introduce a new data set of marcroscopic images of timber, called GOIMAI-Phase-I, which has been obtained using optical magnification in order to capture fine-grained details, which contrasts to the other datasets that are publicly available. More concretely, images in GOIMAI-Phase-I are taken with a smartphone with a 24x magnifying lens attached to the camera. Our data set contains 2120 images of timber and covers 37 legally protected wood species.   Our experiments have assessed the performance of the TDLI-PIV methodology, involving the comparison with other methodologies available in the literature, exploration of data augmentation methods and the effect that the dataset size has on the accuracy of TDLI-PIV.

- **Summary**: Benchmarks for large multimodal language models (MLMs) now serve to simultaneously assess the general capabilities of models instead of evaluating for a specific capability. As a result, when a developer wants to identify which models to use for their application, they are overwhelmed by the number of benchmarks and remain uncertain about which benchmark's results are most reflective of their specific use case. This paper introduces Task-Me-Anything, a benchmark generation engine which produces a benchmark tailored to a user's needs. Task-Me-Anything maintains an extendable taxonomy of visual assets and can programmatically generate a vast number of task instances. Additionally, it algorithmically addresses user queries regarding MLM performance efficiently within a computational budget. It contains 113K images, 10K videos, 2K 3D object assets, over 365 object categories, 655 attributes, and 335 relationships. It can generate 750M image/video question-answering pairs, which focus on evaluating MLM perceptual capabilities. Task-Me-Anything reveals critical insights: open-source MLMs excel in object and attribute recognition but lack spatial and temporal understanding; each model exhibits unique strengths and weaknesses; larger models generally perform better, though exceptions exist; and GPT4o demonstrates challenges in recognizing rotating/moving objects and distinguishing colors.

- **Summary**: H&E-to-IHC stain translation techniques offer a promising solution for precise cancer diagnosis, especially in low-resource regions where there is a shortage of health professionals and limited access to expensive equipment. Considering the pixel-level misalignment of H&E-IHC image pairs, current research explores the pathological consistency between patches from the same positions of the image pair. However, most of them overemphasize the correspondence between domains or patches, overlooking the side information provided by the non-corresponding objects. In this paper, we propose a Mix-Domain Contrastive Learning (MDCL) method to leverage the supervision information in unpaired H&E-to-IHC stain translation. Specifically, the proposed MDCL method aggregates the inter-domain and intra-domain pathology information by estimating the correlation between the anchor patch and all the patches from the matching images, encouraging the network to learn additional contrastive knowledge from mixed domains. With the mix-domain pathology information aggregation, MDCL enhances the pathological consistency between the corresponding patches and the component discrepancy of the patches from the different positions of the generated IHC image. Extensive experiments on two H&E-to-IHC stain translation datasets, namely MIST and BCI, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) models have made substantial progress in generating images from textual prompts. However, they frequently fail to produce images consistent with physical commonsense, a vital capability for applications in world simulation and everyday tasks. Current T2I evaluation benchmarks focus on metrics such as accuracy, bias, and safety, neglecting the evaluation of models' internal knowledge, particularly physical commonsense. To address this issue, we introduce PhyBench, a comprehensive T2I evaluation dataset comprising 700 prompts across 4 primary categories: mechanics, optics, thermodynamics, and material properties, encompassing 31 distinct physical scenarios. We assess 6 prominent T2I models, including proprietary models DALLE3 and Gemini, and demonstrate that incorporating physical principles into prompts enhances the models' ability to generate physically accurate images. Our findings reveal that: (1) even advanced models frequently err in various physical scenarios, except for optics; (2) GPT-4o, with item-specific scoring instructions, effectively evaluates the models' understanding of physical commonsense, closely aligning with human assessments; and (3) current T2I models are primarily focused on text-to-image translation, lacking profound reasoning regarding physical commonsense. We advocate for increased attention to the inherent knowledge within T2I models, beyond their utility as mere image generation tools. The code and data are available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/PhyBench.

- **Summary**: The limited size of pain datasets are a challenge in developing robust deep learning models for pain recognition. Transfer learning approaches are often employed in these scenarios. In this study, we investigate whether deep learned feature representation for one type of experimentally induced pain can be transferred to another. Participating in the AI4Pain challenge, our goal is to classify three levels of pain (No-Pain, Low-Pain, High-Pain). The challenge dataset contains data collected from 65 participants undergoing varying intensities of electrical pain. We utilize the video recording from the dataset to investigate the transferability of deep learned heat pain model to electrical pain. In our proposed approach, we leverage an existing heat pain convolutional neural network (CNN) - trained on BioVid dataset - as a feature extractor. The images from the challenge dataset are inputted to the pre-trained heat pain CNN to obtain feature vectors. These feature vectors are used to train two machine learning models: a simple feed-forward neural network and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Our approach was tested using the dataset's predefined training, validation, and testing splits. Our models outperformed the baseline of the challenge on both the validation and tests sets, highlighting the potential of models trained on other pain datasets for reliable feature extraction.

- **Summary**: In recent years, instruction-tuned Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been successful at several tasks, including image captioning and visual question answering; yet leveraging these models remains an open question for robotics. Prior LMMs for robotics applications have been extensively trained on language and action data, but their ability to generalize in different settings has often been less than desired. To address this, we introduce LLARVA, a model trained with a novel instruction tuning method that leverages structured prompts to unify a range of robotic learning tasks, scenarios, and environments. Additionally, we show that predicting intermediate 2-D representations, which we refer to as "visual traces", can help further align vision and action spaces for robot learning. We generate 8.5M image-visual trace pairs from the Open X-Embodiment dataset in order to pre-train our model, and we evaluate on 12 different tasks in the RLBench simulator as well as a physical Franka Emika Panda 7-DoF robot. Our experiments yield strong performance, demonstrating that LLARVA - using 2-D and language representations - performs well compared to several contemporary baselines, and can generalize across various robot environments and configurations.

- **Summary**: Recent Large Language Models have been enhanced with vision capabilities, enabling them to comprehend images, videos, and interleaved vision-language content. However, the learning methods of these large multimodal models typically treat videos as predetermined clips, making them less effective and efficient at handling streaming video inputs. In this paper, we propose a novel Learning-In-Video-Stream (LIVE) framework, which enables temporally aligned, long-context, and real-time conversation within a continuous video stream. Our LIVE framework comprises comprehensive approaches to achieve video streaming dialogue, encompassing: (1) a training objective designed to perform language modeling for continuous streaming inputs, (2) a data generation scheme that converts offline temporal annotations into a streaming dialogue format, and (3) an optimized inference pipeline to speed up the model responses in real-world video streams. With our LIVE framework, we built VideoLLM-online model upon Llama-2/Llama-3 and demonstrate its significant advantages in processing streaming videos. For instance, on average, our model can support streaming dialogue in a 5-minute video clip at over 10 FPS on an A100 GPU. Moreover, it also showcases state-of-the-art performance on public offline video benchmarks, such as recognition, captioning, and forecasting.

- **Summary**: Scene-level novel view synthesis (NVS) is fundamental to many vision and graphics applications. Recently, pose-conditioned diffusion models have led to significant progress by extracting 3D information from 2D foundation models, but these methods are limited by the lack of scene-level training data. Common dataset choices either consist of isolated objects (Objaverse), or of object-centric scenes with limited pose distributions (DTU, CO3D). In this paper, we create a large-scale scene-level dataset from Internet photo collections, called MegaScenes, which contains over 100K structure from motion (SfM) reconstructions from around the world. Internet photos represent a scalable data source but come with challenges such as lighting and transient objects. We address these issues to further create a subset suitable for the task of NVS. Additionally, we analyze failure cases of state-of-the-art NVS methods and significantly improve generation consistency. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of both our dataset and method on generating in-the-wild scenes.

- **Summary**: We study the visual semantic embedding problem for image-text matching. Most existing work utilizes a tailored cross-attention mechanism to perform local alignment across the two image and text modalities. This is computationally expensive, even though it is more powerful than the unimodal dual-encoder approach. This work introduces a dual-encoder image-text matching model, leveraging a scene graph to represent captions with nodes for objects and attributes interconnected by relational edges. Utilizing a graph attention network, our model efficiently encodes object-attribute and object-object semantic relations, resulting in a robust and fast-performing system. Representing caption as a scene graph offers the ability to utilize the strong relational inductive bias of graph neural networks to learn object-attribute and object-object relations effectively. To train the model, we propose losses that align the image and caption both at the holistic level (image-caption) and the local level (image-object entity), which we show is key to the success of the model. Our model is termed Composition model for Object Relations and Attributes, CORA. Experimental results on two prominent image-text retrieval benchmarks, Flickr30K and MSCOCO, demonstrate that CORA outperforms existing state-of-the-art computationally expensive cross-attention methods regarding recall score while achieving fast computation speed of the dual encoder.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in language and vision assistants have showcased impressive capabilities but suffer from a lack of transparency, limiting broader research and reproducibility. While open-source models handle general image tasks effectively, they face challenges with the high computational demands of complex visually-situated text understanding. Such tasks often require increased token inputs and large vision modules to harness high-resolution information. Striking a balance between model size and data importance remains an open question. This study aims to redefine the design of vision-language models by identifying key components and creating efficient models with constrained inference costs. By strategically formulating datasets, optimizing vision modules, and enhancing supervision techniques, we achieve significant improvements in inference throughput while maintaining high performance. Extensive experiments across models ranging from 160M to 13B parameters offer insights into model optimization.

- **Summary**: We introduce Infinigen Indoors, a Blender-based procedural generator of photorealistic indoor scenes. It builds upon the existing Infinigen system, which focuses on natural scenes, but expands its coverage to indoor scenes by introducing a diverse library of procedural indoor assets, including furniture, architecture elements, appliances, and other day-to-day objects. It also introduces a constraint-based arrangement system, which consists of a domain-specific language for expressing diverse constraints on scene composition, and a solver that generates scene compositions that maximally satisfy the constraints. We provide an export tool that allows the generated 3D objects and scenes to be directly used for training embodied agents in real-time simulators such as Omniverse and Unreal. Infinigen Indoors is open-sourced under the BSD license. Please visit https://infinigen.org for code and videos.



### Exploring the Role of Large Language Models in Prompt Encoding for Diffusion Models

- **Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) based on decoder-only transformers have demonstrated superior text understanding capabilities compared to CLIP and T5-series models. However, the paradigm for utilizing current advanced LLMs in text-to-image diffusion models remains to be explored. We observed an unusual phenomenon: directly using a large language model as the prompt encoder significantly degrades the prompt-following ability in image generation. We identified two main obstacles behind this issue. One is the misalignment between the next token prediction training in LLM and the requirement for discriminative prompt features in diffusion models. The other is the intrinsic positional bias introduced by the decoder-only architecture. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel framework to fully harness the capabilities of LLMs. Through the carefully designed usage guidance, we effectively enhance the text representation capability for prompt encoding and eliminate its inherent positional bias. This allows us to integrate state-of-the-art LLMs into the text-to-image generation model flexibly. Furthermore, we also provide an effective manner to fuse multiple LLMs into our framework. Considering the excellent performance and scaling capabilities demonstrated by the transformer architecture, we further design an LLM-Infused Diffusion Transformer (LI-DiT) based on the framework. We conduct extensive experiments to validate LI-DiT across model size and data size. Benefiting from the inherent ability of the LLMs and our innovative designs, the prompt understanding performance of LI-DiT easily surpasses state-of-the-art open-source models as well as mainstream closed-source commercial models including Stable Diffusion 3, DALL-E 3, and Midjourney V6. The powerful LI-DiT-10B will be available after further optimization and security checks.

- **Summary**: Existing vision-language models (VLMs) mostly rely on vision encoders to extract visual features followed by large language models (LLMs) for visual-language tasks. However, the vision encoders set a strong inductive bias in abstracting visual representation, e.g., resolution, aspect ratio, and semantic priors, which could impede the flexibility and efficiency of the VLMs. Training pure VLMs that accept the seamless vision and language inputs, i.e., without vision encoders, remains challenging and rarely explored. Empirical observations reveal that direct training without encoders results in slow convergence and large performance gaps. In this work, we bridge the gap between encoder-based and encoder-free models, and present a simple yet effective training recipe towards pure VLMs. Specifically, we unveil the key aspects of training encoder-free VLMs efficiently via thorough experiments: (1) Bridging vision-language representation inside one unified decoder; (2) Enhancing visual recognition capability via extra supervision. With these strategies, we launch EVE, an encoder-free vision-language model that can be trained and forwarded efficiently. Notably, solely utilizing 35M publicly accessible data, EVE can impressively rival the encoder-based VLMs of similar capacities across multiple vision-language benchmarks. It significantly outperforms the counterpart Fuyu-8B with mysterious training procedures and undisclosed training data. We believe that EVE provides a transparent and efficient route for developing a pure decoder-only architecture across modalities.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Generating natural and meaningful responses to communicate with multi-modal human inputs is a fundamental capability of Large Vision-Language Models(LVLMs). While current open-source LVLMs demonstrate promising performance in simplified scenarios such as single-turn single-image input, they fall short in real-world conversation scenarios such as following instructions in a long context history with multi-turn and multi-images. Existing LVLM benchmarks primarily focus on single-choice questions or short-form responses, which do not adequately assess the capabilities of LVLMs in real-world human-AI interaction applications. Therefore, we introduce MMDU, a comprehensive benchmark, and MMDU-45k, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset, designed to evaluate and improve LVLMs' abilities in multi-turn and multi-image conversations. We employ the clustering algorithm to ffnd the relevant images and textual descriptions from the open-source Wikipedia and construct the question-answer pairs by human annotators with the assistance of the GPT-4o model. MMDU has a maximum of 18k image+text tokens, 20 images, and 27 turns, which is at least 5x longer than previous benchmarks and poses challenges to current LVLMs. Our in-depth analysis of 15 representative LVLMs using MMDU reveals that open-source LVLMs lag behind closed-source counterparts due to limited conversational instruction tuning data. We demonstrate that ffne-tuning open-source LVLMs on MMDU-45k signiffcantly address this gap, generating longer and more accurate conversations, and improving scores on MMDU and existing benchmarks (MMStar: +1.1%, MathVista: +1.5%, ChartQA:+1.2%). Our contributions pave the way for bridging the gap between current LVLM models and real-world application demands. This project is available at https://github.com/Liuziyu77/MMDU.

- **Summary**: Autonomous vehicles require a precise understanding of their environment to navigate safely. Reliable identification of unknown objects, especially those that are absent during training, such as wild animals, is critical due to their potential to cause serious accidents. Significant progress in semantic segmentation of anomalies has been driven by the availability of out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks. However, a comprehensive understanding of scene dynamics requires the segmentation of individual objects, and thus the segmentation of instances is essential. Development in this area has been lagging, largely due to the lack of dedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we have extended the most commonly used anomaly segmentation benchmarks to include the instance segmentation task. Our evaluation of anomaly instance segmentation methods shows that this challenge remains an unsolved problem.

- **Summary**: In this work, we explore the possibility of training high-parameter 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) models on large-scale, high-resolution datasets. We design a general model parallel training method for 3DGS, named RetinaGS, which uses a proper rendering equation and can be applied to any scene and arbitrary distribution of Gaussian primitives. It enables us to explore the scaling behavior of 3DGS in terms of primitive numbers and training resolutions that were difficult to explore before and surpass previous state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. We observe a clear positive trend of increasing visual quality when increasing primitive numbers with our method. We also demonstrate the first attempt at training a 3DGS model with more than one billion primitives on the full MatrixCity dataset that attains a promising visual quality.

- **Summary**: In the realm of image quantization exemplified by VQGAN, the process encodes images into discrete tokens drawn from a codebook with a predefined size. Recent advancements, particularly with LLAMA 3, reveal that enlarging the codebook significantly enhances model performance. However, VQGAN and its derivatives, such as VQGAN-FC (Factorized Codes) and VQGAN-EMA, continue to grapple with challenges related to expanding the codebook size and enhancing codebook utilization. For instance, VQGAN-FC is restricted to learning a codebook with a maximum size of 16,384, maintaining a typically low utilization rate of less than 12% on ImageNet. In this work, we propose a novel image quantization model named VQGAN-LC (Large Codebook), which extends the codebook size to 100,000, achieving an utilization rate exceeding 99%. Unlike previous methods that optimize each codebook entry, our approach begins with a codebook initialized with 100,000 features extracted by a pre-trained vision encoder. Optimization then focuses on training a projector that aligns the entire codebook with the feature distributions of the encoder in VQGAN-LC. We demonstrate the superior performance of our model over its counterparts across a variety of tasks, including image reconstruction, image classification, auto-regressive image generation using GPT, and image creation with diffusion- and flow-based generative models.

- **Summary**: Conventional wisdom holds that autoregressive models for image generation are typically accompanied by vector-quantized tokens. We observe that while a discrete-valued space can facilitate representing a categorical distribution, it is not a necessity for autoregressive modeling. In this work, we propose to model the per-token probability distribution using a diffusion procedure, which allows us to apply autoregressive models in a continuous-valued space. Rather than using categorical cross-entropy loss, we define a Diffusion Loss function to model the per-token probability. This approach eliminates the need for discrete-valued tokenizers. We evaluate its effectiveness across a wide range of cases, including standard autoregressive models and generalized masked autoregressive (MAR) variants. By removing vector quantization, our image generator achieves strong results while enjoying the speed advantage of sequence modeling. We hope this work will motivate the use of autoregressive generation in other continuous-valued domains and applications.

- **Summary**: Direct preference optimization (DPO) has shown to be an effective method for large language model (LLM) alignment. Recent works have attempted to apply DPO to multimodal scenarios but have found it challenging to achieve consistent improvement. Through a comparative experiment, we identify the unconditional preference problem in multimodal preference optimization, where the model overlooks the image condition. To address this problem, we propose mDPO, a multimodal DPO objective that prevents the over-prioritization of language-only preferences by also optimizing image preference. Moreover, we introduce a reward anchor that forces the reward to be positive for chosen responses, thereby avoiding the decrease in their likelihood -- an intrinsic problem of relative preference optimization. Experiments on two multimodal LLMs of different sizes and three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that mDPO effectively addresses the unconditional preference problem in multimodal preference optimization and significantly improves model performance, particularly in reducing hallucination.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated an excellent understanding of images and 3D data. However, both modalities have shortcomings in holistically capturing the appearance and geometry of objects. Meanwhile, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), which encode information within the weights of a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), have emerged as an increasingly widespread modality that simultaneously encodes the geometry and photorealistic appearance of objects. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of ingesting NeRF into MLLM. We create LLaNA, the first general-purpose NeRF-language assistant capable of performing new tasks such as NeRF captioning and Q\&A. Notably, our method directly processes the weights of the NeRF's MLP to extract information about the represented objects without the need to render images or materialize 3D data structures. Moreover, we build a dataset of NeRFs with text annotations for various NeRF-language tasks with no human intervention. Based on this dataset, we develop a benchmark to evaluate the NeRF understanding capability of our method. Results show that processing NeRF weights performs favourably against extracting 2D or 3D representations from NeRFs.
