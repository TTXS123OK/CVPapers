- **Summary**: As space missions aim to explore increasingly hazardous terrain, accurate and timely position estimates are required to ensure safe navigation. Vision-based navigation achieves this goal through correlating impact craters visible through onboard imagery with a known database to estimate a craft's pose. However, existing literature has not sufficiently evaluated crater-detection algorithm (CDA) performance from imagery containing off-nadir view angles. In this work, we evaluate the performance of Mask R-CNN for crater detection, comparing models pretrained on simulated data containing off-nadir view angles and to pretraining on real-lunar images. We demonstrate pretraining on real-lunar images is superior despite the lack of images containing off-nadir view angles, achieving detection performance of 63.1 F1-score and ellipse-regression performance of 0.701 intersection over union. This work provides the first quantitative analysis of performance of CDAs on images containing off-nadir view angles. Towards the development of increasingly robust CDAs, we additionally provide the first annotated CDA dataset with off-nadir view angles from the Chang'e 5 Landing Camera.

- **Summary**: This study targets Multi-Lighting Image Anomaly Detection (MLIAD), where multiple lighting conditions are utilized to enhance imaging quality and anomaly detection performance. While numerous image anomaly detection methods have been proposed, they lack the capacity to handle multiple inputs for a single sample, like multi-lighting images in MLIAD. Hence, this study proposes Attention Fusion Reverse Distillation (AFRD) to handle multiple inputs in MLIAD. For this purpose, AFRD utilizes a pre-trained teacher network to extract features from multiple inputs. Then these features are aggregated into fused features through an attention module. Subsequently, a corresponding student net-work is utilized to regress the attention fused features. The regression errors are denoted as anomaly scores during inference. Experiments on Eyecandies demonstrates that AFRD achieves superior MLIAD performance than other MLIAD alternatives, also highlighting the benefit of using multiple lighting conditions for anomaly detection.

- **Summary**: Continual Learning (CL) poses a significant challenge in Artificial Intelligence, aiming to mirror the human ability to incrementally acquire knowledge and skills. While extensive research has focused on CL within the context of classification tasks, the advent of increasingly powerful generative models necessitates the exploration of Continual Learning of Generative models (CLoG). This paper advocates for shifting the research focus from classification-based CL to CLoG. We systematically identify the unique challenges presented by CLoG compared to traditional classification-based CL. We adapt three types of existing CL methodologies, replay-based, regularization-based, and parameter-isolation-based methods to generative tasks and introduce comprehensive benchmarks for CLoG that feature great diversity and broad task coverage. Our benchmarks and results yield intriguing insights that can be valuable for developing future CLoG methods. Additionally, we will release a codebase designed to facilitate easy benchmarking and experimentation in CLoG publicly at https://github.com/linhaowei1/CLoG. We believe that shifting the research focus to CLoG will benefit the continual learning community and illuminate the path for next-generation AI-generated content (AIGC) in a lifelong learning paradigm.

- **Summary**: Tracking and segmenting multiple objects in complex scenes has always been a challenge in the field of video object segmentation, especially in scenarios where objects are occluded and split into parts. In such cases, the definition of objects becomes very ambiguous. The motivation behind the MOSE dataset is how to clearly recognize and distinguish objects in complex scenes. In this challenge, we propose a semantic embedding video object segmentation model and use the salient features of objects as query representations. The semantic understanding helps the model to recognize parts of the objects and the salient feature captures the more discriminative features of the objects. Trained on a large-scale video object segmentation dataset, our model achieves first place (\textbf{84.45\%}) in the test set of PVUW Challenge 2024: Complex Video Object Segmentation Track.

- **Summary**: Surgical guide plate is an important tool for the dental implant surgery. However, the design process heavily relies on the dentist to manually simulate the implant angle and depth. When deep neural networks have been applied to assist the dentist quickly locates the implant position, most of them are not able to determine the implant depth. Inspired by the video grounding task which localizes the starting and ending time of the target video segment, in this paper, we simplify the implant depth prediction as video grounding and develop a Texture Perceive Implant Depth Prediction Network (TPNet), which enables us to directly output the implant depth without complex measurements of oral bone. TPNet consists of an implant region detector (IRD) and an implant depth prediction network (IDPNet). IRD is an object detector designed to crop the candidate implant volume from the CBCT, which greatly saves the computation resource. IDPNet takes the cropped CBCT data to predict the implant depth. A Texture Perceive Loss (TPL) is devised to enable the encoder of IDPNet to perceive the texture variation among slices. Extensive experiments on a large dental implant dataset demonstrated that the proposed TPNet achieves superior performance than the existing methods.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection (AD) has been extensively studied and applied in a wide range of scenarios in the recent past. However, there are still gaps between achieved and desirable levels of recognition accuracy for making AD for practical applications. In this paper, we start from an insightful analysis of two types of fundamental yet representative failure cases in the baseline model, and reveal reasons that hinder current AD methods from achieving a higher recognition accuracy. Specifically, by Case-1, we found that the main reasons detrimental to current AD methods is that the inputs to the recovery model contain a large number of detailed features to be recovered, which leads to the normal/abnormal area has-not/has been recovered into its original state. By Case-2, we surprisingly found that the abnormal area that cannot be recognized in image-level representations can be easily recognized in the feature-level representation. Based on the above observations, we propose a novel Recover-then-Discriminate (ReDi) framework for AD. ReDi takes a self-generated feature map and a selected prompted image as explicit input information to solve problems in case-1. Concurrently, a feature-level discriminative network is proposed to enhance abnormal differences between the recovered representation and the input representation. Extensive experimental results on two popular yet challenging AD datasets validate that ReDi achieves the new state-of-the-art accuracy.



### Image Processing Based Forest Fire Detection

- **Summary**: A novel approach for forest fire detection using image processing technique is proposed. A rule-based color model for fire pixel classification is used. The proposed algorithm uses RGB and YCbCr color space. The advantage of using YCbCr color space is that it can separate the luminance from the chrominance more effectively than RGB color space. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on two sets of images, one of which contains fire; the other contains fire-like regions. Standard methods are used for calculating the performance of the algorithm. The proposed method has both higher detection rate and lower false alarm rate. Since the algorithm is cheap in computation, it can be used for real-time forest fire detection.



### STAR: Skeleton-aware Text-based 4D Avatar Generation with In-Network Motion Retargeting

- **Summary**: The creation of 4D avatars (i.e., animated 3D avatars) from text description typically uses text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize 3D avatars in the canonical space and subsequently applies animation with target motions. However, such an optimization-by-animation paradigm has several drawbacks. (1) For pose-agnostic optimization, the rendered images in canonical pose for naive Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) exhibit domain gap and cannot preserve view-consistency using only T2I priors, and (2) For post hoc animation, simply applying the source motions to target 3D avatars yields translation artifacts and misalignment. To address these issues, we propose Skeleton-aware Text-based 4D Avatar generation with in-network motion Retargeting (STAR). STAR considers the geometry and skeleton differences between the template mesh and target avatar, and corrects the mismatched source motion by resorting to the pretrained motion retargeting techniques. With the informatively retargeted and occlusion-aware skeleton, we embrace the skeleton-conditioned T2I and text-to-video (T2V) priors, and propose a hybrid SDS module to coherently provide multi-view and frame-consistent supervision signals. Hence, STAR can progressively optimize the geometry, texture, and motion in an end-to-end manner. The quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate our proposed STAR can synthesize high-quality 4D avatars with vivid animations that align well with the text description. Additional ablation studies shows the contributions of each component in STAR. The source code and demos are available at: \href{https://star-avatar.github.io}{https://star-avatar.github.io}.

- **Summary**: Model agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is one of the most widely used gradient-based meta-learning, consisting of two optimization loops: an inner loop and outer loop. MAML learns the new task from meta-initialization parameters with an inner update and finds the meta-initialization parameters in the outer loop. In general, the injection of noise into the gradient of the model for augmenting the gradient is one of the widely used regularization methods. In this work, we propose a novel cooperative meta-learning framework dubbed CML which leverages gradient-level regularization with gradient augmentation. We inject learnable noise into the gradient of the model for the model generalization. The key idea of CML is introducing the co-learner which has no inner update but the outer loop update to augment gradients for finding better meta-initialization parameters. Since the co-learner does not update in the inner loop, it can be easily deleted after meta-training. Therefore, CML infers with only meta-learner without additional cost and performance degradation. We demonstrate that CML is easily applicable to gradient-based meta-learning methods and CML leads to increased performance in few-shot regression, few-shot image classification and few-shot node classification tasks.

- **Summary**: With the advancement of collaborative perception, the role of aerial-ground collaborative perception, a crucial component, is becoming increasingly important. The demand for collaborative perception across different perspectives to construct more comprehensive perceptual information is growing. However, challenges arise due to the disparities in the field of view between cross-domain agents and their varying sensitivity to information in images. Additionally, when we transform image features into Bird's Eye View (BEV) features for collaboration, we need accurate depth information. To address these issues, we propose a framework specifically designed for aerial-ground collaboration. First, to mitigate the lack of datasets for aerial-ground collaboration, we develop a virtual dataset named V2U-COO for our research. Second, we design a Cross-Domain Cross-Adaptation (CDCA) module to align the target information obtained from different domains, thereby achieving more accurate perception results. Finally, we introduce a Collaborative Depth Optimization (CDO) module to obtain more precise depth estimation results, leading to more accurate perception outcomes. We conduct extensive experiments on both our virtual dataset and a public dataset to validate the effectiveness of our framework. Our experiments on the V2U-COO dataset and the DAIR-V2X dataset demonstrate that our method improves detection accuracy by 6.1% and 2.7%, respectively.

- **Summary**: Multi-UAV collaborative 3D object detection can perceive and comprehend complex environments by integrating complementary information, with applications encompassing traffic monitoring, delivery services and agricultural management. However, the extremely broad observations in aerial remote sensing and significant perspective differences across multiple UAVs make it challenging to achieve precise and consistent feature mapping from 2D images to 3D space in multi-UAV collaborative 3D object detection paradigm. To address the problem, we propose an unparalleled camera-based multi-UAV collaborative 3D object detection paradigm called UCDNet. Specifically, the depth information from the UAVs to the ground is explicitly utilized as a strong prior to provide a reference for more accurate and generalizable feature mapping. Additionally, we design a homologous points geometric consistency loss as an auxiliary self-supervision, which directly influences the feature mapping module, thereby strengthening the global consistency of multi-view perception. Experiments on AeroCollab3D and CoPerception-UAVs datasets show our method increases 4.7% and 10% mAP respectively compared to the baseline, which demonstrates the superiority of UCDNet.

- **Summary**: Patients with mental disorders often exhibit risky abnormal actions, such as climbing walls or hitting windows, necessitating intelligent video behavior monitoring for smart healthcare with the rising Internet of Things (IoT) technology. However, the development of vision-based Human Action Recognition (HAR) for these actions is hindered by the lack of specialized algorithms and datasets. In this paper, we innovatively propose to build a vision-based HAR dataset including abnormal actions often occurring in the mental disorder group and then introduce a novel Scene-Motion-aware Action Recognition Technology framework, named SMART, consisting of two technical modules. First, we propose a scene perception module to extract human motion trajectory and human-scene interaction features, which introduces additional scene information for a supplementary semantic representation of the above actions. Second, the multi-stage fusion module fuses the skeleton motion, motion trajectory, and human-scene interaction features, enhancing the semantic association between the skeleton motion and the above supplementary representation, thus generating a comprehensive representation with both human motion and scene information. The effectiveness of our proposed method has been validated on our self-collected HAR dataset (MentalHAD), achieving 94.9% and 93.1% accuracy in un-seen subjects and scenes and outperforming state-of-the-art approaches by 6.5% and 13.2%, respectively. The demonstrated subject- and scene- generalizability makes it possible for SMART's migration to practical deployment in smart healthcare systems for mental disorder patients in medical settings. The code and dataset will be released publicly for further research: https://github.com/Inowlzy/SMART.git.

- **Summary**: The capacity of existing human keypoint localization models is limited by keypoint priors provided by the training data. To alleviate this restriction and pursue more general model, this work studies keypoint localization from a different perspective by reasoning locations based on keypiont clues in text descriptions. We propose LocLLM, the first Large-Language Model (LLM) based keypoint localization model that takes images and text instructions as inputs and outputs the desired keypoint coordinates. LocLLM leverages the strong reasoning capability of LLM and clues of keypoint type, location, and relationship in textual descriptions for keypoint localization. To effectively tune LocLLM, we construct localization-based instruction conversations to connect keypoint description with corresponding coordinates in input image, and fine-tune the whole model in a parameter-efficient training pipeline. LocLLM shows remarkable performance on standard 2D/3D keypoint localization benchmarks. Moreover, incorporating language clues into the localization makes LocLLM show superior flexibility and generalizable capability in cross dataset keypoint localization, and even detecting novel type of keypoints unseen during training.

- **Summary**: The popularity of visual generative AI models like DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion XL, Stable Video Diffusion, and Sora has been increasing. Through extensive evaluation, we discovered that the state-of-the-art visual generative models can generate content that bears a striking resemblance to characters protected by intellectual property rights held by major entertainment companies (such as Sony, Marvel, and Nintendo), which raises potential legal concerns. This happens when the input prompt contains the character's name or even just descriptive details about their characteristics. To mitigate such IP infringement problems, we also propose a defense method against it. In detail, we develop a revised generation paradigm that can identify potentially infringing generated content and prevent IP infringement by utilizing guidance techniques during the diffusion process. It has the capability to recognize generated content that may be infringing on intellectual property rights, and mitigate such infringement by employing guidance methods throughout the diffusion process without retrain or fine-tune the pretrained models. Experiments on well-known character IPs like Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Superman demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed defense method. Our data and code can be found at https://github.com/ZhentingWang/GAI_IP_Infringement.

- **Summary**: Music is a universal language that can communicate emotions and feelings. It forms an essential part of the whole spectrum of creative media, ranging from movies to social media posts. Machine learning models that can synthesize music are predominantly conditioned on textual descriptions of it. Inspired by how musicians compose music not just from a movie script, but also through visualizations, we propose MeLFusion, a model that can effectively use cues from a textual description and the corresponding image to synthesize music. MeLFusion is a text-to-music diffusion model with a novel "visual synapse", which effectively infuses the semantics from the visual modality into the generated music. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce a new dataset MeLBench, and propose a new evaluation metric IMSM. Our exhaustive experimental evaluation suggests that adding visual information to the music synthesis pipeline significantly improves the quality of generated music, measured both objectively and subjectively, with a relative gain of up to 67.98% on the FAD score. We hope that our work will gather attention to this pragmatic, yet relatively under-explored research area.

- **Summary**: The challenge of open-vocabulary recognition lies in the model has no clue of new categories it is applied to. Existing works have proposed different methods to embed category cues into the model, \eg, through few-shot fine-tuning, providing category names or textual descriptions to Vision-Language Models. Fine-tuning is time-consuming and degrades the generalization capability. Textual descriptions could be ambiguous and fail to depict visual details. This paper tackles open-vocabulary recognition from a different perspective by referring to multi-modal clues composed of textual descriptions and exemplar images. Our method, named OVMR, adopts two innovative components to pursue a more robust category cues embedding. A multi-modal classifier is first generated by dynamically complementing textual descriptions with image exemplars. A preference-based refinement module is hence applied to fuse uni-modal and multi-modal classifiers, with the aim to alleviate issues of low-quality exemplar images or textual descriptions. The proposed OVMR is a plug-and-play module, and works well with exemplar images randomly crawled from the Internet. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the promising performance of OVMR, \eg, it outperforms existing methods across various scenarios and setups.

- **Summary**: Recently, data-driven weather forecasting methods have received significant attention for surpassing the RMSE performance of traditional NWP (Numerical Weather Prediction)-based methods. However, data-driven models are tuned to minimize the loss between forecasted data and ground truths, often using pixel-wise loss. This can lead to models that produce blurred outputs, which, despite being significantly different in detail from the actual weather conditions, still demonstrate low RMSE values. Although evaluation metrics from the computer vision field, such as PSNR, SSIM, and FVD, can be used, they are not entirely suitable for weather variables. This is because weather variables exhibit continuous physical changes over time and lack the distinct boundaries of objects typically seen in computer vision images. To resolve these issues, we propose the advection and convection Error (ACE) metric, specifically designed to assess how well models predict advection and convection, which are significant atmospheric transfer methods. We have validated the ACE evaluation metric on the WeatherBench2 and MovingMNIST datasets.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present XctDiff, an algorithm framework for reconstructing CT from a single radiograph, which decomposes the reconstruction process into two easily controllable tasks: feature extraction and CT reconstruction. Specifically, we first design a progressive feature extraction strategy that is able to extract robust 3D priors from radiographs. Then, we use the extracted prior information to guide the CT reconstruction in the latent space. Moreover, we design a homogeneous spatial codebook to improve the reconstruction quality further. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and overcomes the blurring issue. We also apply XctDiff on self-supervised pre-training task. The effectiveness indicates that it has promising additional applications in medical image analysis.

- **Summary**: May-Thurner Syndrome (MTS), also known as iliac vein compression syndrome or Cockett's syndrome, is a condition potentially impacting over 20 percent of the population, leading to an increased risk of iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis. In this paper, we present a 3D-based deep learning approach called MTS-Net for diagnosing May-Thurner Syndrome using CT scans. To effectively capture the spatial-temporal relationship among CT scans and emulate the clinical process of diagnosing MTS, we propose a novel attention module called the dual-enhanced positional multi-head self-attention (DEP-MHSA). The proposed DEP-MHSA reconsiders the role of positional embedding and incorporates a dual-enhanced positional embedding in both attention weights and residual connections. Further, we establish a new dataset, termed MTS-CT, consisting of 747 subjects. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art MTS diagnosis results, and our self-attention design facilitates the spatial-temporal modeling. We believe that our DEP-MHSA is more suitable to handle CT image sequence modeling and the proposed dataset enables future research on MTS diagnosis. We make our code and dataset publicly available at: https://github.com/Nutingnon/MTS_dep_mhsa.

- **Summary**: This paper presents LogiCode, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for identifying logical anomalies in industrial settings, moving beyond traditional focus on structural inconsistencies. By harnessing LLMs for logical reasoning, LogiCode autonomously generates Python codes to pinpoint anomalies such as incorrect component quantities or missing elements, marking a significant leap forward in anomaly detection technologies. A custom dataset "LOCO-Annotations" and a benchmark "LogiBench" are introduced to evaluate the LogiCode's performance across various metrics including binary classification accuracy, code generation success rate, and precision in reasoning. Findings demonstrate LogiCode's enhanced interpretability, significantly improving the accuracy of logical anomaly detection and offering detailed explanations for identified anomalies. This represents a notable shift towards more intelligent, LLM-driven approaches in industrial anomaly detection, promising substantial impacts on industry-specific applications.

- **Summary**: As a common image processing technique, image decomposition is often used to extract complementary information between modalities. In current decomposition-based image fusion methods, typically, source images are decomposed into three parts at single scale (i.e., visible-exclusive part, infrared-exclusive part, and common part) and lacking interaction between modalities during the decomposition process. These results in the inability of fusion images to effectively focus on finer complementary information between modalities at various scales. To address the above issue, a novel decomposition mechanism, Continuous Decomposition Fusion (CDeFuse), is proposed. Firstly, CDeFuse extends the original three-part decomposition to a more general K-part decomposition at each scale through similarity constraints to fuse multi-scale information and achieve a finer representation of decomposition features. Secondly, a Continuous Decomposition Module (CDM) is introduced to assist K-part decomposition. Its core component, State Transformer (ST), efficiently captures complementary information between modalities by utilizing multi-head self-attention mechanism. Finally, a novel decomposition loss function and the corresponding computational optimization strategy are utilized to ensure the smooth progress of the decomposition process while maintaining linear growth in time complexity with the number of decomposition results K. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CDeFuse achieves comparable performance compared to previous methods. The code will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Recently, large multimodal models have built a bridge from visual to textual information, but they tend to underperform in remote sensing scenarios. This underperformance is due to the complex distribution of objects and the significant scale differences among targets in remote sensing images, leading to visual ambiguities and insufficient descriptions by these multimodal models. Moreover, the lack of multimodal fine-tuning data specific to the remote sensing field makes it challenging for the model's behavior to align with user queries. To address these issues, this paper proposes an attribute-guided \textbf{Multi-Granularity Instruction Multimodal Model (MGIMM)} for remote sensing image detailed description. MGIMM guides the multimodal model to learn the consistency between visual regions and corresponding text attributes (such as object names, colors, and shapes) through region-level instruction tuning. Then, with the multimodal model aligned on region-attribute, guided by multi-grain visual features, MGIMM fully perceives both region-level and global image information, utilizing large language models for comprehensive descriptions of remote sensing images. Due to the lack of a standard benchmark for generating detailed descriptions of remote sensing images, we construct a dataset featuring 38,320 region-attribute pairs and 23,463 image-detailed description pairs. Compared with various advanced methods on this dataset, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of MGIMM's region-attribute guided learning approach.

- **Summary**: Selective classification enables models to make predictions only when they are sufficiently confident, aiming to enhance safety and reliability, which is important in high-stakes scenarios. Previous methods mainly use deep neural networks and focus on modifying the architecture of classification layers to enable the model to estimate the confidence of its prediction. This work provides a generalization bound for selective classification, disclosing that optimizing feature layers helps improve the performance of selective classification. Inspired by this theory, we propose to explicitly improve the selective classification model at the feature level for the first time, leading to a novel Confidence-aware Contrastive Learning method for Selective Classification, CCL-SC, which similarizes the features of homogeneous instances and differentiates the features of heterogeneous instances, with the strength controlled by the model's confidence. The experimental results on typical datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, and ImageNet, show that CCL-SC achieves significantly lower selective risk than state-of-the-art methods, across almost all coverage degrees. Moreover, it can be combined with existing methods to bring further improvement.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image generation has recently emerged as a viable alternative to text-to-image retrieval, due to the visually impressive results of generative diffusion models. Although query performance prediction is an active research topic in information retrieval, to the best of our knowledge, there is no prior study that analyzes the difficulty of queries (prompts) in text-to-image generation, based on human judgments. To this end, we introduce the first dataset of prompts which are manually annotated in terms of image generation performance. In order to determine the difficulty of the same prompts in image retrieval, we also collect manual annotations that represent retrieval performance. We thus propose the first benchmark for joint text-to-image prompt and query performance prediction, comprising 10K queries. Our benchmark enables: (i) the comparative assessment of the difficulty of prompts/queries in image generation and image retrieval, and (ii) the evaluation of prompt/query performance predictors addressing both generation and retrieval. We present results with several pre-generation/retrieval and post-generation/retrieval performance predictors, thus providing competitive baselines for future research.

- **Summary**: The rapid spread of information through mobile devices and media has led to the widespread of false or deceptive news, causing significant concerns in society. Among different types of misinformation, image repurposing, also known as out-of-context misinformation, remains highly prevalent and effective. However, current approaches for detecting out-of-context misinformation often lack interpretability and offer limited explanations. In this study, we propose a logic regularization approach for out-of-context detection called LOGRAN (LOGic Regularization for out-of-context ANalysis). The primary objective of LOGRAN is to decompose the out-of-context detection at the phrase level. By employing latent variables for phrase-level predictions, the final prediction of the image-caption pair can be aggregated using logical rules. The latent variables also provide an explanation for how the final result is derived, making this fine-grained detection method inherently explanatory. We evaluate the performance of LOGRAN on the NewsCLIPpings dataset, showcasing competitive overall results. Visualized examples also reveal faithful phrase-level predictions of out-of-context images, accompanied by explanations. This highlights the effectiveness of our approach in addressing out-of-context detection and enhancing interpretability.

- **Summary**: Most video compression methods focus on human visual perception, neglecting semantic preservation. This leads to severe semantic loss during the compression, hampering downstream video analysis tasks. In this paper, we propose a Masked Video Modeling (MVM)-powered compression framework that particularly preserves video semantics, by jointly mining and compressing the semantics in a self-supervised manner. While MVM is proficient at learning generalizable semantics through the masked patch prediction task, it may also encode non-semantic information like trivial textural details, wasting bitcost and bringing semantic noises. To suppress this, we explicitly regularize the non-semantic entropy of the compressed video in the MVM token space. The proposed framework is instantiated as a simple Semantic-Mining-then-Compression (SMC) model. Furthermore, we extend SMC as an advanced SMC++ model from several aspects. First, we equip it with a masked motion prediction objective, leading to better temporal semantic learning ability. Second, we introduce a Transformer-based compression module, to improve the semantic compression efficacy. Considering that directly mining the complex redundancy among heterogeneous features in different coding stages is non-trivial, we introduce a compact blueprint semantic representation to align these features into a similar form, fully unleashing the power of the Transformer-based compression module. Extensive results demonstrate the proposed SMC and SMC++ models show remarkable superiority over previous traditional, learnable, and perceptual quality-oriented video codecs, on three video analysis tasks and seven datasets. \textit{Codes and model are available at: \url{https://github.com/tianyuan168326/VideoSemanticCompression-Pytorch}.

- **Summary**: Field-of-view (FOV) recovery of truncated chest CT scans is crucial for accurate body composition analysis, which involves quantifying skeletal muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) on CT slices. This, in turn, enables disease prognostication. Here, we present a method for recovering truncated CT slices using generative image outpainting. We train a diffusion model and apply it to truncated CT slices generated by simulating a small FOV. Our model reliably recovers the truncated anatomy and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art despite being trained on 87% less data.

- **Summary**: On-device continual learning (CL) requires the co-optimization of model accuracy and resource efficiency to be practical. This is extremely challenging because it must preserve accuracy while learning new tasks with continuously drifting data and maintain both high energy and memory efficiency to be deployable on real-world devices. Typically, a CL method leverages one of two types of backbone networks: CNN or ViT. It is commonly believed that CNN-based CL excels in resource efficiency, whereas ViT-based CL is superior in model performance, making each option attractive only for a single aspect. In this paper, we revisit this comparison while embracing powerful pre-trained ViT models of various sizes, including ViT-Ti (5.8M parameters). Our detailed analysis reveals that many practical options exist today for making ViT-based methods more suitable for on-device CL, even when accuracy, energy, and memory are all considered. To further expand this impact, we introduce REP, which improves resource efficiency specifically targeting prompt-based rehearsal-free methods. Our key focus is on avoiding catastrophic trade-offs with accuracy while trimming computational and memory costs throughout the training process. We achieve this by exploiting swift prompt selection that enhances input data using a carefully provisioned model, and by developing two novel algorithms-adaptive token merging (AToM) and adaptive layer dropping (ALD)-that optimize the prompt updating stage. In particular, AToM and ALD perform selective skipping across the data and model-layer dimensions without compromising task-specific features in vision transformer models. Extensive experiments on three image classification datasets validate REP's superior resource efficiency over current state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The sparsely activated mixture of experts (MoE) model presents a promising alternative to traditional densely activated (dense) models, enhancing both quality and computational efficiency. However, training MoE models from scratch demands extensive data and computational resources. Moreover, public repositories like timm mainly provide pre-trained dense checkpoints, lacking similar resources for MoE models, hindering their adoption. To bridge this gap, we introduce MoE Jetpack, an effective method for fine-tuning dense checkpoints into MoE models. MoE Jetpack incorporates two key techniques: (1) checkpoint recycling, which repurposes dense checkpoints as initial weights for MoE models, thereby accelerating convergence, enhancing accuracy, and alleviating the computational burden of pre-training; (2) hyperspherical adaptive MoE (SpheroMoE) layer, which optimizes the MoE architecture for better integration of dense checkpoints, enhancing fine-tuning performance. Our experiments on vision tasks demonstrate that MoE Jetpack significantly improves convergence speed and accuracy when fine-tuning dense checkpoints into MoE models. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Adlith/MoE-Jetpack.

- **Summary**: Multimodal fusion is crucial in joint decision-making systems for rendering holistic judgments. Since multimodal data changes in open environments, dynamic fusion has emerged and achieved remarkable progress in numerous applications. However, most existing dynamic multimodal fusion methods lack theoretical guarantees and easily fall into suboptimal problems, yielding unreliability and instability. To address this issue, we propose a Predictive Dynamic Fusion (PDF) framework for multimodal learning. We proceed to reveal the multimodal fusion from a generalization perspective and theoretically derive the predictable Collaborative Belief (Co-Belief) with Mono- and Holo-Confidence, which provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error. Accordingly, we further propose a relative calibration strategy to calibrate the predicted Co-Belief for potential uncertainty. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm our superiority.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have shown exceptional capabilities in generating realistic videos. Yet, their training has been predominantly confined to offline environments where models can repeatedly train on i.i.d. data to convergence. This work explores the feasibility of training diffusion models from a semantically continuous video stream, where correlated video frames sequentially arrive one at a time. To investigate this, we introduce two novel continual video generative modeling benchmarks, Lifelong Bouncing Balls and Windows 95 Maze Screensaver, each containing over a million video frames generated from navigating stationary environments. Surprisingly, our experiments show that diffusion models can be effectively trained online using experience replay, achieving performance comparable to models trained with i.i.d. samples given the same number of gradient steps.

It is a fundamental skill for the cognitive and academic development of children. However, the technological, and educational changes in recent decades have affected both the teaching and assessment of handwriting. This paper presents a literature review of handwriting analysis in children, including a bibliometric analysis of published articles, the study participants, and the methods of evaluating the graphonometric state of children. The aim is to synthesize the state of the art and provide an overview of the main study trends over the last decade. The review concludes that handwriting remains a fundamental tool for early estimation of cognitive problems and early intervention. The article analyzes graphonometric evaluation tools. Likewise, it reflects on the importance of graphonometric evaluation as a means to detect possible difficulties or disorders in learning to write. The article concludes by highlighting the need to agree on an evaluation methodology and to combine databases.

- **Summary**: Numerous techniques have been meticulously designed to achieve optimal architectures for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), yet a comparable focus on vision transformers (ViTs) has been somewhat lacking. Despite the remarkable success of ViTs in various vision tasks, their heavyweight nature presents challenges of computational costs. In this paper, we leverage the Gaussian process to systematically explore the nonlinear and uncertain relationship between performance and global architecture factors of MobileViT, such as resolution, width, and depth including the depth of in-verted residual blocks and the depth of ViT blocks, and joint factors including resolution-depth and resolution-width. We present design principles twisting magic 4D cube of the global architecture factors that minimize model sizes and computational costs with higher model accuracy. We introduce a formula for downsizing architectures by iteratively deriving smaller MobileViT V2, all while adhering to a specified constraint of multiply-accumulate operations (MACs). Experiment results show that our formula significantly outperforms CNNs and mobile ViTs across diversified datasets

- **Summary**: Incremental object detection aims to simultaneously maintain old-class accuracy and detect emerging new-class objects in incremental data. Most existing distillation-based methods underperform when unlabeled old-class objects are absent in the incremental dataset. While the absence can be mitigated by generating old-class samples, it also incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we argue that the extra computational cost stems from the inconsistency between the detector and the generative model, along with redundant generation. To overcome this problem, we propose Efficient Generated Object Replay (EGOR). Specifically, we generate old-class samples by inversing the original detectors, thus eliminating the necessity of training and storing additional generative models. We also propose augmented replay to reuse the objects in generated samples, thereby reducing the redundant generation. In addition, we propose high-response knowledge distillation focusing on the knowledge related to the old class, which transfers the knowledge in generated objects to the incremental detector. With the addition of the generated objects and losses, we observe a bias towards old classes in the detector. We balance the losses for old and new classes to alleviate the bias, thereby increasing the overall detection accuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on MS COCO 2017 demonstrate that our method can efficiently improve detection performance in the absence of old-class objects.

- **Summary**: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) relies on natural language expressions to segment target objects in video, emphasizing modeling dense text-video relations. The current RVOS methods typically use independently pre-trained vision and language models as backbones, resulting in a significant domain gap between video and text. In cross-modal feature interaction, text features are only used as query initialization and do not fully utilize important information in the text. In this work, we propose using frozen pre-trained vision-language models (VLM) as backbones, with a specific emphasis on enhancing cross-modal feature interaction. Firstly, we use frozen convolutional CLIP backbone to generate feature-aligned vision and text features, alleviating the issue of domain gap and reducing training costs. Secondly, we add more cross-modal feature fusion in the pipeline to enhance the utilization of multi-modal information. Furthermore, we propose a novel video query initialization method to generate higher quality video queries. Without bells and whistles, our method achieved 51.5 J&F on the MeViS test set and ranked 3rd place for MeViS Track in CVPR 2024 PVUW workshop: Motion Expression guided Video Segmentation.

While such a feature learning scheme achieves promising performance, learning discriminative features solely based on visual information is challenging especially in case of environmental interference such as occlusion, blur and domain variance. In this work, we argue that multi-modal language-driven features provide complementary information to classical visual features, thereby aiding in improving the robustness to such environmental interference. To this end, we propose a new multi-object tracking framework, named LG-MOT, that explicitly leverages language information at different levels of granularity (scene-and instance-level) and combines it with standard visual features to obtain discriminative representations. To develop LG-MOT, we annotate existing MOT datasets with scene-and instance-level language descriptions. We then encode both instance-and scene-level language information into high-dimensional embeddings, which are utilized to guide the visual features during training. At inference, our LG-MOT uses the standard visual features without relying on annotated language descriptions. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks, MOT17, DanceTrack and SportsMOT, reveal the merits of the proposed contributions leading to state-of-the-art performance. On the DanceTrack test set, our LG-MOT achieves an absolute gain of 2.2\% in terms of target object association (IDF1 score), compared to the baseline using only visual features. Further, our LG-MOT exhibits strong cross-domain generalizability. The dataset and code will be available at ~\url{https://github.com/WesLee88524/LG-MOT}.

- **Summary**: Neural implicit representations have emerged as a powerful paradigm for 3D reconstruction. However, despite their success, existing methods fail to capture fine geometric details and thin structures, especially in scenarios where only sparse RGB views of the objects of interest are available. We hypothesize that current methods for learning neural implicit representations from RGB or RGBD images produce 3D surfaces with missing parts and details because they only rely on 0-order differential properties, i.e. the 3D surface points and their projections, as supervisory signals. Such properties, however, do not capture the local 3D geometry around the points and also ignore the interactions between points. This paper demonstrates that training neural representations with first-order differential properties, i.e. surface normals, leads to highly accurate 3D surface reconstruction even in situations where only as few as two RGB (front and back) images are available. Given multiview RGB images of an object of interest, we first compute the approximate surface normals in the image space using the gradient of the depth maps produced using an off-the-shelf monocular depth estimator such as Depth Anything model. An implicit surface regressor is then trained using a loss function that enforces the first-order differential properties of the regressed surface to match those estimated from Depth Anything. Our extensive experiments on a wide range of real and synthetic datasets show that the proposed method achieves an unprecedented level of reconstruction accuracy even when using as few as two RGB views. The detailed ablation study also demonstrates that normal-based supervision plays a key role in this significant improvement in performance, enabling the 3D reconstruction of intricate geometric details and thin structures that were previously challenging to capture.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based time series forecasting has dominated the short-term precipitation forecasting field with the help of its ability to estimate motion flow in high-resolution datasets. The growing interest in precipitation nowcasting offers substantial opportunities for the advancement of current forecasting technologies. Nevertheless, there has been a scarcity of in-depth surveys of time series precipitation forecasting using deep learning. Thus, this paper systemically reviews recent progress in time series precipitation forecasting models. Specifically, we investigate the following key points within background components, covering: i) preprocessing, ii) objective functions, and iii) evaluation metrics. We then categorize forecasting models into \textit{recursive} and \textit{multiple} strategies based on their approaches to predict future frames, investigate the impacts of models using the strategies, and performance assessments. Finally, we evaluate current deep learning-based models for precipitation forecasting on a public benchmark, discuss their limitations and challenges, and present some promising research directions. Our contribution lies in providing insights for a better understanding of time series precipitation forecasting and in aiding the development of robust AI solutions for the future.

- **Summary**: Video-to-video synthesis models face significant challenges, such as ensuring consistent character generation across frames, maintaining smooth temporal transitions, and preserving quality during fast motion. The introduction of joint fully cross-frame self-attention mechanisms has improved character consistency, but this comes at the cost of increased computational complexity. This full cross-frame self-attention mechanism also incorporates redundant details and limits the number of frames that can be jointly edited due to its computational cost. Moreover, the lack of frames in cross-frame attention adversely affects temporal consistency and visual quality. To address these limitations, we propose a new adaptive motion-guided cross-frame attention mechanism that drastically reduces complexity while preserving semantic details and temporal consistency. Specifically, we selectively incorporate the moving regions of successive frames in cross-frame attention and sparsely include stationary regions based on optical flow sampling. This technique allows for an increased number of jointly edited frames without additional computational overhead. For longer duration of video editing, existing methods primarily focus on frame interpolation or flow-warping from jointly edited keyframes, which often results in blurry frames or reduced temporal consistency. To improve this, we introduce KV-caching of jointly edited frames and reuse the same KV across all intermediate frames, significantly enhancing both intermediate frame quality and temporal consistency. Overall, our motion-sampling method enables the use of around three times more keyframes than existing joint editing methods while maintaining superior prediction quality. Ada-VE achieves up to 4x speed-up when using fully-extended self-attention across 40 frames for joint editing, without compromising visual quality or temporal consistency.

- **Summary**: 3D cars are commonly used in self-driving systems, virtual/augmented reality, and games. However, existing 3D car datasets are either synthetic or low-quality, presenting a significant gap toward the high-quality real-world 3D car datasets and limiting their applications in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose the first large-scale 3D real car dataset, termed 3DRealCar, offering three distinctive features. (1) \textbf{High-Volume}: 2,500 cars are meticulously scanned by 3D scanners, obtaining car images and point clouds with real-world dimensions; (2) \textbf{High-Quality}: Each car is captured in an average of 200 dense, high-resolution 360-degree RGB-D views, enabling high-fidelity 3D reconstruction; (3) \textbf{High-Diversity}: The dataset contains various cars from over 100 brands, collected under three distinct lighting conditions, including reflective, standard, and dark. Additionally, we offer detailed car parsing maps for each instance to promote research in car parsing tasks. Moreover, we remove background point clouds and standardize the car orientation to a unified axis for the reconstruction only on cars without background and controllable rendering. We benchmark 3D reconstruction results with state-of-the-art methods across each lighting condition in 3DRealCar. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the standard lighting condition part of 3DRealCar can be used to produce a large number of high-quality 3D cars, improving various 2D and 3D tasks related to cars. Notably, our dataset brings insight into the fact that recent 3D reconstruction methods face challenges in reconstructing high-quality 3D cars under reflective and dark lighting conditions. \textcolor{red}{\href{https://xiaobiaodu.github.io/3drealcar/}{Our dataset is available here.}}

- **Summary**: Enabling robots to navigate following diverse language instructions in unexplored environments is an attractive goal for human-robot interaction. However, this goal is challenging because different navigation tasks require different strategies. The scarcity of instruction navigation data hinders training an instruction navigation model with varied strategies. Therefore, previous methods are all constrained to one specific type of navigation instruction. In this work, we propose InstructNav, a generic instruction navigation system. InstructNav makes the first endeavor to handle various instruction navigation tasks without any navigation training or pre-built maps. To reach this goal, we introduce Dynamic Chain-of-Navigation (DCoN) to unify the planning process for different types of navigation instructions. Furthermore, we propose Multi-sourced Value Maps to model key elements in instruction navigation so that linguistic DCoN planning can be converted into robot actionable trajectories. With InstructNav, we complete the R2R-CE task in a zero-shot way for the first time and outperform many task-training methods. Besides, InstructNav also surpasses the previous SOTA method by 10.48% on the zero-shot Habitat ObjNav and by 86.34% on demand-driven navigation DDN. Real robot experiments on diverse indoor scenes further demonstrate our method's robustness in coping with the environment and instruction variations.

- **Summary**: Metaphors are a common communication tool used in our day-to-day life. The detection and generation of metaphors in textual form have been studied extensively but metaphors in other forms have been under-explored. Recent studies have shown that Vision-Language (VL) models cannot understand visual metaphors in memes and adverts. As of now, no probing studies have been done that involve complex language phenomena like metaphors with videos. Hence, we introduce a new VL task of describing the metaphors present in the videos in our work. To facilitate this novel task, we construct and release a manually created dataset with 705 videos and 2115 human-written captions, along with a new metric called Average Concept Distance (ACD), to automatically evaluate the creativity of the metaphors generated. We also propose a novel low-resource video metaphor captioning system: GIT-LLaVA, which obtains comparable performance to SoTA video language models on the proposed task. We perform a comprehensive analysis of existing video language models on this task and publish our dataset, models, and benchmark results to enable further research.

- **Summary**: The burgeoning field of text-based video generation (T2V) has reignited significant interest in the research of controllable video editing. Although pre-trained T2V-based editing models have achieved efficient editing capabilities, current works are still plagued by two major challenges. Firstly, the inherent limitations of T2V models lead to content inconsistencies and motion discontinuities between frames. Secondly, the notorious issue of over-editing significantly disrupts areas that are intended to remain unaltered. To address these challenges, our work aims to explore a robust video-based editing paradigm based on score distillation. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Sliding Score Distillation strategy, which not only enhances the stability of T2V supervision but also incorporates both global and local video guidance to mitigate the impact of generation errors. Additionally, we modify the self-attention layers during the editing process to further preserve the key features of the original video. Extensive experiments demonstrate that these strategies enable us to effectively address the aforementioned challenges, achieving superior editing performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Category discovery methods aim to find novel categories in unlabeled visual data. At training time, a set of labeled and unlabeled images are provided, where the labels correspond to the categories present in the images. The labeled data provides guidance during training by indicating what types of visual properties and features are relevant for performing discovery in the unlabeled data. As a result, changing the categories present in the labeled set can have a large impact on what is ultimately discovered in the unlabeled set. Despite its importance, the impact of labeled data selection has not been explored in the category discovery literature to date. We show that changing the labeled data can significantly impact discovery performance. Motivated by this, we propose two new approaches for automatically selecting the most suitable labeled data based on the similarity between the labeled and unlabeled data. Our observation is that, unlike in conventional supervised transfer learning, the best labeled is neither too similar, nor too dissimilar, to the unlabeled categories. Our resulting approaches obtains state-of-the-art discovery performance across a range of challenging fine-grained benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: The recent advancements in generative AI models, which can create realistic and human-like content, are significantly transforming how people communicate, create, and work. While the appropriate use of generative AI models can benefit the society, their misuse poses significant threats to data reliability and authentication. However, due to a lack of aligned multimodal datasets, effective and robust methods for detecting machine-generated content are still in the early stages of development. In this paper, we introduce RU-AI, a new large-scale multimodal dataset designed for the robust and efficient detection of machine-generated content in text, image, and voice. Our dataset is constructed from three large publicly available datasets: Flickr8K, COCO, and Places205, by combining the original datasets and their corresponding machine-generated pairs. Additionally, experimental results show that our proposed unified model, which incorporates a multimodal embedding module with a multilayer perceptron network, can effectively determine the origin of the data (i.e., original data samples or machine-generated ones) from RU-AI. However, future work is still required to address the remaining challenges posed by RU-AI. The source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ZhihaoZhang97/RU-AI.

- **Summary**: Accurate estimates of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) are essential in addressing two of humanity's biggest challenges, climate change and biodiversity loss. Existing datasets for AGB estimation from satellite imagery are limited. Either they focus on specific, local regions at high resolution, or they offer global coverage at low resolution. There is a need for a machine learning-ready, globally representative, high-resolution benchmark. Our findings indicate significant variability in biomass estimates across different vegetation types, emphasizing the necessity for a dataset that accurately captures global diversity. To address these gaps, we introduce a comprehensive new dataset that is globally distributed, covers a range of vegetation types, and spans several years. This dataset combines AGB reference data from the GEDI mission with data from Sentinel-2 and PALSAR-2 imagery. Additionally, it includes pre-processed high-level features such as a dense canopy height map, an elevation map, and a land-cover classification map. We also produce a dense, high-resolution (10m) map of AGB predictions for the entire area covered by the dataset. Rigorously tested, our dataset is accompanied by several benchmark models and is publicly available. It can be easily accessed using a single line of code, offering a solid basis for efforts towards global AGB estimation. The GitHub repository github.com/ghjuliasialelli/AGBD serves as a one-stop shop for all code and data.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in pre-trained vision transformers have shown promise in parameter-efficient audio-visual learning without audio pre-training. However, few studies have investigated effective methods for aligning multimodal features in parameter-efficient audio-visual transformers. In this paper, we propose MA-AVT, a new parameter-efficient audio-visual transformer employing deep modality alignment for corresponding multimodal semantic features. Specifically, we introduce joint unimodal and multimodal token learning for aligning the two modalities with a frozen modality-shared transformer. This allows the model to learn separate representations for each modality, while also attending to the cross-modal relationships between them. In addition, unlike prior work that only aligns coarse features from the output of unimodal encoders, we introduce blockwise contrastive learning to align coarse-to-fine-grain hierarchical features throughout the encoding phase. Furthermore, to suppress the background features in each modality from foreground matched audio-visual features, we introduce a robust discriminative foreground mining scheme. Through extensive experiments on benchmark AVE, VGGSound, and CREMA-D datasets, we achieve considerable performance improvements over SOTA methods.

- **Summary**: Deepfake detection aims to contrast the spread of deep-generated media that undermines trust in online content. While existing methods focus on large and complex models, the need for real-time detection demands greater efficiency. With this in mind, unlike previous work, we introduce a novel deepfake detection approach on images using Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) for fast inference with minimal accuracy loss. Moreover, our method incorporates Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) as additional channel features to uncover manipulation traces in frequency and texture domains. Evaluations on COCOFake, DFFD, and CIFAKE datasets demonstrate our method's state-of-the-art performance in most scenarios with a significant efficiency gain of up to a $20\times$ reduction in FLOPs during inference. Finally, by exploring BNNs in deepfake detection to balance accuracy and efficiency, this work paves the way for future research on efficient deepfake detection.

- **Summary**: Saliency methods have become standard in the explanation toolkit of deep neural networks. Recent developments specific to image classifiers have investigated region-based explanations with either new methods or by adapting well-established ones using ad-hoc superpixel algorithms. In this paper, we aim to avoid relying on these segmenters by extracting a segmentation from the activations of a deep neural network image classifier without fine-tuning the network. Our so-called Neuro-Activated Superpixels (NAS) can isolate the regions of interest in the input relevant to the model's prediction, which boosts high-threshold weakly supervised object localization performance. This property enables the semi-supervised semantic evaluation of saliency methods. The aggregation of NAS with existing saliency methods eases their interpretation and reveals the inconsistencies of the widely used area under the relevance curve metric.

- **Summary**: This paper briefly introduces the solutions developed by our team, HFUT-VUT, for Track 1 of self-supervised heart rate measurement in the 3rd Vision-based Remote Physiological Signal Sensing (RePSS) Challenge hosted at IJCAI 2024. The goal is to develop a self-supervised learning algorithm for heart rate (HR) estimation using unlabeled facial videos. To tackle this task, we present two self-supervised HR estimation solutions that integrate spatial-temporal modeling and contrastive learning, respectively. Specifically, we first propose a non-end-to-end self-supervised HR measurement framework based on spatial-temporal modeling, which can effectively capture subtle rPPG clues and leverage the inherent bandwidth and periodicity characteristics of rPPG to constrain the model. Meanwhile, we employ an excellent end-to-end solution based on contrastive learning, aiming to generalize across different scenarios from complementary perspectives. Finally, we combine the strengths of the above solutions through an ensemble strategy to generate the final predictions, leading to a more accurate HR estimation. As a result, our solutions achieved a remarkable RMSE score of 8.85277 on the test dataset, securing \textbf{2nd place} in Track 1 of the challenge.

- **Summary**: As low-quality housing and in particular certain roof characteristics are associated with an increased risk of malaria, classification of roof types based on remote sensing imagery can support the assessment of malaria risk and thereby help prevent the disease. To support research in this area, we release the Nacala-Roof-Material dataset, which contains high-resolution drone images from Mozambique with corresponding labels delineating houses and specifying their roof types. The dataset defines a multi-task computer vision problem, comprising object detection, classification, and segmentation. In addition, we benchmarked various state-of-the-art approaches on the dataset. Canonical U-Nets, YOLOv8, and a custom decoder on pretrained DINOv2 served as baselines. We show that each of the methods has its advantages but none is superior on all tasks, which highlights the potential of our dataset for future research in multi-task learning. While the tasks are closely related, accurate segmentation of objects does not necessarily imply accurate instance separation, and vice versa. We address this general issue by introducing a variant of the deep ordinal watershed (DOW) approach that additionally separates the interior of objects, allowing for improved object delineation and separation. We show that our DOW variant is a generic approach that improves the performance of both U-Net and DINOv2 backbones, leading to a better trade-off between semantic segmentation and instance segmentation.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been successfully applied in various aerial scenes, yet they face challenges with sparse views due to limited supervision. The acquisition of dense aerial views is often prohibitive, as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may encounter constraints in perspective range and energy constraints. In this work, we introduce Multiplane Prior guided NeRF (MPNeRF), a novel approach tailored for few-shot aerial scene rendering-marking a pioneering effort in this domain. Our key insight is that the intrinsic geometric regularities specific to aerial imagery could be leveraged to enhance NeRF in sparse aerial scenes. By investigating NeRF's and Multiplane Image (MPI)'s behavior, we propose to guide the training process of NeRF with a Multiplane Prior. The proposed Multiplane Prior draws upon MPI's benefits and incorporates advanced image comprehension through a SwinV2 Transformer, pre-trained via SimMIM. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MPNeRF outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods applied in non-aerial contexts, by tripling the performance in SSIM and LPIPS even with three views available. We hope our work offers insights into the development of NeRF-based applications in aerial scenes with limited data.

- **Summary**: Pixel-level Video Understanding requires effectively integrating three-dimensional data in both spatial and temporal dimensions to learn accurate and stable semantic information from continuous frames. However, existing advanced models on the VSPW dataset have not fully modeled spatiotemporal relationships. In this paper, we present our solution for the PVUW competition, where we introduce masked video consistency (MVC) based on existing models. MVC enforces the consistency between predictions of masked frames where random patches are withheld. The model needs to learn the segmentation results of the masked parts through the context of images and the relationship between preceding and succeeding frames of the video. Additionally, we employed test-time augmentation, model aggeregation and a multimodal model-based post-processing method. Our approach achieves 67.27% mIoU performance on the VSPW dataset, ranking 2nd place in the PVUW2024 challenge VSS track.

- **Summary**: City scene generation has gained significant attention in autonomous driving, smart city development, and traffic simulation. It helps enhance infrastructure planning and monitoring solutions. Existing methods have employed a two-stage process involving city layout generation, typically using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), or Transformers, followed by neural rendering. These techniques often exhibit limited diversity and noticeable artifacts in the rendered city scenes. The rendered scenes lack variety, resembling the training images, resulting in monotonous styles. Additionally, these methods lack planning capabilities, leading to less realistic generated scenes. In this paper, we introduce CityCraft, an innovative framework designed to enhance both the diversity and quality of urban scene generation. Our approach integrates three key stages: initially, a diffusion transformer (DiT) model is deployed to generate diverse and controllable 2D city layouts. Subsequently, a Large Language Model(LLM) is utilized to strategically make land-use plans within these layouts based on user prompts and language guidelines. Based on the generated layout and city plan, we utilize the asset retrieval module and Blender for precise asset placement and scene construction. Furthermore, we contribute two new datasets to the field: 1)CityCraft-OSM dataset including 2D semantic layouts of urban areas, corresponding satellite images, and detailed annotations. 2) CityCraft-Buildings dataset, featuring thousands of diverse, high-quality 3D building assets. CityCraft achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic 3D cities.

- **Summary**: Many machine learning models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, with decision-based black-box attacks representing the most critical threat in real-world applications. These attacks are extremely stealthy, generating adversarial examples using hard labels obtained from the target machine learning model. This is typically realized by optimizing perturbation directions, guided by decision boundaries identified through query-intensive exact search, significantly limiting the attack success rate. This paper introduces a novel approach using the Approximation Decision Boundary (ADB) to efficiently and accurately compare perturbation directions without precisely determining decision boundaries. The effectiveness of our ADB approach (ADBA) hinges on promptly identifying suitable ADB, ensuring reliable differentiation of all perturbation directions. For this purpose, we analyze the probability distribution of decision boundaries, confirming that using the distribution's median value as ADB can effectively distinguish different perturbation directions, giving rise to the development of the ADBA-md algorithm. ADBA-md only requires four queries on average to differentiate any pair of perturbation directions, which is highly query-efficient. Extensive experiments on six well-known image classifiers clearly demonstrate the superiority of ADBA and ADBA-md over multiple state-of-the-art black-box attacks.

- **Summary**: In this work, we introduce ProMotion, a unified prototypical framework engineered to model fundamental motion tasks. ProMotion offers a range of compelling attributes that set it apart from current task-specific paradigms. We adopt a prototypical perspective, establishing a unified paradigm that harmonizes disparate motion learning approaches. This novel paradigm streamlines the architectural design, enabling the simultaneous assimilation of diverse motion information. We capitalize on a dual mechanism involving the feature denoiser and the prototypical learner to decipher the intricacies of motion. This approach effectively circumvents the pitfalls of ambiguity in pixel-wise feature matching, significantly bolstering the robustness of motion representation. We demonstrate a profound degree of transferability across distinct motion patterns. This inherent versatility reverberates robustly across a comprehensive spectrum of both 2D and 3D downstream tasks. Empirical results demonstrate that ProMotion outperforms various well-known specialized architectures, achieving 0.54 and 0.054 Abs Rel error on the Sintel and KITTI depth datasets, 1.04 and 2.01 average endpoint error on the clean and final pass of Sintel flow benchmark, and 4.30 F1-all error on the KITTI flow benchmark. For its efficacy, we hope our work can catalyze a paradigm shift in universal models in computer vision.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in text-to-image models have enabled high-quality personalized image synthesis of user-provided concepts with flexible textual control. In this work, we analyze the limitations of two primary techniques in text-to-image personalization: Textual Inversion and DreamBooth. When integrating the learned concept into new prompts, Textual Inversion tends to overfit the concept, while DreamBooth often overlooks it. We attribute these issues to the incorrect learning of the embedding alignment for the concept. We introduce AttnDreamBooth, a novel approach that addresses these issues by separately learning the embedding alignment, the attention map, and the subject identity in different training stages. We also introduce a cross-attention map regularization term to enhance the learning of the attention map. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in identity preservation and text alignment compared to the baseline methods.



### Clarifying Myths About the Relationship Between Shape Bias, Accuracy, and Robustness

- **Summary**: Deep learning models can perform well when evaluated on images from the same distribution as the training set. However, applying small perturbations in the forms of noise, artifacts, occlusions, blurring, etc. to a model's input image and feeding the model with out-of-distribution (OOD) data can significantly drop the model's accuracy, making it not applicable to real-world scenarios. Data augmentation is one of the well-practiced methods to improve model robustness against OOD data; however, examining which augmentation type to choose and how it affects the OOD robustness remains understudied. There is a growing belief that augmenting datasets using data augmentations that improve a model's bias to shape-based features rather than texture-based features results in increased OOD robustness for Convolutional Neural Networks trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset. This is usually stated as ``an increase in the model's shape bias results in an increase in its OOD robustness". Based on this hypothesis, some works in the literature aim to find augmentations with higher effects on model shape bias and use those for data augmentation. By evaluating 39 types of data augmentations on a widely used OOD dataset, we demonstrate the impact of each data augmentation on the model's robustness to OOD data and further show that the mentioned hypothesis is not true; an increase in shape bias does not necessarily result in higher OOD robustness. By analyzing the results, we also find some biases in the ImageNet-1K dataset that can easily be reduced using proper data augmentation. Our evaluation results further show that there is not necessarily a trade-off between in-domain accuracy and OOD robustness, and choosing the proper augmentations can help increase both in-domain accuracy and OOD robustness simultaneously.

- **Summary**: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are machine learning models that are used to estimate the underlying statistical structure of a given dataset and as a result can be used for a variety of tasks such as image generation or anomaly detection. Despite their initial simplicity, designing an effective loss function for training GANs remains challenging, and various loss functions have been proposed aiming to improve the performance and stability of the generative models. In this study, loss function design for GANs is presented as an optimization problem solved using the genetic programming (GP) approach. Initial experiments were carried out using small Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) model and the MNIST dataset, in order to search experimentally for an improved loss function. The functions found were evaluated on CIFAR10, with the best function, named GANetic loss, showing exceptionally better performance and stability compared to the losses commonly used for GAN training. To further evalute its general applicability on more challenging problems, GANetic loss was applied for two medical applications: image generation and anomaly detection. Experiments were performed with histopathological, gastrointestinal or glaucoma images to evaluate the GANetic loss in medical image generation, resulting in improved image quality compared to the baseline models. The GANetic Loss used for polyp and glaucoma images showed a strong improvement in the detection of anomalies. In summary, the GANetic loss function was evaluated on multiple datasets and applications where it consistently outperforms alternative loss functions. Moreover, GANetic loss leads to stable training and reproducible results, a known weak spot of GANs.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in sequence modeling have led to the development of the Mamba architecture, noted for its selective state space approach, offering a promising avenue for efficient long sequence handling. However, its application in 3D shape generation, particularly at high resolutions, remains underexplored. Traditional diffusion transformers (DiT) with self-attention mechanisms, despite their potential, face scalability challenges due to the cubic complexity of attention operations as input length increases. This complexity becomes a significant hurdle when dealing with high-resolution voxel sizes. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel diffusion architecture tailored for 3D point clouds generation-Diffusion Mamba (DiM-3D). This architecture forgoes traditional attention mechanisms, instead utilizing the inherent efficiency of the Mamba architecture to maintain linear complexity with respect to sequence length. DiM-3D is characterized by fast inference times and substantially lower computational demands, quantified in reduced Gflops, thereby addressing the key scalability issues of prior models. Our empirical results on the ShapeNet benchmark demonstrate that DiM-3D achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-fidelity and diverse 3D shapes. Additionally, DiM-3D shows superior capabilities in tasks like 3D point cloud completion. This not only proves the model's scalability but also underscores its efficiency in generating detailed, high-resolution voxels necessary for advanced 3D shape modeling, particularly excelling in environments requiring high-resolution voxel sizes. Through these findings, we illustrate the exceptional scalability and efficiency of the Diffusion Mamba framework in 3D shape generation, setting a new standard for the field and paving the way for future explorations in high-resolution 3D modeling technologies.

- **Summary**: Referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) aims at detecting and tracking multiple objects following human instruction represented by a natural language expression. Existing RMOT benchmarks are usually formulated through manual annotations, integrated with static regulations. This approach results in a dearth of notable diversity and a constrained scope of implementation. In this work, our key idea is to bootstrap the task of referring multi-object tracking by introducing discriminative language words as much as possible. In specific, we first develop Refer-KITTI into a large-scale dataset, named Refer-KITTI-V2. It starts with 2,719 manual annotations, addressing the issue of class imbalance and introducing more keywords to make it closer to real-world scenarios compared to Refer-KITTI. They are further expanded to a total of 9,758 annotations by prompting large language models, which create 617 different words, surpassing previous RMOT benchmarks. In addition, the end-to-end framework in RMOT is also bootstrapped by a simple yet elegant temporal advancement strategy, which achieves better performance than previous approaches.

- **Summary**: Few-shot medical image segmentation has achieved great progress in improving accuracy and efficiency of medical analysis in the biomedical imaging field. However, most existing methods cannot explore inter-class relations among base and novel medical classes to reason unseen novel classes. Moreover, the same kind of medical class has large intra-class variations brought by diverse appearances, shapes and scales, thus causing ambiguous visual characterization to degrade generalization performance of these existing methods on unseen novel classes. To address the above challenges, in this paper, we propose a \underline{\textbf{P}}rototype correlation \underline{\textbf{M}}atching and \underline{\textbf{C}}lass-relation \underline{\textbf{R}}easoning (i.e., \textbf{PMCR}) model. The proposed model can effectively mitigate false pixel correlation matches caused by large intra-class variations while reasoning inter-class relations among different medical classes. Specifically, in order to address false pixel correlation match brought by large intra-class variations, we propose a prototype correlation matching module to mine representative prototypes that can characterize diverse visual information of different appearances well. We aim to explore prototype-level rather than pixel-level correlation matching between support and query features via optimal transport algorithm to tackle false matches caused by intra-class variations. Meanwhile, in order to explore inter-class relations, we design a class-relation reasoning module to segment unseen novel medical objects via reasoning inter-class relations between base and novel classes. Such inter-class relations can be well propagated to semantic encoding of local query features to improve few-shot segmentation performance. Quantitative comparisons illustrates the large performance improvement of our model over other baseline methods.

- **Summary**: Grasping is an important human activity that has long been studied in robotics, computer vision, and cognitive science. Most existing works study grasping from the perspective of synthesizing hand poses conditioned on 3D or 2D object representations. We propose GenHeld to address the inverse problem of synthesizing held objects conditioned on 3D hand model or 2D image. Given a 3D model of hand, GenHeld 3D can select a plausible held object from a large dataset using compact object representations called object codes.The selected object is then positioned and oriented to form a plausible grasp without changing hand pose. If only a 2D hand image is available, GenHeld 2D can edit this image to add or replace a held object. GenHeld 2D operates by combining the abilities of GenHeld 3D with diffusion-based image editing. Results and experiments show that we outperform baselines and can generate plausible held objects in both 2D and 3D. Our experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high quality and plausibility of held object synthesis in both 3D and 2D.

- **Summary**: Decision processes of computer vision models - especially deep neural networks - are opaque in nature, meaning that these decisions cannot be understood by humans. Thus, over the last years, many methods to provide human-understandable explanations have been proposed. For image classification, the most common group are saliency methods, which provide (super-)pixelwise feature attribution scores for input images. But their evaluation still poses a problem, as their results cannot be simply compared to the unknown ground truth. To overcome this, a slew of different proxy metrics have been defined, which are - as the explainability methods themselves - often built on intuition and thus, are possibly unreliable. In this paper, new evaluation metrics for saliency methods are developed and common saliency methods are benchmarked on ImageNet. In addition, a scheme for reliability evaluation of such metrics is proposed that is based on concepts from psychometric testing. The used code can be found at https://github.com/lelo204/ClassificationMetricsForImageExplanations .

- **Summary**: Pathology, the microscopic examination of diseased tissue, is critical for diagnosing various medical conditions, particularly cancers. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and prone to human error. Digital pathology, which converts glass slides into high-resolution digital images for analysis by computer algorithms, revolutionizes the field by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and efficiency through automated image analysis and large-scale data processing. Foundational transformer pretraining is crucial for developing robust, generalizable models as it enables learning from vast amounts of unannotated data.   This paper introduces the Hibou family of foundational vision transformers for pathology, leveraging the DINOv2 framework to pretrain two model variants, Hibou-B and Hibou-L, on a proprietary dataset of over 1 million whole slide images (WSIs) representing diverse tissue types and staining techniques. Our pretrained models demonstrate superior performance on both patch-level and slide-level benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, Hibou-L achieves the highest average accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets. To support further research and application in the field, we have open-sourced the Hibou-B model, which can be accessed at https://github.com/HistAI/hibou

- **Summary**: Videos are more informative than images because they capture the dynamics of the scene. By representing motion in videos, we can capture dynamic activities. In this work, we introduce GPT-4 generated motion descriptions that capture fine-grained motion descriptions of activities and apply them to three action datasets. We evaluated several video-text models on the task of retrieval of motion descriptions. We found that they fall far behind human expert performance on two action datasets, raising the question of whether video-text models understand motion in videos. To address it, we introduce a method of improving motion understanding in video-text models by utilizing motion descriptions. This method proves to be effective on two action datasets for the motion description retrieval task. The results draw attention to the need for quality captions involving fine-grained motion information in existing datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline in understanding fine-grained motion during video-text retrieval.

- **Summary**: Tuning-free long video diffusion has been proposed to generate extended-duration videos with enriched content by reusing the knowledge from pre-trained short video diffusion model without retraining. However, most works overlook the fine-grained long-term video consistency modeling, resulting in limited scene consistency (i.e., unreasonable object or background transitions), especially with multiple text inputs. To mitigate this, we propose the Consistency Noise Injection, dubbed CoNo, which introduces the "look-back" mechanism to enhance the fine-grained scene transition between different video clips, and designs the long-term consistency regularization to eliminate the content shifts when extending video contents through noise prediction. In particular, the "look-back" mechanism breaks the noise scheduling process into three essential parts, where one internal noise prediction part is injected into two video-extending parts, intending to achieve a fine-grained transition between two video clips. The long-term consistency regularization focuses on explicitly minimizing the pixel-wise distance between the predicted noises of the extended video clip and the original one, thereby preventing abrupt scene transitions. Extensive experiments have shown the effectiveness of the above strategies by performing long-video generation under both single- and multi-text prompt conditions. The project has been available in https://wxrui182.github.io/CoNo.github.io/.

- **Summary**: Using feature attributions for post-hoc explanations is a common practice to understand and verify the predictions of opaque machine learning models. Despite the numerous techniques available, individual methods often produce inconsistent and unstable results, putting their overall reliability into question. In this work, we aim to systematically improve the quality of feature attributions by combining multiple explanations across distinct methods or their variations. For this purpose, we propose a novel approach to derive optimal convex combinations of feature attributions that yield provable improvements of desired quality criteria such as robustness or faithfulness to the model behavior. Through extensive experiments involving various model architectures and popular feature attribution techniques, we demonstrate that our combination strategy consistently outperforms individual methods and existing baselines.

- **Summary**: Rainfall estimation through the analysis of its impact on electromagnetic waves has sparked increasing interest in the research community. Recent studies have delved into its effects on cellular network performance, demonstrating the potential to forecast rainfall levels based on electromagnetic wave attenuation during precipitations. This paper aims to solve the problem of identifying the nature of specific weather phenomena from the received signal level (RSL) in 4G/LTE mobile terminals. Specifically, utilizing time-series data representing RSL, we propose a novel approach to encode time series as images and model the task as an image classification problem, which we finally address using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The main benefit of the abovementioned procedure is the opportunity to utilize various data augmentation techniques simultaneously. This encompasses applying traditional approaches, such as moving averages, to the time series and enhancing the generated images. We have investigated various image data augmentation methods to identify the most effective combination for this scenario. In the upcoming sections, we will introduce the task of rainfall estimation and conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset used. Subsequently, we will formally propose a new approach for converting time series into images. To conclude, the paper's final section will present and discuss the experiments conducted, providing the reader with a brief yet comprehensive overview of the results.

- **Summary**: We introduce LlavaGuard, a family of VLM-based safeguard models, offering a versatile framework for evaluating the safety compliance of visual content. Specifically, we designed LlavaGuard for dataset annotation and generative model safeguarding. To this end, we collected and annotated a high-quality visual dataset incorporating a broad safety taxonomy, which we use to tune VLMs on context-aware safety risks. As a key innovation, LlavaGuard's new responses contain comprehensive information, including a safety rating, the violated safety categories, and an in-depth rationale. Further, our introduced customizable taxonomy categories enable the context-specific alignment of LlavaGuard to various scenarios. Our experiments highlight the capabilities of LlavaGuard in complex and real-world applications. We provide checkpoints ranging from 7B to 34B parameters demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, with even the smallest models outperforming baselines like GPT-4. We make our dataset and model weights publicly available and invite further research to address the diverse needs of communities and contexts.

- **Summary**: Recent research identified a temporary performance drop on previously learned tasks when transitioning to a new one. This drop is called the stability gap and has great consequences for continual learning: it complicates the direct employment of continually learning since the worse-case performance at task-boundaries is dramatic, it limits its potential as an energy-efficient training paradigm, and finally, the stability drop could result in a reduced final performance of the algorithm. In this paper, we show that the stability gap also occurs when applying joint incremental training of homogeneous tasks. In this scenario, the learner continues training on the same data distribution and has access to all data from previous tasks. In addition, we show that in this scenario, there exists a low-loss linear path to the next minima, but that SGD optimization does not choose this path. We perform further analysis including a finer batch-wise analysis which could provide insights towards potential solution directions.

- **Summary**: A key challenge that threatens the widespread use of neural networks in safety-critical applications is their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we study the second-order behavior of continuously differentiable deep neural networks, focusing on robustness against adversarial perturbations. First, we provide a theoretical analysis of robustness and attack certificates for deep classifiers by leveraging local gradients and upper bounds on the second derivative (curvature constant). Next, we introduce a novel algorithm to analytically compute provable upper bounds on the second derivative of neural networks. This algorithm leverages the compositional structure of the model to propagate the curvature bound layer-by-layer, giving rise to a scalable and modular approach. The proposed bound can serve as a differentiable regularizer to control the curvature of neural networks during training, thereby enhancing robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method on classification tasks using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

- **Summary**: Mammalian brains handle complex reasoning by integrating information across brain regions specialized for particular sensory modalities. This enables improved robustness and generalization versus deep neural networks, which typically process one modality and are vulnerable to perturbations. While defense methods exist, they do not generalize well across perturbations. We developed a fusion model combining background and foreground features from CNNs trained on Imagenet and Places365. We tested its robustness to human-perceivable perturbations on MS COCO. The fusion model improved robustness, especially for classes with greater context variability. Our proposed solution for integrating multiple modalities provides a new approach to enhance robustness and may be complementary to existing methods.

- **Summary**: We analyze energy decay for deep convolutional neural networks employed as feature extractors, such as Mallat's wavelet scattering transform. For time-frequency scattering transforms based on Gabor filters, it has been established that energy decay is exponential, for arbitrary square-integrable input signals. Our main results allow to prove that this is wrong for wavelet scattering in arbitrary dimensions. In this setting, the energy decay of the scattering transform acting on a generic square-integrable signal turns out to be arbitrarily slow. The fact that this behavior holds for dense subsets of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ emphasizes that fast energy decay is generally not a stable property of signals.   We complement these findings with positive results allowing to conclude fast (up to exponential) energy decay for generalized Sobolev spaces that are tailored to the frequency localization of the underlying filter bank.   Both negative and positive results highlight that energy decay in scattering networks critically depends on the interplay of the respective frequency localizations of the signal on the one hand, and of the employed filters on the other.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in processing vision-language tasks. One of the crux of MLLMs lies in vision tokenization, which involves efficiently transforming input visual signals into feature representations that are most beneficial for LLMs. However, existing vision tokenizers, essential for semantic alignment between vision and language, remain problematic. Existing methods aggressively fragment visual input, corrupting the visual semantic integrity. To address this, this paper proposes a novel dynamic Semantic-Equivalent Vision Tokenizer (SeTok), which groups visual features into semantic units via a dynamic clustering algorithm, flexibly determining the number of tokens based on image complexity. The resulting vision tokens effectively preserve semantic integrity and capture both low-frequency and high-frequency visual features. The proposed MLLM (Setokim) equipped with SeTok significantly demonstrates superior performance across various tasks, as evidenced by our experimental results.

- **Summary**: Storing data is particularly a challenge when dealing with image data which often involves large file sizes due to the high resolution and complexity of images. Efficient image compression algorithms are crucial to better manage data storage costs. In this paper, we propose a novel region-based lossy image compression technique, called PatchSVD, based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm. We show through experiments that PatchSVD outperforms SVD-based image compression with respect to three popular image compression metrics. Moreover, we compare PatchSVD compression artifacts with those of Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) and SVD-based image compression and illustrate some cases where PatchSVD compression artifacts are preferable compared to JPEG and SVD artifacts.

- **Summary**: Video object segmentation approaches primarily rely on large-scale pixel-accurate human-annotated datasets for model development. In Dense Video Object Segmentation (DVOS) scenarios, each video frame encompasses hundreds of small, dense, and partially occluded objects. Accordingly, the labor-intensive manual annotation of even a single frame often takes hours, which hinders the development of DVOS for many applications. Furthermore, in videos with dense patterns, following a large number of objects that move in different directions poses additional challenges. To address these challenges, we proposed a semi-self-supervised spatiotemporal approach for DVOS utilizing a diffusion-based method through multi-task learning. Emulating real videos' optical flow and simulating their motion, we developed a methodology to synthesize computationally annotated videos that can be used for training DVOS models; The model performance was further improved by utilizing weakly labeled (computationally generated but imprecise) data. To demonstrate the utility and efficacy of the proposed approach, we developed DVOS models for wheat head segmentation of handheld and drone-captured videos, capturing wheat crops in fields of different locations across various growth stages, spanning from heading to maturity. Despite using only a few manually annotated video frames, the proposed approach yielded high-performing models, achieving a Dice score of 0.82 when tested on a drone-captured external test set. While we showed the efficacy of the proposed approach for wheat head segmentation, its application can be extended to other crops or DVOS in other domains, such as crowd analysis or microscopic image analysis.

- **Summary**: The integration of language and 3D perception is crucial for developing embodied agents and robots that comprehend and interact with the physical world. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive language understanding and generation capabilities, their adaptation to 3D environments (3D-LLMs) remains in its early stages. A primary challenge is the absence of large-scale datasets that provide dense grounding between language and 3D scenes. In this paper, we introduce 3D-GRAND, a pioneering large-scale dataset comprising 40,087 household scenes paired with 6.2 million densely-grounded scene-language instructions. Our results show that instruction tuning with 3D-GRAND significantly enhances grounding capabilities and reduces hallucinations in 3D-LLMs. As part of our contributions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark 3D-POPE to systematically evaluate hallucination in 3D-LLMs, enabling fair comparisons among future models. Our experiments highlight a scaling effect between dataset size and 3D-LLM performance, emphasizing the critical role of large-scale 3D-text datasets in advancing embodied AI research. Notably, our results demonstrate early signals for effective sim-to-real transfer, indicating that models trained on large synthetic data can perform well on real-world 3D scans. Through 3D-GRAND and 3D-POPE, we aim to equip the embodied AI community with essential resources and insights, setting the stage for more reliable and better-grounded 3D-LLMs. Project website: https://3d-grand.github.io
