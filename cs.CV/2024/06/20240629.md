- **Summary**: Detecting and classifying lesions in breast ultrasound images is a promising application of artificial intelligence (AI) for reducing the burden of cancer in regions with limited access to mammography. Such AI systems are more likely to be useful in a clinical setting if their predictions can be explained to a radiologist. This work proposes an explainable AI model that provides interpretable predictions using a standard lexicon from the American College of Radiology's Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System (BI-RADS). The model is a deep neural network featuring a concept bottleneck layer in which known BI-RADS features are predicted before making a final cancer classification. This enables radiologists to easily review the predictions of the AI system and potentially fix errors in real time by modifying the concept predictions. In experiments, a model is developed on 8,854 images from 994 women with expert annotations and histological cancer labels. The model outperforms state-of-the-art lesion detection frameworks with 48.9 average precision on the held-out testing set, and for cancer classification, concept intervention is shown to increase performance from 0.876 to 0.885 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.

- **Summary**: Bimanual manipulation is challenging due to precise spatial and temporal coordination required between two arms. While there exist several real-world bimanual systems, there is a lack of simulated benchmarks with a large task diversity for systematically studying bimanual capabilities across a wide range of tabletop tasks. This paper addresses the gap by extending RLBench to bimanual manipulation. We open-source our code and benchmark comprising 13 new tasks with 23 unique task variations, each requiring a high degree of coordination and adaptability. To kickstart the benchmark, we extended several state-of-the art methods to bimanual manipulation and also present a language-conditioned behavioral cloning agent -- PerAct2, which enables the learning and execution of bimanual 6-DoF manipulation tasks. Our novel network architecture efficiently integrates language processing with action prediction, allowing robots to understand and perform complex bimanual tasks in response to user-specified goals.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: To meet the real-time analysis requirements of video streaming applications, we propose an inter-relation-aware video complexity analyzer (IVCA) as an extension to VCA. The IVCA addresses the limitation of VCA by considering inter-frame relations, namely motion and reference structure. First, we enhance the accuracy of temporal features by introducing feature-domain motion estimation into the IVCA. Next, drawing inspiration from the hierarchical reference structure in codecs, we design layer-aware weights to adjust the majorities of frame complexity in different layers. Additionally, we expand the scope of temporal features by considering frames that be referred to, rather than relying solely on the previous frame. Experimental results show the significant improvement in complexity estimation accuracy achieved by IVCA, with minimal time complexity increase.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the problem of modeling and estimating dynamic multi-valued mappings. While most mathematical models provide a unique solution for a given input, real-world applications often lack deterministic solutions. In such scenarios, estimating dynamic multi-valued mappings is necessary to suggest different reasonable solutions for each input. This paper introduces a deep neural network framework incorporating a generative network and a classification component. The objective is to model the dynamic multi-valued mapping between the input and output by providing a reliable uncertainty measurement. Generating multiple solutions for a given input involves utilizing a discrete codebook comprising finite variables. These variables are fed into a generative network along with the input, producing various output possibilities. The discreteness of the codebook enables efficient estimation of the output's conditional probability distribution for any given input using a classifier. By jointly optimizing the discrete codebook and its uncertainty estimation during training using a specially designed loss function, a highly accurate approximation is achieved. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is demonstrated through its application to various imaging problems, using both synthetic and real imaging data. Experimental results show that our framework accurately estimates the dynamic multi-valued mapping with uncertainty estimation.

- **Summary**: Driven by advancements in photovoltaic (PV) technology, solar energy has emerged as a promising renewable energy source, due to its ease of integration onto building rooftops, facades, and windows. For the emerging cities, the lack of detailed street-level data presents a challenge for effectively assessing the potential of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV). To address this, this study introduces SolarSAM, a novel BIPV evaluation method that leverages remote sensing imagery and deep learning techniques, and an emerging city in northern China is utilized to validate the model performance. During the process, SolarSAM segmented various building rooftops using text prompt guided semantic segmentation. Separate PV models were then developed for Rooftop PV, Facade-integrated PV, and PV windows systems, using this segmented data and local climate information. The potential for BIPV installation, solar power generation, and city-wide power self-sufficiency were assessed, revealing that the annual BIPV power generation potential surpassed the city's total electricity consumption by a factor of 2.5. Economic and environmental analysis were also conducted, including levelized cost of electricity and carbon reduction calculations, comparing different BIPV systems across various building categories. These findings demonstrated the model's performance and reveled the potential of BIPV power generation in the future.

- **Summary**: Facial nerve segmentation is crucial for preoperative path planning in cochlear implantation surgery. Recently, researchers have proposed some segmentation methods, such as atlas-based and deep learning-based methods. However, since the facial nerve is a tubular organ with a diameter of only 1.0-1.5mm, it is challenging to locate and segment the facial nerve in CT scans. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-aware dualstream network (UADSN). UADSN consists of a 2D segmentation stream and a 3D segmentation stream. Predictions from two streams are used to identify uncertain regions, and a consistency loss is employed to supervise the segmentation of these regions. In addition, we introduce channel squeeze & spatial excitation modules into the skip connections of U-shaped networks to extract meaningful spatial information. In order to consider topologypreservation, a clDice loss is introduced into the supervised loss function. Experimental results on the facial nerve dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of UADSN and our submodules.

- **Comment**: Presented at the ICMLAI 2024, in Mendonza, Argentina
- **Journal**: International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing
  and Communication; Vol. 11 No. 9 (2023)
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the trade-off between computational resource utilization and image quality in the context of image fusion techniques for smartphone camera capture. The study explores various combinations of fusion methods, fusion weights, number of frames, and stacking (a.k.a. merging) techniques using a proprietary dataset of images captured with Motorola smartphones. The objective was to identify optimal configurations that balance computational efficiency with image quality. Our results indicate that multi-scale methods and their single-scale fusion counterparts return similar image quality measures and runtime, but single-scale ones have lower memory usage. Furthermore, we identified that fusion methods operating in the YUV color space yield better performance in terms of image quality, resource utilization, and runtime. The study also shows that fusion weights have an overall small impact on image quality, runtime, and memory. Moreover, our results reveal that increasing the number of highly exposed input frames does not necessarily improve image quality and comes with a corresponding increase in computational resources usage and runtime; and that stacking methods, although reducing memory usage, may compromise image quality. Finally, our work underscores the importance of thoughtful configuration selection for image fusion techniques in constrained environments and offers insights for future image fusion method development, particularly in the realm of smartphone applications.

- **Summary**: Appearance-based supervised methods with full-face image input have made tremendous advances in recent gaze estimation tasks. However, intensive human annotation requirement inhibits current methods from achieving industrial level accuracy and robustness. Although current unsupervised pre-training frameworks have achieved success in many image recognition tasks, due to the deep coupling between facial and eye features, such frameworks are still deficient in extracting useful gaze features from full-face. To alleviate above limitations, this work proposes a novel unsupervised/self-supervised gaze pre-training framework, which forces the full-face branch to learn a low dimensional gaze embedding without gaze annotations, through collaborative feature contrast and squeeze modules. In the heart of this framework is an alternating eye-attended/unattended masking training scheme, which squeezes gaze-related information from full-face branch into an eye-masked auto-encoder through an injection bottleneck design that successfully encourages the model to pays more attention to gaze direction rather than facial textures only, while still adopting the eye self-reconstruction objective. In the same time, a novel eye/gaze-related information contrastive loss has been designed to further boost the learned representation by forcing the model to focus on eye-centered regions. Extensive experimental results on several gaze benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves superior performances over unsupervised state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Most existing human rendering methods require every part of the human to be fully visible throughout the input video. However, this assumption does not hold in real-life settings where obstructions are common, resulting in only partial visibility of the human. Considering this, we present OccFusion, an approach that utilizes efficient 3D Gaussian splatting supervised by pretrained 2D diffusion models for efficient and high-fidelity human rendering. We propose a pipeline consisting of three stages. In the Initialization stage, complete human masks are generated from partial visibility masks. In the Optimization stage, 3D human Gaussians are optimized with additional supervision by Score-Distillation Sampling (SDS) to create a complete geometry of the human. Finally, in the Refinement stage, in-context inpainting is designed to further improve rendering quality on the less observed human body parts. We evaluate OccFusion on ZJU-MoCap and challenging OcMotion sequences and find that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the rendering of occluded humans.

- **Summary**: Phytoplankton, a crucial component of aquatic ecosystems, requires efficient monitoring to understand marine ecological processes and environmental conditions. Traditional phytoplankton monitoring methods, relying on non-in situ observations, are time-consuming and resource-intensive, limiting timely analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce PhyTracker, an intelligent in situ tracking framework designed for automatic tracking of phytoplankton. PhyTracker overcomes significant challenges unique to phytoplankton monitoring, such as constrained mobility within water flow, inconspicuous appearance, and the presence of impurities. Our method incorporates three innovative modules: a Texture-enhanced Feature Extraction (TFE) module, an Attention-enhanced Temporal Association (ATA) module, and a Flow-agnostic Movement Refinement (FMR) module. These modules enhance feature capture, differentiate between phytoplankton and impurities, and refine movement characteristics, respectively. Extensive experiments on the PMOT dataset validate the superiority of PhyTracker in phytoplankton tracking, and additional tests on the MOT dataset demonstrate its general applicability, outperforming conventional tracking methods. This work highlights key differences between phytoplankton and traditional objects, offering an effective solution for phytoplankton monitoring.

- **Summary**: In this work, we investigate the fundamental trade-off regarding accuracy and parameter efficiency in the parameterization of neural network weights using predictor networks. We present a surprising finding that, when recovering the original model accuracy is the sole objective, it can be achieved effectively through the weight reconstruction objective alone. Additionally, we explore the underlying factors for improving weight reconstruction under parameter-efficiency constraints, and propose a novel training scheme that decouples the reconstruction objective from auxiliary objectives such as knowledge distillation that leads to significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, these results pave way for more practical scenarios, where one needs to achieve improvements on both model accuracy and predictor network parameter-efficiency simultaneously.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based RGB caries detection improves the efficiency of caries identification and is crucial for preventing oral diseases. The performance of deep learning models depends on high-quality data and requires substantial training resources, making efficient deployment challenging. Core data selection, by eliminating low-quality and confusing data, aims to enhance training efficiency without significantly compromising model performance. However, distance-based data selection methods struggle to distinguish dependencies among high-dimensional caries data. To address this issue, we propose a Core Data Selection Method with Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSCDS) for efficient caries image learning and caries classification. We describe the core data selection criterion as the distribution of samples in different classes. JSCDS calculates the cluster centers by sample embedding representation in the caries classification network and utilizes Jensen-Shannon Divergence to compute the mutual information between data samples and cluster centers, capturing nonlinear dependencies among high-dimensional data. The average mutual information is calculated to fit the above distribution, serving as the criterion for constructing the core set for model training. Extensive experiments on RGB caries datasets show that JSCDS outperforms other data selection methods in prediction performance and time consumption. Notably, JSCDS exceeds the performance of the full dataset model with only 50% of the core data, with its performance advantage becoming more pronounced in the 70% of core data.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Video generation models have demonstrated great capabilities of producing impressive monocular videos, however, the generation of 3D stereoscopic video remains under-explored. We propose a pose-free and training-free approach for generating 3D stereoscopic videos using an off-the-shelf monocular video generation model. Our method warps a generated monocular video into camera views on stereoscopic baseline using estimated video depth, and employs a novel frame matrix video inpainting framework. The framework leverages the video generation model to inpaint frames observed from different timestamps and views. This effective approach generates consistent and semantically coherent stereoscopic videos without scene optimization or model fine-tuning. Moreover, we develop a disocclusion boundary re-injection scheme that further improves the quality of video inpainting by alleviating the negative effects propagated from disoccluded areas in the latent space. We validate the efficacy of our proposed method by conducting experiments on videos from various generative models, including Sora [4 ], Lumiere [2], WALT [8 ], and Zeroscope [ 42]. The experiments demonstrate that our method has a significant improvement over previous methods. The code will be released at \url{https://daipengwa.github.io/SVG_ProjectPage}.

- **Summary**: Prompt-based "diversity interventions" are commonly adopted to improve the diversity of Text-to-Image (T2I) models depicting individuals with various racial or gender traits. However, will this strategy result in nonfactual demographic distribution, especially when generating real historical figures? In this work, we propose DemOgraphic FActualIty Representation (DoFaiR), a benchmark to systematically quantify the trade-off between using diversity interventions and preserving demographic factuality in T2I models. DoFaiR consists of 756 meticulously fact-checked test instances to reveal the factuality tax of various diversity prompts through an automated evidence-supported evaluation pipeline. Experiments on DoFaiR unveil that diversity-oriented instructions increase the number of different gender and racial groups in DALLE-3's generations at the cost of historically inaccurate demographic distributions. To resolve this issue, we propose Fact-Augmented Intervention (FAI), which instructs a Large Language Model (LLM) to reflect on verbalized or retrieved factual information about gender and racial compositions of generation subjects in history, and incorporate it into the generation context of T2I models. By orienting model generations using the reflected historical truths, FAI significantly improves the demographic factuality under diversity interventions while preserving diversity.

- **Summary**: Recent studies have revealed that vision transformers (ViTs) face similar security risks from adversarial attacks as deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, directly applying attack methodology on CNNs to ViTs has been demonstrated to be ineffective since the ViTs typically work on patch-wise encoding. This article explores the vulnerability of ViTs against adversarial attacks under a black-box scenario, and proposes a novel query-efficient hard-label adversarial attack method called AdvViT. Specifically, considering that ViTs are highly sensitive to patch modification, we propose to optimize the adversarial perturbation on the individual patches. To reduce the dimension of perturbation search space, we modify only a handful of low-frequency components of each patch. Moreover, we design a weight mask matrix for all patches to further optimize the perturbation on different regions of a whole image. We test six mainstream ViT backbones on the ImageNet-1k dataset. Experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art attacks on CNNs, our AdvViT achieves much lower $L_2$-norm distortion under the same query budget, sufficiently validating the vulnerability of ViTs against adversarial attacks.

- **Summary**: The design and analysis of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) sketches play a crucial role in industrial product design, primarily involving CAD primitives and their inter-primitive constraints. To address challenges related to error accumulation in autoregressive models and the complexities associated with self-supervised model design for this task, we propose a two-stage network framework. This framework consists of a primitive network and a constraint network, transforming the sketch analysis task into a set prediction problem to enhance the effective handling of primitives and constraints. By decoupling target types from parameters, the model gains increased flexibility and optimization while reducing complexity. Additionally, the constraint network incorporates a pointer module to explicitly indicate the relationship between constraint parameters and primitive indices, enhancing interpretability and performance. Qualitative and quantitative analyses on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of this method.

- **Summary**: The precise diagnosis of urinary stones is crucial for devising effective treatment strategies. The diagnostic process, however, is often complicated by the low contrast between stones and surrounding tissues, as well as the variability in stone locations across different patients. To address this issue, we propose a novel location embedding based pairwise distance learning network (LEPD-Net) that leverages low-dose abdominal X-ray imaging combined with location information for the fine-grained diagnosis of urinary stones. LEPD-Net enhances the representation of stone-related features through context-aware region enhancement, incorporates critical location knowledge via stone location embedding, and achieves recognition of fine-grained objects with our innovative fine-grained pairwise distance learning. Additionally, we have established an in-house dataset on urinary tract stones to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Comprehensive experiments conducted on this dataset reveal that our framework significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Kidney cancer is a global health concern, and accurate assessment of patient frailty is crucial for optimizing surgical outcomes. This paper introduces AI Age Discrepancy, a novel metric derived from machine learning analysis of preoperative abdominal CT scans, as a potential indicator of frailty and postoperative risk in kidney cancer patients. This retrospective study of 599 patients from the 2023 Kidney Tumor Segmentation (KiTS) challenge dataset found that a higher AI Age Discrepancy is significantly associated with longer hospital stays and lower overall survival rates, independent of established factors. This suggests that AI Age Discrepancy may provide valuable insights into patient frailty and could thus inform clinical decision-making in kidney cancer treatment.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we delve into the pedestrian behavior understanding problem from the perspective of three different tasks: intention estimation, action prediction, and event risk assessment. We first define the tasks and discuss how these tasks are represented and annotated in two widely used pedestrian datasets, JAAD and PIE. We then propose a new benchmark based on these definitions, available annotations, and three new classes of metrics, each designed to assess different aspects of the model performance.   We apply the new evaluation approach to examine four SOTA prediction models on each task and compare their performance w.r.t. metrics and input modalities. In particular, we analyze the differences between intention estimation and action prediction tasks by considering various scenarios and contextual factors. Lastly, we examine model agreement across these two tasks to show their complementary role. The proposed benchmark reveals new facts about the role of different data modalities, the tasks, and relevant data properties. We conclude by elaborating on our findings and proposing future research directions.

- **Summary**: In medical image segmentation, personalized cross-silo federated learning (FL) is becoming popular for utilizing varied data across healthcare settings to overcome data scarcity and privacy concerns. However, existing methods often suffer from client drift, leading to inconsistent performance and delayed training. We propose a new framework, Personalized Federated Learning via Feature Enhancement (pFLFE), designed to mitigate these challenges. pFLFE consists of two main stages: feature enhancement and supervised learning. The first stage improves differentiation between foreground and background features, and the second uses these enhanced features for learning from segmentation masks. We also design an alternative training approach that requires fewer communication rounds without compromising segmentation quality, even with limited communication resources. Through experiments on three medical segmentation tasks, we demonstrate that pFLFE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Audio analysis is useful in many application scenarios. The state-of-the-art audio analysis approaches assume that the data distribution at training and deployment time will be the same. However, due to various real-life environmental factors, the data may encounter drift in its distribution or can encounter new classes in the late future. Thus, a one-time trained model might not perform adequately. In this paper, we characterize continual learning (CL) approaches in audio analysis. In this paper, we characterize continual learning (CL) approaches, intended to tackle catastrophic forgetting arising due to drifts. As there is no CL dataset for audio analysis, we use DCASE 2020 to 2023 datasets to create various CL scenarios for audio-based monitoring tasks. We have investigated the following CL and non-CL approaches: EWC, LwF, SI, GEM, A-GEM, GDumb, Replay, Naive, cumulative, and joint training. The study is very beneficial for researchers and practitioners working in the area of audio analysis for developing adaptive models. We observed that Replay achieved better results than other methods in the DCASE challenge data. It achieved an accuracy of 70.12% for the domain incremental scenario and an accuracy of 96.98% for the class incremental scenario.

- **Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) exhibit impressive cross-modal understanding and reasoning abilities, often assessed through multiple-choice questions (MCQs) that include an image, a question, and several options. However, many benchmarks used for such evaluations suffer from systematic biases. Remarkably, Large Language Models (LLMs) without any visual perception capabilities achieve non-trivial performance, undermining the credibility of these evaluations. To address this issue while maintaining the efficiency of MCQ evaluations, we propose MMEvalPro, a benchmark designed to avoid Type-I errors through a trilogy evaluation pipeline and more rigorous metrics. For each original question from existing benchmarks, human annotators augment it by creating one perception question and one knowledge anchor question through a meticulous annotation process. MMEvalPro comprises $2,138$ question triplets, totaling $6,414$ distinct questions. Two-thirds of these questions are manually labeled by human experts, while the rest are sourced from existing benchmarks (MMMU, ScienceQA, and MathVista). Compared with the existing benchmarks, our experiments with the latest LLMs and LMMs demonstrate that MMEvalPro is more challenging (the best LMM lags behind human performance by $31.73\%$, compared to an average gap of $8.03\%$ in previous benchmarks) and more trustworthy (the best LLM trails the best LMM by $23.09\%$, whereas the gap for previous benchmarks is just $14.64\%$). Our in-depth analysis explains the reason for the large performance gap and justifies the trustworthiness of evaluation, underscoring its significant potential for advancing future research.

- **Summary**: Breast cancer is described as one of the most common types of cancer which has been diagnosed mainly in women. When compared in the ratio of male to female, it has been duly found that the prone of having breast cancer is more in females than males. Breast lumps are classified mainly into two groups namely: cancerous and non-cancerous. When we say that the lump in the breast is cancerous, it means that it can spread via lobules, ducts, areola, stroma to various organs of the body. On the other hand, non-cancerous breast lumps are less harmful but it should be monitored under proper diagnosis to avoid it being transformed to cancerous lump. To diagnose these breast lumps the method of mammogram, ultrasonic images and MRI images are undertaken. Also, for better diagnosis sometimes doctors recommend for biopsy and any unforeseen anomalies occurring there may give rise to inaccurate test report. To avoid these discrepancies, processing the mammogram images is considered to be one of the most reliable methods. In the proposed method MATLAB GUI is developed and some sample images of breast lumps are placed accordingly in the respective axes. With the help of sliders the actual breast lump image is compared with the already stored breast lump sample images and then accordingly the history of the breast lumps is generated in real time in the form of test report.

- **Summary**: Spurious patterns refer to a mathematical association between two or more variables in a dataset that are not causally related. However, this notion of spuriousness, which is usually introduced due to sampling biases in the dataset, has classically lacked a formal definition. To address this gap, this work presents the first information-theoretic formalization of spuriousness in a dataset (given a split of spurious and core features) using a mathematical framework called Partial Information Decomposition (PID). Specifically, we disentangle the joint information content that the spurious and core features share about another target variable (e.g., the prediction label) into distinct components, namely unique, redundant, and synergistic information. We propose the use of unique information, with roots in Blackwell Sufficiency, as a novel metric to formally quantify dataset spuriousness and derive its desirable properties. We empirically demonstrate how higher unique information in the spurious features in a dataset could lead a model into choosing the spurious features over the core features for inference, often having low worst-group-accuracy. We also propose a novel autoencoder-based estimator for computing unique information that is able to handle high-dimensional image data. Finally, we also show how this unique information in the spurious feature is reduced across several dataset-based spurious-pattern-mitigation techniques such as data reweighting and varying levels of background mixing, demonstrating a novel tradeoff between unique information (spuriousness) and worst-group-accuracy.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in neural rendering have excelled at novel view synthesis from multi-view RGB images. However, they often lack the capability to edit the shading or colour of the scene at a detailed point-level, while ensuring consistency across different viewpoints. In this work, we address the challenge of point-level 3D scene albedo and shading editing from multi-view RGB images, focusing on detailed editing at the point-level rather than at a part or global level. While prior works based on volumetric representation such as NeRF struggle with achieving 3D consistent editing at the point level, recent advancements in point-based neural rendering show promise in overcoming this challenge. We introduce ``Intrinsic PAPR'', a novel method based on the recent point-based neural rendering technique Proximity Attention Point Rendering (PAPR). Unlike other point-based methods that model the intrinsic decomposition of the scene, our approach does not rely on complicated shading models or simplistic priors that may not universally apply. Instead, we directly model scene decomposition into albedo and shading components, leading to better estimation accuracy. Comparative evaluations against the latest point-based inverse rendering methods demonstrate that Intrinsic PAPR achieves higher-quality novel view rendering and superior point-level albedo and shading editing.

- **Summary**: Building generalized models that can solve many computer vision tasks simultaneously is an intriguing direction. Recent works have shown image itself can be used as a natural interface for general-purpose visual perception and demonstrated inspiring results. In this paper, we explore diffusion-based vision generalists, where we unify different types of dense prediction tasks as conditional image generation and re-purpose pre-trained diffusion models for it. However, directly applying off-the-shelf latent diffusion models leads to a quantization issue. Thus, we propose to perform diffusion in pixel space and provide a recipe for finetuning pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models for dense vision tasks. In experiments, we evaluate our method on four different types of tasks and show competitive performance to the other vision generalists.

- **Summary**: While automatic monitoring and coaching of exercises are showing encouraging results in non-medical applications, they still have limitations such as errors and limited use contexts. To allow the development and assessment of physical rehabilitation by an intelligent tutoring system, we identify in this article four challenges to address and propose a medical dataset of clinical patients carrying out low back-pain rehabilitation exercises. The dataset includes 3D Kinect skeleton positions and orientations, RGB videos, 2D skeleton data, and medical annotations to assess the correctness, and error classification and localisation of body part and timespan. Along this dataset, we perform a complete research path, from data collection to processing, and finally a small benchmark. We evaluated on the dataset two baseline movement recognition algorithms, pertaining to two different approaches: the probabilistic approach with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and the deep learning approach with a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM).   This dataset is valuable because it includes rehabilitation relevant motions in a clinical setting with patients in their rehabilitation program, using a cost-effective, portable, and convenient sensor, and because it shows the potential for improvement on these challenges.

- **Summary**: Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease in developed countries. High-fidelity preclinical models can improve AS management by enabling therapeutic innovation, early diagnosis, and tailored treatment planning. However, their use is currently limited by complex workflows necessitating lengthy expert-driven manual operations. Here, we propose an AI-powered computational framework for accelerated and democratized patient-specific modeling of AS hemodynamics from computed tomography. First, we demonstrate that our automated meshing algorithms can generate task-ready geometries for both computational and benchtop simulations with higher accuracy and 100 times faster than existing approaches. Then, we show that our approach can be integrated with fluid-structure interaction and soft robotics models to accurately recapitulate a broad spectrum of clinical hemodynamic measurements of diverse AS patients. The efficiency and reliability of these algorithms make them an ideal complementary tool for personalized high-fidelity modeling of AS biomechanics, hemodynamics, and treatment planning.

- **Summary**: MRI is a widely used ionization-free soft-tissue imaging modality, often employed repeatedly over a patient's lifetime. However, prolonged scanning durations, among other issues, can limit availability and accessibility. In this work, we aim to substantially reduce scan times by leveraging prior scans of the same patient. These prior scans typically contain considerable shared information with the current scan, thereby enabling higher acceleration rates when appropriately utilized. We propose a prior informed reconstruction method with a trained diffusion model in conjunction with data-consistency steps. Our method can be trained with unlabeled image data, eliminating the need for a dataset of either k-space measurements or paired longitudinal scans as is required of other learning-based methods. We demonstrate superiority of our method over previously suggested approaches in effectively utilizing prior information without over-biasing prior consistency, which we validate on both an open-source dataset of healthy patients as well as several longitudinal cases of clinical interest.

- **Summary**: The shift towards efficient and automated data analysis through Machine Learning (ML) has notably impacted healthcare systems, particularly Radiomics. Radiomics leverages ML to analyze medical images accurately and efficiently for precision medicine. Current methods rely on Deep Learning (DL) to improve performance and accuracy (Deep Radiomics). Given the sensitivity of medical images, ensuring privacy throughout the Deep Radiomics pipeline-from data generation and collection to model training and inference-is essential, especially when outsourced. Thus, Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) are crucial tools for Deep Radiomics. Previous studies and systematization efforts have either broadly overviewed PETs and their applications or mainly focused on subsets of PETs for ML algorithms. In Deep Radiomics, where efficiency, accuracy, and privacy are crucial, many PETs, while theoretically applicable, may not be practical without specialized optimizations or hybrid designs. Additionally, not all DL models are suitable for Radiomics. Consequently, there is a need for specialized studies that investigate and systematize the effective and practical integration of PETs into the Deep Radiomics pipeline. This work addresses this research gap by (1) classifying existing PETs, presenting practical hybrid PETS constructions, and a taxonomy illustrating their potential integration with the Deep Radiomics pipeline, with comparative analyses detailing assumptions, architectural suitability, and security, (2) Offering technical insights, describing potential challenges and means of combining PETs into the Deep Radiomics pipeline, including integration strategies, subtilities, and potential challenges, (3) Proposing potential research directions, identifying challenges, and suggesting solutions to enhance the PETs in Deep Radiomics.
