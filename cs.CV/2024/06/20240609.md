- **Summary**: It has been shown that many generative models inherit and amplify societal biases. To date, there is no uniform/systematic agreed standard to control/adjust for these biases. This study examines the presence and manipulation of societal biases in leading text-to-image models: Stable Diffusion, DALL-E 3, and Adobe Firefly. Through a comprehensive analysis combining base prompts with modifiers and their sequencing, we uncover the nuanced ways these AI technologies encode biases across gender, race, geography, and region/culture. Our findings reveal the challenges and potential of prompt engineering in controlling biases, highlighting the critical need for ethical AI development promoting diversity and inclusivity.   This work advances AI ethics by not only revealing the nuanced dynamics of bias in text-to-image generation models but also by offering a novel framework for future research in controlling bias. Our contributions-panning comparative analyses, the strategic use of prompt modifiers, the exploration of prompt sequencing effects, and the introduction of a bias sensitivity taxonomy-lay the groundwork for the development of common metrics and standard analyses for evaluating whether and how future AI models exhibit and respond to requests to adjust for inherent biases.

- **Summary**: Glaucoma is a chronic eye disease characterized by optic neuropathy, leading to irreversible vision loss. It progresses gradually, often remaining undiagnosed until advanced stages. Early detection is crucial to monitor atrophy and develop treatment strategies to prevent further vision impairment. Data-centric methods have enabled computer-aided algorithms for precise glaucoma diagnosis.   In this study, we use deep learning models to identify complex disease traits and progression criteria, detecting subtle changes indicative of glaucoma. We explore the structure-function relationship in glaucoma progression and predict functional impairment from structural eye deterioration. We analyze statistical and machine learning methods, including deep learning techniques with optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans for accurate progression prediction.   Addressing challenges like age variability, data imbalances, and noisy labels, we develop novel semi-supervised time-series algorithms:   1. Weakly-Supervised Time-Series Learning: We create a CNN-LSTM model to encode spatiotemporal features from OCT scans. This approach uses age-related progression and positive-unlabeled data to establish robust pseudo-progression criteria, bypassing gold-standard labels.   2. Semi-Supervised Time-Series Learning: Using labels from Guided Progression Analysis (GPA) in a contrastive learning scheme, the CNN-LSTM architecture learns from potentially mislabeled data to improve prediction accuracy.   Our methods outperform conventional and state-of-the-art techniques.

- **Summary**: In contemporary computer vision applications, particularly image classification, architectural backbones pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet are commonly employed as feature extractors. Despite the widespread use of these pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), there remains a gap in understanding the performance of various resource-efficient backbones across diverse domains and dataset sizes. Our study systematically evaluates multiple lightweight, pre-trained CNN backbones under consistent training settings across a variety of datasets, including natural images, medical images, galaxy images, and remote sensing images. This comprehensive analysis aims to aid machine learning practitioners in selecting the most suitable backbone for their specific problem, especially in scenarios involving small datasets where fine-tuning a pre-trained network is crucial. Even though attention-based architectures are gaining popularity, we observed that they tend to perform poorly under low data finetuning tasks compared to CNNs. We also observed that some CNN architectures such as ConvNeXt, RegNet and EfficientNet performs well compared to others on a diverse set of domains consistently. Our findings provide actionable insights into the performance trade-offs and effectiveness of different backbones, facilitating informed decision-making in model selection for a broad spectrum of computer vision domains.

- **Summary**: Text-based person retrieval (TPR) is a challenging task that involves retrieving a specific individual based on a textual description. Despite considerable efforts to bridge the gap between vision and language, the significant differences between these modalities continue to pose a challenge. Previous methods have attempted to align text and image samples in a modal-shared space, but they face uncertainties in optimization directions due to the movable features of both modalities and the failure to account for one-to-many relationships of image-text pairs in TPR datasets. To address this issue, we propose an effective bi-directional one-to-many embedding paradigm that offers a clear optimization direction for each sample, thus mitigating the optimization problem. Additionally, this embedding scheme generates multiple features for each sample without introducing trainable parameters, making it easier to align with several positive samples. Based on this paradigm, we propose a novel Bi-directional one-to-many Embedding Alignment (Beat) model to address the TPR task. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Beat model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular TPR datasets, including CUHK-PEDES (65.61 R@1), ICFG-PEDES (58.25 R@1), and RSTPReID (48.10 R@1). Furthermore, additional experiments on MS-COCO, CUB, and Flowers datasets further demonstrate the potential of Beat to be applied to other image-text retrieval tasks.

- **Summary**: We present DenseAV, a novel dual encoder grounding architecture that learns high-resolution, semantically meaningful, and audio-visually aligned features solely through watching videos. We show that DenseAV can discover the ``meaning'' of words and the ``location'' of sounds without explicit localization supervision. Furthermore, it automatically discovers and distinguishes between these two types of associations without supervision. We show that DenseAV's localization abilities arise from a new multi-head feature aggregation operator that directly compares dense image and audio representations for contrastive learning. In contrast, many other systems that learn ``global'' audio and video representations cannot localize words and sound. Finally, we contribute two new datasets to improve the evaluation of AV representations through speech and sound prompted semantic segmentation. On these and other datasets we show DenseAV dramatically outperforms the prior art on speech and sound prompted semantic segmentation. DenseAV outperforms the previous state-of-the-art, ImageBind, on cross-modal retrieval using fewer than half of the parameters. Project Page: \href{https://aka.ms/denseav}{https://aka.ms/denseav}

- **Summary**: With recent advances in video prediction, controllable video generation has been attracting more attention. Generating high fidelity videos according to simple and flexible conditioning is of particular interest. To this end, we propose a controllable video generation model using pixel level renderings of 2D or 3D bounding boxes as conditioning. In addition, we also create a bounding box predictor that, given the initial and ending frames' bounding boxes, can predict up to 15 bounding boxes per frame for all the frames in a 25-frame clip. We perform experiments across 3 well-known AV video datasets: KITTI, Virtual-KITTI 2 and BDD100k.

- **Summary**: In real-world clinical settings, traditional deep learning-based classification methods struggle with diagnosing newly introduced disease types because they require samples from all disease classes for offline training. Class incremental learning offers a promising solution by adapting a deep network trained on specific disease classes to handle new diseases. However, catastrophic forgetting occurs, decreasing the performance of earlier classes when adapting the model to new data. Prior proposed methodologies to overcome this require perpetual storage of previous samples, posing potential practical concerns regarding privacy and storage regulations in healthcare. To this end, we propose a novel data-free class incremental learning framework that utilizes data synthesis on learned classes instead of data storage from previous classes. Our key contributions include acquiring synthetic data known as Continual Class-Specific Impression (CCSI) for previously inaccessible trained classes and presenting a methodology to effectively utilize this data for updating networks when introducing new classes. We obtain CCSI by employing data inversion over gradients of the trained classification model on previous classes starting from the mean image of each class inspired by common landmarks shared among medical images and utilizing continual normalization layers statistics as a regularizer in this pixel-wise optimization process. Subsequently, we update the network by combining the synthesized data with new class data and incorporate several losses, including an intra-domain contrastive loss to generalize the deep network trained on the synthesized data to real data, a margin loss to increase separation among previous classes and new ones, and a cosine-normalized cross-entropy loss to alleviate the adverse effects of imbalanced distributions in training data.



### PaRa: Personalizing Text-to-Image Diffusion via Parameter Rank Reduction

- **Summary**: Personalizing a large-scale pretrained Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model is challenging as it typically struggles to make an appropriate trade-off between its training data distribution and the target distribution, i.e., learning a novel concept with only a few target images to achieve personalization (aligning with the personalized target) while preserving text editability (aligning with diverse text prompts). In this paper, we propose PaRa, an effective and efficient Parameter Rank Reduction approach for T2I model personalization by explicitly controlling the rank of the diffusion model parameters to restrict its initial diverse generation space into a small and well-balanced target space. Our design is motivated by the fact that taming a T2I model toward a novel concept such as a specific art style implies a small generation space. To this end, by reducing the rank of model parameters during finetuning, we can effectively constrain the space of the denoising sampling trajectories towards the target. With comprehensive experiments, we show that PaRa achieves great advantages over existing finetuning approaches on single/multi-subject generation as well as single-image editing. Notably, compared to the prevailing fine-tuning technique LoRA, PaRa achieves better parameter efficiency (2x fewer learnable parameters) and much better target image alignment.

- **Summary**: In industrial scenarios, it is crucial not only to identify anomalous items but also to classify the type of anomaly. However, research on anomaly multi-classification remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes a novel and valuable research task called anomaly multi-classification. Given the challenges in applying few-shot learning to this task, due to limited training data and unique characteristics of anomaly images, we introduce a baseline model that combines RelationNet and PatchCore. We propose a data generation method that creates pseudo classes and a corresponding proxy task, aiming to bridge the gap in transferring few-shot learning to industrial scenarios. Furthermore, we utilize contrastive learning to improve the vanilla baseline, achieving much better performance than directly fine-tune a ResNet. Experiments conducted on MvTec AD and MvTec3D AD demonstrate that our approach shows superior performance in this novel task.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel approach for 3D mesh reconstruction from multi-view images. Our method takes inspiration from large reconstruction models like LRM that use a transformer-based triplane generator and a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) model trained on multi-view images. However, in our method, we introduce several important modifications that allow us to significantly enhance 3D reconstruction quality. First of all, we examine the original LRM architecture and find several shortcomings. Subsequently, we introduce respective modifications to the LRM architecture, which lead to improved multi-view image representation and more computationally efficient training. Second, in order to improve geometry reconstruction and enable supervision at full image resolution, we extract meshes from the NeRF field in a differentiable manner and fine-tune the NeRF model through mesh rendering. These modifications allow us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both 2D and 3D evaluation metrics, such as a PSNR of 28.67 on Google Scanned Objects (GSO) dataset. Despite these superior results, our feed-forward model still struggles to reconstruct complex textures, such as text and portraits on assets. To address this, we introduce a lightweight per-instance texture refinement procedure. This procedure fine-tunes the triplane representation and the NeRF color estimation model on the mesh surface using the input multi-view images in just 4 seconds. This refinement improves the PSNR to 29.79 and achieves faithful reconstruction of complex textures, such as text. Additionally, our approach enables various downstream applications, including text- or image-to-3D generation.

- **Summary**: Over the last year, significant advancements have been made in the realms of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), particularly in their application to autonomous driving. These models have showcased remarkable abilities in processing and interacting with complex information. In autonomous driving, LLMs and MLLMs are extensively used, requiring access to sensitive vehicle data such as precise locations, images, and road conditions. These data are transmitted to an LLM-based inference cloud for advanced analysis. However, concerns arise regarding data security, as the protection against data and privacy breaches primarily depends on the LLM's inherent security measures, without additional scrutiny or evaluation of the LLM's inference outputs. Despite its importance, the security aspect of LLMs in autonomous driving remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, our research introduces a novel security framework for autonomous vehicles, utilizing a multi-agent LLM approach. This framework is designed to safeguard sensitive information associated with autonomous vehicles from potential leaks, while also ensuring that LLM outputs adhere to driving regulations and align with human values. It includes mechanisms to filter out irrelevant queries and verify the safety and reliability of LLM outputs. Utilizing this framework, we evaluated the security, privacy, and cost aspects of eleven large language model-driven autonomous driving cues. Additionally, we performed QA tests on these driving prompts, which successfully demonstrated the framework's efficacy.

- **Summary**: Existing prompt-tuning methods have demonstrated impressive performances in continual learning (CL), by selecting and updating relevant prompts in the vision-transformer models. On the contrary, this paper aims to learn each task by tuning the prompts in the direction orthogonal to the subspace spanned by previous tasks' features, so as to ensure no interference on tasks that have been learned to overcome catastrophic forgetting in CL. However, different from the orthogonal projection in the traditional CNN architecture, the prompt gradient orthogonal projection in the ViT architecture shows completely different and greater challenges, i.e., 1) the high-order and non-linear self-attention operation; 2) the drift of prompt distribution brought by the LayerNorm in the transformer block. Theoretically, we have finally deduced two consistency conditions to achieve the prompt gradient orthogonal projection, which provide a theoretical guarantee of eliminating interference on previously learned knowledge via the self-attention mechanism in visual prompt tuning. In practice, an effective null-space-based approximation solution has been proposed to implement the prompt gradient orthogonal projection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of anti-forgetting on four class-incremental benchmarks with diverse pre-trained baseline models, and our approach achieves superior performances to state-of-the-art methods.

### SRC-Net: Bi-Temporal Spatial Relationship Concerned Network for Change Detection

- **Summary**: Change detection (CD) in remote sensing imagery is a crucial task with applications in environmental monitoring, urban development, and disaster management. CD involves utilizing bi-temporal images to identify changes over time. The bi-temporal spatial relationships between features at the same location at different times play a key role in this process. However, existing change detection networks often do not fully leverage these spatial relationships during bi-temporal feature extraction and fusion. In this work, we propose SRC-Net: a bi-temporal spatial relationship concerned network for CD. The proposed SRC-Net includes a Perception and Interaction Module that incorporates spatial relationships and establishes a cross-branch perception mechanism to enhance the precision and robustness of feature extraction. Additionally, a Patch-Mode joint Feature Fusion Module is introduced to address information loss in current methods. It considers different change modes and concerns about spatial relationships, resulting in more expressive fusion features. Furthermore, we construct a novel network using these two relationship concerned modules and conducted experiments on the LEVIR-CD and WHU Building datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our network outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while maintaining a modest parameter count. We believe our approach sets a new paradigm for change detection and will inspire further advancements in the field. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/Chnja/SRCNet.

- **Summary**: Modern machine learning pipelines leverage large amounts of public data, making it infeasible to guarantee data quality and leaving models open to poisoning and backdoor attacks. However, provably bounding model behavior under such attacks remains an open problem. In this work, we address this challenge and develop the first framework providing provable guarantees on the behavior of models trained with potentially manipulated data. In particular, our framework certifies robustness against untargeted and targeted poisoning as well as backdoor attacks for both input and label manipulations. Our method leverages convex relaxations to over-approximate the set of all possible parameter updates for a given poisoning threat model, allowing us to bound the set of all reachable parameters for any gradient-based learning algorithm. Given this set of parameters, we provide bounds on worst-case behavior, including model performance and backdoor success rate. We demonstrate our approach on multiple real-world datasets from applications including energy consumption, medical imaging, and autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: In the medical field, managing high-dimensional massive medical imaging data and performing reliable medical analysis from it is a critical challenge, especially in resource-limited environments such as remote medical facilities and mobile devices. This necessitates effective dataset compression techniques to reduce storage, transmission, and computational cost. However, existing coreset selection methods are primarily designed for natural image datasets, and exhibit doubtful effectiveness when applied to medical image datasets due to challenges such as intra-class variation and inter-class similarity. In this paper, we propose a novel coreset selection strategy termed as Evolution-aware VAriance (EVA), which captures the evolutionary process of model training through a dual-window approach and reflects the fluctuation of sample importance more precisely through variance measurement. Extensive experiments on medical image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy over previous SOTA methods, especially at high compression rates. EVA achieves 98.27% accuracy with only 10% training data, compared to 97.20% for the full training set. None of the compared baseline methods can exceed Random at 5% selection rate, while EVA outperforms Random by 5.61%, showcasing its potential for efficient medical image analysis.

- **Summary**: This paper studies learning fair encoders in a self-supervised learning (SSL) setting, in which all data are unlabeled and only a small portion of them are annotated with sensitive attribute.   Adversarial fair representation learning is well suited for this scenario by minimizing a contrastive loss over unlabeled data while maximizing an adversarial loss of predicting the sensitive attribute over the data with sensitive attribute. Nevertheless, optimizing adversarial fair representation learning presents significant challenges due to solving a non-convex non-concave minimax game. The complexity deepens when incorporating a global contrastive loss that contrasts each anchor data point against all other examples. A central question is ``{\it can we design a provable yet efficient algorithm for solving adversarial fair self-supervised contrastive learning}?'' Building on advanced optimization techniques, we propose a stochastic algorithm dubbed SoFCLR with a convergence analysis under reasonable conditions without requring a large batch size. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for downstream classification with eight fairness notions.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel method for generating diverse 3D human poses in scenes with semantic control. Existing methods heavily rely on the human-scene interaction dataset, resulting in a limited diversity of the generated human poses. To overcome this challenge, we propose to decouple the pose and interaction generation process. Our approach consists of three stages: pose generation, contact generation, and putting human into the scene. We train a pose generator on the human dataset to learn rich pose prior, and a contact generator on the human-scene interaction dataset to learn human-scene contact prior. Finally, the placing module puts the human body into the scene in a suitable and natural manner. The experimental results on the PROX dataset demonstrate that our method produces more physically plausible interactions and exhibits more diverse human poses. Furthermore, experiments on the MP3D-R dataset further validates the generalization ability of our method.

- **Summary**: Haze contamination in hyperspectral remote sensing images (HSI) can lead to spatial visibility degradation and spectral distortion. Haze in HSI exhibits spatial irregularity and inhomogeneous spectral distribution, with few dehazing networks available. Current CNN and Transformer-based dehazing methods fail to balance global scene recovery, local detail retention, and computational efficiency. Inspired by the ability of Mamba to model long-range dependencies with linear complexity, we explore its potential for HSI dehazing and propose the first HSI Dehazing Mamba (HDMba) network. Specifically, we design a novel window selective scan module (WSSM) that captures local dependencies within windows and global correlations between windows by partitioning them. This approach improves the ability of conventional Mamba in local feature extraction. By modeling the local and global spectral-spatial information flow, we achieve a comprehensive analysis of hazy regions. The DehazeMamba layer (DML), constructed by WSSM, and residual DehazeMamba (RDM) blocks, composed of DMLs, are the core components of the HDMba framework. These components effectively characterize the complex distribution of haze in HSIs, aiding in scene reconstruction and dehazing. Experimental results on the Gaofen-5 HSI dataset demonstrate that HDMba outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in dehazing performance. The code will be available at https://github.com/RsAI-lab/HDMba.

- **Summary**: Dataset distillation is an emerging dataset reduction method, which condenses large-scale datasets while maintaining task accuracy. Current methods have integrated parameterization techniques to boost synthetic dataset performance by shifting the optimization space from pixel to another informative feature domain. However, they limit themselves to a fixed optimization space for distillation, neglecting the diverse guidance across different informative latent spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel parameterization method dubbed Hierarchical Generative Latent Distillation (H-GLaD), to systematically explore hierarchical layers within the generative adversarial networks (GANs). This allows us to progressively span from the initial latent space to the final pixel space. In addition, we introduce a novel class-relevant feature distance metric to alleviate the computational burden associated with synthetic dataset evaluation, bridging the gap between synthetic and original datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed H-GLaD achieves a significant improvement in both same-architecture and cross-architecture performance with equivalent time consumption.

- **Summary**: Learning to infer labels in an open world, i.e., in an environment where the target "labels" are unknown, is an important characteristic for achieving autonomy. Foundation models pre-trained on enormous amounts of data have shown remarkable generalization skills through prompting, particularly in zero-shot inference. However, their performance is restricted to the correctness of the target label's search space. In an open world, this target search space can be unknown or exceptionally large, which severely restricts the performance of such models. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework called ALGO - Action Learning with Grounded Object recognition that uses symbolic knowledge stored in large-scale knowledge bases to infer activities in egocentric videos with limited supervision using two steps. First, we propose a neuro-symbolic prompting approach that uses object-centric vision-language models as a noisy oracle to ground objects in the video through evidence-based reasoning. Second, driven by prior commonsense knowledge, we discover plausible activities through an energy-based symbolic pattern theory framework and learn to ground knowledge-based action (verb) concepts in the video. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets (EPIC-Kitchens, GTEA Gaze, GTEA Gaze Plus) demonstrate its performance on open-world activity inference.

- **Summary**: Advanced diffusion models (DMs) perform impressively in image super-resolution (SR), but the high memory and computational costs hinder their deployment. Binarization, an ultra-compression algorithm, offers the potential for effectively accelerating DMs. Nonetheless, due to the model structure and the multi-step iterative attribute of DMs, existing binarization methods result in significant performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce a novel binarized diffusion model, BI-DiffSR, for image SR. First, for the model structure, we design a UNet architecture optimized for binarization. We propose the consistent-pixel-downsample (CP-Down) and consistent-pixel-upsample (CP-Up) to maintain dimension consistent and facilitate the full-precision information transfer. Meanwhile, we design the channel-shuffle-fusion (CS-Fusion) to enhance feature fusion in skip connection. Second, for the activation difference across timestep, we design the timestep-aware redistribution (TaR) and activation function (TaA). The TaR and TaA dynamically adjust the distribution of activations based on different timesteps, improving the flexibility and representation alability of the binarized module. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our BI-DiffSR outperforms existing binarization methods. Code is available at https://github.com/zhengchen1999/BI-DiffSR.

- **Summary**: The use of AI in public spaces continually raises concerns about privacy and the protection of sensitive data. An example is the deployment of detection and recognition methods on humans, where images are provided by surveillance cameras. This results in the acquisition of great amounts of sensitive data, since the capture and transmission of images taken by such cameras happens unaltered, for them to be received by a server on the network. However, many applications do not explicitly require the identity of a given person in a scene; An anonymized representation containing information of the person's position while preserving the context of them in the scene suffices. We show how using a customized loss function on region of interests (ROI) can achieve sufficient anonymization such that human faces become unrecognizable while persons are kept detectable, by training an end-to-end optimized autoencoder for learned image compression that utilizes the flexibility of the learned analysis and reconstruction transforms for the task of mutating parts of the compression result. This approach enables compression and anonymization in one step on the capture device, instead of transmitting sensitive, nonanonymized data over the network. Additionally, we evaluate how this anonymization impacts the average precision of pre-trained foundation models on detecting faces (MTCNN) and humans (YOLOv8) in comparison to non-ANN based methods, while considering compression rate and latency.

- **Summary**: Recently, Neural Fields have emerged as a powerful modelling paradigm to represent continuous signals. In a conditional neural field, a field is represented by a latent variable that conditions the NeF, whose parametrisation is otherwise shared over an entire dataset. We propose Equivariant Neural Fields based on cross attention transformers, in which NeFs are conditioned on a geometric conditioning variable, a latent point cloud, that enables an equivariant decoding from latent to field. Our equivariant approach induces a steerability property by which both field and latent are grounded in geometry and amenable to transformation laws if the field transforms, the latent represents transforms accordingly and vice versa. Crucially, the equivariance relation ensures that the latent is capable of (1) representing geometric patterns faitfhully, allowing for geometric reasoning in latent space, (2) weightsharing over spatially similar patterns, allowing for efficient learning of datasets of fields. These main properties are validated using classification experiments and a verification of the capability of fitting entire datasets, in comparison to other non-equivariant NeF approaches. We further validate the potential of ENFs by demonstrate unique local field editing properties.

- **Summary**: Despite notable advancements in the field of computer vision, the precise detection of tiny objects continues to pose a significant challenge, largely owing to the minuscule pixel representation allocated to these objects in imagery data. This challenge resonates profoundly in the domain of geoscience and remote sensing, where high-fidelity detection of tiny objects can facilitate a myriad of applications ranging from urban planning to environmental monitoring. In this paper, we propose a new framework, namely, DeNoising FPN with Trans R-CNN (DNTR), to improve the performance of tiny object detection. DNTR consists of an easy plug-in design, DeNoising FPN (DN-FPN), and an effective Transformer-based detector, Trans R-CNN. Specifically, feature fusion in the feature pyramid network is important for detecting multiscale objects. However, noisy features may be produced during the fusion process since there is no regularization between the features of different scales. Therefore, we introduce a DN-FPN module that utilizes contrastive learning to suppress noise in each level's features in the top-down path of FPN. Second, based on the two-stage framework, we replace the obsolete R-CNN detector with a novel Trans R-CNN detector to focus on the representation of tiny objects with self-attention. Experimental results manifest that our DNTR outperforms the baselines by at least 17.4% in terms of APvt on the AI-TOD dataset and 9.6% in terms of AP on the VisDrone dataset, respectively. Our code will be available at https://github.com/hoiliu-0801/DNTR.

- **Summary**: The recent rapid development of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has indicated their potential for embodied tasks.However, the critical skill of spatial understanding in embodied environments has not been thoroughly evaluated, leaving the gap between current LVLMs and qualified embodied intelligence unknown. Therefore, we construct EmbSpatial-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating embodied spatial understanding of LVLMs.The benchmark is automatically derived from embodied scenes and covers 6 spatial relationships from an egocentric perspective.Experiments expose the insufficient capacity of current LVLMs (even GPT-4V). We further present EmbSpatial-SFT, an instruction-tuning dataset designed to improve LVLMs' embodied spatial understanding.

- **Summary**: Classifying 3D MRI images for early detection of Alzheimer's disease is a critical task in medical imaging. Traditional approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers face significant challenges in this domain. CNNs, while effective in capturing local spatial features, struggle with long-range dependencies and often require extensive computational resources for high-resolution 3D data. Transformers, on the other hand, excel in capturing global context but suffer from quadratic complexity in inference time and require substantial memory, making them less efficient for large-scale 3D MRI data. To address these limitations, we propose the use of Vision Mamba, an advanced model based on State Space Models (SSMs), for the classification of 3D MRI images to detect Alzheimer's disease. Vision Mamba leverages dynamic state representations and the selective scan algorithm, allowing it to efficiently capture and retain important spatial information across 3D volumes. By dynamically adjusting state transitions based on input features, Vision Mamba can selectively retain relevant information, leading to more accurate and computationally efficient processing of 3D MRI data. Our approach combines the parallelizable nature of convolutional operations during training with the efficient, recurrent processing of states during inference. This architecture not only improves computational efficiency but also enhances the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies within 3D medical images. Experimental results demonstrate that Vision Mamba outperforms traditional CNN and Transformer models accuracy, making it a promising tool for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease using 3D MRI data.

- **Summary**: Multimodal fusion breaks through the barriers between diverse modalities and has already yielded numerous impressive performances. However, in various specialized fields, it is struggling to obtain sufficient alignment data for the training process, which seriously limits the use of previously elegant models. Thus, semi-supervised learning attempts to achieve multimodal alignment with fewer matched pairs but traditional methods like pseudo-labeling are difficult to apply in domains with no label information. To address these problems, we transform semi-supervised multimodal alignment into a manifold matching problem and propose a new method based on CLIP, named Gentle-CLIP. Specifically, we design a novel semantic density distribution loss to explore implicit semantic alignment information from unpaired multimodal data by constraining the latent representation distribution with fine granularity, thus eliminating the need for numerous strictly matched pairs. Meanwhile, we introduce multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy as well as self-supervised contrastive loss to pull separate modality distributions closer and enhance the stability of the representation distribution. In addition, the contrastive loss used in CLIP is employed on the supervised matched data to prevent negative optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on a range of tasks in various fields, including protein, remote sensing, and the general vision-language field, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Gentle-CLIP.

- **Summary**: Distilling large latent diffusion models (LDMs) into ones that are fast to sample from is attracting growing research interest. However, the majority of existing methods face a dilemma where they either (i) depend on multiple individual distilled models for different sampling budgets, or (ii) sacrifice generation quality with limited (e.g., 2-4) and/or moderate (e.g., 5-8) sampling steps. To address these, we extend the recent multistep consistency distillation (MCD) strategy to representative LDMs, establishing the Multistep Latent Consistency Models (MLCMs) approach for low-cost high-quality image synthesis. MLCM serves as a unified model for various sampling steps due to the promise of MCD. We further augment MCD with a progressive training strategy to strengthen inter-segment consistency to boost the quality of few-step generations. We take the states from the sampling trajectories of the teacher model as training data for MLCMs to lift the requirements for high-quality training datasets and to bridge the gap between the training and inference of the distilled model. MLCM is compatible with preference learning strategies for further improvement of visual quality and aesthetic appeal. Empirically, MLCM can generate high-quality, delightful images with only 2-8 sampling steps. On the MSCOCO-2017 5K benchmark, MLCM distilled from SDXL gets a CLIP Score of 33.30, Aesthetic Score of 6.19, and Image Reward of 1.20 with only 4 steps, substantially surpassing 4-step LCM [23], 8-step SDXL-Lightning [17], and 8-step HyperSD [33]. We also demonstrate the versatility of MLCMs in applications including controllable generation, image style transfer, and Chinese-to-image generation.

- **Summary**: Pre-training has emerged as a simple yet powerful methodology for representation learning across various domains. However, due to the expensive training cost and limited data, pre-training has not yet been extensively studied in correspondence pruning. To tackle these challenges, we propose a pre-training method to acquire a generic inliers-consistent representation by reconstructing masked correspondences, providing a strong initial representation for downstream tasks. Toward this objective, a modicum of true correspondences naturally serve as input, thus significantly reducing pre-training overhead. In practice, we introduce CorrMAE, an extension of the mask autoencoder framework tailored for the pre-training of correspondence pruning. CorrMAE involves two main phases, \ie correspondence learning and matching point reconstruction, guiding the reconstruction of masked correspondences through learning visible correspondence consistency. Herein, we employ a dual-branch structure with an ingenious positional encoding to reconstruct unordered and irregular correspondences. Also, a bi-level designed encoder is proposed for correspondence learning, which offers enhanced consistency learning capability and transferability. Extensive experiments have shown that the model pre-trained with our CorrMAE outperforms prior work on multiple challenging benchmarks. Meanwhile, our CorrMAE is primarily a task-driven pre-training method, and can achieve notable improvements for downstream tasks by pre-training on the targeted dataset. We hope this work can provide a starting point for correspondence pruning pre-training.

- **Summary**: Although 3D Gaussian Splatting has been widely studied because of its realistic and efficient novel-view synthesis, it is still challenging to extract a high-quality surface from the point-based representation. Previous works improve the surface by incorporating geometric priors from the off-the-shelf normal estimator. However, there are two main limitations: 1) Supervising normal rendered from 3D Gaussians updates only the rotation parameter while neglecting other geometric parameters; 2) The inconsistency of predicted normal maps across multiple views may lead to severe reconstruction artifacts. In this paper, we propose a Depth-Normal regularizer that directly couples normal with other geometric parameters, leading to full updates of the geometric parameters from normal regularization. We further propose a confidence term to mitigate inconsistencies of normal predictions across multiple views. Moreover, we also introduce a densification and splitting strategy to regularize the size and distribution of 3D Gaussians for more accurate surface modeling. Compared with Gaussian-based baselines, experiments show that our approach obtains better reconstruction quality and maintains competitive appearance quality at faster training speed and 100+ FPS rendering. Our code will be made open-source upon paper acceptance.

- **Summary**: Visually detecting camouflaged objects is a hard problem for both humans and computer vision algorithms. Strong similarities between object and background appearance make the task significantly more challenging than traditional object detection or segmentation tasks. Current state-of-the-art models use either convolutional neural networks or vision transformers as feature extractors. They are trained in a fully supervised manner and thus need a large amount of labeled training data. In this paper, both self-supervised and frugal learning methods are introduced to the task of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD). The overall goal is to fine-tune two COD reference methods, namely SINet-V2 and HitNet, pre-trained for camouflaged animal detection to the task of camouflaged human detection. Therefore, we use the public dataset CPD1K that contains camouflaged humans in a forest environment. We create a strong baseline using supervised frugal transfer learning for the fine-tuning task. Then, we analyze three pseudo-labeling approaches to perform the fine-tuning task in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments show that we achieve similar performance by pure self-supervision compared to fully supervised frugal learning.

- **Summary**: Edge detection is a fundamental task in computer vision and it has made great progress under the development of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), some of them have achieved a beyond human-level performance. However, recent top-performing edge detection methods tend to generate thick and blurred edge lines. In this work, we propose an effective method to solve this problem. Our approach consists of a lightweight pre-trained backbone, multi-scale contextual enhancement module aggregating gradient information (MCGI), boundary correction module (BCM), and boundary refinement module (BRM). In addition to this, we construct a novel hybrid loss function based on the Tversky index for solving the issue of imbalanced pixel distribution. We test our method on three standard benchmarks and the experiment results illustrate that our method improves the visual effect of edge maps and achieves a top performance among several state-of-the-art methods on the BSDS500 dataset (ODS F-score in standard evaluation is 0.829, in crispness evaluation is 0.720), NYUD-V2 dataset (ODS F-score in standard evaluation is 0.768, in crispness evaluation is \textbf{0.546}), and BIPED dataset (ODS F-score in standard evaluation is 0.903).

- **Summary**: Text-guided 3D visual grounding (T-3DVG), which aims to locate a specific object that semantically corresponds to a language query from a complicated 3D scene, has drawn increasing attention in the 3D research community over the past few years. Compared to 2D visual grounding, this task presents great potential and challenges due to its closer proximity to the real world and the complexity of data collection and 3D point cloud source processing. In this survey, we attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of the T-3DVG progress, including its fundamental elements, recent research advances, and future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic survey on the T-3DVG task. Specifically, we first provide a general structure of the T-3DVG pipeline with detailed components in a tutorial style, presenting a complete background overview. Then, we summarize the existing T-3DVG approaches into different categories and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. We also present the benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics to assess their performances. Finally, we discuss the potential limitations of existing T-3DVG and share some insights on several promising research directions.

This paper demonstrates that convolution and self-attention, while widely used, are not the only effective methods for segmentation. Breaking with convention, we present a Convolution and self-Attention Free Mamba-based semantic Segmentation Network named CAF-MambaSegNet. Specifically, we design a Mamba-based Channel Aggregator and Spatial Aggregator, which are applied independently in each encoder-decoder stage. The Channel Aggregator extracts information across different channels, and the Spatial Aggregator learns features across different spatial locations. We also propose a Linearly Interconnected Factorized Mamba (LIFM) Block to reduce the computational complexity of a Mamba and to enhance its decision function by introducing a non-linearity between two factorized Mamba blocks. Our goal is not to outperform state-of-the-art results but to show how this innovative, convolution and self-attention-free method can inspire further research beyond well-established CNNs and Transformers, achieving linear complexity and reducing the number of parameters. Source code and pre-trained models will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: DEtection TRansformer (DETR) becomes a dominant paradigm, mainly due to its common architecture with high accuracy and no post-processing. However, DETR suffers from unstable training dynamics. It consumes more data and epochs to converge compared with CNN-based detectors. This paper aims to stabilize DETR training through the online distillation. It utilizes a teacher model, accumulated by Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and distills its knowledge into the online model in following three aspects. First, the matching relation between object queries and ground truth (GT) boxes in the teacher is employed to guide the student, so queries within the student are not only assigned labels based on their own predictions, but also refer to the matching results from the teacher. Second, the teacher's initial query is given to the online student, and its prediction is directly constrained by the corresponding output from the teacher. Finally, the object queries from teacher's different decoding stages are used to build the auxiliary groups to accelerate the convergence. For each GT, two queries with the least matching costs are selected into this extra group, and they predict the GT box and participate the optimization. Extensive experiments show that the proposed OD-DETR successfully stabilizes the training, and significantly increases the performance without bringing in more parameters.

- **Summary**: The need for abundant labelled data in supervised Adversarial Training (AT) has prompted the use of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques with AT. However, the direct application of existing SSL methods to adversarial training has been sub-optimal due to the increased training complexity of combining SSL with AT. A recent approach, DeACL, mitigates this by utilizing supervision from a standard SSL teacher in a distillation setting, to mimic supervised AT. However, we find that there is still a large performance gap when compared to supervised adversarial training, specifically on larger models. In this work, investigate the key reason for this gap and propose Projected Feature Adversarial Training (ProFeAT) to bridge the same. We show that the sub-optimal distillation performance is a result of mismatch in training objectives of the teacher and student, and propose to use a projection head at the student, that allows it to leverage weak supervision from the teacher while also being able to learn adversarially robust representations that are distinct from the teacher. We further propose appropriate attack and defense losses at the feature and projector, alongside a combination of weak and strong augmentations for the teacher and student respectively, to improve the training data diversity without increasing the training complexity. Through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets and models, we demonstrate significant improvements in both clean and robust accuracy when compared to existing SSL-AT methods, setting a new state-of-the-art. We further report on-par/ improved performance when compared to TRADES, a popular supervised-AT method.

- **Summary**: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems critically depend on visual perception for real-time object detection and multiple object tracking (MOT) to ensure safe driving. However, high latency in these visual perception components can lead to significant safety risks, such as vehicle collisions. While previous research has extensively explored latency attacks within the digital realm, translating these methods effectively to the physical world presents challenges. For instance, existing attacks rely on perturbations that are unrealistic or impractical for AD, such as adversarial perturbations affecting areas like the sky, or requiring large patches that obscure most of a camera's view, thus making them impossible to be conducted effectively in the real world.   In this paper, we introduce SlowPerception, the first physical-world latency attack against AD perception, via generating projector-based universal perturbations. SlowPerception strategically creates numerous phantom objects on various surfaces in the environment, significantly increasing the computational load of Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and MOT, thereby inducing substantial latency. Our SlowPerception achieves second-level latency in physical-world settings, with an average latency of 2.5 seconds across different AD perception systems, scenarios, and hardware configurations. This performance significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art latency attacks. Additionally, we conduct AD system-level impact assessments, such as vehicle collisions, using industry-grade AD systems with production-grade AD simulators with a 97% average rate. We hope that our analyses can inspire further research in this critical domain, enhancing the robustness of AD systems against emerging vulnerabilities.

- **Summary**: In the domain of large foundation models, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has gained notable recognition for its exceptional performance in image segmentation. However, tackling the video camouflage object detection (VCOD) task presents a unique challenge. Camouflaged objects typically blend into the background, making them difficult to distinguish in still images. Additionally, ensuring temporal consistency in this context is a challenging problem. As a result, SAM encounters limitations and falls short when applied to the VCOD task. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new method called the SAM Propagation Module (SAM-PM). Our propagation module enforces temporal consistency within SAM by employing spatio-temporal cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, we exclusively train the propagation module while keeping the SAM network weights frozen, allowing us to integrate task-specific insights with the vast knowledge accumulated by the large model. Our method effectively incorporates temporal consistency and domain-specific expertise into the segmentation network with an addition of less than 1% of SAM's parameters. Extensive experimentation reveals a substantial performance improvement in the VCOD benchmark when compared to the most recent state-of-the-art techniques.

- **Summary**: Recent research in adversarial machine learning has focused on visual perception in Autonomous Driving (AD) and has shown that printed adversarial patches can attack object detectors. However, it is important to note that AD visual perception encompasses more than just object detection; it also includes Multiple Object Tracking (MOT). MOT enhances the robustness by compensating for object detection errors and requiring consistent object detection results across multiple frames before influencing tracking results and driving decisions. Thus, MOT makes attacks on object detection alone less effective. To attack such robust AD visual perception, a digital hijacking attack has been proposed to cause dangerous driving scenarios. However, this attack has limited effectiveness.   In this paper, we introduce a novel physical-world adversarial patch attack, ControlLoc, designed to exploit hijacking vulnerabilities in entire AD visual perception. ControlLoc utilizes a two-stage process: initially identifying the optimal location for the adversarial patch, and subsequently generating the patch that can modify the perceived location and shape of objects with the optimal location. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of ControlLoc, achieving an impressive average attack success rate of around 98.1% across various AD visual perceptions and datasets, which is four times greater effectiveness than the existing hijacking attack. The effectiveness of ControlLoc is further validated in physical-world conditions, including real vehicle tests under different conditions such as outdoor light conditions with an average attack success rate of 77.5%. AD system-level impact assessments are also included, such as vehicle collision, using industry-grade AD systems and production-grade AD simulators with an average vehicle collision rate and unnecessary emergency stop rate of 81.3%.

- **Summary**: How humans can efficiently and effectively acquire images has always been a perennial question. A typical solution is text-to-image retrieval from an existing database given the text query; however, the limited database typically lacks creativity. By contrast, recent breakthroughs in text-to-image generation have made it possible to produce fancy and diverse visual content, but it faces challenges in synthesizing knowledge-intensive images. In this work, we rethink the relationship between text-to-image generation and retrieval and propose a unified framework in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we first explore the intrinsic discriminative abilities of MLLMs and introduce a generative retrieval method to perform retrieval in a training-free manner. Subsequently, we unify generation and retrieval in an autoregressive generation way and propose an autonomous decision module to choose the best-matched one between generated and retrieved images as the response to the text query. Additionally, we construct a benchmark called TIGeR-Bench, including creative and knowledge-intensive domains, to standardize the evaluation of unified text-to-image generation and retrieval. Extensive experimental results on TIGeR-Bench and two retrieval benchmarks, i.e., Flickr30K and MS-COCO, demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: Endowing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with visual grounding capability can significantly enhance AIs' understanding of the visual world and their interaction with humans. However, existing methods typically fine-tune the parameters of LMMs to learn additional segmentation tokens and overfit grounding and segmentation datasets. Such a design would inevitably cause a catastrophic diminution in the indispensable conversational capability of general AI assistants. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate state-of-the-art grounding LMMs across a suite of multimodal question-answering benchmarks, observing pronounced performance drops that indicate vanishing general knowledge comprehension and weakened instruction following ability. To address this issue, we present F-LMM -- grounding frozen off-the-shelf LMMs in human-AI conversations -- a straightforward yet effective design based on the fact that word-pixel correspondences conducive to visual grounding inherently exist in the attention weights of well-trained LMMs. Using only a few trainable CNN layers, we can translate word-pixel attention weights to mask logits, which a SAM-based mask refiner can further optimise. Our F-LMM neither learns special segmentation tokens nor utilises high-quality grounded instruction-tuning data, but achieves competitive performance on referring expression segmentation and panoptic narrative grounding benchmarks while completely preserving LMMs' original conversational ability. Additionally, with instruction-following ability preserved and grounding ability obtained, our F-LMM can perform visual chain-of-thought reasoning and better resist object hallucinations.

- **Summary**: Digital pathology and microscopy image analysis are widely employed in the segmentation of digitally scanned IHC slides, primarily to identify cancer and pinpoint regions of interest (ROI) indicative of tumor presence. However, current ROI segmentation models are either stain-specific or suffer from the issues of stain and scanner variance due to different staining protocols or modalities across multiple labs. Also, tissues like Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS), acini, etc. are often classified as Tumors due to their structural similarities and color compositions. In this paper, we proposed a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) based Multi-class Tissue Segmentation model for histopathology whole-slide Breast slides which classify tumors and segments other tissue regions such as Ducts, acini, DCIS, Squamous epithelium, Blood Vessels, Necrosis, etc. as a separate class. Our unique pixel-aligned non-linear merge across spatial resolutions empowers models with both local and global fields of view for accurate detection of various classes. Our proposed model is also able to separate bad regions such as folds, artifacts, blurry regions, bubbles, etc. from tissue regions using multi-level context from different resolutions of WSI. Multi-phase iterative training with context-aware augmentation and increasing noise was used to efficiently train a multi-stain generic model with partial and noisy annotations from 513 slides. Our training pipeline used 12 million patches generated using context-aware augmentations which made our model stain and scanner invariant across data sources. To extrapolate stain and scanner invariance, our model was evaluated on 23000 patches which were for a completely new stain (Hematoxylin and Eosin) from a completely new scanner (Motic) from a different lab. The mean IOU was 0.72 which is on par with model performance on other data sources and scanners.

- **Summary**: Propelled by the rapid advancement of deep learning technologies, the YOLO series has set a new benchmark for real-time object detectors. Researchers have continuously explored innovative applications of reparameterization, efficient layer aggregation networks, and anchor-free techniques on the foundation of YOLO. To further enhance detection performance, Transformer-based structures have been introduced, significantly expanding the model's receptive field and achieving notable performance gains. However, such improvements come at a cost, as the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism increases the computational burden of the model. Fortunately, the emergence of State Space Models (SSM) as an innovative technology has effectively mitigated the issues caused by quadratic complexity. In light of these advancements, we introduce Mamba-YOLO a novel object detection model based on SSM. Mamba-YOLO not only optimizes the SSM foundation but also adapts specifically for object detection tasks. Given the potential limitations of SSM in sequence modeling, such as insufficient receptive field and weak image locality, we have designed the LSBlock and RGBlock. These modules enable more precise capture of local image dependencies and significantly enhance the robustness of the model. Extensive experimental results on the publicly available benchmark datasets COCO and VOC demonstrate that Mamba-YOLO surpasses the existing YOLO series models in both performance and competitiveness, showcasing its substantial potential and competitive edge.The PyTorch code is available at:\url{https://github.com/HZAI-ZJNU/Mamba-YOLO}

- **Summary**: To compete with existing mobile architectures, MobileViG introduces Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA), a fast token-mixing operator based on the principles of GNNs. However, MobileViG scales poorly with model size, falling at most 1% behind models with similar latency. This paper introduces Mobile Graph Convolution (MGC), a new vision graph neural network (ViG) module that solves this scaling problem. Our proposed mobile vision architecture, MobileViGv2, uses MGC to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. MGC improves on SVGA by increasing graph sparsity and introducing conditional positional encodings to the graph operation. Our smallest model, MobileViGv2-Ti, achieves a 77.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, 2% higher than MobileViG-Ti, with 0.9 ms inference latency on the iPhone 13 Mini NPU. Our largest model, MobileViGv2-B, achieves an 83.4% top-1 accuracy, 0.8% higher than MobileViG-B, with 2.7 ms inference latency. Besides image classification, we show that MobileViGv2 generalizes well to other tasks. For object detection and instance segmentation on MS COCO 2017, MobileViGv2-M outperforms MobileViG-M by 1.2 $AP^{box}$ and 0.7 $AP^{mask}$, and MobileViGv2-B outperforms MobileViG-B by 1.0 $AP^{box}$ and 0.7 $AP^{mask}$. For semantic segmentation on ADE20K, MobileViGv2-M achieves 42.9% $mIoU$ and MobileViGv2-B achieves 44.3% $mIoU$. Our code can be found at \url{https://github.com/SLDGroup/MobileViGv2}.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has made a notable advancement in the field of neural rendering, 3D scene reconstruction, and novel view synthesis. Nevertheless, 3D-GS encounters the main challenge when it comes to accurately representing physical reflections, especially in the case of total reflection and semi-reflection that are commonly found in real-world scenes. This limitation causes reflections to be mistakenly treated as independent elements with physical presence, leading to imprecise reconstructions. Herein, to tackle this challenge, we propose RefGaussian to disentangle reflections from 3D-GS for realistically modeling reflections. Specifically, we propose to split a scene into transmitted and reflected components and represent these components using two Spherical Harmonics (SH). Given that this decomposition is not fully determined, we employ local regularization techniques to ensure local smoothness for both the transmitted and reflected components, thereby achieving more plausible decomposition outcomes than 3D-GS. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior novel view synthesis and accurate depth estimation outcomes. Furthermore, it enables the utilization of scene editing applications, ensuring both high-quality results and physical coherence.

- **Summary**: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) plays a vital role in applications such as autonomous driving. However, various attacks target MDE models, with physical attacks posing significant threats to system security. Traditional adversarial training methods, which require ground-truth labels, are not directly applicable to MDE models that lack ground-truth depth. Some self-supervised model hardening techniques (e.g., contrastive learning) overlook the domain knowledge of MDE, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this work, we introduce a novel self-supervised adversarial training approach for MDE models, leveraging view synthesis without the need for ground-truth depth. We enhance adversarial robustness against real-world attacks by incorporating L_0-norm-bounded perturbation during training. We evaluate our method against supervised learning-based and contrastive learning-based approaches specifically designed for MDE. Our experiments with two representative MDE networks demonstrate improved robustness against various adversarial attacks, with minimal impact on benign performance.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancements in the development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have consistently led to new breakthroughs on various benchmarks. In response, numerous challenging and comprehensive benchmarks have been proposed to more accurately assess the capabilities of MLLMs. However, there is a dearth of exploration of the higher-order perceptual capabilities of MLLMs. To fill this gap, we propose the Image Implication understanding Benchmark, II-Bench, which aims to evaluate the model's higher-order perception of images. Through extensive experiments on II-Bench across multiple MLLMs, we have made significant findings. Initially, a substantial gap is observed between the performance of MLLMs and humans on II-Bench. The pinnacle accuracy of MLLMs attains 74.8%, whereas human accuracy averages 90%, peaking at an impressive 98%. Subsequently, MLLMs perform worse on abstract and complex images, suggesting limitations in their ability to understand high-level semantics and capture image details. Finally, it is observed that most models exhibit enhanced accuracy when image sentiment polarity hints are incorporated into the prompts. This observation underscores a notable deficiency in their inherent understanding of image sentiment. We believe that II-Bench will inspire the community to develop the next generation of MLLMs, advancing the journey towards expert artificial general intelligence (AGI). II-Bench is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/m-a-p/II-Bench.

- **Summary**: This paper discusses a simple and effective method for the summation of long sequences of floating point numbers. The method comprises two phases: an accumulation phase where the mantissas of the floating point numbers are added to accumulators indexed by the exponents and a reconstruction phase where the actual summation result is finalised. Various architectural details are given for both FPGAs and ASICs including fusing the operation with a multiplier, creating efficient MACs.

- **Summary**: We provide a two-way integration for the widely adopted ControlNet by integrating external condition generation algorithms into a single dense prediction method and incorporating its individually trained image generation processes into a single model. Despite its tremendous success, the ControlNet of a two-stage pipeline bears limitations in being not self-contained (e.g. calls the external condition generation algorithms) with a large model redundancy (separately trained models for different types of conditioning inputs). Our proposed OmniControlNet consolidates 1) the condition generation (e.g., HED edges, depth maps, user scribble, and animal pose) by a single multi-tasking dense prediction algorithm under the task embedding guidance and 2) the image generation process for different conditioning types under the textual embedding guidance. OmniControlNet achieves significantly reduced model complexity and redundancy while capable of producing images of comparable quality for conditioned text-to-image generation.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and monitoring. Though effective, the current segmentation networks such as UNet struggle with capturing long-range features. More accurate models such as TransUNet, Swin-UNet, and CS-UNet have higher computation complexity. To address this problem, we propose GCtx-UNet, a lightweight segmentation architecture that can capture global and local image features with accuracy better or comparable to the state-of-the-art approaches. GCtx-UNet uses vision transformer that leverages global context self-attention modules joined with local self-attention to model long and short range spatial dependencies. GCtx-UNet is evaluated on the Synapse multi-organ abdominal CT dataset, the ACDC cardiac MRI dataset, and several polyp segmentation datasets. In terms of Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff Distance (HD) metrics, GCtx-UNet outperformed CNN-based and Transformer-based approaches, with notable gains in the segmentation of complex and small anatomical structures. Moreover, GCtx-UNet is much more efficient than the state-of-the-art approaches with smaller model size, lower computation workload, and faster training and inference speed, making it a practical choice for clinical applications.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussians, as a low-level scene representation, typically involve thousands to millions of Gaussians. This makes it difficult to control the scene in ways that reflect the underlying dynamic structure, where the number of independent entities is typically much smaller. In particular, it can be challenging to animate and move objects in the scene, which requires coordination among many Gaussians. To address this issue, we develop a mutual information shaping technique that enforces movement resonance between correlated Gaussians in a motion network. Such correlations can be learned from putative 2D object masks in different views. By approximating the mutual information with the Jacobians of the motions, our method ensures consistent movements of the Gaussians composing different objects under various perturbations. In particular, we develop an efficient contrastive training pipeline with lightweight optimization to shape the motion network, avoiding the need for re-shaping throughout the motion sequence. Notably, our training only touches a small fraction of all Gaussians in the scene yet attains the desired compositional behavior according to the underlying dynamic structure. The proposed technique is evaluated on challenging scenes and demonstrates significant performance improvement in promoting consistent movements and 3D object segmentation while inducing low computation and memory requirements.

- **Summary**: Land Use Land Cover (LULC) analysis on satellite images using deep learning-based methods is significantly helpful in understanding the geography, socio-economic conditions, poverty levels, and urban sprawl in developing countries. Recent works involve segmentation with LULC classes such as farmland, built-up areas, forests, meadows, water bodies, etc. Training deep learning methods on satellite images requires large sets of images annotated with LULC classes. However, annotated data for developing countries are scarce due to a lack of funding, absence of dedicated residential/industrial/economic zones, a large population, and diverse building materials. BD-SAT provides a high-resolution dataset that includes pixel-by-pixel LULC annotations for Dhaka metropolitan city and surrounding rural/urban areas. Using a strict and standardized procedure, the ground truth is created using Bing satellite imagery with a ground spatial distance of 2.22 meters per pixel. A three-stage, well-defined annotation process has been followed with support from GIS experts to ensure the reliability of the annotations. We performed several experiments to establish benchmark results. The results show that the annotated BD-SAT is sufficient to train large deep learning models with adequate accuracy for five major LULC classes: forest, farmland, built-up areas, water bodies, and meadows.

- **Summary**: Point cloud is a promising 3D representation for volumetric streaming in emerging AR/VR applications. Despite recent advances in point cloud compression, decoding and rendering high-quality images from lossy compressed point clouds is still challenging in terms of quality and complexity, making it a major roadblock to achieve real-time 6-Degree-of-Freedom video streaming. In this paper, we address this problem by developing a point cloud compression scheme that generates a bit stream that can be directly decoded to renderable 3D Gaussians. The encoder and decoder are jointly optimized to consider both bit-rates and rendering quality. It significantly improves the rendering quality while substantially reducing decoding and rendering time, compared to existing point cloud compression methods. Furthermore, the proposed scheme generates a scalable bit stream, allowing multiple levels of details at different bit-rate ranges. Our method supports real-time color decoding and rendering of high quality point clouds, thus paving the way for interactive 3D streaming applications with free view points.

- **Summary**: We present a simple yet effective method to improve the robustness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) against adversarial examples by post-processing an adversarially trained model. Our technique, MeanSparse, cascades the activation functions of a trained model with novel operators that sparsify mean-centered feature vectors. This is equivalent to reducing feature variations around the mean, and we show that such reduced variations merely affect the model's utility, yet they strongly attenuate the adversarial perturbations and decrease the attacker's success rate. Our experiments show that, when applied to the top models in the RobustBench leaderboard, it achieves a new robustness record of 72.08% (from 71.07%) and 59.64% (from 59.56%) on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, respectively, in term of AutoAttack accuracy.
