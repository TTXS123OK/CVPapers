- **Summary**: Various pose estimation and tracking problems in robotics can be decomposed into a correspondence estimation problem (often computed using a deep network) followed by a weighted least squares optimization problem to solve for the poses. Recent work has shown that coupling the two problems by iteratively refining one conditioned on the other's output yields SOTA results across domains. However, training these models has proved challenging, requiring a litany of tricks to stabilize and speed up training. In this work, we take the visual odometry problem as an example and identify three plausible causes: (1) flow loss interference, (2) linearization errors in the bundle adjustment (BA) layer, and (3) dependence of weight gradients on the BA residual. We show how these issues result in noisy and higher variance gradients, potentially leading to a slow down in training and instabilities. We then propose a simple, yet effective solution to reduce the gradient variance by using the weights predicted by the network in the inner optimization loop to weight the correspondence objective in the training problem. This helps the training objective `focus' on the more important points, thereby reducing the variance and mitigating the influence of outliers. We show that the resulting method leads to faster training and can be more flexibly trained in varying training setups without sacrificing performance. In particular we show $2$--$2.5\times$ training speedups over a baseline visual odometry model we modify.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in image and video synthesis. However, scaling them to high-resolution inputs is challenging and requires restructuring the diffusion pipeline into multiple independent components, limiting scalability and complicating downstream applications. This makes it very efficient during training and unlocks end-to-end optimization on high-resolution videos. We improve PDMs in two principled ways. First, to enforce consistency between patches, we develop deep context fusion -- an architectural technique that propagates the context information from low-scale to high-scale patches in a hierarchical manner. Second, to accelerate training and inference, we propose adaptive computation, which allocates more network capacity and computation towards coarse image details. The resulting model sets a new state-of-the-art FVD score of 66.32 and Inception Score of 87.68 in class-conditional video generation on UCF-101 $256^2$, surpassing recent methods by more than 100%. Then, we show that it can be rapidly fine-tuned from a base $36\times 64$ low-resolution generator for high-resolution $64 \times 288 \times 512$ text-to-video synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first diffusion-based architecture which is trained on such high resolutions entirely end-to-end.

- **Summary**: Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is a key tool for assessing breast cancer progression. Although deep learning has been applied to automate tumor segmentation in breast MRI, the effect of sequence combinations in mpMRI remains under-investigated. This study explores the impact of different combinations of T2-weighted (T2w), dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map on breast tumor segmentation using nnU-Net. Evaluated on a multicenter mpMRI dataset, the nnU-Net model using DCE sequences achieved a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.18 for functional tumor volume (FTV) segmentation. For whole tumor mask (WTM) segmentation, adding the predicted FTV to DWI and ADC map improved the DSC from 0.57 $\pm$ 0.24 to 0.60 $\pm$ 0.21. Adding T2w did not yield significant improvement, which still requires further investigation under a more standardized imaging protocol. This study serves as a foundation for future work on predicting breast cancer treatment response using mpMRI.

- **Summary**: Explainable AI (XAI) has revolutionized the field of deep learning by empowering users to have more trust in neural network models. The field of XAI allows users to probe the inner workings of these algorithms to elucidate their decision-making processes. The rise in popularity of XAI has led to the advent of different strategies to produce explanations, all of which only occasionally agree. Thus several objective evaluation metrics have been devised to decide which of these modules give the best explanation for specific scenarios. The goal of the paper is twofold: (i) we employ the notions of necessity and sufficiency from causal literature to come up with a novel explanatory technique called SHifted Adversaries using Pixel Elimination(SHAPE) which satisfies all the theoretical and mathematical criteria of being a valid explanation, (ii) we show that SHAPE is, infact, an adversarial explanation that fools causal metrics that are employed to measure the robustness and reliability of popular importance based visual XAI methods. Our analysis shows that SHAPE outperforms popular explanatory techniques like GradCAM and GradCAM++ in these tests and is comparable to RISE, raising questions about the sanity of these metrics and the need for human involvement for an overall better evaluation.

- **Summary**: Mobile app user interfaces (UIs) are rich with action, text, structure, and image content that can be utilized to learn generic UI representations for tasks like automating user commands, summarizing content, and evaluating the accessibility of user interfaces. Prior work has learned strong visual representations with local or global captioning losses, but fails to retain both granularities. To combat this, we propose Textual Foresight, a novel pretraining objective for learning UI screen representations. Textual Foresight generates global text descriptions of future UI states given a current UI and local action taken. Our approach requires joint reasoning over elements and entire screens, resulting in improved UI features: on generation tasks, UI agents trained with Textual Foresight outperform state-of-the-art by 2% with 28x fewer images. We train with our newly constructed mobile app dataset, OpenApp, which results in the first public dataset for app UI representation learning. OpenApp enables new baselines, and we find Textual Foresight improves average task performance over them by 5.7% while having access to 2x less data.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with hybrid representations have shown impressive capabilities in reconstructing scenes for view synthesis, delivering high efficiency. Nonetheless, their performance significantly drops with sparse view inputs, due to the issue of overfitting. While various regularization strategies have been devised to address these challenges, they often depend on inefficient assumptions or are not compatible with hybrid models. There is a clear need for a method that maintains efficiency and improves resilience to sparse views within a hybrid framework. In this paper, we introduce an accurate and efficient few-shot neural rendering method named Spatial Annealing smoothing regularized NeRF (SANeRF), which is specifically designed for a pre-filtering-driven hybrid representation architecture. We implement an exponential reduction of the sample space size from an initially large value. This methodology is crucial for stabilizing the early stages of the training phase and significantly contributes to the enhancement of the subsequent process of detail refinement. Our extensive experiments reveal that, by adding merely one line of code, SANeRF delivers superior rendering quality and much faster reconstruction speed compared to current few-shot NeRF methods. Notably, SANeRF outperforms FreeNeRF by 0.3 dB in PSNR on the Blender dataset, while achieving 700x faster reconstruction speed.



### Sense Less, Generate More: Pre-training LiDAR Perception with Masked Autoencoders for Ultra-Efficient 3D Sensing

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose a disruptively frugal LiDAR perception dataflow that generates rather than senses parts of the environment that are either predictable based on the extensive training of the environment or have limited consequence to the overall prediction accuracy. Therefore, the proposed methodology trades off sensing energy with training data for low-power robotics and autonomous navigation to operate frugally with sensors, extending their lifetime on a single battery charge. Our proposed generative pre-training strategy for this purpose, called as radially masked autoencoding (R-MAE), can also be readily implemented in a typical LiDAR system by selectively activating and controlling the laser power for randomly generated angular regions during on-field operations. Our extensive evaluations show that pre-training with R-MAE enables focusing on the radial segments of the data, thereby capturing spatial relationships and distances between objects more effectively than conventional procedures. Therefore, the proposed methodology not only reduces sensing energy but also improves prediction accuracy. For example, our extensive evaluations on Waymo, nuScenes, and KITTI datasets show that the approach achieves over a 5% average precision improvement in detection tasks across datasets and over a 4% accuracy improvement in transferring domains from Waymo and nuScenes to KITTI. In 3D object detection, it enhances small object detection by up to 4.37% in AP at moderate difficulty levels in the KITTI dataset. Even with 90% radial masking, it surpasses baseline models by up to 5.59% in mAP/mAPH across all object classes in the Waymo dataset. Additionally, our method achieves up to 3.17% and 2.31% improvements in mAP and NDS, respectively, on the nuScenes dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness with both single and fused LiDAR-camera modalities. https://github.com/sinatayebati/Radial_MAE.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in generative models have unlocked the capabilities to render photo-realistic data in a controllable fashion. Trained on the real data, these generative models are capable of producing realistic samples with minimal to no domain gap, as compared to the traditional graphics rendering. However, using the data generated using such models for training downstream tasks remains under-explored, mainly due to the lack of 3D consistent annotations. Moreover, controllable generative models are learned from massive data and their latent space is often too vast to obtain meaningful sample distributions for downstream task with limited generation. To overcome these challenges, we extract 3D consistent annotations from an existing controllable generative model, making the data useful for downstream tasks. Our experiments show competitive performance against state-of-the-art models using only generated synthetic data, demonstrating potential for solving downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: We address the challenge of detecting questionable content in online media, specifically the subcategory of comic mischief. This type of content combines elements such as violence, adult content, or sarcasm with humor, making it difficult to detect. Employing a multimodal approach is vital to capture the subtle details inherent in comic mischief content. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel end-to-end multimodal system for the task of comic mischief detection. As part of this contribution, we release a novel dataset for the targeted task consisting of three modalities: video, text (video captions and subtitles), and audio. We also design a HIerarchical Cross-attention model with CAPtions (HICCAP) to capture the intricate relationships among these modalities. The results show that the proposed approach makes a significant improvement over robust baselines and state-of-the-art models for comic mischief detection and its type classification. This emphasizes the potential of our system to empower users, to make informed decisions about the online content they choose to see. In addition, we conduct experiments on the UCF101, HMDB51, and XD-Violence datasets, comparing our model against other state-of-the-art approaches showcasing the outstanding performance of our proposed model in various scenarios.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be the state-of-the-art approach for modeling the transfer functions of visual cortical neurons. Cortical neurons in the primary visual cortex are are sensitive to contextual information mediated by extensive horizontal and feedback connections. Standard CNNs can integrate global spatial image information to model such contextual modulation via two mechanisms: successive rounds of convolutions and a fully connected readout layer. In this paper, we find that non-local networks or self-attention (SA) mechanisms, theoretically related to context-dependent flexible gating mechanisms observed in the primary visual cortex, improve neural response predictions over parameter-matched CNNs in two key metrics: tuning curve correlation and tuning peak. We factorize networks to determine the relative contribution of each context mechanism. This reveals that information in the local receptive field is most important for modeling the overall tuning curve, but surround information is critically necessary for characterizing the tuning peak. We find that self-attention can replace subsequent spatial-integration convolutions when learned in an incremental manner, and is further enhanced in the presence of a fully connected readout layer, suggesting that the two context mechanisms are complementary. Finally, we find that learning a receptive-field-centric model with self-attention, before incrementally learning a fully connected readout, yields a more biologically realistic model in terms of center-surround contributions.

- **Summary**: Recent text-to-image diffusion-based generative models have the stunning ability to generate highly detailed and photo-realistic images and achieve state-of-the-art low FID scores on challenging image generation benchmarks. However, one of the primary failure modes of these text-to-image generative models is in composing attributes, objects, and their associated relationships accurately into an image. In our paper, we investigate this compositionality-based failure mode and highlight that imperfect text conditioning with CLIP text-encoder is one of the primary reasons behind the inability of these models to generate high-fidelity compositional scenes. In particular, we show that (i) there exists an optimal text-embedding space that can generate highly coherent compositional scenes which shows that the output space of the CLIP text-encoder is sub-optimal, and (ii) we observe that the final token embeddings in CLIP are erroneous as they often include attention contributions from unrelated tokens in compositional prompts. Our main finding shows that the best compositional improvements can be achieved (without harming the model's FID scores) by fine-tuning {\it only} a simple linear projection on CLIP's representation space in Stable-Diffusion variants using a small set of compositional image-text pairs. This result demonstrates that the sub-optimality of the CLIP's output space is a major error source. We also show that re-weighting the erroneous attention contributions in CLIP can also lead to improved compositional performances, however these improvements are often less significant than those achieved by solely learning a linear projection head, highlighting erroneous attentions to be only a minor error source.

- **Summary**: This work introduces two new distance metrics for comparing labeled arrays, which are common outputs of image segmentation algorithms. Each pixel in an image is assigned a label, with binary segmentation providing only two labels ('foreground' and 'background'). These can be represented by a simple binary matrix and compared using pixel differences. However, many segmentation algorithms output multiple regions in a labeled array. We propose two distance metrics, named LAD and MADLAD, that calculate the distance between two labeled images. By doing so, the accuracy of different image segmentation algorithms can be evaluated by measuring their outputs against a 'ground truth' labeling. Both proposed metrics, operating with a complexity of $O(N)$ for images with $N$ pixels, are designed to quickly identify similar labeled arrays, even when different labeling methods are used. Comparisons are made between images labeled manually and those labeled by segmentation algorithms. This evaluation is crucial when searching through a space of segmentation algorithms and their hyperparameters via a genetic algorithm to identify the optimal solution for automated segmentation, which is the goal in our lab, SEE-Insight. By measuring the distance from the ground truth, these metrics help determine which algorithm provides the most accurate segmentation.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the problem of plausible object placement for the challenging task of realistic image composition. We propose DiffPop, the first framework that utilizes plausibility-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model to learn the scale and spatial relations among multiple objects and the corresponding scene image. First, we train an unguided diffusion model to directly learn the object placement parameters in a self-supervised manner. Then, we develop a human-in-the-loop pipeline which exploits human labeling on the diffusion-generated composite images to provide the weak supervision for training a structural plausibility classifier. The classifier is further used to guide the diffusion sampling process towards generating the plausible object placement. Experimental results verify the superiority of our method for producing plausible and diverse composite images on the new Cityscapes-OP dataset and the public OPA dataset, as well as demonstrate its potential in applications such as data augmentation and multi-object placement tasks. Our dataset and code will be released.

- **Summary**: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have attracted considerable attention for their event-driven, low-power characteristics and high biological interpretability. Inspired by knowledge distillation (KD), recent research has improved the performance of the SNN model with a pre-trained teacher model. However, additional teacher models require significant computational resources, and it is tedious to manually define the appropriate teacher network architecture. In this paper, we explore cost-effective self-distillation learning of SNNs to circumvent these concerns. Without an explicit defined teacher, the SNN generates pseudo-labels and learns consistency during training. On the one hand, we extend the timestep of the SNN during training to create an implicit temporal ``teacher" that guides the learning of the original ``student", i.e., the temporal self-distillation. On the other hand, we guide the output of the weak classifier at the intermediate stage by the final output of the SNN, i.e., the spatial self-distillation. Our temporal-spatial self-distillation (TSSD) learning method does not introduce any inference overhead and has excellent generalization ability. Extensive experiments on the static image datasets CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet as well as the neuromorphic datasets CIFAR10-DVS and DVS-Gesture validate the superior performance of the TSSD method. This paper presents a novel manner of fusing SNNs with KD, providing insights into high-performance SNN learning methods.

- **Summary**: We present FaithFill, a diffusion-based inpainting object completion approach for realistic generation of missing object parts. Typically, multiple reference images are needed to achieve such realistic generation, otherwise the generation would not faithfully preserve shape, texture, color, and background. In this work, we propose a pipeline that utilizes only a single input reference image -having varying lighting, background, object pose, and/or viewpoint. The singular reference image is used to generate multiple views of the object to be inpainted. We demonstrate that FaithFill produces faithful generation of the object's missing parts, together with background/scene preservation, from a single reference image. This is demonstrated through standard similarity metrics, human judgement, and GPT evaluation. Our results are presented on the DreamBooth dataset, and a novel proposed dataset.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a novel Face-to-Face spoken dialogue model. It processes audio-visual speech from user input and generates audio-visual speech as the response, marking the initial step towards creating an avatar chatbot system without relying on intermediate text. To this end, we newly introduce MultiDialog, the first large-scale multimodal (i.e., audio and visual) spoken dialogue corpus containing 340 hours of approximately 9,000 dialogues, recorded based on the open domain dialogue dataset, TopicalChat. The MultiDialog contains parallel audio-visual recordings of conversation partners acting according to the given script with emotion annotations, which we expect to open up research opportunities in multimodal synthesis. Our Face-to-Face spoken dialogue model incorporates a textually pretrained large language model and adapts it into the audio-visual spoken dialogue domain by incorporating speech-text joint pretraining. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our model in facilitating a face-to-face conversation. Demo and data are available at https://multidialog.github.io and https://huggingface.co/datasets/IVLLab/MultiDialog, respectively.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral image classification is a crucial but challenging task due to the high dimensionality and complex spatial-spectral correlations inherent in hyperspectral data. This paper employs Wavelet-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (wav-kan) architecture tailored for efficient modeling of these intricate dependencies. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, Wav-KAN incorporates wavelet functions as learnable activation functions, enabling non-linear mapping of the input spectral signatures. The wavelet-based activation allows Wav-KAN to effectively capture multi-scale spatial and spectral patterns through dilations and translations. Experimental evaluation on three benchmark hyperspectral datasets (Salinas, Pavia, Indian Pines) demonstrates the superior performance of Wav-KAN compared to traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and the recently proposed Spline-based KAN (Spline-KAN) model. In this work we are: (1) conducting more experiments on additional hyperspectral datasets (Pavia University, WHU-Hi, and Urban Hyperspectral Image) to further validate the generalizability of Wav-KAN; (2) developing a multiresolution Wav-KAN architecture to capture scale-invariant features; (3) analyzing the effect of dimensional reduction techniques on classification performance; (4) exploring optimization methods for tuning the hyperparameters of KAN models; and (5) comparing Wav-KAN with other state-of-the-art models in hyperspectral image classification.

- **Summary**: Dance plays an important role as an artistic form and expression in human culture, yet the creation of dance remains a challenging task. Most dance generation methods primarily rely solely on music, seldom taking into consideration intrinsic attributes such as music style or genre. In this work, we introduce Flexible Dance Generation with Style Description Prompts (DGSDP), a diffusion-based framework suitable for diversified tasks of dance generation by fully leveraging the semantics of music style. The core component of this framework is Music-Conditioned Style-Aware Diffusion (MCSAD), which comprises a Transformer-based network and a music Style Modulation module. The MCSAD seemly integrates music conditions and style description prompts into the dance generation framework, ensuring that generated dances are consistent with the music content and style. To facilitate flexible dance generation and accommodate different tasks, a spatial-temporal masking strategy is effectively applied in the backward diffusion process. The proposed framework successfully generates realistic dance sequences that are accurately aligned with music for a variety of tasks such as long-term generation, dance in-betweening, dance inpainting, and etc. We hope that this work has the potential to inspire dance generation and creation, with promising applications in entertainment, art, and education.

- **Summary**: 3D face alignment is a very challenging and fundamental problem in computer vision. Existing deep learning-based methods manually design different networks to regress either parameters of a 3D face model or 3D positions of face vertices. However, designing such networks relies on expert knowledge, and these methods often struggle to produce consistent results across various face poses. To address this limitation, we employ Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to automatically discover the optimal architecture for 3D face alignment. We propose a novel Multi-path One-shot Neural Architecture Search (MONAS) framework that leverages multi-scale features and contextual information to enhance face alignment across various poses. The MONAS comprises two key algorithms: Multi-path Networks Unbiased Sampling Based Training and Simulated Annealing based Multi-path One-shot Search. Experimental results on three popular benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of the MONAS for both sparse alignment and dense alignment.

- **Summary**: Data-free knowledge distillation is able to utilize the knowledge learned by a large teacher network to augment the training of a smaller student network without accessing the original training data, avoiding privacy, security, and proprietary risks in real applications. In this line of research, existing methods typically follow an inversion-and-distillation paradigm in which a generative adversarial network on-the-fly trained with the guidance of the pre-trained teacher network is used to synthesize a large-scale sample set for knowledge distillation. In this paper, we reexamine this common data-free knowledge distillation paradigm, showing that there is considerable room to improve the overall training efficiency through a lens of ``small-scale inverted data for knowledge distillation". In light of three empirical observations indicating the importance of how to balance class distributions in terms of synthetic sample diversity and difficulty during both data inversion and distillation processes, we propose Small Scale Data-free Knowledge Distillation SSD-KD. In formulation, SSD-KD introduces a modulating function to balance synthetic samples and a priority sampling function to select proper samples, facilitated by a dynamic replay buffer and a reinforcement learning strategy. As a result, SSD-KD can perform distillation training conditioned on an extremely small scale of synthetic samples (e.g., 10X less than the original training data scale), making the overall training efficiency one or two orders of magnitude faster than many mainstream methods while retaining superior or competitive model performance, as demonstrated on popular image classification and semantic segmentation benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Dynamic convolution learns a linear mixture of n static kernels weighted with their input-dependent attentions, demonstrating superior performance than normal convolution. However, it increases the number of convolutional parameters by n times, and thus is not parameter efficient. This leads to no research progress that can allow researchers to explore the setting n>100 (an order of magnitude larger than the typical setting n<10) for pushing forward the performance boundary of dynamic convolution while enjoying parameter efficiency. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose KernelWarehouse, a more general form of dynamic convolution, which redefines the basic concepts of ``kernels", ``assembling kernels" and ``attention function" through the lens of exploiting convolutional parameter dependencies within the same layer and across neighboring layers of a ConvNet. We testify the effectiveness of KernelWarehouse on ImageNet and MS-COCO datasets using various ConvNet architectures. Intriguingly, KernelWarehouse is also applicable to Vision Transformers, and it can even reduce the model size of a backbone while improving the model accuracy. For instance, KernelWarehouse (n=4) achieves 5.61%|3.90%|4.38% absolute top-1 accuracy gain on the ResNet18|MobileNetV2|DeiT-Tiny backbone, and KernelWarehouse (n=1/4) with 65.10% model size reduction still achieves 2.29% gain on the ResNet18 backbone.

- **Summary**: Material defects (MD) represent a primary challenge affecting product performance and giving rise to safety issues in related products. The rapid and accurate identification and localization of MD constitute crucial research endeavours in addressing contemporary challenges associated with MD. Although conventional non-destructive testing methods such as ultrasonic and X-ray approaches have mitigated issues related to low efficiency in manual inspections, they struggle to meet the diverse requirements of high precision, real-time speed, automation, and intelligence. In recent years, propelled by the swift advancement of machine learning (ML) technologies, particularly exemplified by deep learning, ML has swiftly emerged as the core technology and a prominent research direction for material defect detection (MDD). Through a comprehensive review of the latest literature, we systematically survey the ML techniques applied in MDD into five categories: unsupervised learning, supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and generative learning. We provide a detailed analysis of the main principles and techniques used, together with the advantages and potential challenges associated with these techniques. Furthermore, the survey focuses on the techniques for defect detection in composite materials, which are important types of materials enjoying increasingly wide application in various industries such as aerospace, automotive, construction, and renewable energy. Finally, the survey explores potential future directions in MDD utilizing ML technologies. This comprehensive survey not only consolidates existing literature on ML-based MDD technologies but also serves as a foundational reference for future researchers and industrial practitioners, providing valuable insights and guidance in developing advanced and efficient MDD systems.

- **Summary**: Vivid talking face generation holds immense potential applications across diverse multimedia domains, such as film and game production. While existing methods accurately synchronize lip movements with input audio, they typically ignore crucial alignments between emotion and facial cues, which include expression, gaze, and head pose. These alignments are indispensable for synthesizing realistic videos. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage audio-driven talking face generation framework that employs 3D facial landmarks as intermediate variables. This framework achieves collaborative alignment of expression, gaze, and pose with emotions through self-supervised learning. Specifically, we decompose this task into two key steps, namely speech-to-landmarks synthesis and landmarks-to-face generation. The first step focuses on simultaneously synthesizing emotionally aligned facial cues, including normalized landmarks that represent expressions, gaze, and head pose. These cues are subsequently reassembled into relocated facial landmarks. In the second step, these relocated landmarks are mapped to latent key points using self-supervised learning and then input into a pretrained model to create high-quality face images. Extensive experiments on the MEAD dataset demonstrate that our model significantly advances the state-of-the-art performance in both visual quality and emotional alignment.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose a fast and robust Image Feature Triangle Descriptor (IFTD) based on the STD method, aimed at improving the efficiency and accuracy of place recognition in driving scenarios. We extract keypoints from BEV projection image of point cloud and construct these keypoints into triangle descriptors. By matching these feature triangles, we achieved precise place recognition and calculated the 4-DOF pose estimation between two keyframes. Furthermore, we employ image similarity inspection to perform the final place recognition. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that our IFTD can achieve greater robustness and accuracy than state-of-the-art methods with low computational overhead.

- **Summary**: Band selection plays a crucial role in hyperspectral image classification by removing redundant and noisy bands and retaining discriminative ones. However, most existing deep learning-based methods are aimed at dealing with a specific band selection dataset, and need to retrain parameters for new datasets, which significantly limits their generalizability.To address this issue, a novel multi-teacher multi-objective meta-learning network (M$^3$BS) is proposed for zero-shot hyperspectral band selection. In M$^3$BS, a generalizable graph convolution network (GCN) is constructed to generate dataset-agnostic base, and extract compatible meta-knowledge from multiple band selection tasks. To enhance the ability of meta-knowledge extraction, multiple band selection teachers are introduced to provide diverse high-quality experiences.strategy Finally, subsequent classification tasks are attached and jointly optimized with multi-teacher band selection tasks through multi-objective meta-learning in an end-to-end trainable way. Multi-objective meta-learning guarantees to coordinate diverse optimization objectives automatically and adapt to various datasets simultaneously. Once the optimization is accomplished, the acquired meta-knowledge can be directly transferred to unseen datasets without any retraining or fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method on par with state-of-the-art baselines for zero-shot hyperspectral band selection.

- **Summary**: Hybrid Event-Based Vision Sensor (HybridEVS) is a novel sensor integrating traditional frame-based and event-based sensors, offering substantial benefits for applications requiring low-light, high dynamic range, and low-latency environments, such as smartphones and wearable devices. Despite its potential, the lack of Image signal processing (ISP) pipeline specifically designed for HybridEVS poses a significant challenge. To address this challenge, in this study, we propose a coarse-to-fine framework named DemosaicFormer which comprises coarse demosaicing and pixel correction. Coarse demosaicing network is designed to produce a preliminary high-quality estimate of the RGB image from the HybridEVS raw data while the pixel correction network enhances the performance of image restoration and mitigates the impact of defective pixels. Our key innovation is the design of a Multi-Scale Gating Module (MSGM) applying the integration of cross-scale features, which allows feature information to flow between different scales. Additionally, the adoption of progressive training and data augmentation strategies further improves model's robustness and effectiveness. Experimental results show superior performance against the existing methods both qualitatively and visually, and our DemosaicFormer achieves the best performance in terms of all the evaluation metrics in the MIPI 2024 challenge on Demosaic for Hybridevs Camera.

- **Summary**: In medical images, various types of lesions often manifest significant differences in their shape and texture. Accurate medical image segmentation demands deep learning models with robust capabilities in multi-scale and boundary feature learning. However, previous networks still have limitations in addressing the above issues. Firstly, previous networks simultaneously fuse multi-level features or employ deep supervision to enhance multi-scale learning. However, this may lead to feature redundancy and excessive computational overhead, which is not conducive to network training and clinical deployment. Secondly, the majority of medical image segmentation networks exclusively learn features in the spatial domain, disregarding the abundant global information in the frequency domain. This results in a bias towards low-frequency components, neglecting crucial high-frequency information. To address these problems, we introduce SF-UNet, a spatial-frequency dual-domain attention network. It comprises two main components: the Multi-scale Progressive Channel Attention (MPCA) block, which progressively extract multi-scale features across adjacent encoder layers, and the lightweight Frequency-Spatial Attention (FSA) block, with only 0.05M parameters, enabling concurrent learning of texture and boundary features from both spatial and frequency domains. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed SF-UNet on three public datasets. Experimental results show that compared to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) medical image segmentation networks, SF-UNet achieves the best performance, and achieves up to 9.4\% and 10.78\% improvement in DSC and IOU. Codes will be released at https://github.com/nkicsl/SF-UNet.

- **Summary**: Image classification is a primary task in data analysis where explainable models are crucially demanded in various applications. Although amounts of methods have been proposed to obtain explainable knowledge from the black-box classifiers, these approaches lack the efficiency of extracting global knowledge regarding the classification task, thus is vulnerable to local traps and often leads to poor accuracy. In this study, we propose a generative explanation model that combines the advantages of global and local knowledge for explaining image classifiers. We develop a representation learning method called class association embedding (CAE), which encodes each sample into a pair of separated class-associated and individual codes. Recombining the individual code of a given sample with altered class-associated code leads to a synthetic real-looking sample with preserved individual characters but modified class-associated features and possibly flipped class assignments. A building-block coherency feature extraction algorithm is proposed that efficiently separates class-associated features from individual ones. The extracted feature space forms a low-dimensional manifold that visualizes the classification decision patterns. Explanation on each individual sample can be then achieved in a counter-factual generation manner which continuously modifies the sample in one direction, by shifting its class-associated code along a guided path, until its classification outcome is changed. We compare our method with state-of-the-art ones on explaining image classification tasks in the form of saliency maps, demonstrating that our method achieves higher accuracies.

- **Summary**: Real-world Image Dehazing (RID) aims to alleviate haze-induced degradation in real-world settings. This task remains challenging due to the complexities in accurately modeling real haze distributions and the scarcity of paired real-world data. To address these challenges, we first introduce a cooperative unfolding network that jointly models atmospheric scattering and image scenes, effectively integrating physical knowledge into deep networks to restore haze-contaminated details. Additionally, we propose the first RID-oriented iterative mean-teacher framework, termed the Coherence-based Label Generator, to generate high-quality pseudo labels for network training. Specifically, we provide an optimal label pool to store the best pseudo-labels during network training, leveraging both global and local coherence to select high-quality candidates and assign weights to prioritize haze-free regions. We verify the effectiveness of our method, with experiments demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on RID tasks.

Inspired by the non-contrastive SSL approach (SimSiam), we introduce a novel framework SIMSAM to compute the Semantic Affinity Matrix, which is significant for unsupervised image segmentation. Given an image, SIMSAM first extracts features using pre-trained DINO-ViT, then projects the features to predict the correlations of dense features in a non-contrastive way. We show applications of the Semantic Affinity Matrix in object segmentation and semantic segmentation tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/chandagrover/SimSAM.

- **Summary**: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has emerged as a promising approach for effectively reducing the generalization error. However, SAM incurs twice the computational cost compared to base optimizer (e.g., SGD). We propose Asymptotic Unbiased Sampling with respect to iterations to accelerate SAM (AUSAM), which maintains the model's generalization capacity while significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Concretely, we probabilistically sample a subset of data points beneficial for SAM optimization based on a theoretically guaranteed criterion, i.e., the Gradient Norm of each Sample (GNS). We further approximate the GNS by the difference in loss values before and after perturbation in SAM. As a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic method, our approach consistently accelerates SAM across a range of tasks and networks, i.e., classification, human pose estimation and network quantization. On CIFAR10/100 and Tiny-ImageNet, AUSAM achieves results comparable to SAM while providing a speedup of over 70%. Compared to recent dynamic data pruning methods, AUSAM is better suited for SAM and excels in maintaining performance. Additionally, AUSAM accelerates optimization in human pose estimation and model quantization without sacrificing performance, demonstrating its broad practicality.

- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a technique used to transfer knowledge from an overparameterized teacher network to a less-parameterized student network, thereby minimizing the incurred performance loss. KD methods can be categorized into offline and online approaches. Offline KD leverages a powerful pretrained teacher network, while online KD allows the teacher network to be adjusted dynamically to enhance the learning effectiveness of the student network. Recently, it has been discovered that sharing the classifier of the teacher network can significantly boost the performance of the student network with only a minimal increase in the number of network parameters. Building on these insights, we propose adaptive teaching with a shared classifier (ATSC). In ATSC, the pretrained teacher network self-adjusts to better align with the learning needs of the student network based on its capabilities, and the student network benefits from the shared classifier, enhancing its performance. Additionally, we extend ATSC to environments with multiple teachers. We conduct extensive experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed KD method. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets in both single-teacher and multiteacher scenarios, with only a modest increase in the number of required model parameters.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in open-vocabulary 3D scene reconstruction facilitated by visual language models (VLMs), which showcase remarkable capabilities in open-set retrieval. However, existing methods face some limitations: they either focus on learning point-wise features, resulting in blurry semantic understanding, or solely tackle object-level reconstruction, thereby overlooking the intricate details of the object's interior. To address these challenges, we introduce OpenObj, an innovative approach to build open-vocabulary object-level Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with fine-grained understanding. In essence, OpenObj establishes a robust framework for efficient and watertight scene modeling and comprehension at the object-level. Moreover, we incorporate part-level features into the neural fields, enabling a nuanced representation of object interiors. This approach captures object-level instances while maintaining a fine-grained understanding. The results on multiple datasets demonstrate that OpenObj achieves superior performance in zero-shot semantic segmentation and retrieval tasks. Additionally, OpenObj supports real-world robotics tasks at multiple scales, including global movement and local manipulation.

- **Summary**: The increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters demand more sophisticated approaches for rapid and precise damage assessment. To tackle this issue, researchers have developed various methods on disaster benchmark datasets from satellite imagery to aid in detecting disaster damage. However, the diverse nature of geographical landscapes and disasters makes it challenging to apply existing methods to regions unseen during training. We present DAVI (Disaster Assessment with VIsion foundation model), which overcomes domain disparities and detects structural damage (e.g., building) without requiring ground-truth labels of the target region. DAVI integrates task-specific knowledge from a model trained on source regions with an image segmentation foundation model to generate pseudo labels of possible damage in the target region. It then employs a two-stage refinement process, targeting both the pixel and overall image, to more accurately pinpoint changes in disaster-struck areas based on before-and-after images. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that DAVI achieves exceptional performance across diverse terrains (e.g., USA and Mexico) and disaster types (e.g., wildfires, hurricanes, and earthquakes). This confirms its robustness in assessing disaster impact without dependence on ground-truth labels.

- **Summary**: Amidst the advancements in image-based Large Vision-Language Models (image-LVLM), the transition to video-based models (video-LVLM) is hindered by the limited availability of quality video data. This paper addresses the challenge by leveraging the visual commonalities between images and videos to efficiently evolve image-LVLMs into video-LVLMs. We present a cost-effective video-LVLM that enhances model architecture, introduces innovative training strategies, and identifies the most effective types of video instruction data. Our innovative weighted token sampler significantly compresses the visual token numbers of each video frame, effectively cutting computational expenses. We also find that judiciously using just 10% of the video data, compared to prior video-LVLMs, yields impressive results during various training phases. Moreover, we delve into the influence of video instruction data in limited-resource settings, highlighting the significance of incorporating video training data that emphasizes temporal understanding to enhance model performance. The resulting Fewer Tokens and Fewer Videos LVLM (FTFV-LVLM) exhibits exceptional performance across video and image benchmarks, validating our model's design and training approaches.

- **Summary**: The major Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030, set by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), include sustainable cities and communities, no poverty, and reduced inequalities. However, millions of people live in slums or informal settlements with poor living conditions in many major cities around the world, especially in less developed countries. To emancipate these settlements and their inhabitants through government intervention, accurate data about slum location and extent is required. While ground survey data is the most reliable, such surveys are costly and time-consuming. An alternative is remotely sensed data obtained from very high-resolution (VHR) imagery. With the advancement of new technology, remote sensing based mapping of slums has emerged as a prominent research area. The parallel rise of Artificial Intelligence, especially Deep Learning has added a new dimension to this field as it allows automated analysis of satellite imagery to identify complex spatial patterns associated with slums. This article offers a detailed review and meta-analysis of research on slum mapping using remote sensing imagery from 2014 to 2024, with a special focus on deep learning approaches. Our analysis reveals a trend towards increasingly complex neural network architectures, with advancements in data preprocessing and model training techniques significantly enhancing slum identification accuracy. We have attempted to identify key methodologies that are effective across diverse geographic contexts. While acknowledging the transformative impact Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in slum detection, our review underscores the absence of a universally optimal model, suggesting the need for context-specific adaptations. We also identify prevailing challenges in this field, such as data limitations and a lack of model explainability and suggest potential strategies for overcoming these.

- **Summary**: Recent progress in multimodal large language models has markedly enhanced the understanding of short videos (typically under one minute), and several evaluation datasets have emerged accordingly. However, these advancements fall short of meeting the demands of real-world applications such as embodied intelligence for long-term decision-making, in-depth movie reviews and discussions, and live sports commentary, all of which require comprehension of long videos spanning several hours. To address this gap, we introduce LVBench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video understanding. Our dataset comprises publicly sourced videos and encompasses a diverse set of tasks aimed at long video comprehension and information extraction. LVBench is designed to challenge multimodal models to demonstrate long-term memory and extended comprehension capabilities. Our extensive evaluations reveal that current multimodal models still underperform on these demanding long video understanding tasks. Through LVBench, we aim to spur the development of more advanced models capable of tackling the complexities of long video comprehension.

- **Summary**: Empowered by transformer-based models, visual tracking has advanced significantly. However, the slow speed of current trackers limits their applicability on devices with constrained computational resources. To address this challenge, we introduce ABTrack, an adaptive computation framework that adaptively bypassing transformer blocks for efficient visual tracking. The rationale behind ABTrack is rooted in the observation that semantic features or relations do not uniformly impact the tracking task across all abstraction levels. Instead, this impact varies based on the characteristics of the target and the scene it occupies. Consequently, disregarding insignificant semantic features or relations at certain abstraction levels may not significantly affect the tracking accuracy. We propose a Bypass Decision Module (BDM) to determine if a transformer block should be bypassed, which adaptively simplifies the architecture of ViTs and thus speeds up the inference process. To counteract the time cost incurred by the BDMs and further enhance the efficiency of ViTs, we innovatively adapt a pruning technique to reduce the dimension of the latent representation of tokens in each transformer block. Extensive experiments on multiple tracking benchmarks validate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present our approach to the Auto WCEBleedGen Challenge V2 2024. Our solution combines the Swin Transformer for the initial classification of bleeding frames and RT-DETR for further detection of bleeding in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE), enhanced by a series of image preprocessing steps. These steps include converting images to Lab colour space, applying Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) for better contrast, and using Gaussian blur to suppress artefacts. The Swin Transformer utilizes a tiered architecture with shifted windows to efficiently manage self-attention calculations, focusing on local windows while enabling cross-window interactions. RT-DETR features an efficient hybrid encoder for fast processing of multi-scale features and an uncertainty-minimal query selection for enhanced accuracy. The class activation maps by Ablation-CAM are plausible to the model's decisions. On the validation set, this approach achieves a classification accuracy of 98.5% (best among the other state-of-the-art models) compared to 91.7% without any pre-processing and an $\text{AP}_{50}$ of 66.7% compared to 65.0% with state-of-the-art YOLOv8. On the test set, this approach achieves a classification accuracy and F1 score of 87.0% and 89.0% respectively.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present our approach to the 3D CBCT Challenge 2024, a part of ICASSP SP Grand Challenges 2024. Improvement in Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) reconstruction has been achieved by integrating Swin Image Restoration (SwinIR) based sinogram and image enhancement modules. The proposed methodology uses Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent (NAG) to solve the least squares (NAG-LS) problem in CT image reconstruction. The integration of sinogram and image enhancement modules aims to enhance image clarity and preserve fine details, offering a promising solution for both low dose and clinical dose CBCT reconstruction. The averaged mean squared error (MSE) over the validation dataset has decreased significantly, in the case of low dose by one-fifth and clinical dose by one-tenth. Our solution is one of the top 5 approaches in this challenge.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel mid-wave infrared (MWIR) small target detection dataset (MWIRSTD) comprising 14 video sequences containing approximately 1053 images with annotated targets of three distinct classes of small objects. Captured using cooled MWIR imagers, the dataset offers a unique opportunity for researchers to develop and evaluate state-of-the-art methods for small object detection in realistic MWIR scenes. Unlike existing datasets, which primarily consist of uncooled thermal images or synthetic data with targets superimposed onto the background or vice versa, MWIRSTD provides authentic MWIR data with diverse targets and environments. Extensive experiments on various traditional methods and deep learning-based techniques for small target detection are performed on the proposed dataset, providing valuable insights into their efficacy.

- **Summary**: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a fundamental tool in modern diffusion models for text-guided generation. Although effective, CFG has notable drawbacks. For instance, DDIM with CFG lacks invertibility, complicating image editing; furthermore, high guidance scales, essential for high-quality outputs, frequently result in issues like mode collapse. Contrary to the widespread belief that these are inherent limitations of diffusion models, this paper reveals that the problems actually stem from the off-manifold phenomenon associated with CFG, rather than the diffusion models themselves. More specifically, inspired by the recent advancements of diffusion model-based inverse problem solvers (DIS), we reformulate text-guidance as an inverse problem with a text-conditioned score matching loss, and develop CFG++, a novel approach that tackles the off-manifold challenges inherent in traditional CFG. CFG++ features a surprisingly simple fix to CFG, yet it offers significant improvements, including better sample quality for text-to-image generation, invertibility, smaller guidance scales, reduced mode collapse, etc. Furthermore, CFG++ enables seamless interpolation between unconditional and conditional sampling at lower guidance scales, consistently outperforming traditional CFG at all scales. Experimental results confirm that our method significantly enhances performance in text-to-image generation, DDIM inversion, editing, and solving inverse problems, suggesting a wide-ranging impact and potential applications in various fields that utilize text guidance.

- **Summary**: Large multimodal models (LMMs) combine unimodal encoders and large language models (LLMs) to perform multimodal tasks. Despite recent advancements towards the interpretability of these models, understanding internal representations of LMMs remains largely a mystery. In this paper, we present a novel framework for the interpretation of LMMs. We propose a dictionary learning based approach, applied to the representation of tokens. The elements of the learned dictionary correspond to our proposed concepts. We show that these concepts are well semantically grounded in both vision and text. Thus we refer to these as "multi-modal concepts". We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the results of the learnt concepts. We show that the extracted multimodal concepts are useful to interpret representations of test samples. Finally, we evaluate the disentanglement between different concepts and the quality of grounding concepts visually and textually. We will publicly release our code.

- **Summary**: Vast amounts of remote sensing (RS) data provide Earth observations across multiple dimensions, encompassing critical spatial, temporal, and spectral information which is essential for addressing global-scale challenges such as land use monitoring, disaster prevention, and environmental change mitigation. Despite various pre-training methods tailored to the characteristics of RS data, a key limitation persists: the inability to effectively integrate spatial, temporal, and spectral information within a single unified model. To unlock the potential of RS data, we construct a Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Structured Dataset (STSSD) characterized by the incorporation of multiple RS sources, diverse coverage, unified locations within image sets, and heterogeneity within images. Building upon this structured dataset, we propose an Anchor-Aware Masked AutoEncoder method (A$^{2}$-MAE), leveraging intrinsic complementary information from the different kinds of images and geo-information to reconstruct the masked patches during the pre-training phase. A$^{2}$-MAE integrates an anchor-aware masking strategy and a geographic encoding module to comprehensively exploit the properties of RS images. Specifically, the proposed anchor-aware masking strategy dynamically adapts the masking process based on the meta-information of a pre-selected anchor image, thereby facilitating the training on images captured by diverse types of RS sources within one model. Furthermore, we propose a geographic encoding method to leverage accurate spatial patterns, enhancing the model generalization capabilities for downstream applications that are generally location-related. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves comprehensive improvements across various downstream tasks compared with existing RS pre-training methods, including image classification, semantic segmentation, and change detection tasks.

- **Summary**: Benefiting from the advancements in large language models and cross-modal alignment, existing multi-modal video understanding methods have achieved prominent performance in offline scenario. However, online video streams, as one of the most common media forms in the real world, have seldom received attention. Compared to offline videos, the 'dynamic' nature of online video streams poses challenges for the direct application of existing models and introduces new problems, such as the storage of extremely long-term information, interaction between continuous visual content and 'asynchronous' user questions. Therefore, in this paper we present Flash-VStream, a video-language model that simulates the memory mechanism of human. Our model is able to process extremely long video streams in real-time and respond to user queries simultaneously. Compared to existing models, Flash-VStream achieves significant reductions in inference latency and VRAM consumption, which is intimately related to performing understanding of online streaming video. In addition, given that existing video understanding benchmarks predominantly concentrate on offline scenario, we propose VStream-QA, a novel question answering benchmark specifically designed for online video streaming understanding. Comparisons with popular existing methods on the proposed benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method for such challenging setting. To verify the generalizability of our approach, we further evaluate it on existing video understanding benchmarks and achieves state-of-the-art performance in offline scenarios as well.

- **Summary**: Communicating in noisy, multi-talker environments is challenging, especially for people with hearing impairments. Egocentric video data can potentially be used to identify a user's conversation partners, which could be used to inform selective acoustic amplification of relevant speakers. Recent introduction of datasets and tasks in computer vision enable progress towards analyzing social interactions from an egocentric perspective. Building on this, we focus on the task of identifying conversation partners from egocentric video and describe a suitable dataset. Our dataset comprises 69 hours of egocentric video of diverse multi-conversation scenarios where each individual was assigned one or more conversation partners, providing the labels for our computer vision task. This dataset enables the development and assessment of algorithms for identifying conversation partners and evaluating related approaches. Here, we describe the dataset alongside initial baseline results of this ongoing work, aiming to contribute to the exciting advancements in egocentric video analysis for social settings.

- **Summary**: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) is important for video enhancement, frame rate up-conversion, and slow-motion generation. The introduction of event cameras, which capture per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously, has significantly enhanced VFI capabilities, particularly for high-speed, nonlinear motions. However, these event-based methods encounter challenges in low-light conditions, notably trailing artifacts and signal latency, which hinder their direct applicability and generalization. Addressing these issues, we propose a novel per-scene optimization strategy tailored for low-light conditions. This approach utilizes the internal statistics of a sequence to handle degraded event data under low-light conditions, improving the generalizability to different lighting and camera settings. To evaluate its robustness in low-light condition, we further introduce EVFI-LL, a unique RGB+Event dataset captured under low-light conditions. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in low-light environments. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available upon publication.

- **Summary**: We aim to edit the lip movements in talking video according to the given speech while preserving the personal identity and visual details. The task can be decomposed into two sub-problems: (1) speech-driven lip motion generation and (2) visual appearance synthesis. Current solutions handle the two sub-problems within a single generative model, resulting in a challenging trade-off between lip-sync quality and visual details preservation. Instead, we propose to disentangle the motion and appearance, and then generate them one by one with a speech-to-motion diffusion model and a motion-conditioned appearance generation model. However, there still remain challenges in each stage, such as motion-aware identity preservation in (1) and visual details preservation in (2). Therefore, to preserve personal identity, we adopt landmarks to represent the motion, and further employ a landmark-based identity loss. To capture motion-agnostic visual details, we use separate encoders to encode the lip, non-lip appearance and motion, and then integrate them with a learned fusion module. We train MyTalk on a large-scale and diverse dataset. Experiments show that our method generalizes well to the unknown, even out-of-domain person, in terms of both lip sync and visual detail preservation. We encourage the readers to watch the videos on our project page (https://Ingrid789.github.io/MyTalk/).

- **Summary**: Local feature extractors are the cornerstone of many computer vision tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks can significantly compromise their effectiveness. This paper discusses approaches to attack sophisticated local feature extraction algorithms and models to achieve two distinct goals: (1) forcing a match between originally non-matching image regions, and (2) preventing a match between originally matching regions. At the end of the paper, we discuss the performance and drawbacks of different patch generation methods.

  Forecasting" challenge, held at CVPR 2024 WAD
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Motion forecasting is crucial in autonomous driving systems to anticipate the future trajectories of surrounding agents such as pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signals. In end-to-end forecasting, the model must jointly detect from sensor data (cameras or LiDARs) the position and past trajectories of the different elements of the scene and predict their future location. We depart from the current trend of tackling this task via end-to-end training from perception to forecasting and we use a modular approach instead. Following a recent study, we individually build and train detection, tracking, and forecasting modules. We then only use consecutive finetuning steps to integrate the modules better and alleviate compounding errors. Our study reveals that this simple yet effective approach significantly improves performance on the end-to-end forecasting benchmark. Consequently, our solution ranks first in the Argoverse 2 end-to-end Forecasting Challenge held at CVPR 2024 Workshop on Autonomous Driving (WAD), with 63.82 mAPf. We surpass forecasting results by +17.1 points over last year's winner and by +13.3 points over this year's runner-up. This remarkable performance in forecasting can be explained by our modular paradigm, which integrates finetuning strategies and significantly outperforms the end-to-end-trained counterparts.

- **Summary**: Interpretation of chest computed tomography (CT) is time-consuming. Previous studies have measured the time-saving effect of using a deep-learning-based aid (DLA) for CT interpretation. We evaluated the joint impact of a multi-pathology DLA on the time and accuracy of radiologists' reading.   40 radiologists were randomly split into three experimental arms: control (10), who interpret studies without assistance; informed group (10), who were briefed about DLA pathologies, but performed readings without it; and the experimental group (20), who interpreted half studies with DLA, and half without. Every arm used the same 200 CT studies retrospectively collected from BIMCV-COVID19 dataset; each radiologist provided readings for 20 CT studies. We compared interpretation time, and accuracy of participants diagnostic report with respect to 12 pathological findings.   Mean reading time per study was 15.6 minutes [SD 8.5] in the control arm, 13.2 minutes [SD 8.7] in the informed arm, 14.4 [SD 10.3] in the experimental arm without DLA, and 11.4 minutes [SD 7.8] in the experimental arm with DLA. Mean sensitivity and specificity were 41.5 [SD 30.4], 86.8 [SD 28.3] in the control arm; 53.5 [SD 22.7], 92.3 [SD 9.4] in the informed non-assisted arm; 63.2 [SD 16.4], 92.3 [SD 8.2] in the experimental arm without DLA; and 91.6 [SD 7.2], 89.9 [SD 6.0] in the experimental arm with DLA. DLA speed up interpretation time per study by 2.9 minutes (CI95 [1.7, 4.3], p<0.0005), increased sensitivity by 28.4 (CI95 [23.4, 33.4], p<0.0005), and decreased specificity by 2.4 (CI95 [0.6, 4.3], p=0.13).   Of 20 radiologists in the experimental arm, 16 have improved reading time and sensitivity, two improved their time with a marginal drop in sensitivity, and two participants improved sensitivity with increased time. Overall, DLA introduction decreased reading time by 20.6%.

- **Summary**: Distribution of colors and patterns in images is observed through cascades that adjust spatial resolution and dynamics. Cascades of colors reveal the emergent universal property that Fully Colored Images (FCIs) of natural scenes adhere to the debated continuous linear log-scale law (slope $-2.00 \pm 0.01$) (L1). Cascades of discrete $2 \times 2$ patterns are derived from pixel squares reductions onto the seven unlabeled rotation-free textures (0000, 0001, 0011, 0012, 0101, 0102, 0123). They exhibit an unparalleled universal entropy maximum of $1.74 \pm 0.013$ at some dynamics regardless of spatial scale (L2). Patterns also adhere to the Integral Fluctuation Theorem ($1.00 \pm 0.01$) (L3), pivotal in studies of chaotic systems. Images with fewer colors exhibit quadratic shift and bias from L1 and L3 but adhere to L2. Randomized Hilbert fractals FCIs better match the laws than basic-to-AI-based simulations. Those results are of interest in Neural Networks, out of equilibrium physics and spectral imagery.

- **Summary**: The field of 3D object detection from point clouds is rapidly advancing in computer vision, aiming to accurately and efficiently detect and localize objects in three-dimensional space. Current 3D detectors commonly fall short in terms of flexibility and scalability, with ample room for advancements in performance. In this paper, our objective is to address these limitations by introducing two frameworks for 3D object detection with minimal hand-crafted design. Firstly, we propose CT3D, which sequentially performs raw-point-based embedding, a standard Transformer encoder, and a channel-wise decoder for point features within each proposal. Secondly, we present an enhanced network called CT3D++, which incorporates geometric and semantic fusion-based embedding to extract more valuable and comprehensive proposal-aware information. Additionally, CT3D ++ utilizes a point-to-key bidirectional encoder for more efficient feature encoding with reduced computational cost. By replacing the corresponding components of CT3D with these novel modules, CT3D++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the KITTI dataset and the large-scale Way\-mo Open Dataset. The source code for our frameworks will be made accessible at https://github.com/hlsheng1/CT3D-plusplus.

- **Summary**: Compositional Reasoning (CR) entails grasping the significance of attributes, relations, and word order. Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs), comprising a visual encoder and a Large Language Model (LLM) decoder, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in such reasoning tasks. This prompts a crucial question: have VLMs effectively tackled the CR challenge? We conjecture that existing CR benchmarks may not adequately push the boundaries of modern VLMs due to the reliance on an LLM-only negative text generation pipeline. Consequently, the negatives produced either appear as outliers from the natural language distribution learned by VLMs' LLM decoders or as improbable within the corresponding image context. To address these limitations, we introduce ConMe -- a compositional reasoning benchmark and a novel data generation pipeline leveraging VLMs to produce `hard CR Q&A'. Through a new concept of VLMs conversing with each other to collaboratively expose their weaknesses, our pipeline autonomously generates, evaluates, and selects challenging compositional reasoning questions, establishing a robust CR benchmark, also subsequently validated manually. Our benchmark provokes a noteworthy, up to 33%, decrease in CR performance compared to preceding benchmarks, reinstating the CR challenge even for state-of-the-art VLMs.

- **Summary**: Generative techniques continue to evolve at an impressively high rate, driven by the hype about these technologies. This rapid advancement severely limits the application of deepfake detectors, which, despite numerous efforts by the scientific community, struggle to achieve sufficiently robust performance against the ever-changing content. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose an analysis of two continuous learning techniques on a Short and a Long sequence of fake media. Both sequences include a complex and heterogeneous range of deepfakes generated from GANs, computer graphics techniques, and unknown sources. Our study shows that continual learning could be important in mitigating the need for generalizability. In fact, we show that, although with some limitations, continual learning methods help to maintain good performance across the entire training sequence. For these techniques to work in a sufficiently robust way, however, it is necessary that the tasks in the sequence share similarities. In fact, according to our experiments, the order and similarity of the tasks can affect the performance of the models over time. To address this problem, we show that it is possible to group tasks based on their similarity. This small measure allows for a significant improvement even in longer sequences. This result suggests that continual techniques can be combined with the most promising detection methods, allowing them to catch up with the latest generative techniques. In addition to this, we propose an overview of how this learning approach can be integrated into a deepfake detection pipeline for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). This allows you to keep track of different funds, such as social networks, new generative tools, or third-party datasets, and through the integration of continuous learning, allows constant maintenance of the detectors.

- **Summary**: Neural implicit representation has attracted attention in 3D reconstruction through various success cases. For further applications such as scene understanding or editing, several works have shown progress towards object compositional reconstruction. Despite their superior performance in observed regions, their performance is still limited in reconstructing objects that are partially observed. To better treat this problem, we introduce category-level neural fields that learn meaningful common 3D information among objects belonging to the same category present in the scene. Our key idea is to subcategorize objects based on their observed shape for better training of the category-level model. Then we take advantage of the neural field to conduct the challenging task of registering partially observed objects by selecting and aligning against representative objects selected by ray-based uncertainty. Experiments on both simulation and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method improves the reconstruction of unobserved parts for several categories.

- **Summary**: The pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have been increasingly employed to tackle the real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) problem due to their powerful generative image priors. Most of the existing methods start from random noise to reconstruct the high-quality (HQ) image under the guidance of the given low-quality (LQ) image. While promising results have been achieved, such Real- ISR methods require multiple diffusion steps to reproduce the HQ image, increasing the computational cost. Meanwhile, the random noise introduces uncertainty in the output, which is unfriendly to image restoration tasks. To address these issues, we propose a one-step effective diffusion network, namely OSEDiff, for the Real- ISR problem. We argue that the LQ image contains rich information to restore its HQ counterpart, and hence the given LQ image can be directly taken as the starting point for diffusion, eliminating the uncertainty introduced by random noise sampling. We finetune the pre-trained diffusion network with trainable layers to adapt it to complex image degradations. To ensure that the one-step diffusion model could yield HQ Real-ISR output, we apply variational score distillation in the latent space to conduct KL-divergence regularization. As a result, our OSEDiff model can efficiently and effectively generate HQ images in just one diffusion step. Our experiments demonstrate that OSEDiff achieves comparable or even better Real-ISR results, in terms of both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, than previous diffusion model based Real-ISR methods that require dozens or hundreds of steps. The source codes will be released at https://github.com/cswry/OSEDiff.

- **Summary**: Complex video object segmentation serves as a fundamental task for a wide range of downstream applications such as video editing and automatic data annotation. Here we present the 2nd place solution in the MOSE track of PVUW 2024. To mitigate problems caused by tiny objects, similar objects and fast movements in MOSE. We use instance segmentation to generate extra pretraining data from the valid and test set of MOSE. The segmented instances are combined with objects extracted from COCO to augment the training data and enhance semantic representation of the baseline model. Besides, motion blur is added during training to increase robustness against image blur induced by motion. Finally, we apply test time augmentation (TTA) and memory strategy to the inference stage. Our method ranked 2nd in the MOSE track of PVUW 2024, with a $\mathcal{J}$ of 0.8007, a $\mathcal{F}$ of 0.8683 and a $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$ of 0.8345.

- **Summary**: High dynamic range (HDR) video reconstruction aims to generate HDR videos from low dynamic range (LDR) frames captured with alternating exposures. Most existing works solely rely on the regression-based paradigm, leading to adverse effects such as ghosting artifacts and missing details in saturated regions. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-promoted method for HDR video reconstruction, termed HDR-V-Diff, which incorporates a diffusion model to capture the HDR distribution. As such, HDR-V-Diff can reconstruct HDR videos with realistic details while alleviating ghosting artifacts. However, the direct introduction of video diffusion models would impose massive computational burden. Instead, to alleviate this burden, we first propose an HDR Latent Diffusion Model (HDR-LDM) to learn the distribution prior of single HDR frames. Specifically, HDR-LDM incorporates a tonemapping strategy to compress HDR frames into the latent space and a novel exposure embedding to aggregate the exposure information into the diffusion process. We then propose a Temporal-Consistent Alignment Module (TCAM) to learn the temporal information as a complement for HDR-LDM, which conducts coarse-to-fine feature alignment at different scales among video frames. Finally, we design a Zero-Init Cross-Attention (ZiCA) mechanism to effectively integrate the learned distribution prior and temporal information for generating HDR frames. Extensive experiments validate that HDR-V-Diff achieves state-of-the-art results on several representative datasets.

- **Summary**: Segmentation has become a crucial pre-processing step to many refined downstream tasks, and particularly so in the medical domain. Even with recent improvements in segmentation models, many segmentation tasks remain difficult. When multiple organs are segmented simultaneously, difficulties are due not only to the limited availability of labelled data, but also to class imbalance. In this work we propose dynamic class-based loss strategies to mitigate the effects of highly imbalanced training data. We show how our approach improves segmentation performance on a challenging Multi-Class 3D Abdominal Organ dataset.

- **Summary**: In the evolving landscape of computer vision (CV) technologies, the automatic detection and interpretation of gender and emotion in images is a critical area of study. This paper investigates social biases in CV models, emphasizing the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy. These metrics often fall short in capturing the complexities of gender and emotion, which are fluid and culturally nuanced constructs. Our study proposes a sociotechnical framework for evaluating CV models, incorporating both technical performance measures and considerations of social fairness. Using a dataset of 5,570 images related to vaccination and climate change, we empirically compared the performance of various CV models, including traditional models like DeepFace and FER, and generative models like GPT-4 Vision. Our analysis involved manually validating the gender and emotional expressions in a subset of images to serve as benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while GPT-4 Vision outperforms other models in technical accuracy for gender classification, it exhibits discriminatory biases, particularly in response to transgender and non-binary personas. Furthermore, the model's emotion detection skew heavily towards positive emotions, with a notable bias towards associating female images with happiness, especially when prompted by male personas. These findings underscore the necessity of developing more comprehensive evaluation criteria that address both validity and discriminatory biases in CV models. Our proposed framework provides guidelines for researchers to critically assess CV tools, ensuring their application in communication research is both ethical and effective. The significant contribution of this study lies in its emphasis on a sociotechnical approach, advocating for CV technologies that support social good and mitigate biases rather than perpetuate them.

- **Summary**: This work explores knowledge distillation (KD) for visually-rich document (VRD) applications such as document layout analysis (DLA) and document image classification (DIC). While VRD research is dependent on increasingly sophisticated and cumbersome models, the field has neglected to study efficiency via model compression. Here, we design a KD experimentation methodology for more lean, performant models on document understanding (DU) tasks that are integral within larger task pipelines. We carefully selected KD strategies (response-based, feature-based) for distilling knowledge to and from backbones with different architectures (ResNet, ViT, DiT) and capacities (base, small, tiny). We study what affects the teacher-student knowledge gap and find that some methods (tuned vanilla KD, MSE, SimKD with an apt projector) can consistently outperform supervised student training. Furthermore, we design downstream task setups to evaluate covariate shift and the robustness of distilled DLA models on zero-shot layout-aware document visual question answering (DocVQA). DLA-KD experiments result in a large mAP knowledge gap, which unpredictably translates to downstream robustness, accentuating the need to further explore how to efficiently obtain more semantic document layout awareness.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a method using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to detect common glitches in video games. The problem setting consists of an image (800x800 RGB) as input to be classified into one of five defined classes, normal image, or one of four different kinds of glitches (stretched, low resolution, missing and placeholder textures). Using a supervised approach, we train a ShuffleNetV2 using generated data. This work focuses on detecting texture graphical anomalies achieving arguably good performance with an accuracy of 86.8\%, detecting 88\% of the glitches with a false positive rate of 8.7\%, and with the models being able to generalize and detect glitches even in unseen objects. We apply a confidence measure as well to tackle the issue with false positives as well as an effective way of aggregating images to achieve better detection in production. The main use of this work is the partial automatization of graphical testing in the final stages of video game development.

- **Summary**: We present a method for expanding a dataset by incorporating knowledge from the wide distribution of pre-trained latent diffusion models. Data augmentations typically incorporate inductive biases about the image formation process into the training (e.g. translation, scaling, colour changes, etc.). Here, we go beyond simple pixel transformations and introduce the concept of instance-level data augmentation by repainting parts of the image at the level of object instances. The method combines a conditional diffusion model with depth and edge maps control conditioning to seamlessly repaint individual objects inside the scene, being applicable to any segmentation or detection dataset. Used as a data augmentation method, it improves the performance and generalization of the state-of-the-art salient object detection, semantic segmentation and object detection models. By redrawing all privacy-sensitive instances (people, license plates, etc.), the method is also applicable for data anonymization. We also release fully synthetic and anonymized expansions for popular datasets: COCO, Pascal VOC and DUTS.

- **Summary**: Interpretability is essential in medical imaging to ensure that clinicians can comprehend and trust artificial intelligence models. Several approaches have been recently considered to encode attributes in the latent space to enhance its interpretability. Notably, attribute regularization aims to encode a set of attributes along the dimensions of a latent representation. However, this approach is based on Variational AutoEncoder and suffers from blurry reconstruction. In this paper, we propose an Attributed-regularized Soft Introspective Variational Autoencoder that combines attribute regularization of the latent space within the framework of an adversarially trained variational autoencoder. We demonstrate on short-axis cardiac Magnetic Resonance images of the UK Biobank the ability of the proposed method to address blurry reconstruction issues of variational autoencoder methods while preserving the latent space interpretability.

- **Summary**: Spline wavelets have shown favorable characteristics for localizing in both time and frequency. In this paper, we propose a new biorthogonal cubic special spline wavelet (BCSSW), based on the Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau wavelet construction method and the cubic special spline algorithm. BCSSW has better properties in compact support, symmetry, and frequency domain characteristics. However, current mainstream detection operators usually ignore the uncertain representation of regional pixels and global structures. To solve these problems, we propose a structural uncertainty-aware and multi-structure operator fusion detection algorithm (EDBSW) based on a new BCSSW spline wavelet. By constructing a spline wavelet that efficiently handles edge effects, we utilize structural uncertainty-aware modulus maxima to detect highly uncertain edge samples. The proposed wavelet detection operator utilizes the multi-structure morphological operator and fusion reconstruction strategy to effectively address anti-noise processing and edge information of different frequencies. Numerous experiments have demonstrated its excellent performance in reducing noise and capturing edge structure details.

- **Summary**: We aim to generate fine-grained 3D geometry from large-scale sparse LiDAR scans, abundantly captured by autonomous vehicles (AV). Contrary to prior work on AV scene completion, we aim to extrapolate fine geometry from unlabeled and beyond spatial limits of LiDAR scans, taking a step towards generating realistic, high-resolution simulation-ready 3D street environments. We propose hierarchical Generative Cellular Automata (hGCA), a spatially scalable conditional 3D generative model, which grows geometry recursively with local kernels following, in a coarse-to-fine manner, equipped with a light-weight planner to induce global consistency. Experiments on synthetic scenes show that hGCA generates plausible scene geometry with higher fidelity and completeness compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our model generalizes strongly from sim-to-real, qualitatively outperforming baselines on the Waymo-open dataset. We also show anecdotal evidence of the ability to create novel objects from real-world geometric cues even when trained on limited synthetic content.

- **Summary**: Maritime surveillance is vital to mitigate illegal activities such as drug smuggling, illegal fishing, and human trafficking. Vision-based maritime surveillance is challenging mainly due to visibility issues at night, which results in failures in re-identifying vessels and detecting suspicious activities. In this paper, we introduce a thermal, vision-based approach for maritime surveillance with object tracking, vessel re-identification, and suspicious activity detection capabilities. For vessel re-identification, we propose a novel viewpoint-independent algorithm which compares features of the sides of the vessel separately (separate side-spaces) leveraging shape information in the absence of color features. We propose techniques to adapt tracking and activity detection algorithms for the thermal domain and train them using a thermal dataset we created. This dataset will be the first publicly available benchmark dataset for thermal maritime surveillance. Our system is capable of re-identifying vessels with an 81.8% Top1 score and identifying suspicious activities with a 72.4\% frame mAP score; a new benchmark for each task in the thermal domain.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in image classification tasks, particularly when equipped with local information via region attention or convolutions. While such architectures improve the feature aggregation from different granularities, they often fail to contribute to the robustness of the networks. Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) enables the modeling of global cell representations through local interactions, with its training strategies and architecture design conferring strong generalization ability and robustness against noisy inputs. In this paper, we propose Adaptor Neural Cellular Automata (AdaNCA) for Vision Transformer that uses NCA as plug-in-play adaptors between ViT layers, enhancing ViT's performance and robustness against adversarial samples as well as out-of-distribution inputs. To overcome the large computational overhead of standard NCAs, we propose Dynamic Interaction for more efficient interaction learning. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm for identifying the most effective insertion points for AdaNCA based on our analysis of AdaNCA placement and robustness improvement. With less than a 3% increase in parameters, AdaNCA contributes to more than 10% absolute improvement in accuracy under adversarial attacks on the ImageNet1K benchmark. Moreover, we demonstrate with extensive evaluations across 8 robustness benchmarks and 4 ViT architectures that AdaNCA, as a plug-in-play module, consistently improves the robustness of ViTs.

- **Summary**: Novel view synthesis from raw images provides superior high dynamic range (HDR) information compared to reconstructions from low dynamic range RGB images. However, the inherent noise in unprocessed raw images compromises the accuracy of 3D scene representation. Our study reveals that 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is particularly susceptible to this noise, leading to numerous elongated Gaussian shapes that overfit the noise, thereby significantly degrading reconstruction quality and reducing inference speed, especially in scenarios with limited views. To address these issues, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning framework designed to reconstruct HDR 3DGS from a limited number of noisy raw images. This framework enhances 3DGS by integrating a noise extractor and employing a noise-robust reconstruction loss that leverages a noise distribution prior. Experimental results show that our method outperforms LDR/HDR 3DGS and previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised and supervised pre-trained models in both reconstruction quality and inference speed on the RawNeRF dataset across a broad range of training views.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language MOT is a crucial tracking problem and has drawn increasing attention recently. It aims to track objects based on human language commands, replacing the traditional use of templates or pre-set information from training sets in conventional tracking tasks. Despite various efforts, a key challenge lies in the lack of a clear understanding of why language is used for tracking, which hinders further development in this field. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing Language-Guided MOT, a unified task framework, along with a corresponding large-scale benchmark, termed LaMOT, which encompasses diverse scenarios and language descriptions. Specially, LaMOT comprises 1,660 sequences from 4 different datasets and aims to unify various Vision-Language MOT tasks while providing a standardized evaluation platform. To ensure high-quality annotations, we manually assign appropriate descriptive texts to each target in every video and conduct careful inspection and correction. To the best of our knowledge, LaMOT is the first benchmark dedicated to Language-Guided MOT. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective tracker, termed LaMOTer. By establishing a unified task framework, providing challenging benchmarks, and offering insights for future algorithm design and evaluation, we expect to contribute to the advancement of research in Vision-Language MOT. We will release the data at https://github.com/Nathan-Li123/LaMOT.

- **Summary**: Universal image representations are critical in enabling real-world fine-grained and instance-level recognition applications, where objects and entities from any domain must be identified at large scale. Despite recent advances, existing methods fail to capture important domain-specific knowledge, while also ignoring differences in data distribution across different domains. This leads to a large performance gap between efficient universal solutions and expensive approaches utilising a collection of specialist models, one for each domain. In this work, we make significant strides towards closing this gap, by introducing a new learning technique, dubbed UDON (Universal Dynamic Online DistillatioN). UDON employs multi-teacher distillation, where each teacher is specialized in one domain, to transfer detailed domain-specific knowledge into the student universal embedding. UDON's distillation approach is not only effective, but also very efficient, by sharing most model parameters between the student and all teachers, where all models are jointly trained in an online manner. UDON also comprises a sampling technique which adapts the training process to dynamically allocate batches to domains which are learned slower and require more frequent processing. This boosts significantly the learning of complex domains which are characterised by a large number of classes and long-tail distributions. With comprehensive experiments, we validate each component of UDON, and showcase significant improvements over the state of the art in the recent UnED benchmark.

- **Summary**: Dysarthric speech reconstruction (DSR) aims to transform dysarthric speech into normal speech. It still suffers from low speaker similarity and poor prosody naturalness. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal DSR model by leveraging neural codec language modeling to improve the reconstruction results, especially for the speaker similarity and prosody naturalness. Our proposed model consists of: (i) a multi-modal content encoder to extract robust phoneme embeddings from dysarthric speech with auxiliary visual inputs; (ii) a speaker codec encoder to extract and normalize the speaker-aware codecs from the dysarthric speech, in order to provide original timbre and normal prosody; (iii) a codec language model based speech decoder to reconstruct the speech based on the extracted phoneme embeddings and normalized codecs. Evaluations on the commonly used UASpeech corpus show that our proposed model can achieve significant improvements in terms of speaker similarity and prosody naturalness.

- **Summary**: Watermarking is crucial for protecting the copyright of AI-generated images. We propose WMAdapter, a diffusion model watermark plugin that takes user-specified watermark information and allows for seamless watermark imprinting during the diffusion generation process. WMAdapter is efficient and robust, with a strong emphasis on high generation quality. To achieve this, we make two key designs: (1) We develop a contextual adapter structure that is lightweight and enables effective knowledge transfer from heavily pretrained post-hoc watermarking models. (2) We introduce an extra finetuning step and design a hybrid finetuning strategy to further improve image quality and eliminate tiny artifacts. Empirical results demonstrate that WMAdapter offers strong flexibility, exceptional image generation quality and competitive watermark robustness.

- **Summary**: Blind image deblurring is the process of deriving a sharp image and a blur kernel from a blurred image. Blurry images are typically modeled as the convolution of a sharp image with a blur kernel, necessitating the estimation of the unknown blur kernel to perform blind image deblurring effectively. Existing approaches primarily focus on domain-specific features of images, such as salient edges, dark channels, and light streaks. These features serve as probabilistic priors to enhance the estimation of the blur kernel. For improved generality, we propose a novel prior (ReLU sparsity prior) that estimates blur kernel effectively across all distributions of images (natural, facial, text, low-light, saturated etc). Our approach demonstrates superior efficiency, with inference times up to three times faster, while maintaining high accuracy in PSNR, SSIM, and error ratio metrics. We also observe noticeable improvement in the performance of the state-of-the-art architectures (in terms of aforementioned metrics) in deep learning based approaches when our method is used as a post-processing unit.

- **Summary**: While the generation of document layouts has been extensively explored, comprehensive document generation encompassing both layout and content presents a more complex challenge. This paper delves into this advanced domain, proposing a novel approach called DocSynthv2 through the development of a simple yet effective autoregressive structured model. Our model, distinct in its integration of both layout and textual cues, marks a step beyond existing layout-generation approaches. By focusing on the relationship between the structural elements and the textual content within documents, we aim to generate cohesive and contextually relevant documents without any reliance on visual components. Through experimental studies on our curated benchmark for the new task, we demonstrate the ability of our model combining layout and textual information in enhancing the generation quality and relevance of documents, opening new pathways for research in document creation and automated design. Our findings emphasize the effectiveness of autoregressive models in handling complex document generation tasks.

- **Summary**: People's social relationships are often manifested through their surroundings, with certain objects or interactions acting as symbols for specific relationships, e.g., wedding rings, roses, hugs, or holding hands. This brings unique challenges to recognizing social relationships, requiring understanding and capturing the essence of these contexts from visual appearances. However, current methods of social relationship understanding rely on the basic classification paradigm of detected persons and objects, which fails to understand the comprehensive context and often overlooks decisive social factors, especially subtle visual cues. To highlight the social-aware context and intricate details, we propose a novel approach that recognizes \textbf{Con}textual \textbf{So}cial \textbf{R}elationships (\textbf{ConSoR}) from a social cognitive perspective. Specifically, to incorporate social-aware semantics, we build a lightweight adapter upon the frozen CLIP to learn social concepts via our novel multi-modal side adapter tuning mechanism. Further, we construct social-aware descriptive language prompts (e.g., scene, activity, objects, emotions) with social relationships for each image, and then compel ConSoR to concentrate more intensively on the decisive visual social factors via visual-linguistic contrasting. Impressively, ConSoR outperforms previous methods with a 12.2\% gain on the People-in-Social-Context (PISC) dataset and a 9.8\% increase on the People-in-Photo-Album (PIPA) benchmark. Furthermore, we observe that ConSoR excels at finding critical visual evidence to reveal social relationships.

- **Summary**: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) endeavors to segment unseen classes with only a few labeled samples. Current FSS methods are commonly built on the assumption that their training and application scenarios share similar domains, and their performances degrade significantly while applied to a distinct domain. To this end, we propose to leverage the cutting-edge foundation model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), for generalization enhancement. The SAM however performs unsatisfactorily on domains that are distinct from its training data, which primarily comprise natural scene images, and it does not support automatic segmentation of specific semantics due to its interactive prompting mechanism. In our work, we introduce APSeg, a novel auto-prompt network for cross-domain few-shot semantic segmentation (CD-FSS), which is designed to be auto-prompted for guiding cross-domain segmentation. Specifically, we propose a Dual Prototype Anchor Transformation (DPAT) module that fuses pseudo query prototypes extracted based on cycle-consistency with support prototypes, allowing features to be transformed into a more stable domain-agnostic space. Additionally, a Meta Prompt Generator (MPG) module is introduced to automatically generate prompt embeddings, eliminating the need for manual visual prompts. We build an efficient model which can be applied directly to target domains without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on four cross-domain datasets show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art CD-FSS method by 5.24% and 3.10% in average accuracy on 1-shot and 5-shot settings, respectively.

- **Summary**: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an important clinical imaging tool but inevitably introduces radiation hazards to patients and healthcare providers. Reducing the tracer injection dose and eliminating the CT acquisition for attenuation correction can reduce the overall radiation dose, but often results in PET with high noise and bias. Thus, it is desirable to develop 3D methods to translate the non-attenuation-corrected low-dose PET (NAC-LDPET) into attenuation-corrected standard-dose PET (AC-SDPET). Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a new state-of-the-art deep learning method for image-to-image translation, better than traditional CNN-based methods. However, due to the high computation cost and memory burden, it is largely limited to 2D applications. To address these challenges, we developed a novel 2.5D Multi-view Averaging Diffusion Model (MADM) for 3D image-to-image translation with application on NAC-LDPET to AC-SDPET translation. Specifically, MADM employs separate diffusion models for axial, coronal, and sagittal views, whose outputs are averaged in each sampling step to ensure the 3D generation quality from multiple views. To accelerate the 3D sampling process, we also proposed a strategy to use the CNN-based 3D generation as a prior for the diffusion model. Our experimental results on human patient studies suggested that MADM can generate high-quality 3D translation images, outperforming previous CNN-based and Diffusion-based baseline methods.

In this paper, we present Deep Degradation Response (DDR), a method to quantify changes in image deep features under varying degradation conditions. Specifically, our approach facilitates flexible and adaptive degradation, enabling the controlled synthesis of image degradation through text-driven prompts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the versatility of DDR as an image descriptor, with strong correlations observed with key image attributes such as complexity, colorfulness, sharpness, and overall quality. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of DDR across a spectrum of applications. It excels as a blind image quality assessment metric, outperforming existing methodologies across multiple datasets. Additionally, DDR serves as an effective unsupervised learning objective in image restoration tasks, yielding notable advancements in image deblurring and single-image super-resolution. Our code will be made available.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the challenge of unsupervised mistake detection in egocentric video through the analysis of gaze signals, a critical component for advancing user assistance in smart glasses. Traditional supervised methods, reliant on manually labeled mistakes, suffer from domain-dependence and scalability issues. This research introduces an unsupervised method for detecting mistakes in videos of human activities, overcoming the challenges of domain-specific requirements and the necessity for annotated data. By analyzing unusual gaze patterns that signal user disorientation during tasks, we propose a gaze completion model that forecasts eye gaze trajectories from incomplete inputs. The difference between the anticipated and observed gaze paths acts as an indicator for identifying errors. Our method is validated on the EPIC-Tent dataset, showing its superiority compared to current one-class supervised and unsupervised techniques.

- **Summary**: Monocular 3D lane detection has become a fundamental problem in the context of autonomous driving, which comprises the tasks of finding the road surface and locating lane markings. One major challenge lies in a flexible but robust line representation capable of modeling complex lane structures, while still avoiding unpredictable behavior. While previous methods rely on fully data-driven approaches, we instead introduce a novel approach LaneCPP that uses a continuous 3D lane detection model leveraging physical prior knowledge about the lane structure and road geometry. While our sophisticated lane model is capable of modeling complex road structures, it also shows robust behavior since physical constraints are incorporated by means of a regularization scheme that can be analytically applied to our parametric representation. Moreover, we incorporate prior knowledge about the road geometry into the 3D feature space by modeling geometry-aware spatial features, guiding the network to learn an internal road surface representation. In our experiments, we show the benefits of our contributions and prove the meaningfulness of using priors to make 3D lane detection more robust. The results show that LaneCPP achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of F-Score and geometric errors.

- **Summary**: Recently, the application of modern diffusion-based text-to-image generation models for creating artistic fonts, traditionally the domain of professional designers, has garnered significant interest. Diverging from the majority of existing studies that concentrate on generating artistic typography, our research aims to tackle a novel and more demanding challenge: the generation of text effects for multilingual fonts. This task essentially requires generating coherent and consistent visual content within the confines of a font-shaped canvas, as opposed to a traditional rectangular canvas. To address this task, we introduce a novel shape-adaptive diffusion model capable of interpreting the given shape and strategically planning pixel distributions within the irregular canvas. To achieve this, we curate a high-quality shape-adaptive image-text dataset and incorporate the segmentation mask as a visual condition to steer the image generation process within the irregular-canvas. This approach enables the traditionally rectangle canvas-based diffusion model to produce the desired concepts in accordance with the provided geometric shapes. Second, to maintain consistency across multiple letters, we also present a training-free, shape-adaptive effect transfer method for transferring textures from a generated reference letter to others. The key insights are building a font effect noise prior and propagating the font effect information in a concatenated latent space. The efficacy of our FontStudio system is confirmed through user preference studies, which show a marked preference (78% win-rates on aesthetics) for our system even when compared to the latest unrivaled commercial product, Adobe Firefly.

- **Summary**: We present VisionLLM v2, an end-to-end generalist multimodal large model (MLLM) that unifies visual perception, understanding, and generation within a single framework. Unlike traditional MLLMs limited to text output, VisionLLM v2 significantly broadens its application scope. It excels not only in conventional visual question answering (VQA) but also in open-ended, cross-domain vision tasks such as object localization, pose estimation, and image generation and editing. To this end, we propose a new information transmission mechanism termed "super link", as a medium to connect MLLM with task-specific decoders. It not only allows flexible transmission of task information and gradient feedback between the MLLM and multiple downstream decoders but also effectively resolves training conflicts in multi-tasking scenarios. In addition, to support the diverse range of tasks, we carefully collected and combed training data from hundreds of public vision and vision-language tasks. In this way, our model can be joint-trained end-to-end on hundreds of vision language tasks and generalize to these tasks using a set of shared parameters through different user prompts, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. We believe VisionLLM v2 will offer a new perspective on the generalization of MLLMs.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Language Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate the emerging abilities of "world models" -- interpreting and reasoning about complex real-world dynamics. To assess these abilities, we posit videos are the ideal medium, as they encapsulate rich representations of real-world dynamics and causalities. To this end, we introduce MMWorld, a new benchmark for multi-discipline, multi-faceted multimodal video understanding. MMWorld distinguishes itself from previous video understanding benchmarks with two unique advantages: (1) multi-discipline, covering various disciplines that often require domain expertise for comprehensive understanding; (2) multi-faceted reasoning, including explanation, counterfactual thinking, future prediction, etc. MMWorld consists of a human-annotated dataset to evaluate MLLMs with questions about the whole videos and a synthetic dataset to analyze MLLMs within a single modality of perception. Together, MMWorld encompasses 1,910 videos across seven broad disciplines and 69 subdisciplines, complete with 6,627 question-answer pairs and associated captions. The evaluation includes 2 proprietary and 10 open-source MLLMs, which struggle on MMWorld (e.g., GPT-4V performs the best with only 52.3\% accuracy), showing large room for improvement. Further ablation studies reveal other interesting findings such as models' different skill sets from humans. We hope MMWorld can serve as an essential step towards world model evaluation in videos.

- **Summary**: Image-text interleaved data, consisting of multiple images and texts arranged in a natural document format, aligns with the presentation paradigm of internet data and closely resembles human reading habits. Recent studies have shown that such data aids multimodal in-context learning and maintains the capabilities of large language models during multimodal fine-tuning. However, the limited scale and diversity of current image-text interleaved data restrict the development of multimodal large language models. In this paper, we introduce OmniCorpus, a 10 billion-scale image-text interleaved dataset. Using an efficient data engine, we filter and extract large-scale high-quality documents, which contain 8.6 billion images and 1,696 billion text tokens. Compared to counterparts (e.g., MMC4, OBELICS), our dataset 1) has 15 times larger scales while maintaining good data quality; 2) features more diverse sources, including both English and non-English websites as well as video-centric websites; 3) is more flexible, easily degradable from an image-text interleaved format to pure text corpus and image-text pairs. Through comprehensive analysis and experiments, we validate the quality, usability, and effectiveness of the proposed dataset. We hope this could provide a solid data foundation for future multimodal model research. Code and data are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/OmniCorpus.

- **Summary**: The development of Autonomous Driving (AD) systems in simulated environments like CARLA is crucial for advancing real-world automotive technologies. To drive innovation, CARLA introduced Leaderboard 2.0, significantly more challenging than its predecessor. However, current AD methods have struggled to achieve satisfactory outcomes due to a lack of sufficient ground truth data. Human driving logs provided by CARLA are insufficient, and previously successful expert agents like Autopilot and Roach, used for collecting datasets, have seen reduced effectiveness under these more demanding conditions. To overcome these data limitations, we introduce PRIBOOT, an expert agent that leverages limited human logs with privileged information. We have developed a novel BEV representation specifically tailored to meet the demands of this new benchmark and processed it as an RGB image to facilitate the application of transfer learning techniques, instead of using a set of masks. Additionally, we propose the Infraction Rate Score (IRS), a new evaluation metric designed to provide a more balanced assessment of driving performance over extended routes. PRIBOOT is the first model to achieve a Route Completion (RC) of 75% in Leaderboard 2.0, along with a Driving Score (DS) and IRS of 20% and 45%, respectively. With PRIBOOT, researchers can now generate extensive datasets, potentially solving the data availability issues that have hindered progress in this benchmark.

- **Summary**: Accurate nuclei segmentation in histopathological images is crucial for cancer diagnosis. Automating this process offers valuable support to clinical experts, as manual annotation is time-consuming and prone to human errors. However, automating nuclei segmentation presents challenges due to uncertain cell boundaries, intricate staining, and diverse structures. In this paper, we present a segmentation approach that combines the U-Net architecture with a DenseNet-121 backbone, harnessing the strengths of both to capture comprehensive contextual and spatial information. Our model introduces the Wavelet-guided channel attention module to enhance cell boundary delineation, along with a learnable weighted global attention module for channel-specific attention. The decoder module, composed of an upsample block and convolution block, further refines segmentation in handling staining patterns. The experimental results conducted on two publicly accessible histopathology datasets, namely Monuseg and TNBC, underscore the superiority of our proposed model, demonstrating its potential to advance histopathological image analysis and cancer diagnosis.

- **Summary**: We present Diffusion Soup, a compartmentalization method for Text-to-Image Generation that averages the weights of diffusion models trained on sharded data. By construction, our approach enables training-free continual learning and unlearning with no additional memory or inference costs, since models corresponding to data shards can be added or removed by re-averaging. We show that Diffusion Soup samples from a point in weight space that approximates the geometric mean of the distributions of constituent datasets, which offers anti-memorization guarantees and enables zero-shot style mixing. Empirically, Diffusion Soup outperforms a paragon model trained on the union of all data shards and achieves a 30% improvement in Image Reward (.34 $\to$ .44) on domain sharded data, and a 59% improvement in IR (.37 $\to$ .59) on aesthetic data. In both cases, souping also prevails in TIFA score (respectively, 85.5 $\to$ 86.5 and 85.6 $\to$ 86.8). We demonstrate robust unlearning -- removing any individual domain shard only lowers performance by 1% in IR (.45 $\to$ .44) -- and validate our theoretical insights on anti-memorization using real data. Finally, we showcase Diffusion Soup's ability to blend the distinct styles of models finetuned on different shards, resulting in the zero-shot generation of hybrid styles.

- **Summary**: The advent of the digital age has driven the development of coherent optical modems -- devices that modulate the amplitude and phase of light in multiple polarization states. These modems transmit data through fiber optic cables that are thousands of kilometers in length at data rates exceeding one terabit per second. This remarkable technology is made possible through near-THz-rate programmable control and sensing of the full optical wavefield. While coherent optical modems form the backbone of telecommunications networks around the world, their extraordinary capabilities also provide unique opportunities for imaging. Here, we introduce full-wavefield lidar: a new imaging modality that repurposes off-the-shelf coherent optical modems to simultaneously measure distance, axial velocity, and polarization. We demonstrate this modality by combining a 74 GHz-bandwidth coherent optical modem with free-space coupling optics and scanning mirrors. We develop a time-resolved image formation model for this system and formulate a maximum-likelihood reconstruction algorithm to recover depth, velocity, and polarization information at each scene point from the modem's raw transmitted and received symbols. Compared to existing lidars, full-wavefield lidar promises improved mm-scale ranging accuracy from brief, microsecond exposure times, reliable velocimetry, and robustness to intererence from ambient light or other lidar signals.

- **Summary**: We introduce transformation-dependent adversarial attacks, a new class of threats where a single additive perturbation can trigger diverse, controllable mis-predictions by systematically transforming the input (e.g., scaling, blurring, compression). Unlike traditional attacks with static effects, our perturbations embed metamorphic properties to enable different adversarial attacks as a function of the transformation parameters. We demonstrate the transformation-dependent vulnerability across models (e.g., convolutional networks and vision transformers) and vision tasks (e.g., image classification and object detection). Our proposed geometric and photometric transformations enable a range of targeted errors from one crafted input (e.g., higher than 90% attack success rate for classifiers). We analyze effects of model architecture and type/variety of transformations on attack effectiveness. This work forces a paradigm shift by redefining adversarial inputs as dynamic, controllable threats. We highlight the need for robust defenses against such multifaceted, chameleon-like perturbations that current techniques are ill-prepared for.

- **Summary**: Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) is critical for marine research and exploration but hindered by complex color distortions and severe blurring. Recent deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable results, yet these methods struggle with high computational costs and insufficient global modeling, resulting in locally under- or over- adjusted regions. We present PixMamba, a novel architecture, designed to overcome these challenges by leveraging State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient global dependency modeling. Unlike convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with limited receptive fields and transformer networks with high computational costs, PixMamba efficiently captures global contextual information while maintaining computational efficiency. Our dual-level strategy features the patch-level Efficient Mamba Net (EMNet) for reconstructing enhanced image feature and the pixel-level PixMamba Net (PixNet) to ensure fine-grained feature capturing and global consistency of enhanced image that were previously difficult to obtain. PixMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across various underwater image datasets and delivers visually superior results. Code is available at: https://github.com/weitunglin/pixmamba.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Smartphone users often navigate across multiple applications (apps) to complete tasks such as sharing content between social media platforms. Autonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) navigation agents can enhance user experience in communication, entertainment, and productivity by streamlining workflows and reducing manual intervention. However, prior GUI agents often trained with datasets comprising simple tasks that can be completed within a single app, leading to poor performance in cross-app navigation. To address this problem, we introduce GUI Odyssey, a comprehensive dataset for training and evaluating cross-app navigation agents. GUI Odyssey consists of 7,735 episodes from 6 mobile devices, spanning 6 types of cross-app tasks, 201 apps, and 1.4K app combos. Leveraging GUI Odyssey, we developed OdysseyAgent, a multimodal cross-app navigation agent by fine-tuning the Qwen-VL model with a history resampling module. Extensive experiments demonstrate OdysseyAgent's superior accuracy compared to existing models. For instance, OdysseyAgent surpasses fine-tuned Qwen-VL and zero-shot GPT-4V by 1.44\% and 55.49\% in-domain accuracy, and 2.29\% and 48.14\% out-of-domain accuracy on average. The dataset and code will be released in \url{https://github.com/OpenGVLab/GUI-Odyssey}.

- **Summary**: Existing fine-grained hashing methods typically lack code interpretability as they compute hash code bits holistically using both global and local features. To address this limitation, we propose ConceptHash, a novel method that achieves sub-code level interpretability. In ConceptHash, each sub-code corresponds to a human-understandable concept, such as an object part, and these concepts are automatically discovered without human annotations. Specifically, we leverage a Vision Transformer architecture and introduce concept tokens as visual prompts, along with image patch tokens as model inputs. Each concept is then mapped to a specific sub-code at the model output, providing natural sub-code interpretability. To capture subtle visual differences among highly similar sub-categories (e.g., bird species), we incorporate language guidance to ensure that the learned hash codes are distinguishable within fine-grained object classes while maintaining semantic alignment. This approach allows us to develop hash codes that exhibit similarity within families of species while remaining distinct from species in other families. Extensive experiments on four fine-grained image retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that ConceptHash outperforms previous methods by a significant margin, offering unique sub-code interpretability as an additional benefit.

- **Summary**: Visual localization techniques rely upon some underlying scene representation to localize against. These representations can be explicit such as 3D SFM map or implicit, such as a neural network that learns to encode the scene. The former requires sparse feature extractors and matchers to build the scene representation. The latter might lack geometric grounding not capturing the 3D structure of the scene well enough. This paper proposes to jointly learn the scene representation along with a 3D dense feature field and a 2D feature extractor whose outputs are embedded in the same metric space. Through a contrastive framework we align this volumetric field with the image-based extractor and regularize the latter with a ranking loss from learned surface information. We learn the underlying geometry of the scene with an implicit field through volumetric rendering and design our feature field to leverage intermediate geometric information encoded in the implicit field. The resulting features are discriminative and robust to viewpoint change while maintaining rich encoded information. Visual localization is then achieved by aligning the image-based features and the rendered volumetric features. We show the effectiveness of our approach on real-world scenes, demonstrating that our approach outperforms prior and concurrent work on leveraging implicit scene representations for localization.

- **Summary**: We present Real2Code, a novel approach to reconstructing articulated objects via code generation. Given visual observations of an object, we first reconstruct its part geometry using an image segmentation model and a shape completion model. We then represent the object parts with oriented bounding boxes, which are input to a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to predict joint articulation as code. By leveraging pre-trained vision and language models, our approach scales elegantly with the number of articulated parts, and generalizes from synthetic training data to real world objects in unstructured environments. Experimental results demonstrate that Real2Code significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art in reconstruction accuracy, and is the first approach to extrapolate beyond objects' structural complexity in the training set, and reconstructs objects with up to 10 articulated parts. When incorporated with a stereo reconstruction model, Real2Code also generalizes to real world objects from a handful of multi-view RGB images, without the need for depth or camera information.

- **Summary**: Creating realistic avatars from a single RGB image is an attractive yet challenging problem. Due to its ill-posed nature, recent works leverage powerful prior from 2D diffusion models pretrained on large datasets. Although 2D diffusion models demonstrate strong generalization capability, they cannot provide multi-view shape priors with guaranteed 3D consistency. We propose Human 3Diffusion: Realistic Avatar Creation via Explicit 3D Consistent Diffusion. Our key insight is that 2D multi-view diffusion and 3D reconstruction models provide complementary information for each other, and by coupling them in a tight manner, we can fully leverage the potential of both models. We introduce a novel image-conditioned generative 3D Gaussian Splats reconstruction model that leverages the priors from 2D multi-view diffusion models, and provides an explicit 3D representation, which further guides the 2D reverse sampling process to have better 3D consistency. Experiments show that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods and enables the creation of realistic avatars from a single RGB image, achieving high-fidelity in both geometry and appearance. Extensive ablations also validate the efficacy of our design, (1) multi-view 2D priors conditioning in generative 3D reconstruction and (2) consistency refinement of sampling trajectory via the explicit 3D representation. Our code and models will be released on https://yuxuan-xue.com/human-3diffusion.

- **Summary**: With recent video object segmentation (VOS) benchmarks evolving to challenging scenarios, we revisit a simple but overlooked strategy: restricting the size of memory banks. This diverges from the prevalent practice of expanding memory banks to accommodate extensive historical information. Our specially designed "memory deciphering" study offers a pivotal insight underpinning such a strategy: expanding memory banks, while seemingly beneficial, actually increases the difficulty for VOS modules to decode relevant features due to the confusion from redundant information. By restricting memory banks to a limited number of essential frames, we achieve a notable improvement in VOS accuracy. This process balances the importance and freshness of frames to maintain an informative memory bank within a bounded capacity. Additionally, restricted memory banks reduce the training-inference discrepancy in memory lengths compared with continuous expansion. This fosters new opportunities in temporal reasoning and enables us to introduce the previously overlooked "temporal positional embedding." Finally, our insights are embodied in "RMem" ("R" for restricted), a simple yet effective VOS modification that excels at challenging VOS scenarios and establishes new state of the art for object state changes (on the VOST dataset) and long videos (on the Long Videos dataset). Our code and demo are available at https://restricted-memory.github.io/.

- **Summary**: Web-crawled image-text pairs are inherently noisy. Prior studies demonstrate that semantically aligning and enriching textual descriptions of these pairs can significantly enhance model training across various vision-language tasks, particularly text-to-image generation. However, large-scale investigations in this area remain predominantly closed-source. Our paper aims to bridge this community effort, leveraging the powerful and \textit{open-sourced} LLaMA-3, a GPT-4 level LLM. Our recaptioning pipeline is simple: first, we fine-tune a LLaMA-3-8B powered LLaVA-1.5 and then employ it to recaption 1.3 billion images from the DataComp-1B dataset. Our empirical results confirm that this enhanced dataset, Recap-DataComp-1B, offers substantial benefits in training advanced vision-language models. For discriminative models like CLIP, we observe enhanced zero-shot performance in cross-modal retrieval tasks. For generative models like text-to-image Diffusion Transformers, the generated images exhibit a significant improvement in alignment with users' text instructions, especially in following complex queries.

- **Summary**: The default strategy for training single-view Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) follows the fully supervised route using large-scale datasets of synthetic 3D assets or multi-view captures. Although these resources simplify the training procedure, they are hard to scale up beyond the existing datasets and they are not necessarily representative of the real distribution of object shapes. To address these limitations, in this paper, we introduce Real3D, the first LRM system that can be trained using single-view real-world images. Real3D introduces a novel self-training framework that can benefit from both the existing synthetic data and diverse single-view real images. We propose two unsupervised losses that allow us to supervise LRMs at the pixel- and semantic-level, even for training examples without ground-truth 3D or novel views. To further improve performance and scale up the image data, we develop an automatic data curation approach to collect high-quality examples from in-the-wild images. Our experiments show that Real3D consistently outperforms prior work in four diverse evaluation settings that include real and synthetic data, as well as both in-domain and out-of-domain shapes.

- **Summary**: End-to-end autonomous driving has garnered widespread attention. Current end-to-end approaches largely rely on the supervision from perception tasks such as detection, tracking, and map segmentation to aid in learning scene representations. However, these methods require extensive annotations, hindering the data scalability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel self-supervised method to enhance end-to-end driving without the need for costly labels. Specifically, our framework \textbf{LAW} uses a LAtent World model to predict future latent features based on the predicted ego actions and the latent feature of the current frame. The predicted latent features are supervised by the actually observed features in the future. This supervision jointly optimizes the latent feature learning and action prediction, which greatly enhances the driving performance. As a result, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop benchmarks without costly annotations.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models are the state of the art in text-to-image generation, but their perceptual variability remains understudied. In this paper, we examine how prompts affect image variability in black-box diffusion-based models. We propose W1KP, a human-calibrated measure of variability in a set of images, bootstrapped from existing image-pair perceptual distances. Current datasets do not cover recent diffusion models, thus we curate three test sets for evaluation. Our best perceptual distance outperforms nine baselines by up to 18 points in accuracy, and our calibration matches graded human judgements 78% of the time. Using W1KP, we study prompt reusability and show that Imagen prompts can be reused for 10-50 random seeds before new images become too similar to already generated images, while Stable Diffusion XL and DALL-E 3 can be reused 50-200 times. Lastly, we analyze 56 linguistic features of real prompts, finding that the prompt's length, CLIP embedding norm, concreteness, and word senses influence variability most. As far as we are aware, we are the first to analyze diffusion variability from a visuolinguistic perspective. Our project page is at http://w1kp.com

- **Summary**: Volumetric medical segmentation models have achieved significant success on organ and tumor-based segmentation tasks in recent years. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored, raising serious concerns regarding the real-world deployment of tools employing such models in the healthcare sector. This underscores the importance of investigating the robustness of existing models. In this context, our work aims to empirically examine the adversarial robustness across current volumetric segmentation architectures, encompassing Convolutional, Transformer, and Mamba-based models. We extend this investigation across four volumetric segmentation datasets, evaluating robustness under both white box and black box adversarial attacks. Overall, we observe that while both pixel and frequency-based attacks perform reasonably well under white box setting, the latter performs significantly better under transfer-based black box attacks. Across our experiments, we observe transformer-based models show higher robustness than convolution-based models with Mamba-based models being the most vulnerable. Additionally, we show that large-scale training of volumetric segmentation models improves the model's robustness against adversarial attacks. The code and pretrained models will be made available at https://github.com/HashmatShadab/Robustness-of-Volumetric-Medical-Segmentation-Models.

- **Summary**: Seeing clearly with high resolution is a foundation of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), which has been proven to be vital for visual perception and reasoning. Existing works usually employ a straightforward resolution upscaling method, where the image consists of global and local branches, with the latter being the sliced image patches but resized to the same resolution as the former. This means that higher resolution requires more local patches, resulting in exorbitant computational expenses, and meanwhile, the dominance of local image tokens may diminish the global context. In this paper, we dive into the problems and propose a new framework as well as an elaborate optimization strategy. Specifically, we extract contextual information from the global view using a mixture of adapters, based on the observation that different adapters excel at different tasks. With regard to local patches, learnable query embeddings are introduced to reduce image tokens, the most important tokens accounting for the user question will be further selected by a similarity-based selector. Our empirical results demonstrate a `less is more' pattern, where \textit{utilizing fewer but more informative local image tokens leads to improved performance}. Besides, a significant challenge lies in the training strategy, as simultaneous end-to-end training of the global mining block and local compression block does not yield optimal results. We thus advocate for an alternating training way, ensuring balanced learning between global and local aspects. Finally, we also introduce a challenging dataset with high requirements for image detail, enhancing the training of the local compression layer. The proposed method, termed LMM with Sophisticated Tasks, Local image compression, and Mixture of global Experts (SliME), achieves leading performance across various benchmarks with only 2 million training data.

- **Summary**: Recently many techniques have emerged to create high quality 3D assets and scenes. When it comes to editing of these objects, however, existing approaches are either slow, compromise on quality, or do not provide enough customization. We introduce a novel approach to quickly edit a 3D model from a single reference view. Our technique first segments the edit image, and then matches semantically corresponding regions across chosen segmented dataset views using DINO features. A color or texture change from a particular region of the edit image can then be applied to other views automatically in a semantically sensible manner. These edited views act as an updated dataset to further train and re-style the 3D scene. The end-result is therefore an edited 3D model. Our framework enables a wide variety of editing tasks such as manual local edits, correspondence based style transfer from any example image, and a combination of different styles from multiple example images. We use Gaussian Splats as our primary 3D representation due to their speed and ease of local editing, but our technique works for other methods such as NeRFs as well. We show through multiple examples that our method produces higher quality results while offering fine-grained control of editing. Project page: ice-gaussian.github.io

- **Summary**: In this work, we study how to build a robotic system that can solve multiple 3D manipulation tasks given language instructions. To be useful in industrial and household domains, such a system should be capable of learning new tasks with few demonstrations and solving them precisely. Prior works, like PerAct and RVT, have studied this problem, however, they often struggle with tasks requiring high precision. We study how to make them more effective, precise, and fast. Using a combination of architectural and system-level improvements, we propose RVT-2, a multitask 3D manipulation model that is 6X faster in training and 2X faster in inference than its predecessor RVT. RVT-2 achieves a new state-of-the-art on RLBench, improving the success rate from 65% to 82%. RVT-2 is also effective in the real world, where it can learn tasks requiring high precision, like picking up and inserting plugs, with just 10 demonstrations.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) excel at image and video generation but face computational challenges due to self-attention's quadratic complexity. We propose DiTFastAttn, a novel post-training compression method to alleviate DiT's computational bottleneck. We identify three key redundancies in the attention computation during DiT inference: 1. spatial redundancy, where many attention heads focus on local information; 2. temporal redundancy, with high similarity between neighboring steps' attention outputs; 3. conditional redundancy, where conditional and unconditional inferences exhibit significant similarity. To tackle these redundancies, we propose three techniques: 1. Window Attention with Residual Caching to reduce spatial redundancy; 2. Temporal Similarity Reduction to exploit the similarity between steps; 3. Conditional Redundancy Elimination to skip redundant computations during conditional generation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DiTFastAttn, we apply it to DiT, PixArt-Sigma for image generation tasks, and OpenSora for video generation tasks. Evaluation results show that for image generation, our method reduces up to 88\% of the FLOPs and achieves up to 1.6x speedup at high resolution generation.

- **Summary**: Providing textual concept-based explanations for neurons in deep neural networks (DNNs) is of importance in understanding how a DNN model works. Prior works have associated concepts with neurons based on examples of concepts or a pre-defined set of concepts, thus limiting possible explanations to what the user expects, especially in discovering new concepts. Furthermore, defining the set of concepts requires manual work from the user, either by directly specifying them or collecting examples. To overcome these, we propose to leverage multimodal large language models for automatic and open-ended concept discovery. We show that, without a restricted set of pre-defined concepts, our method gives rise to novel interpretable concepts that are more faithful to the model's behavior. To quantify this, we validate each concept by generating examples and counterexamples and evaluating the neuron's response on this new set of images. Collectively, our method can discover concepts and simultaneously validate them, providing a credible automated tool to explain deep neural networks.

- **Summary**: Due to the high potential for abuse of GenAI systems, the task of detecting synthetic images has recently become of great interest to the research community. Unfortunately, existing image-space detectors quickly become obsolete as new high-fidelity text-to-image models are developed at blinding speed. In this work, we propose a new synthetic image detector that uses features obtained by inverting an open-source pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. We show that these inversion features enable our detector to generalize well to unseen generators of high visual fidelity (e.g., DALL-E 3) even when the detector is trained only on lower fidelity fake images generated via Stable Diffusion. This detector achieves new state-of-the-art across multiple training and evaluation setups. Moreover, we introduce a new challenging evaluation protocol that uses reverse image search to mitigate stylistic and thematic biases in the detector evaluation. We show that the resulting evaluation scores align well with detectors' in-the-wild performance, and release these datasets as public benchmarks for future research.

- **Summary**: Breast cancer is a major global health concern. Pathologists face challenges in analyzing complex features from pathological images, which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. Therefore, efficient computer-based diagnostic tools are needed for early detection and treatment planning. This paper presents a modified version of MultiResU-Net for histopathology image segmentation, which is selected as the backbone for its ability to analyze and segment complex features at multiple scales and ensure effective feature flow via skip connections. The modified version also utilizes the Gaussian distribution-based Attention Module (GdAM) to incorporate histopathology-relevant text information in a Gaussian distribution. The sampled features from the Gaussian text feature-guided distribution highlight specific spatial regions based on prior knowledge. Finally, using the Controlled Dense Residual Block (CDRB) on skip connections of MultiResU-Net, the information is transferred from the encoder layers to the decoder layers in a controlled manner using a scaling parameter derived from the extracted spatial features. We validate our approach on two diverse breast cancer histopathology image datasets: TNBC and MonuSeg, demonstrating superior segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code for our proposed model is available on https://github.com/AyushRoy2001/GRU-Net.

- **Summary**: The rapid evolution of intelligent document processing systems demands robust solutions that adapt to diverse domains without extensive retraining. Traditional methods often falter with variable document types, leading to poor performance. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a text-graphic layer separation approach that enhances domain adaptability in document image restoration (DIR) systems. We propose LayeredDoc, which utilizes two layers of information: the first targets coarse-grained graphic components, while the second refines machine-printed textual content. This hierarchical DIR framework dynamically adjusts to the characteristics of the input document, facilitating effective domain adaptation. We evaluated our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively using a new real-world dataset, LayeredDocDB, developed for this study. Initially trained on a synthetically generated dataset, our model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities for the DIR task, offering a promising solution for handling variability in real-world data. Our code is accessible on GitHub.

- **Summary**: Advances in deepfake research have led to the creation of almost perfect manipulations undetectable by human eyes and some deepfakes detection tools. Recently, several techniques have been proposed to differentiate deepfakes from realistic images and videos. This paper introduces a Frequency Enhanced Self-Blended Images (FSBI) approach for deepfakes detection. This proposed approach utilizes Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) to extract discriminative features from the self-blended images (SBI) to be used for training a convolutional network architecture model. The SBIs blend the image with itself by introducing several forgery artifacts in a copy of the image before blending it. This prevents the classifier from overfitting specific artifacts by learning more generic representations. These blended images are then fed into the frequency features extractor to detect artifacts that can not be detected easily in the time domain. The proposed approach has been evaluated on FF++ and Celeb-DF datasets and the obtained results outperformed the state-of-the-art techniques with the cross-dataset evaluation protocol.

- **Summary**: Brain tumor segmentation remains a significant challenge, particularly in the context of multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) where missing modality images are common in clinical settings, leading to reduced segmentation accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy, which is called masked predicted pre-training, enabling robust feature learning from incomplete modality data. Additionally, in the fine-tuning phase, we utilize a knowledge distillation technique to align features between complete and missing modality data, simultaneously enhancing model robustness. Notably, we leverage the Holder pseudo-divergence instead of the KLD for distillation loss, offering improve mathematical interpretability and properties. Extensive experiments on the BRATS2018 and BRATS2020 datasets demonstrate significant performance enhancements compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The high level of photorealism in state-of-the-art diffusion models like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Firefly makes it difficult for untrained humans to distinguish between real photographs and AI-generated images. To address this problem, we designed a guide to help readers develop a more critical eye toward identifying artifacts, inconsistencies, and implausibilities that often appear in AI-generated images. The guide is organized into five categories of artifacts and implausibilities: anatomical, stylistic, functional, violations of physics, and sociocultural. For this guide, we generated 138 images with diffusion models, curated 9 images from social media, and curated 42 real photographs. These images showcase the kinds of cues that prompt suspicion towards the possibility an image is AI-generated and why it is often difficult to draw conclusions about an image's provenance without any context beyond the pixels in an image. Human-perceptible artifacts are not always present in AI-generated images, but this guide reveals artifacts and implausibilities that often emerge. By drawing attention to these kinds of artifacts and implausibilities, we aim to better equip people to distinguish AI-generated images from real photographs in the future.

- **Summary**: Video generation has many unique challenges beyond those of image generation. The temporal dimension introduces extensive possible variations across frames, over which consistency and continuity may be violated. In this study, we move beyond evaluating simple actions and argue that generated videos should incorporate the emergence of new concepts and their relation transitions like in real-world videos as time progresses. To assess the Temporal Compositionality of video generation models, we propose TC-Bench, a benchmark of meticulously crafted text prompts, corresponding ground truth videos, and robust evaluation metrics. The prompts articulate the initial and final states of scenes, effectively reducing ambiguities for frame development and simplifying the assessment of transition completion. In addition, by collecting aligned real-world videos corresponding to the prompts, we expand TC-Bench's applicability from text-conditional models to image-conditional ones that can perform generative frame interpolation. We also develop new metrics to measure the completeness of component transitions in generated videos, which demonstrate significantly higher correlations with human judgments than existing metrics. Our comprehensive experimental results reveal that most video generators achieve less than 20% of the compositional changes, highlighting enormous space for future improvement. Our analysis indicates that current video generation models struggle to interpret descriptions of compositional changes and synthesize various components across different time steps.

- **Summary**: While diffusion models have shown impressive performance in 2D image/video generation, diffusion-based Text-to-Multi-view-Video (T2MVid) generation remains underexplored. The new challenges posed by T2MVid generation lie in the lack of massive captioned multi-view videos and the complexity of modeling such multi-dimensional distribution. To this end, we propose a novel diffusion-based pipeline that generates high-quality multi-view videos centered around a dynamic 3D object from text. Specifically, we factor the T2MVid problem into viewpoint-space and time components. Such factorization allows us to combine and reuse layers of advanced pre-trained multi-view image and 2D video diffusion models to ensure multi-view consistency as well as temporal coherence for the generated multi-view videos, largely reducing the training cost. We further introduce alignment modules to align the latent spaces of layers from the pre-trained multi-view and the 2D video diffusion models, addressing the reused layers' incompatibility that arises from the domain gap between 2D and multi-view data. In support of this and future research, we further contribute a captioned multi-view video dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates high-quality multi-view videos, exhibiting vivid motions, temporal coherence, and multi-view consistency, given a variety of text prompts.

- **Summary**: Perceiving the world and forecasting its future state is a critical task for self-driving. Supervised approaches leverage annotated object labels to learn a model of the world -- traditionally with object detections and trajectory predictions, or temporal bird's-eye-view (BEV) occupancy fields. However, these annotations are expensive and typically limited to a set of predefined categories that do not cover everything we might encounter on the road. Instead, we learn to perceive and forecast a continuous 4D (spatio-temporal) occupancy field with self-supervision from LiDAR data. This unsupervised world model can be easily and effectively transferred to downstream tasks. We tackle point cloud forecasting by adding a lightweight learned renderer and achieve state-of-the-art performance in Argoverse 2, nuScenes, and KITTI. To further showcase its transferability, we fine-tune our model for BEV semantic occupancy forecasting and show that it outperforms the fully supervised state-of-the-art, especially when labeled data is scarce. Finally, when compared to prior state-of-the-art on spatio-temporal geometric occupancy prediction, our 4D world model achieves a much higher recall of objects from classes relevant to self-driving.
