- **Summary**: Recovering the camera motion and scene geometry from visual data is a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision. Its success in standard vision is attributed to the maturity of feature extraction, data association and multi-view geometry. The recent emergence of neuromorphic event-based cameras places great demands on approaches that use raw event data as input to solve this fundamental problem.Existing state-of-the-art solutions typically infer implicitly data association by iteratively reversing the event data generation process. However, the nonlinear nature of these methods limits their applicability in real-time tasks, and the constant-motion assumption leads to unstable results under agile motion.To this end, we rethink the problem formulation in a way that aligns better with the differential working principle of event cameras.We show that the event-based normal flow can be used, via the proposed geometric error term, as an alternative to the full flow in solving a family of geometric problems that involve instantaneous first-order kinematics and scene geometry. Furthermore, we develop a fast linear solver and a continuous-time nonlinear solver on top of the proposed geometric error term.Experiments on both synthetic and real data show the superiority of our linear solver in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and indicate its complementary feature as an initialization method for existing nonlinear solvers. Besides, our continuous-time non-linear solver exhibits exceptional capability in accommodating sudden variations in motion since it does not rely on the constant-motion assumption.

- **Summary**: We study the problem of continual test-time adaption where the goal is to adapt a source pre-trained model to a sequence of unlabelled target domains at test time. Existing methods on test-time training suffer from several limitations: (1) Mismatch between the feature extractor and classifier; (2) Interference between the main and self-supervised tasks; (3) Lack of the ability to quickly adapt to the current distribution. In light of these challenges, we propose a cascading paradigm that simultaneously updates the feature extractor and classifier at test time, mitigating the mismatch between them and enabling long-term model adaptation. The pre-training of our model is structured within a meta-learning framework, thereby minimizing the interference between the main and self-supervised tasks and encouraging fast adaptation in the presence of limited unlabelled data. Additionally, we introduce innovative evaluation metrics, average accuracy and forward transfer, to effectively measure the model's adaptation capabilities in dynamic, real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our approach in a range of tasks including image classification, text classification, and speech recognition.

- **Summary**: Specular highlight removal plays a pivotal role in multimedia applications, as it enhances the quality and interpretability of images and videos, ultimately improving the performance of downstream tasks such as content-based retrieval, object recognition, and scene understanding. Despite significant advances in deep learning-based methods, current state-of-the-art approaches often rely on additional priors or supervision, limiting their practicality and generalization capability. In this paper, we propose the Dual-Hybrid Attention Network for Specular Highlight Removal (DHAN-SHR), an end-to-end network that introduces novel hybrid attention mechanisms to effectively capture and process information across different scales and domains without relying on additional priors or supervision. DHAN-SHR consists of two key components: the Adaptive Local Hybrid-Domain Dual Attention Transformer (L-HD-DAT) and the Adaptive Global Dual Attention Transformer (G-DAT). The L-HD-DAT captures local inter-channel and inter-pixel dependencies while incorporating spectral domain features, enabling the network to effectively model the complex interactions between specular highlights and the underlying surface properties. The G-DAT models global inter-channel relationships and long-distance pixel dependencies, allowing the network to propagate contextual information across the entire image and generate more coherent and consistent highlight-free results. To evaluate the performance of DHAN-SHR and facilitate future research in this area, we compile a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising a diverse range of images with varying levels of specular highlights. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DHAN-SHR outperforms 18 state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, setting a new standard for specular highlight removal in multimedia applications.

- **Summary**: The growing demand for high-resolution maps across various applications has underscored the necessity of accurately segmenting building vectors from overhead imagery. However, current deep neural networks often produce raster data outputs, leading to the need for extensive post-processing that compromises the fidelity, regularity, and simplicity of building representations. In response, this paper introduces a novel deep convolutional neural network named OriCornerNet, which directly extracts delineated building polygons from input images. Specifically, our approach involves a deep model that predicts building footprint masks, corners, and orientation vectors that indicate directions toward adjacent corners. These predictions are then used to reconstruct an initial polygon, followed by iterative refinement using a graph convolutional network that leverages semantic and geometric features. Our method inherently generates simplified polygons by initializing the refinement process with predicted corners. Also, including geometric information from oriented corners contributes to producing more regular and accurate results. Performance evaluations conducted on SpaceNet Vegas and CrowdAI-small datasets demonstrate the competitive efficacy of our approach compared to the state-of-the-art in building segmentation from overhead imagery.

- **Summary**: Compound Expression Recognition (CER) is vital for effective interpersonal interactions. Human emotional expressions are inherently complex due to the presence of compound expressions, requiring the consideration of both local and global facial cues for accurate judgment. In this paper, we propose an ensemble learning-based solution to address this complexity. Our approach involves training three distinct expression classification models using convolutional networks, Vision Transformers, and multiscale local attention networks. By employing late fusion for model ensemble, we combine the outputs of these models to predict the final results. Our method demonstrates high accuracy on the RAF-DB datasets and is capable of recognizing expressions in certain portions of the C-EXPR-DB through zero-shot learning.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present our approach to addressing the challenges of the 7th ABAW competition. The competition comprises three sub-challenges: Valence Arousal (VA) estimation, Expression (Expr) classification, and Action Unit (AU) detection. To tackle these challenges, we employ state-of-the-art models to extract powerful visual features. Subsequently, a Transformer Encoder is utilized to integrate these features for the VA, Expr, and AU sub-challenges. To mitigate the impact of varying feature dimensions, we introduce an affine module to align the features to a common dimension. Overall, our results significantly outperform the baselines.

- **Summary**: We present a new approach for generating 3D house wireframes with semantic enrichment using an autoregressive model. Unlike conventional generative models that independently process vertices, edges, and faces, our approach employs a unified wire-based representation for improved coherence in learning 3D wireframe structures. By re-ordering wire sequences based on semantic meanings, we facilitate seamless semantic integration during sequence generation. Our two-phase technique merges a graph-based autoencoder with a transformer-based decoder to learn latent geometric tokens and generate semantic-aware wireframes. Through iterative prediction and decoding during inference, our model produces detailed wireframes that can be easily segmented into distinct components, such as walls, roofs, and rooms, reflecting the semantic essence of the shape. Empirical results on a comprehensive house dataset validate the superior accuracy, novelty, and semantic fidelity of our model compared to existing generative models.

- **Summary**: Detecting retinal image analysis, particularly the geometrical features of branching points, plays an essential role in diagnosing eye diseases. However, existing methods used for this purpose often are coarse-level and lack fine-grained analysis for efficient annotation. To mitigate these issues, this paper proposes a novel method for detecting retinal branching angles using a self-configured image processing technique. Additionally, we offer an open-source annotation tool and a benchmark dataset comprising 40 images annotated with retinal branching angles. Our methodology for retinal branching angle detection and calculation is detailed, followed by a benchmark analysis comparing our method with previous approaches. The results indicate that our method is robust under various conditions with high accuracy and efficiency, which offers a valuable instrument for ophthalmic research and clinical applications.



### GRIDS: Grouped Multiple-Degradation Restoration with Image Degradation Similarity

- **Summary**: Traditional single-task image restoration methods excel in handling specific degradation types but struggle with multiple degradations. To address this limitation, we propose Grouped Restoration with Image Degradation Similarity (GRIDS), a novel approach that harmonizes the competing objectives inherent in multiple-degradation restoration. We first introduce a quantitative method for assessing relationships between image degradations using statistical modeling of deep degradation representations. This analysis facilitates the strategic grouping of similar tasks, enhancing both the efficiency and effectiveness of the restoration process. Based on the degradation similarity, GRIDS divides restoration tasks into one of the optimal groups, where tasks within the same group are highly correlated. For instance, GRIDS effectively groups 11 degradation types into 4 cohesive groups. Trained models within each group show significant improvements, with an average improvement of 0.09dB over single-task upper bound models and 2.24dB over the mix-training baseline model. GRIDS incorporates an adaptive model selection mechanism for inference, automatically selecting the appropriate grouped-training model based on the input degradation. This mechanism is particularly useful for real-world scenarios with unknown degradations as it does not rely on explicit degradation classification modules. Furthermore, our method can predict model generalization ability without the need for network inference, providing valuable insights for practitioners.

- **Summary**: Deception detection has garnered increasing attention in recent years due to the significant growth of digital media and heightened ethical and security concerns. It has been extensively studied using multimodal methods, including video, audio, and text. In addition, individual differences in deception production and detection are believed to play a crucial role.Although some studies have utilized individual information such as personality traits to enhance the performance of deception detection, current systems remain limited, partly due to a lack of sufficient datasets for evaluating performance. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal deception dataset MDPE. Besides deception features, this dataset also includes individual differences information in personality and emotional expression characteristics. It can explore the impact of individual differences on deception behavior. It comprises over 104 hours of deception and emotional videos from 193 subjects. Furthermore, we conducted numerous experiments to provide valuable insights for future deception detection research. MDPE not only supports deception detection, but also provides conditions for tasks such as personality recognition and emotion recognition, and can even study the relationships between them. We believe that MDPE will become a valuable resource for promoting research in the field of affective computing.

- **Summary**: Recently, large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated immense potential in zero-shot anomaly segmentation (ZSAS) task, utilizing a unified model to directly detect anomalies on any unseen product with painstakingly crafted text prompts. However, existing methods often assume that the product category to be inspected is known, thus setting product-specific text prompts, which is difficult to achieve in the data privacy scenarios. Moreover, even the same type of product exhibits significant differences due to specific components and variations in the production process, posing significant challenges to the design of text prompts. In this end, we propose a visual context prompting model (VCP-CLIP) for ZSAS task based on CLIP. The insight behind VCP-CLIP is to employ visual context prompting to activate CLIP's anomalous semantic perception ability. In specific, we first design a Pre-VCP module to embed global visual information into the text prompt, thus eliminating the necessity for product-specific prompts. Then, we propose a novel Post-VCP module, that adjusts the text embeddings utilizing the fine-grained features of the images. In extensive experiments conducted on 10 real-world industrial anomaly segmentation datasets, VCP-CLIP achieved state-of-the-art performance in ZSAS task. The code is available at https://github.com/xiaozhen228/VCP-CLIP.

- **Summary**: Online continual learning (OCL) involves deep neural networks retaining knowledge from old data while adapting to new data, which is accessible only once. A critical challenge in OCL is catastrophic forgetting, reflected in reduced model performance on old data. Existing replay-based methods mitigate forgetting by replaying buffered samples from old data and learning current samples of new data. In this work, we dissect existing methods and empirically discover that learning and replaying in the same feature space is not conducive to addressing the forgetting issue. Since the learned features associated with old data are readily changed by the features related to new data due to data imbalance, leading to the forgetting problem. Based on this observation, we intuitively explore learning and replaying in different feature spaces. Learning in a feature subspace is sufficient to capture novel knowledge from new data while replaying in a larger feature space provides more feature space to maintain historical knowledge from old data. To this end, we propose a novel OCL approach called experience replay with feature subspace learning (ER-FSL). Firstly, ER-FSL divides the entire feature space into multiple subspaces, with each subspace used to learn current samples. Moreover, it introduces a subspace reuse mechanism to address situations where no blank subspaces exist. Secondly, ER-FSL replays previous samples using an accumulated space comprising all learned subspaces. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of ER-FSL over various state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In the realm of ubiquitous computing, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is vital for the automation and intelligent identification of human actions through data from diverse sensors. However, traditional machine learning approaches by aggregating data on a central server and centralized processing are memory-intensive and raise privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a solution by training a global model collaboratively across multiple devices by exchanging their local model parameters instead of local data. However, in realistic settings, sensor data on devices is non-independently and identically distributed (Non-IID). This means that data activity recorded by most devices is sparse, and sensor data distribution for each client may be inconsistent. As a result, typical FL frameworks in heterogeneous environments suffer from slow convergence and poor performance due to deviation of the global model's objective from the global objective. Most FL methods applied to HAR are either designed for overly ideal scenarios without considering the Non-IID problem or present privacy and scalability concerns. This work addresses these challenges, proposing CDFL, an efficient federated learning framework for image-based HAR. CDFL efficiently selects a representative set of privacy-preserved images using contrastive learning and deep clustering, reduces communication overhead by selecting effective clients for global model updates, and improves global model quality by training on privacy-preserved data. Our comprehensive experiments carried out on three public datasets, namely Stanford40, PPMI, and VOC2012, demonstrate the superiority of CDFL in terms of performance, convergence rate, and bandwidth usage compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) by well-trained 2D diffusion models has shown great promise in text-to-3D generation. However, this paradigm distills view-agnostic 2D image distributions into the rendering distribution of 3D representation for each view independently, overlooking the coherence across views and yielding 3D inconsistency in generations. In this work, we propose \textbf{J}oint \textbf{S}core \textbf{D}istillation (JSD), a new paradigm that ensures coherent 3D generations. Specifically, we model the joint image distribution, which introduces an energy function to capture the coherence among denoised images from the diffusion model. We then derive the joint score distillation on multiple rendered views of the 3D representation, as opposed to a single view in SDS. In addition, we instantiate three universal view-aware models as energy functions, demonstrating compatibility with JSD. Empirically, JSD significantly mitigates the 3D inconsistency problem in SDS, while maintaining text congruence. Moreover, we introduce the Geometry Fading scheme and Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) Switching strategy to enhance generative details. Our framework, JointDreamer, establishes a new benchmark in text-to-3D generation, achieving outstanding results with an 88.5\% CLIP R-Precision and 27.7\% CLIP Score. These metrics demonstrate exceptional text congruence, as well as remarkable geometric consistency and texture fidelity.

- **Summary**: Targeted adversarial attack, which aims to mislead a model to recognize any image as a target object by imperceptible perturbations, has become a mainstream tool for vulnerability assessment of deep neural networks (DNNs). Since existing targeted attackers only learn to attack known target classes, they cannot generalize well to unknown classes. To tackle this issue, we propose $\bf{G}$eneralized $\bf{A}$dversarial attac$\bf{KER}$ ($\bf{GAKer}$), which is able to construct adversarial examples to any target class. The core idea behind GAKer is to craft a latently infected representation during adversarial example generation. To this end, the extracted latent representations of the target object are first injected into intermediate features of an input image in an adversarial generator. Then, the generator is optimized to ensure visual consistency with the input image while being close to the target object in the feature space. Since the GAKer is class-agnostic yet model-agnostic, it can be regarded as a general tool that not only reveals the vulnerability of more DNNs but also identifies deficiencies of DNNs in a wider range of classes. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method in generating adversarial examples for both known and unknown classes. Notably, compared with other generative methods, our method achieves an approximately $14.13\%$ higher attack success rate for unknown classes and an approximately $4.23\%$ higher success rate for known classes. Our code is available in https://github.com/VL-Group/GAKer.

- **Summary**: Perceiving the world as 3D occupancy supports embodied agents to avoid collision with any types of obstacle. While open-vocabulary image understanding has prospered recently, how to bind the predicted 3D occupancy grids with open-world semantics still remains under-explored due to limited open-world annotations. Hence, instead of building our model from scratch, we try to blend 2D foundation models, specifically a depth model MiDaS and a semantic model CLIP, to lift the semantics to 3D space, thus fulfilling 3D occupancy. However, building upon these foundation models is not trivial. First, the MiDaS faces the depth ambiguity problem, i.e., it only produces relative depth but fails to estimate bin depth for feature lifting. Second, the CLIP image features lack high-resolution pixel-level information, which limits the 3D occupancy accuracy. Third, open vocabulary is often trapped by the long-tail problem. To address these issues, we propose VEON for Vocabulary-Enhanced Occupancy predictioN by not only assembling but also adapting these foundation models. We first equip MiDaS with a Zoedepth head and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for relative-metric-bin depth transformation while reserving beneficial depth prior. Then, a lightweight side adaptor network is attached to the CLIP vision encoder to generate high-resolution features for fine-grained 3D occupancy prediction. Moreover, we design a class reweighting strategy to give priority to the tail classes. With only 46M trainable parameters and zero manual semantic labels, VEON achieves 15.14 mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes, and shows the capability of recognizing objects with open-vocabulary categories, meaning that our VEON is label-efficient, parameter-efficient, and precise enough.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based methods have garnered significant attention in remote sensing (RS) image compression due to their superior performance. Most of these methods focus on enhancing the coding capability of the compression network and improving entropy model prediction accuracy. However, they typically compress and decompress each image independently, ignoring the significant inter-image similarity prior. In this paper, we propose a codebook-based RS image compression (Code-RSIC) method with a generated discrete codebook, which is deployed at the decoding end of a compression algorithm to provide inter-image similarity prior. Specifically, we first pretrain a high-quality discrete codebook using the competitive generation model VQGAN. We then introduce a Transformer-based prediction model to align the latent features of the decoded images from an existing compression algorithm with the frozen high-quality codebook. Finally, we develop a hierarchical prior integration network (HPIN), which mainly consists of Transformer blocks and multi-head cross-attention modules (MCMs) that can query hierarchical prior from the codebook, thus enhancing the ability of the proposed method to decode texture-rich RS images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Code-RSIC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art traditional and learning-based image compression algorithms in terms of perception quality.

- **Summary**: Novel view synthesis from unconstrained in-the-wild image collections remains a significant yet challenging task due to photometric variations and transient occluders that complicate accurate scene reconstruction. Previous methods have approached these issues by integrating per-image appearance features embeddings in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers faster training and real-time rendering, adapting it for unconstrained image collections is non-trivial due to the substantially different architecture. In this paper, we introduce Splatfacto-W, an approach that integrates per-Gaussian neural color features and per-image appearance embeddings into the rasterization process, along with a spherical harmonics-based background model to represent varying photometric appearances and better depict backgrounds. Our key contributions include latent appearance modeling, efficient transient object handling, and precise background modeling. Splatfacto-W delivers high-quality, real-time novel view synthesis with improved scene consistency in in-the-wild scenarios. Our method improves the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) by an average of 5.3 dB compared to 3DGS, enhances training speed by 150 times compared to NeRF-based methods, and achieves a similar rendering speed to 3DGS.

- **Summary**: Fully-supervised monocular 3D hand reconstruction is often difficult because capturing the requisite 3D data entails deploying specialized equipment in a controlled environment. We introduce a weakly-supervised method that avoids such requirements by leveraging fundamental principles well-established in the understanding of the human hand's unique structure and functionality. Specifically, we systematically study hand knowledge from different sources, including biomechanics, functional anatomy, and physics. We effectively incorporate these valuable foundational insights into 3D hand reconstruction models through an appropriate set of differentiable training losses. This enables training solely with readily-obtainable 2D hand landmark annotations and eliminates the need for expensive 3D supervision. Moreover, we explicitly model the uncertainty that is inherent in image observations. We enhance the training process by exploiting a simple yet effective Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) loss that incorporates uncertainty into the loss function. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art weakly-supervised methods. For example, our method achieves nearly a 21\% performance improvement on the widely adopted FreiHAND dataset.

- **Summary**: In real-world scenarios, human actions often fall into a long-tailed distribution. It makes the existing skeleton-based action recognition works, which are mostly designed based on balanced datasets, suffer from a sharp performance degradation. Recently, many efforts have been madeto image/video long-tailed learning. However, directly applying them to skeleton data can be sub-optimal due to the lack of consideration of the crucial spatial-temporal motion patterns, especially for some modality-specific methodologies such as data augmentation. To this end, considering the crucial role of the body parts in the spatially concentrated human actions, we attend to the mixing augmentations and propose a novel method, Shap-Mix, which improves long-tailed learning by mining representative motion patterns for tail categories. Specifically, we first develop an effective spatial-temporal mixing strategy for the skeleton to boost representation quality. Then, the employed saliency guidance method is presented, consisting of the saliency estimation based on Shapley value and a tail-aware mixing policy. It preserves the salient motion parts of minority classes in mixed data, explicitly establishing the relationships between crucial body structure cues and high-level semantics. Extensive experiments on three large-scale skeleton datasets show our remarkable performance improvement under both long-tailed and balanced settings.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal embeddings form the foundation for vision-language models, such as CLIP embeddings, the most widely used text-image embeddings. However, these embeddings are vulnerable to subtle misalignment of cross-modal features, resulting in decreased model performance and diminished generalization. To address this problem, we design ModalChorus, an interactive system for visual probing and alignment of multi-modal embeddings. ModalChorus primarily offers a two-stage process: 1) embedding probing with Modal Fusion Map (MFM), a novel parametric dimensionality reduction method that integrates both metric and nonmetric objectives to enhance modality fusion; and 2) embedding alignment that allows users to interactively articulate intentions for both point-set and set-set alignments. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons for CLIP embeddings with existing dimensionality reduction (e.g., t-SNE and MDS) and data fusion (e.g., data context map) methods demonstrate the advantages of MFM in showcasing cross-modal features over common vision-language datasets. Case studies reveal that ModalChorus can facilitate intuitive discovery of misalignment and efficient re-alignment in scenarios ranging from zero-shot classification to cross-modal retrieval and generation.

- **Summary**: Scene Text Recognition (STR) methods have demonstrated robust performance in word-level text recognition. However, in applications the text image is sometimes long due to detected with multiple horizontal words. It triggers the requirement to build long text recognition models from readily available short word-level text datasets, which has been less studied previously. In this paper, we term this the Out of Length (OOL) text recognition. We establish a new Long Text Benchmark (LTB) to facilitate the assessment of different methods in long text recognition. Meanwhile, we propose a novel method called OOL Text Recognition with sub-String Matching (SMTR). SMTR comprises two cross-attention-based modules: one encodes a sub-string containing multiple characters into next and previous queries, and the other employs the queries to attend to the image features, matching the sub-string and simultaneously recognizing its next and previous character. SMTR can recognize text of arbitrary length by iterating the process above. To avoid being trapped in recognizing highly similar sub-strings, we introduce a regularization training to compel SMTR to effectively discover subtle differences between similar sub-strings for precise matching. In addition, we propose an inference augmentation to alleviate confusion caused by identical sub-strings and improve the overall recognition efficiency. Extensive experimental results reveal that SMTR, even when trained exclusively on short text, outperforms existing methods in public short text benchmarks and exhibits a clear advantage on LTB.

- **Summary**: Point cloud segmentation is crucial for robotic visual perception and environmental understanding, enabling applications such as robotic navigation and 3D reconstruction. However, handling the sparse and unordered nature of point cloud data presents challenges for efficient and accurate segmentation. Inspired by the Mamba model's success in natural language processing, we propose the Serialized Point Cloud Mamba Segmentation Model (Serialized Point Mamba), which leverages a state-space model to dynamically compress sequences, reduce memory usage, and enhance computational efficiency. Serialized Point Mamba integrates local-global modeling capabilities with linear complexity, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both indoor and outdoor datasets. This approach includes novel techniques such as staged point cloud sequence learning, grid pooling, and Conditional Positional Encoding, facilitating effective segmentation across diverse point cloud tasks. Our method achieved 76.8 mIoU on Scannet and 70.3 mIoU on S3DIS. In Scannetv2 instance segmentation, it recorded 40.0 mAP. It also had the lowest latency and reasonable memory use, making it the SOTA among point semantic segmentation models based on mamba.

- **Summary**: Recently, transformers have demonstrated great potential for modeling long-term dependencies from skeleton sequences and thereby gained ever-increasing attention in skeleton action recognition. However, the existing transformer-based approaches heavily rely on the naive attention mechanism for capturing the spatiotemporal features, which falls short in learning discriminative representations that exhibit similar motion patterns. To address this challenge, we introduce the Frequency-aware Mixed Transformer (FreqMixFormer), specifically designed for recognizing similar skeletal actions with subtle discriminative motions. First, we introduce a frequency-aware attention module to unweave skeleton frequency representations by embedding joint features into frequency attention maps, aiming to distinguish the discriminative movements based on their frequency coefficients. Subsequently, we develop a mixed transformer architecture to incorporate spatial features with frequency features to model the comprehensive frequency-spatial patterns. Additionally, a temporal transformer is proposed to extract the global correlations across frames. Extensive experiments show that FreqMiXFormer outperforms SOTA on 3 popular skeleton action recognition datasets, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based segmentation techniques have shown remarkable performance in brain segmentation, yet their success hinges on the availability of extensive labeled training data. Acquiring such vast datasets, however, poses a significant challenge in many clinical applications. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a novel 3D brain segmentation approach using complementary 2D diffusion models. The core idea behind our approach is to first mine 2D features with semantic information extracted from the 2D diffusion models by taking orthogonal views as input, followed by fusing them into a 3D contextual feature representation. Then, we use these aggregated features to train multi-layer perceptrons to classify the segmentation labels. Our goal is to achieve reliable segmentation quality without requiring complete labels for each individual subject. Our experiments on training in brain subcortical structure segmentation with a dataset from only one subject demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods. Further experiments on the minimum requirement of annotation by sparse labeling yield promising results even with only nine slices and a labeled background region.

- **Summary**: Large-scale diffusion models have made significant advancements in the field of image generation, especially through the use of cross-attention mechanisms that guide image formation based on textual descriptions. While the analysis of text-guided cross-attention in diffusion models has been extensively studied in recent years, its application in image-to-image diffusion models remains underexplored. This paper introduces the Image-to-Image Attribution Maps I2AM method, which aggregates patch-level cross-attention scores to enhance the interpretability of latent diffusion models across time steps, heads, and attention layers. I2AM facilitates detailed image-to-image attribution analysis, enabling observation of how diffusion models prioritize key features over time and head during the image generation process from reference images. Through extensive experiments, we first visualize the attribution maps of both generated and reference images, verifying that critical information from the reference image is effectively incorporated into the generated image, and vice versa. To further assess our understanding, we introduce a new evaluation metric tailored for reference-based image inpainting tasks. This metric, measuring the consistency between the attribution maps of generated and reference images, shows a strong correlation with established performance metrics for inpainting tasks, validating the potential use of I2AM in future research endeavors.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a new Segment Anything Model with Depth Perception (DSAM) for Camouflaged Object Detection (COD). DSAM exploits the zero-shot capability of SAM to realize precise segmentation in the RGB-D domain. It consists of the Prompt-Deeper Module and the Finer Module. The Prompt-Deeper Module utilizes knowledge distillation and the Bias Correction Module to achieve the interaction between RGB features and depth features, especially using depth features to correct erroneous parts in RGB features. Then, the interacted features are combined with the box prompt in SAM to create a prompt with depth perception. The Finer Module explores the possibility of accurately segmenting highly camouflaged targets from a depth perspective. It uncovers depth cues in areas missed by SAM through mask reversion, self-filtering, and self-attention operations, compensating for its defects in the COD domain. DSAM represents the first step towards the SAM-based RGB-D COD model. It maximizes the utilization of depth features while synergizing with RGB features to achieve multimodal complementarity, thereby overcoming the segmentation limitations of SAM and improving its accuracy in COD. Experimental results on COD benchmarks demonstrate that DSAM achieves excellent segmentation performance and reaches the state-of-the-art (SOTA) on COD benchmarks with less consumption of training resources.

- **Summary**: Predicting future trajectories for other road agents is an essential task for autonomous vehicles. Established trajectory prediction methods primarily use agent tracks generated by a detection and tracking system and HD map as inputs. In this work, we propose a novel method that also incorporates visual input from surround-view cameras, allowing the model to utilize visual cues such as human gazes and gestures, road conditions, vehicle turn signals, etc, which are typically hidden from the model in prior methods. Furthermore, we use textual descriptions generated by a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) as supervision during training to guide the model on what to learn from the input data. Despite using these extra inputs, our method achieves a latency of 53 ms, making it feasible for real-time processing, which is significantly faster than that of previous single-agent prediction methods with similar performance. Our experiments show that both the visual inputs and the textual descriptions contribute to improvements in trajectory prediction performance, and our qualitative analysis highlights how the model is able to exploit these additional inputs. Lastly, in this work we create and release the nuScenes-Text dataset, which augments the established nuScenes dataset with rich textual annotations for every scene, demonstrating the positive impact of utilizing VLM on trajectory prediction.

- **Summary**: The pre-trained vision and language (V\&L) models have substantially improved the performance of cross-modal image-text retrieval. In general, however, V\&L models have limited retrieval performance for small objects because of the rough alignment between words and the small objects in the image. In contrast, it is known that human cognition is object-centric, and we pay more attention to important objects, even if they are small. To bridge this gap between the human cognition and the V\&L model's capability, we propose a cross-modal image-text retrieval framework based on ``object-aware query perturbation.'' The proposed method generates a key feature subspace of the detected objects and perturbs the corresponding queries using this subspace to improve the object awareness in the image. In our proposed method, object-aware cross-modal image-text retrieval is possible while keeping the rich expressive power and retrieval performance of existing V\&L models without additional fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets show that our method outperforms conventional algorithms.

- **Summary**: This paper tackles the simultaneous optimization of pose and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Departing from the conventional practice of using explicit global representations for camera pose, we propose a novel overparameterized representation that models camera poses as learnable rigid warp functions. We establish that modeling the rigid warps must be tightly coupled with constraints and regularization imposed. Specifically, we highlight the critical importance of enforcing invertibility when learning rigid warp functions via neural network and propose the use of an Invertible Neural Network (INN) coupled with a geometry-informed constraint for this purpose. We present results on synthetic and real-world datasets, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines in terms of pose estimation and high-fidelity reconstruction due to enhanced optimization convergence.

- **Summary**: We introduce a layout similarity measure designed to evaluate the results of layout generation. While several similarity measures have been proposed in prior research, there has been a lack of comprehensive discussion about their behaviors. Our research uncovers that the majority of these measures are unable to handle various layout differences, primarily due to their dependencies on strict element matching, that is one-by-one matching of elements within the same category. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new similarity measure based on optimal transport, which facilitates a more flexible matching of elements. This approach allows us to quantify the similarity between any two layouts even those sharing no element categories, making our measure highly applicable to a wide range of layout generation tasks. For tasks such as unconditional layout generation, where FID is commonly used, we also extend our measure to deal with collection-level similarities between groups of layouts. The empirical result suggests that our collection-level measure offers more reliable comparisons than existing ones like FID and Max.IoU.

- **Summary**: Recently, large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising results on document visual question answering (VQA) task, particularly after training on document instruction datasets. An effective evaluation method for document instruction data is crucial in constructing instruction data with high efficacy, which, in turn, facilitates the training of LLMs and MLLMs for document VQA. However, most existing evaluation methods for instruction data are limited to the textual content of the instructions themselves, thereby hindering the effective assessment of document instruction datasets and constraining their construction. In this paper, we propose ProcTag, a data-oriented method that assesses the efficacy of document instruction data. ProcTag innovatively performs tagging on the execution process of instructions rather than the instruction text itself. By leveraging the diversity and complexity of these tags to assess the efficacy of the given dataset, ProcTag enables selective sampling or filtering of document instructions. Furthermore, DocLayPrompt, a novel semi-structured layout-aware document prompting strategy, is proposed for effectively representing documents. Experiments demonstrate that sampling existing open-sourced and generated document VQA/instruction datasets with ProcTag significantly outperforms current methods for evaluating instruction data. Impressively, with ProcTag-based sampling in the generated document datasets, only 30.5\% of the document instructions are required to achieve 100\% efficacy compared to the complete dataset. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/AdvancedLiterateMachinery/tree/main/DocumentUnderstanding/ProcTag.

- **Summary**: Capitalizing on the remarkable advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a burgeoning initiative to harness LLMs for instruction following robotic navigation. Such a trend underscores the potential of LLMs to generalize navigational reasoning and diverse language understanding. However, a significant discrepancy in agent performance is observed when integrating LLMs in the Vision-and-Language navigation (VLN) tasks compared to previous downstream specialist models. Furthermore, the inherent capacity of language to interpret and facilitate communication in agent interactions is often underutilized in these integrations. In this work, we strive to bridge the divide between VLN-specialized models and LLM-based navigation paradigms, while maintaining the interpretative prowess of LLMs in generating linguistic navigational reasoning. By aligning visual content in a frozen LLM, we encompass visual observation comprehension for LLMs and exploit a way to incorporate LLMs and navigation policy networks for effective action predictions and navigational reasoning. We demonstrate the data efficiency of the proposed methods and eliminate the gap between LM-based agents and state-of-the-art VLN specialists.

- **Summary**: Generating human-object interactions (HOIs) is critical with the tremendous advances of digital avatars. Existing datasets are typically limited to humans interacting with a single object while neglecting the ubiquitous manipulation of multiple objects. Thus, we propose HIMO, a large-scale MoCap dataset of full-body human interacting with multiple objects, containing 3.3K 4D HOI sequences and 4.08M 3D HOI frames. We also annotate HIMO with detailed textual descriptions and temporal segments, benchmarking two novel tasks of HOI synthesis conditioned on either the whole text prompt or the segmented text prompts as fine-grained timeline control. To address these novel tasks, we propose a dual-branch conditional diffusion model with a mutual interaction module for HOI synthesis. Besides, an auto-regressive generation pipeline is also designed to obtain smooth transitions between HOI segments. Experimental results demonstrate the generalization ability to unseen object geometries and temporal compositions.

- **Summary**: Class-incremental continual learning is an important area of research, as static deep learning methods fail to adapt to changing tasks and data distributions. In previous works, promising results were achieved using replay and compressed replay techniques. In the field of regular replay, GDumb achieved outstanding results but requires a large amount of memory. This problem can be addressed by compressed replay techniques. The goal of this work is to evaluate compressed replay in the pipeline of GDumb. We propose FETCH, a two-stage compression approach. First, the samples from the continual datastream are encoded by the early layers of a pre-trained neural network. Second, the samples are compressed before being stored in the episodic memory. Following GDumb, the remaining classification head is trained from scratch using only the decompressed samples from the reply memory. We evaluate FETCH in different scenarios and show that this approach can increase accuracy on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. In our experiments, simple compression methods (e.g., quantization of tensors) outperform deep autoencoders. In the future, FETCH could serve as a baseline for benchmarking compressed replay learning in constrained memory scenarios.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models are among the most effective methods for image generation. This is in particular because, unlike GANs, they can be easily conditioned during training to produce elements with desired class or properties. However, guiding a pre-trained diffusion model to generate elements from previously unlabeled data is significantly more challenging. One of the possible solutions was given by the ADM-G guiding approach. Although ADM-G successfully generates elements from the given class, there is a significant quality gap compared to a model originally conditioned on this class. In particular, the FID score obtained by the ADM-G-guided diffusion model is nearly three times lower than the class-conditioned guidance. We demonstrate that this issue is partly due to ADM-G providing minimal guidance during the final stage of the denoising process. To address this problem, we propose GeoGuide, a guidance model based on tracing the distance of the diffusion model's trajectory from the data manifold. The main idea of GeoGuide is to produce normalized adjustments during the backward denoising process. As shown in the experiments, GeoGuide surpasses the probabilistic approach ADM-G with respect to both the FID scores and the quality of the generated images.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image models encounter safety issues, including concerns related to copyright and Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. Despite several methods have been proposed for erasing inappropriate concepts from diffusion models, they often exhibit incomplete erasure, consume a lot of computing resources, and inadvertently damage generation ability. In this work, we introduce Reliable and Efficient Concept Erasure (RECE), a novel approach that modifies the model in 3 seconds without necessitating additional fine-tuning. Specifically, RECE efficiently leverages a closed-form solution to derive new target embeddings, which are capable of regenerating erased concepts within the unlearned model. To mitigate inappropriate content potentially represented by derived embeddings, RECE further aligns them with harmless concepts in cross-attention layers. The derivation and erasure of new representation embeddings are conducted iteratively to achieve a thorough erasure of inappropriate concepts. Besides, to preserve the model's generation ability, RECE introduces an additional regularization term during the derivation process, resulting in minimizing the impact on unrelated concepts during the erasure process. All the processes above are in closed-form, guaranteeing extremely efficient erasure in only 3 seconds. Benchmarking against previous approaches, our method achieves more efficient and thorough erasure with minor damage to original generation ability and demonstrates enhanced robustness against red-teaming tools.

- **Summary**: 3D point cloud segmentation has received significant interest for its growing applications. However, the generalization ability of models suffers in dynamic scenarios due to the distribution shift between test and training data. To promote robustness and adaptability across diverse scenarios, test-time adaptation (TTA) has recently been introduced. Nevertheless, most existing TTA methods are developed for images, and limited approaches applicable to point clouds ignore the inherent hierarchical geometric structures in point cloud streams, i.e., local (point-level), global (object-level), and temporal (frame-level) structures. In this paper, we delve into TTA in 3D point cloud segmentation and propose a novel Hierarchical Geometry Learning (HGL) framework. HGL comprises three complementary modules from local, global to temporal learning in a bottom-up manner.Technically, we first construct a local geometry learning module for pseudo-label generation. Next, we build prototypes from the global geometry perspective for pseudo-label fine-tuning. Furthermore, we introduce a temporal consistency regularization module to mitigate negative transfer. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our HGL. Remarkably, on the SynLiDAR to SemanticKITTI task, HGL achieves an overall mIoU of 46.91\%, improving GIPSO by 3.0\% and significantly reducing the required adaptation time by 80\%.

- **Summary**: We present our contribution to the 7th ABAW challenge at ECCV 2024, by utilizing a Dual-Direction Attention Mixed Feature Network for multitask facial expression recognition we achieve results far beyond the proposed baseline for the Multi-Task ABAW challenge. Our proposal uses the well-known DDAMFN architecture as base to effectively predict valence-arousal, emotion recognition, and action units. We demonstrate the architecture ability to handle these tasks simultaneously, providing insights into its architecture and the rationale behind its design. Additionally, we compare our results for a multitask solution with independent single-task performance.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in implicit scene representation enable high-fidelity street view novel view synthesis. However, existing methods optimize a neural radiance field for each scene, relying heavily on dense training images and extensive computation resources. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce a new method called Efficient Depth-Guided Urban View Synthesis (EDUS) for fast feed-forward inference and efficient per-scene fine-tuning. Different from prior generalizable methods that infer geometry based on feature matching, EDUS leverages noisy predicted geometric priors as guidance to enable generalizable urban view synthesis from sparse input images. The geometric priors allow us to apply our generalizable model directly in the 3D space, gaining robustness across various sparsity levels. Through comprehensive experiments on the KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets, we demonstrate promising generalization abilities on novel street scenes. Moreover, our results indicate that EDUS achieves state-of-the-art performance in sparse view settings when combined with fast test-time optimization.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a practical approach for the optimization of topological simplification, a central pre-processing step for the analysis and visualization of scalar data. Given an input scalar field f and a set of "signal" persistence pairs to maintain, our approach produces an output field g that is close to f and which optimizes (i) the cancellation of "non-signal" pairs, while (ii) preserving the "signal" pairs. In contrast to pre-existing simplification algorithms, our approach is not restricted to persistence pairs involving extrema and can thus address a larger class of topological features, in particular saddle pairs in three-dimensional scalar data. Our approach leverages recent generic persistence optimization frameworks and extends them with tailored accelerations specific to the problem of topological simplification. Extensive experiments report substantial accelerations over these frameworks, thereby making topological simplification optimization practical for real-life datasets. Our approach enables a direct visualization and analysis of the topologically simplified data, e.g., via isosurfaces of simplified topology (fewer components and handles). We apply our approach to the extraction of prominent filament structures in three-dimensional data. Specifically, we show that our pre-simplification of the data leads to practical improvements over standard topological techniques for removing filament loops. We also show how our approach can be used to repair genus defects in surface processing. Finally, we provide a C++ implementation for reproducibility purposes.

- **Summary**: Identifying the relevant input features that have a critical influence on the output results is indispensable for the development of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Remove-and-Retrain (ROAR) is a widely accepted approach for assessing the importance of individual pixels by measuring changes in accuracy following their removal and subsequent retraining of the modified dataset. However, we uncover notable limitations in pixel-perturbation strategies. When viewed from a geometric perspective, we discover that these metrics fail to discriminate between differences among feature attribution methods, thereby compromising the reliability of the evaluation. To address this challenge, we introduce an alternative feature-perturbation approach named Geometric Remove-and-Retrain (GOAR). Through a series of experiments with both synthetic and real datasets, we substantiate that GOAR transcends the limitations of pixel-centric metrics.

- **Summary**: The increasing necessity for fisheye cameras in fields such as robotics and autonomous driving has led to the proposal of various fisheye camera models. While the evolution of camera models has facilitated the development of diverse systems in the field, the lack of adaptation between different fisheye camera models means that recalibration is always necessary, which is cumbersome. This paper introduces a conversion tool for various previously proposed fisheye camera models. It is user-friendly, simple, yet extremely fast and accurate, offering conversion capabilities for a broader range of models compared to existing tools. We have verified that models converted using our system perform correctly in applications such as SLAM. By utilizing our system, researchers can obtain output parameters directly from input parameters without the need for an image set and any recalibration processes, thus serving as a bridge across different fisheye camera models in various research fields. We provide our system as an open source tool available at: https://github.com/eowjd0512/fisheye-calib-adapter

- **Summary**: Visual SLAM is a key technology for many autonomous systems. However, tracking loss can lead to the creation of disjoint submaps in multimap SLAM systems like ORB-SLAM3. Because of that, these systems employ submap merging strategies. As we show, these strategies are not always successful. In this paper, we investigate the impact of using modern VPR approaches for submap merging in visual SLAM. We argue that classical evaluation metrics are not sufficient to estimate the impact of a modern VPR component on the overall system. We show that naively replacing the VPR component does not leverage its full potential without requiring substantial interference in the original system. Because of that, we present a post-processing pipeline along with a set of metrics that allow us to estimate the impact of modern VPR components. We evaluate our approach on the NCLT and Newer College datasets using ORB-SLAM3 with NetVLAD and HDC-DELF as VPR components. Additionally, we present a simple approach for combining VPR with temporal consistency for map merging. We show that the map merging performance of ORB-SLAM3 can be improved. Building on these results, researchers in VPR can assess the potential of their approaches for SLAM systems.

- **Summary**: In the domain of anomaly detection, methods often excel in either high-level semantic or low-level industrial benchmarks, rarely achieving cross-domain proficiency. Semantic anomalies are novelties that differ in meaning from the training set, like unseen objects in self-driving cars. In contrast, industrial anomalies are subtle defects that preserve semantic meaning, such as cracks in airplane components. In this paper, we present GeneralAD, an anomaly detection framework designed to operate in semantic, near-distribution, and industrial settings with minimal per-task adjustments. In our approach, we capitalize on the inherent design of Vision Transformers, which are trained on image patches, thereby ensuring that the last hidden states retain a patch-based structure. We propose a novel self-supervised anomaly generation module that employs straightforward operations like noise addition and shuffling to patch features to construct pseudo-abnormal samples. These features are fed to an attention-based discriminator, which is trained to score every patch in the image. With this, our method can both accurately identify anomalies at the image level and also generate interpretable anomaly maps. We extensively evaluated our approach on ten datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in six and on-par performance in the remaining for both localization and detection tasks.

- **Summary**: Most existing Low-light Image Enhancement (LLIE) methods either directly map Low-Light (LL) to Normal-Light (NL) images or use semantic or illumination maps as guides. However, the ill-posed nature of LLIE and the difficulty of semantic retrieval from impaired inputs limit these methods, especially in extremely low-light conditions. To address this issue, we present a new LLIE network via Generative LAtent feature based codebook REtrieval (GLARE), in which the codebook prior is derived from undegraded NL images using a Vector Quantization (VQ) strategy. More importantly, we develop a generative Invertible Latent Normalizing Flow (I-LNF) module to align the LL feature distribution to NL latent representations, guaranteeing the correct code retrieval in the codebook. In addition, a novel Adaptive Feature Transformation (AFT) module, featuring an adjustable function for users and comprising an Adaptive Mix-up Block (AMB) along with a dual-decoder architecture, is devised to further enhance fidelity while preserving the realistic details provided by codebook prior. Extensive experiments confirm the superior performance of GLARE on various benchmark datasets and real-world data. Its effectiveness as a preprocessing tool in low-light object detection tasks further validates GLARE for high-level vision applications. Code is released at https://github.com/LowLevelAI/GLARE.

- **Summary**: Existing 3D human object interaction (HOI) datasets and models simply align global descriptions with the long HOI sequence, while lacking a detailed understanding of intermediate states and the transitions between states. In this paper, we argue that fine-grained semantic alignment, which utilizes state-level descriptions, offers a promising paradigm for learning semantically rich HOI representations. To achieve this, we introduce Semantic-HOI, a new dataset comprising over 20K paired HOI states with fine-grained descriptions for each HOI state and the body movements that happen between two consecutive states. Leveraging the proposed dataset, we design three state-level HOI tasks to accomplish fine-grained semantic alignment within the HOI sequence. Additionally, we propose a unified model called F-HOI, designed to leverage multimodal instructions and empower the Multi-modal Large Language Model to efficiently handle diverse HOI tasks. F-HOI offers multiple advantages: (1) It employs a unified task formulation that supports the use of versatile multimodal inputs. (2) It maintains consistency in HOI across 2D, 3D, and linguistic spaces. (3) It utilizes fine-grained textual supervision for direct optimization, avoiding intricate modeling of HOI states. Extensive experiments reveal that F-HOI effectively aligns HOI states with fine-grained semantic descriptions, adeptly tackling understanding, reasoning, generation, and reconstruction tasks.

- **Summary**: Despite the success of large-scale pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) especially CLIP in various open-vocabulary tasks, their application to semantic segmentation remains challenging, producing noisy segmentation maps with mis-segmented regions. In this paper, we carefully re-investigate the architecture of CLIP, and identify residual connections as the primary source of noise that degrades segmentation quality. With a comparative analysis of statistical properties in the residual connection and the attention output across different pretrained models, we discover that CLIP's image-text contrastive training paradigm emphasizes global features at the expense of local discriminability, leading to noisy segmentation results. In response, we propose ClearCLIP, a novel approach that decomposes CLIP's representations to enhance open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. We introduce three simple modifications to the final layer: removing the residual connection, implementing the self-self attention, and discarding the feed-forward network. ClearCLIP consistently generates clearer and more accurate segmentation maps and outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks, affirming the significance of our discoveries.

- **Summary**: Adversarial training (AT) has become an effective defense method against adversarial examples (AEs) and it is typically framed as a bi-level optimization problem. Among various AT methods, fast AT (FAT), which employs a single-step attack strategy to guide the training process, can achieve good robustness against adversarial attacks at a low cost. However, FAT methods suffer from the catastrophic overfitting problem, especially on complex tasks or with large-parameter models. In this work, we propose a FAT method termed FGSM-PCO, which mitigates catastrophic overfitting by averting the collapse of the inner optimization problem in the bi-level optimization process. FGSM-PCO generates current-stage AEs from the historical AEs and incorporates them into the training process using an adaptive mechanism. This mechanism determines an appropriate fusion ratio according to the performance of the AEs on the training model. Coupled with a loss function tailored to the training framework, FGSM-PCO can alleviate catastrophic overfitting and help the recovery of an overfitted model to effective training. We evaluate our algorithm across three models and three datasets to validate its effectiveness. Comparative empirical studies against other FAT algorithms demonstrate that our proposed method effectively addresses unresolved overfitting issues in existing algorithms.

- **Summary**: Limited training data and severe class imbalance pose significant challenges to developing clinically robust deep learning models. Federated learning (FL) addresses the former by enabling different medical clients to collaboratively train a deep model without sharing privacy-sensitive data. However, class imbalance worsens due to variation in inter-client class distribution. We propose federated learning with non-parametric regularization (FedNPR and FedNPR-Per, a personalized version of FedNPR) to regularize the feature extractor and enhance useful and discriminative signal in the feature space. Our extensive experiments show that FedNPR outperform the existing state-of-the art FL approaches in class imbalance skin lesion classification and intracranial hemorrhage identification. Additionally, the non-parametric regularization module consistently improves the performance of existing state-of-the-art FL approaches. We believe that NPR is a valuable tool in FL under clinical settings.

- **Summary**: Despite the substantial progress in deep learning, its adoption in industrial robotics projects remains limited, primarily due to challenges in data acquisition and labeling. Previous sim2real approaches using domain randomization require extensive scene and model optimization. To address these issues, we introduce an innovative physically-based structured light simulation system, generating both RGB and physically realistic depth images, surpassing previous dataset generation tools. We create an RGBD dataset tailored for robotic industrial grasping scenarios and evaluate it across various tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, and embedding sim2real visual perception in industrial robotic grasping. By reducing the sim2real gap and enhancing deep learning training, we facilitate the application of deep learning models in industrial settings.

- **Summary**: Fine-grained recognition involves the classification of images from subordinate macro-categories, and it is challenging due to small inter-class differences. To overcome this, most methods perform discriminative feature selection enabled by a feature extraction backbone followed by a high-level feature refinement step. Recently, many studies have shown the potential behind vision transformers as a backbone for fine-grained recognition, but their usage of its attention mechanism to select discriminative tokens can be computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a novel and computationally inexpensive metric to identify discriminative regions in an image. We compare the similarity between the global representation of an image given by the CLS token, a learnable token used by transformers for classification, and the local representation of individual patches. We select the regions with the highest similarity to obtain crops, which are forwarded through the same transformer encoder. Finally, high-level features of the original and cropped representations are further refined together in order to make more robust predictions. Through extensive experimental evaluation we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, obtaining favorable results in terms of accuracy across a variety of datasets. Furthermore, our method achieves these results at a much lower computational cost compared to the alternatives. Code and checkpoints are available at: \url{https://github.com/arkel23/GLSim}.

- **Summary**: The labor-intensive labeling for semantic segmentation has spurred the emergence of Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation. Recent studies utilize patch-wise contrastive learning based on features from image-level self-supervised pretrained models. However, relying solely on similarity-based supervision from image-level pretrained models often leads to unreliable guidance due to insufficient patch-level semantic representations. To address this, we propose a Progressive Proxy Anchor Propagation (PPAP) strategy. This method gradually identifies more trustworthy positives for each anchor by relocating its proxy to regions densely populated with semantically similar samples. Specifically, we initially establish a tight boundary to gather a few reliable positive samples around each anchor. Then, considering the distribution of positive samples, we relocate the proxy anchor towards areas with a higher concentration of positives and adjust the positiveness boundary based on the propagation degree of the proxy anchor. Moreover, to account for ambiguous regions where positive and negative samples may coexist near the positiveness boundary, we introduce an instance-wise ambiguous zone. Samples within these zones are excluded from the negative set, further enhancing the reliability of the negative set. Our state-of-the-art performances on various datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) methods rely on healthy data distributions to identify anomalies as outliers. In brain MRI, a common approach is reconstruction-based UAD, where generative models reconstruct healthy brain MRIs, and anomalies are detected as deviations between input and reconstruction. However, this method is sensitive to imperfect reconstructions, leading to false positives that impede the segmentation. To address this limitation, we construct multiple reconstructions with probabilistic diffusion models. We then analyze the resulting distribution of these reconstructions using the Mahalanobis distance to identify anomalies as outliers. By leveraging information about normal variations and covariance of individual pixels within this distribution, we effectively refine anomaly scoring, leading to improved segmentation. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial performance improvements across various data sets. Specifically, compared to relying solely on single reconstructions, our approach achieves relative improvements of 15.9%, 35.4%, 48.0%, and 4.7% in terms of AUPRC for the BRATS21, ATLAS, MSLUB and WMH data sets, respectively.

- **Summary**: We present SENC, a novel self-supervised neural cloth simulator that addresses the challenge of cloth self-collision. This problem has remained unresolved due to the gap in simulation setup between recent collision detection and response approaches and self-supervised neural simulators. The former requires collision-free initial setups, while the latter necessitates random cloth instantiation during training. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel loss based on Global Intersection Analysis (GIA). This loss extracts the volume surrounded by the cloth region that forms the penetration. By constructing an energy based on this volume, our self-supervised neural simulator can effectively address cloth self-collisions. Moreover, we develop a self-collision-aware graph neural network capable of learning to handle self-collisions, even for parts that are topologically distant from one another. Additionally, we introduce an effective external force scheme that enables the simulation to learn the cloth's behavior in response to random external forces. We validate the efficacy of SENC through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, demonstrating that it effectively reduces cloth self-collision while maintaining high-quality animation results.

- **Summary**: Over the past decade, the technology used by referees in football has improved substantially, enhancing the fairness and accuracy of decisions. This progress has culminated in the implementation of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), an innovation that enables backstage referees to review incidents on the pitch from multiple points of view. However, the VAR is currently limited to professional leagues due to its expensive infrastructure and the lack of referees worldwide. In this paper, we present the semi-automated Video Assistant Referee System (VARS) that leverages the latest findings in multi-view video analysis. VARS sets a new state-of-the-art on the SoccerNet-MVFoul dataset, a multi-view video dataset of football fouls. Our VARS achieves a new state-of-the-art on the SoccerNet-MVFoul dataset by recognizing the type of foul in 50% of instances and the appropriate sanction in 46% of cases. Finally, we conducted a comparative study to investigate human performance in classifying fouls and their corresponding severity and compared these findings to our VARS. The results of our study highlight the potential of our VARS to reach human performance and support football refereeing across all levels of professional and amateur federations.

- **Summary**: We tackle the novel class discovery in point cloud segmentation, which discovers novel classes based on the semantic knowledge of seen classes. Existing work proposes an online point-wise clustering method with a simplified equal class-size constraint on the novel classes to avoid degenerate solutions. However, the inherent imbalanced distribution of novel classes in point clouds typically violates the equal class-size constraint. Moreover, point-wise clustering ignores the rich spatial context information of objects, which results in less expressive representation for semantic segmentation. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel self-labeling strategy that adaptively generates high-quality pseudo-labels for imbalanced classes during model training. In addition, we develop a dual-level representation that incorporates regional consistency into the point-level classifier learning, reducing noise in generated segmentation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two widely used datasets, SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS, and the results show our method outperforms the state of the art by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Perception is essential for autonomous driving system. Recent approaches based on Bird's-eye-view (BEV) and deep learning have made significant progress. However, there exists challenging issues including lengthy development cycles, poor reusability, and complex sensor setups in perception algorithm development process. To tackle the above challenges, this paper proposes a novel hierarchical Bird's-eye-view (BEV) perception paradigm, aiming to provide a library of fundamental perception modules and user-friendly graphical interface, enabling swift construction of customized models. We conduct the Pretrain-Finetune strategy to effectively utilize large scale public datasets and streamline development processes. Specifically, we present a Multi-Module Learning (MML) approach, enhancing performance through synergistic and iterative training of multiple models. Extensive experimental results on the Nuscenes dataset demonstrate that our approach renders significant improvement over the traditional training method.

- **Summary**: Distribution shifts between training and test data are all but inevitable over the lifecycle of a deployed model and lead to performance decay. Adapting the model can hopefully mitigate this drop in performance. Yet, adaptation is challenging since it must be unsupervised: we usually do not have access to any labeled data at test time. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic state-space model that can adapt a deployed model subjected to distribution drift. Our model learns the dynamics induced by distribution shifts on the last set of hidden features. Without requiring labels, we infer time-evolving class prototypes that serve as a dynamic classification head. Moreover, our approach is lightweight, modifying only the model's last linear layer. In experiments on real-world distribution shifts and synthetic corruptions, we demonstrate that our approach performs competitively with methods that require back-propagation and access to the model backbone. Our model especially excels in the case of small test batches - the most difficult setting.

- **Summary**: The linguistic capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are critical for their effective application across diverse tasks. This study aims to evaluate the performance of MLLMs on the VALSE benchmark, focusing on the efficacy of few-shot In-Context Learning (ICL), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of state-of-the-art MLLMs, varying in model size and pretraining datasets. The experimental results reveal that ICL and CoT prompting significantly boost model performance, particularly in tasks requiring complex reasoning and contextual understanding. Models pretrained on captioning datasets show superior zero-shot performance, while those trained on interleaved image-text data benefit from few-shot learning. Our findings provide valuable insights into optimizing MLLMs for better grounding of language in visual contexts, highlighting the importance of the composition of pretraining data and the potential of few-shot learning strategies to improve the reasoning abilities of MLLMs.

- **Summary**: Audio-driven emotional 3D face animation aims to generate emotionally expressive talking heads with synchronized lip movements. However, previous research has often overlooked the influence of diverse emotions on facial expressions or proved unsuitable for driving MetaHuman models. In response to this deficiency, we introduce EmoFace, a novel audio-driven methodology for creating facial animations with vivid emotional dynamics. Our approach can generate facial expressions with multiple emotions, and has the ability to generate random yet natural blinks and eye movements, while maintaining accurate lip synchronization. We propose independent speech encoders and emotion encoders to learn the relationship between audio, emotion and corresponding facial controller rigs, and finally map into the sequence of controller values. Additionally, we introduce two post-processing techniques dedicated to enhancing the authenticity of the animation, particularly in blinks and eye movements. Furthermore, recognizing the scarcity of emotional audio-visual data suitable for MetaHuman model manipulation, we contribute an emotional audio-visual dataset and derive control parameters for each frames. Our proposed methodology can be applied in producing dialogues animations of non-playable characters (NPCs) in video games, and driving avatars in virtual reality environments. Our further quantitative and qualitative experiments, as well as an user study comparing with existing researches show that our approach demonstrates superior results in driving 3D facial models.

- **Summary**: The rapid expansion of multimedia content has made accurately retrieving relevant videos from large collections increasingly challenging. Recent advancements in text-video retrieval have focused on cross-modal interactions, large-scale foundation model training, and probabilistic modeling, yet often neglect the crucial user perspective, leading to discrepancies between user queries and the content retrieved. To address this, we introduce MERLIN (Multimodal Embedding Refinement via LLM-based Iterative Navigation), a novel, training-free pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for iterative feedback learning. MERLIN refines query embeddings from a user perspective, enhancing alignment between queries and video content through a dynamic question answering process. Experimental results on datasets like MSR-VTT, MSVD, and ActivityNet demonstrate that MERLIN substantially improves Recall@1, outperforming existing systems and confirming the benefits of integrating LLMs into multimodal retrieval systems for more responsive and context-aware multimedia retrieval.

- **Summary**: Current deep learning-based low-light image enhancement methods often struggle with high-resolution images, and fail to meet the practical demands of visual perception across diverse and unseen scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach termed CoLIE, which redefines the enhancement process through mapping the 2D coordinates of an underexposed image to its illumination component, conditioned on local context. We propose a reconstruction of enhanced-light images within the HSV space utilizing an implicit neural function combined with an embedded guided filter, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, we introduce a single image-based training loss function to enhance the model's adaptability to various scenes, further enhancing its practical applicability. Through rigorous evaluations, we analyze the properties of our proposed framework, demonstrating its superiority in both image quality and scene adaptability. Furthermore, our evaluation extends to applications in downstream tasks within low-light scenarios, underscoring the practical utility of CoLIE.

- **Summary**: Gait recognition is a biometric technology that distinguishes individuals by their walking patterns. However, previous methods face challenges when accurately extracting identity features because they often become entangled with non-identity clues. To address this challenge, we propose CLTD, a causality-inspired discriminative feature learning module designed to effectively eliminate the influence of confounders in triple domains, \ie, spatial, temporal, and spectral. Specifically, we utilize the Cross Pixel-wise Attention Generator (CPAG) to generate attention distributions for factual and counterfactual features in spatial and temporal domains. Then, we introduce the Fourier Projection Head (FPH) to project spatial features into the spectral space, which preserves essential information while reducing computational costs. Additionally, we employ an optimization method with contrastive learning to enforce semantic consistency constraints across sequences from the same subject. Our approach has demonstrated significant performance improvements on challenging datasets, proving its effectiveness. Moreover, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing gait recognition methods.

- **Summary**: Diffusion probabilistic models have recently achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality images. However, balancing high perceptual quality and low distortion remains challenging in image compression applications. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Uncertainty-Guided image compression approach with wavelet Diffusion (UGDiff). Our approach focuses on high frequency compression via the wavelet transform, since high frequency components are crucial for reconstructing image details. We introduce a wavelet conditional diffusion model for high frequency prediction, followed by a residual codec that compresses and transmits prediction residuals to the decoder. This diffusion prediction-then-residual compression paradigm effectively addresses the low fidelity issue common in direct reconstructions by existing diffusion models. Considering the uncertainty from the random sampling of the diffusion model, we further design an uncertainty-weighted rate-distortion (R-D) loss tailored for residual compression, providing a more rational trade-off between rate and distortion. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of UGDiff, surpassing state-of-the-art image compression methods in R-D performance, perceptual quality, subjective quality, and inference time.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a reservoir computing-based and directed graph analysis pipeline. The goal of this pipeline is to define an efficient brain representation for connectivity in stroke data derived from magnetic resonance imaging. Ultimately, this representation is used within a directed graph convolutional architecture and investigated with explainable artificial intelligence (AI) tools.   Stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide, and it demands precise diagnostic tools for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. Neuroimaging data, with their rich structural and functional information, provide a fertile ground for biomarker discovery. However, the complexity and variability of information flow in the brain requires advanced analysis, especially if we consider the case of disrupted networks as those given by the brain connectome of stroke patients. To address the needs given by this complex scenario we proposed an end-to-end pipeline. This pipeline begins with reservoir computing causality, to define effective connectivity of the brain. This allows directed graph network representations which have not been fully investigated so far by graph convolutional network classifiers. Indeed, the pipeline subsequently incorporates a classification module to categorize the effective connectivity (directed graphs) of brain networks of patients versus matched healthy control. The classification led to an area under the curve of 0.69 with the given heterogeneous dataset. Thanks to explainable tools, an interpretation of disrupted networks across the brain networks was possible. This elucidates the effective connectivity biomarker's contribution to stroke classification, fostering insights into disease mechanisms and treatment responses.

- **Summary**: In real-world scenarios, where knowledge distributions exhibit long-tail. Humans manage to master knowledge uniformly across imbalanced distributions, a feat attributed to their diligent practices of reviewing, summarizing, and correcting errors. Motivated by this learning process, we propose a novel learning paradigm, called reflecting learning, in handling long-tail recognition. Our method integrates three processes for reviewing past predictions during training, summarizing and leveraging the feature relation across classes, and correcting gradient conflict for loss functions. These designs are lightweight enough to plug and play with existing long-tail learning methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in popular long-tail visual benchmarks. The experimental results highlight the great potential of reflecting learning in dealing with long-tail recognition.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising advancements in general visual and language understanding. However, the representation of multimodal information using MLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a new framework, E5-V, designed to adapt MLLMs for achieving universal multimodal embeddings. Our findings highlight the significant potential of MLLMs in representing multimodal inputs compared to previous approaches. By leveraging MLLMs with prompts, E5-V effectively bridges the modality gap between different types of inputs, demonstrating strong performance in multimodal embeddings even without fine-tuning. We propose a single modality training approach for E5-V, where the model is trained exclusively on text pairs. This method demonstrates significant improvements over traditional multimodal training on image-text pairs, while reducing training costs by approximately 95%. Additionally, this approach eliminates the need for costly multimodal training data collection. Extensive experiments across four types of tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of E5-V. As a universal multimodal model, E5-V not only achieves but often surpasses state-of-the-art performance in each task, despite being trained on a single modality.

First, to confirm the possibility that these models could indeed generate unsafe videos, we choose unsafe content generation prompts collected from 4chan and Lexica, and three open-source SOTA VGMs to generate unsafe videos. After filtering out duplicates and poorly generated content, we created an initial set of 2112 unsafe videos from an original pool of 5607 videos. Through clustering and thematic coding analysis of these generated videos, we identify 5 unsafe video categories: Distorted/Weird, Terrifying, Pornographic, Violent/Bloody, and Political. With IRB approval, we then recruit online participants to help label the generated videos. Based on the annotations submitted by 403 participants, we identified 937 unsafe videos from the initial video set. With the labeled information and the corresponding prompts, we created the first dataset of unsafe videos generated by VGMs.   We then study possible defense mechanisms to prevent the generation of unsafe videos. Existing defense methods in image generation focus on filtering either input prompt or output results. We propose a new approach called Latent Variable Defense (LVD), which works within the model's internal sampling process. LVD can achieve 0.90 defense accuracy while reducing time and computing resources by 10x when sampling a large number of unsafe prompts.

- **Summary**: In frame-based vision, object detection faces substantial performance degradation under challenging conditions due to the limited sensing capability of conventional cameras. Event cameras output sparse and asynchronous events, providing a potential solution to solve these problems. However, effectively fusing two heterogeneous modalities remains an open issue. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical feature refinement network for event-frame fusion. The core concept is the design of the coarse-to-fine fusion module, denoted as the cross-modality adaptive feature refinement (CAFR) module. In the initial phase, the bidirectional cross-modality interaction (BCI) part facilitates information bridging from two distinct sources. Subsequently, the features are further refined by aligning the channel-level mean and variance in the two-fold adaptive feature refinement (TAFR) part. We conducted extensive experiments on two benchmarks: the low-resolution PKU-DDD17-Car dataset and the high-resolution DSEC dataset. Experimental results show that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art by an impressive margin of $\textbf{8.0}\%$ on the DSEC dataset. Besides, our method exhibits significantly better robustness (\textbf{69.5}\% versus \textbf{38.7}\%) when introducing 15 different corruption types to the frame images.

- **Summary**: Large-scale vision models have become integral in many applications due to their unprecedented performance and versatility across downstream tasks. However, the robustness of these foundation models has primarily been explored for a single task, namely image classification. The vulnerability of other common vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation, remains largely unknown. We present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of the adversarial robustness of self-supervised vision encoders across multiple downstream tasks. Our attacks operate in the encoder embedding space and at the downstream task output level. In both cases, current state-of-the-art adversarial fine-tuning techniques tested only for classification significantly degrade clean and robust performance on other tasks. Since the purpose of a foundation model is to cater to multiple applications at once, our findings reveal the need to enhance encoder robustness more broadly.

- **Summary**: Re-Identification systems (Re-ID) are crucial for public safety but face the challenge of having to adapt to environments that differ from their training distribution. Furthermore, rigorous privacy protocols in public places are being enforced as apprehensions regarding individual freedom rise, adding layers of complexity to the deployment of accurate Re-ID systems in new environments. For example, in the European Union, the principles of ``Data Minimization'' and ``Purpose Limitation'' restrict the retention and processing of images to what is strictly necessary. These regulations pose a challenge to the conventional Re-ID training schemes that rely on centralizing data on servers. In this work, we present a novel setting for privacy-preserving Distributed Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for person Re-ID (DUDA-Rid) to address the problem of domain shift without requiring any image transfer outside the camera devices. To address this setting, we introduce Fed-Protoid, a novel solution that adapts person Re-ID models directly within the edge devices. Our proposed solution employs prototypes derived from the source domain to align feature statistics within edge devices. Those source prototypes are distributed across the edge devices to minimize a distributed Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss tailored for the DUDA-Rid setting. Our experiments provide compelling evidence that Fed-Protoid outperforms all evaluated methods in terms of both accuracy and communication efficiency, all while maintaining data privacy.

- **Summary**: In the context of global climate change and frequent extreme weather events, forecasting future geospatial vegetation states under these conditions is of significant importance. The vegetation change process is influenced by the complex interplay between dynamic meteorological variables and static environmental variables, leading to high levels of uncertainty. Existing deterministic methods are inadequate in addressing this uncertainty and fail to accurately model the impact of these variables on vegetation, resulting in blurry and inaccurate forecasting results. To address these issues, we propose VegeDiff for the geospatial vegetation forecasting task. To our best knowledge, VegeDiff is the first to employ a diffusion model to probabilistically capture the uncertainties in vegetation change processes, enabling the generation of clear and accurate future vegetation states. VegeDiff also separately models the global impact of dynamic meteorological variables and the local effects of static environmental variables, thus accurately modeling the impact of these variables. Extensive experiments on geospatial vegetation forecasting tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of VegeDiff. By capturing the uncertainties in vegetation changes and modeling the complex influence of relevant variables, VegeDiff outperforms existing deterministic methods, providing clear and accurate forecasting results of future vegetation states. Interestingly, we demonstrate the potential of VegeDiff in applications of forecasting future vegetation states from multiple aspects and exploring the impact of meteorological variables on vegetation dynamics.

- **Summary**: Sign language is one of the most effective communication tools for people with hearing difficulties. Most existing works focus on improving the performance of sign language tasks on RGB videos, which may suffer from degraded recording conditions, such as fast movement of hands with motion blur and textured signer's appearance. The bio-inspired event camera, which asynchronously captures brightness change with high speed, could naturally perceive dynamic hand movements, providing rich manual clues for sign language tasks. In this work, we aim at exploring the potential of event camera in continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) and sign language translation (SLT). To promote the research, we first collect an event-based benchmark EvSign for those tasks with both gloss and spoken language annotations. EvSign dataset offers a substantial amount of high-quality event streams and an extensive vocabulary of glosses and words, thereby facilitating the development of sign language tasks. In addition, we propose an efficient transformer-based framework for event-based SLR and SLT tasks, which fully leverages the advantages of streaming events. The sparse backbone is employed to extract visual features from sparse events. Then, the temporal coherence is effectively utilized through the proposed local token fusion and gloss-aware temporal aggregation modules. Extensive experimental results are reported on both simulated (PHOENIX14T) and EvSign datasets. Our method performs favorably against existing state-of-the-art approaches with only 0.34% computational cost (0.84G FLOPS per video) and 44.2% network parameters.

- **Summary**: In recent years, notable advancements have been made in the domain of visual document understanding, with the prevailing architecture comprising a cascade of vision and language models. The text component can either be extracted explicitly with the use of external OCR models in OCR-based approaches, or alternatively, the vision model can be endowed with reading capabilities in OCR-free approaches. Typically, the queries to the model are input exclusively to the language component, necessitating the visual features to encompass the entire document. In this paper, we present VisFocus, an OCR-free method designed to better exploit the vision encoder's capacity by coupling it directly with the language prompt. To do so, we replace the down-sampling layers with layers that receive the input prompt and allow highlighting relevant parts of the document, while disregarding others. We pair the architecture enhancements with a novel pre-training task, using language masking on a snippet of the document text fed to the visual encoder in place of the prompt, to empower the model with focusing capabilities. Consequently, VisFocus learns to allocate its attention to text patches pertinent to the provided prompt. Our experiments demonstrate that this prompt-guided visual encoding approach significantly improves performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Diagnosing and treating abnormalities in the wrist, specifically distal radius, and ulna fractures, is a crucial concern among children, adolescents, and young adults, with a higher incidence rate during puberty. However, the scarcity of radiologists and the lack of specialized training among medical professionals pose a significant risk to patient care. This problem is further exacerbated by the rising number of imaging studies and limited access to specialist reporting in certain regions. This highlights the need for innovative solutions to improve the diagnosis and treatment of wrist abnormalities. Automated wrist fracture detection using object detection has shown potential, but current studies mainly use two-stage detection methods with limited evidence for single-stage effectiveness. This study employs state-of-the-art single-stage deep neural network-based detection models YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8 to detect wrist abnormalities. Through extensive experimentation, we found that these YOLO models outperform the commonly used two-stage detection algorithm, Faster R-CNN, in bone fracture detection. Additionally, compound-scaled variants of each YOLO model were compared, with YOLOv8x demonstrating a fracture detection mean average precision (mAP) of 0.95 and an overall mAP of 0.77 on the GRAZPEDWRI-DX pediatric wrist dataset, highlighting the potential of single-stage models for enhancing pediatric wrist imaging.

- **Summary**: Diversity is a concept of prime importance in almost all disciplines based on information processing. In telecommunications, for example, spatial, temporal, and frequency diversity, as well as redundant coding, are fundamental concepts that have enabled the design of extremely efficient systems. In machine learning, in particular with neural networks, diversity is not always a concept that is emphasized or at least clearly identified. This paper proposes a neural network architecture that builds upon various diversity principles, some of them already known, others more original. Our architecture obtains remarkable results, with a record self-supervised learning accuracy of 99. 57% in MNIST, and a top tier promising semi-supervised learning accuracy of 94.21% in CIFAR-10 using only 25 labels per class.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental computer vision task with a vast number of applications. State of the art methods increasingly rely on deep learning models, known to incorrectly estimate uncertainty and being overconfident in predictions, especially in data not seen during training. This is particularly problematic in semantic segmentation due to inherent class imbalance. Popular uncertainty quantification approaches are task-agnostic and fail to leverage spatial pixel correlations in uncertainty estimates, crucial in this task. In this work, a novel training methodology specifically designed for semantic segmentation is presented. Training samples are weighted by instance-wise uncertainty masks computed by an ensemble. This is shown to increase performance on minority classes, boost model generalization and robustness to domain-shift when compared to using the inverse of class proportions or no class weights at all. This method addresses the challenges of class imbalance and uncertainty estimation in semantic segmentation, potentially enhancing model performance and reliability across various applications.

- **Summary**: The task of labeling multiple organs for segmentation is a complex and time-consuming process, resulting in a scarcity of comprehensively labeled multi-organ datasets while the emergence of numerous partially labeled datasets. Current methods are inadequate in effectively utilizing the supervised information available from these datasets, thereby impeding the progress in improving the segmentation accuracy. This paper proposes a two-stage multi-organ segmentation method based on mutual learning, aiming to improve multi-organ segmentation performance by complementing information among partially labeled datasets. In the first stage, each partial-organ segmentation model utilizes the non-overlapping organ labels from different datasets and the distinct organ features extracted by different models, introducing additional mutual difference learning to generate higher quality pseudo labels for unlabeled organs. In the second stage, each full-organ segmentation model is supervised by fully labeled datasets with pseudo labels and leverages true labels from other datasets, while dynamically sharing accurate features across different models, introducing additional mutual similarity learning to enhance multi-organ segmentation performance. Extensive experiments were conducted on nine datasets that included the head and neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. The results indicate that our method has achieved SOTA performance in segmentation tasks that rely on partial labels, and the ablation studies have thoroughly confirmed the efficacy of the mutual learning mechanism.

- **Summary**: The strawberry industry yields significant economic benefits for Florida, yet the process of monitoring strawberry growth and yield is labor-intensive and costly. The development of machine learning-based detection and tracking methodologies has been used for helping automated monitoring and prediction of strawberry yield, still, enhancement has been limited as previous studies only applied the deep learning method for flower and fruit detection, which did not consider the unique characteristics of image datasets collected by the machine vision system. This study proposed an optimal pruning of detection heads of the deep learning model (YOLOv7 and its variants) that could achieve fast and precise strawberry flower, immature fruit, and mature fruit detection. Thereafter, an enhanced object tracking algorithm, which is called the Information Based Tracking Algorithm (IBTA) utilized the best detection result, removed the Kalman Filter, and integrated moving direction, velocity, and spatial information to improve the precision in strawberry flower and fruit tracking. The proposed pruning of detection heads across YOLOv7 variants, notably Pruning-YOLOv7-tiny with detection head 3 and Pruning-YOLOv7-tiny with heads 2 and 3 achieved the best inference speed (163.9 frames per second) and detection accuracy (89.1%), respectively. On the other hand, the effect of IBTA was proved by comparing it with the centroid tracking algorithm (CTA), the Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and Multiple Object Tracking Precision (MOTP) of IBTA were 12.3% and 6.0% higher than that of CTA, accordingly. In addition, other object-tracking evaluation metrics, including IDF1, IDR, IDP, MT, and IDs, show that IBTA performed better than CTA in strawberry flower and fruit tracking.

- **Summary**: Multimodal learning typically relies on the assumption that all modalities are fully available during both the training and inference phases. However, in real-world scenarios, consistently acquiring complete multimodal data presents significant challenges due to various factors. This often leads to the issue of missing modalities, where data for certain modalities are absent, posing considerable obstacles not only for the availability of multimodal pretrained models but also for their fine-tuning and the preservation of robustness in downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework integrating parameter-efficient fine-tuning of unimodal pretrained models with a self-supervised joint-embedding learning method. This framework enables the model to predict the embedding of a missing modality in the representation space during inference. Our method effectively predicts the missing embedding through prompt tuning, leveraging information from available modalities. We evaluate our approach on several multimodal benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness across various scenarios of missing modalities.

- **Summary**: Generic event boundary detection (GEBD), inspired by human visual cognitive behaviors of consistently segmenting videos into meaningful temporal chunks, finds utility in various applications such as video editing and. In this paper, we demonstrate that SOTA GEBD models often prioritize final performance over model complexity, resulting in low inference speed and hindering efficient deployment in real-world scenarios. We contribute to addressing this challenge by experimentally reexamining the architecture of GEBD models and uncovering several surprising findings. Firstly, we reveal that a concise GEBD baseline model already achieves promising performance without any sophisticated design. Secondly, we find that the widely applied image-domain backbones in GEBD models can contain plenty of architecture redundancy, motivating us to gradually ``modernize'' each component to enhance efficiency. Thirdly, we show that the GEBD models using image-domain backbones conducting the spatiotemporal learning in a spatial-then-temporal greedy manner can suffer from a distraction issue, which might be the inefficient villain for GEBD. Using a video-domain backbone to jointly conduct spatiotemporal modeling is an effective solution for this issue. The outcome of our exploration is a family of GEBD models, named EfficientGEBD, significantly outperforms the previous SOTA methods by up to 1.7\% performance gain and 280\% speedup under the same backbone. Our research prompts the community to design modern GEBD methods with the consideration of model complexity, particularly in resource-aware applications.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods leverage unlabeled data by pseudo-labeling them. Thus the success of these methods hinges on the reliablility of the pseudo-labels. Existing methods mostly choose high-confidence pixels in an effort to avoid erroneous pseudo-labels. However, high confidence does not guarantee correct pseudo-labels especially in the initial training iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to reliably learn from pseudo-labels. First, we unify the predictions from a trained object detector and a semantic segmentation model to identify reliable pseudo-label pixels. Second, we assign different learning weights to pseudo-labeled pixels to avoid noisy training signals. To determine these weights, we first use the reliable pseudo-label pixels identified from the first step and labeled pixels to construct a prototype for each class. Then, the per-pixel weight is the structural similarity between the pixel and the prototype measured via rank-statistics similarity. This metric is robust to noise, making it better suited for comparing features from unlabeled images, particularly in the initial training phases where wrong pseudo labels are prone to occur. We show that our method can be easily integrated into four semi-supervised semantic segmentation frameworks, and improves them in both Cityscapes and Pascal VOC datasets.

- **Summary**: Object detection is a core task in computer vision. Over the years, the development of numerous models has significantly enhanced performance. However, these conventional models are usually limited by the data on which they were trained and by the category logic they define. With the recent rise of Language-Visual Models, new methods have emerged that are not restricted to these fixed categories. Despite their flexibility, such Open Vocabulary detection models still fall short in accuracy compared to traditional models with fixed classes. At the same time, more accurate data-specific models face challenges when there is a need to extend classes or merge different datasets for training. The latter often cannot be combined due to different logics or conflicting class definitions, making it difficult to improve a model without compromising its performance. In this paper, we introduce CerberusDet, a framework with a multi-headed model designed for handling multiple object detection tasks. Proposed model is built on the YOLO architecture and efficiently shares visual features from both backbone and neck components, while maintaining separate task heads. This approach allows CerberusDet to perform very efficiently while still delivering optimal results. We evaluated the model on the PASCAL VOC dataset and additional categories from the Objects365 dataset to demonstrate its abilities. CerberusDet achieved results comparable to state-of-the-art data-specific models with 36% less inference time. The more tasks are trained together, the more efficient the proposed model becomes compared to running individual models sequentially. The training and inference code, as well as the model, are available as open-source (https://github.com/ai-forever/CerberusDet).

- **Summary**: Network quantization generally converts full-precision weights and/or activations into low-bit fixed-point values in order to accelerate an inference process. Recent approaches to network quantization further discretize the gradients into low-bit fixed-point values, enabling an efficient training. They typically set a quantization interval using a min-max range of the gradients or adjust the interval such that the quantization error for entire gradients is minimized. In this paper, we analyze the quantization error of gradients for the low-bit fixed-point training, and show that lowering the error for large-magnitude gradients boosts the quantization performance significantly. Based on this, we derive an upper bound of quantization error for the large gradients in terms of the quantization interval, and obtain an optimal condition for the interval minimizing the quantization error for large gradients. We also introduce an interval update algorithm that adjusts the quantization interval adaptively to maintain a small quantization error for large gradients. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our quantization method for various combinations of network architectures and bit-widths on various tasks, including image classification, object detection, and super-resolution.

- **Summary**: Text-guided image editing and generation methods have diverse real-world applications. However, text-guided infinite image synthesis faces several challenges. First, there is a lack of text-image paired datasets with high-resolution and contextual diversity. Second, expanding images based on text requires global coherence and rich local context understanding. Previous studies have mainly focused on limited categories, such as natural landscapes, and also required to train on high-resolution images with paired text. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for both global coherence and local context understanding, without any high-resolution text-image paired training dataset. We train the diffusion model to expand an image conditioned on global and local captions generated from the LLM and visual feature. At the inference stage, given an image and a global caption, we use the LLM to generate a next local caption to expand the input image. Then, we expand the image using the global caption, generated local caption and the visual feature to consider global consistency and spatial local context. In experiments, our model outperforms the baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore, our model demonstrates the capability of text-guided arbitrary-sized image generation in zero-shot manner with LLM guidance.

- **Summary**: Recognizing unauthorized Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) within designated no-fly zones throughout the day and night is of paramount importance, where the unauthorized UAVs pose a substantial threat to both civil and military aviation safety. However, recognizing UAVs day and night with dual-vision cameras is nontrivial, since red-green-blue (RGB) images suffer from a low detection rate under an insufficient light condition, such as on cloudy or stormy days, while black-and-white infrared (IR) images struggle to capture UAVs that overlap with the background at night. In this paper, we propose a new optical flow-assisted graph-pooling residual network (OF-GPRN), which significantly enhances the UAV detection rate in day and night dual visions. The proposed OF-GPRN develops a new optical fusion to remove superfluous backgrounds, which improves RGB/IR imaging clarity. Furthermore, OF-GPRN extends optical fusion by incorporating a graph residual split attention network and a feature pyramid, which refines the perception of UAVs, leading to a higher success rate in UAV detection. A comprehensive performance evaluation is conducted using a benchmark UAV catch dataset. The results indicate that the proposed OF-GPRN elevates the UAV mean average precision (mAP) detection rate to 87.8%, marking a 17.9% advancement compared to the residual graph neural network (ResGCN)-based approach.

- **Summary**: 3D surface reconstruction from multi-view images is essential for scene understanding and interaction. However, complex indoor scenes pose challenges such as ambiguity due to limited observations. Recent implicit surface representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and signed distance functions (SDFs), employ various geometric priors to resolve the lack of observed information. Nevertheless, their performance heavily depends on the quality of the pre-trained geometry estimation models. To ease such dependence, we propose regularizing the geometric modeling by explicitly encouraging the mutual information among surface normals of highly correlated scene points. In this way, the geometry learning process is modulated by the second-order correlations from noisy (first-order) geometric priors, thus eliminating the bias due to poor generalization. Additionally, we introduce a simple yet effective scheme that utilizes semantic and geometric features to identify correlated points, enhancing their mutual information accordingly. The proposed technique can serve as a plugin for SDF-based neural surface representations. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed in improving the surface reconstruction quality of major states of the arts.

- **Summary**: 3D surface reconstruction from images is essential for numerous applications. Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a promising framework for 3D modeling. However, NeRFs require accurate camera poses as input, and existing methods struggle to handle significantly noisy pose estimates (i.e., outliers), which are commonly encountered in real-world scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel approach that optimizes radiance fields with scene graphs to mitigate the influence of outlier poses. Our method incorporates an adaptive inlier-outlier confidence estimation scheme based on scene graphs, emphasizing images of high compatibility with the neighborhood and consistency in the rendering quality. We also introduce an effective intersection-over-union (IoU) loss to optimize the camera pose and surface geometry, together with a coarse-to-fine strategy to facilitate the training. Furthermore, we propose a new dataset containing typical outlier poses for a detailed evaluation. Experimental results on various datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method over existing approaches, showcasing its robustness in handling outliers and producing high-quality 3D reconstructions.

- **Summary**: Deep learning holds immense promise for aiding radiologists in breast cancer detection. However, achieving optimal model performance is hampered by limitations in availability and sharing of data commonly associated to patient privacy concerns. Such concerns are further exacerbated, as traditional deep learning models can inadvertently leak sensitive training information. This work addresses these challenges exploring and quantifying the utility of privacy-preserving deep learning techniques, concretely, (i) differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) and (ii) fully synthetic training data generated by our proposed malignancy-conditioned generative adversarial network. We assess these methods via downstream malignancy classification of mammography masses using a transformer model. Our experimental results depict that synthetic data augmentation can improve privacy-utility tradeoffs in differentially private model training. Further, model pretraining on synthetic data achieves remarkable performance, which can be further increased with DP-SGD fine-tuning across all privacy guarantees. With this first in-depth exploration of privacy-preserving deep learning in breast imaging, we address current and emerging clinical privacy requirements and pave the way towards the adoption of private high-utility deep diagnostic models.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have been demonstrated as strong priors for solving general inverse problems. Most existing Diffusion model-based Inverse Problem Solvers (DIS) employ a plug-and-play approach to guide the sampling trajectory with either projections or gradients. Though effective, these methods generally necessitate hundreds of sampling steps, posing a dilemma between inference time and reconstruction quality. In this work, we try to push the boundary of inference steps to 1-2 NFEs while still maintaining high reconstruction quality. To achieve this, we propose to leverage a pretrained distillation of diffusion model, namely consistency model, as the data prior. The key to achieving few-step guidance is to enforce two types of constraints during the sampling process of the consistency model: soft measurement constraint with ControlNet and hard measurement constraint via optimization. Supporting both single-step reconstruction and multistep refinement, the proposed framework further provides a way to trade image quality with additional computational cost. Within comparable NFEs, our method achieves new state-of-the-art in diffusion-based inverse problem solving, showcasing the significant potential of employing prior-based inverse problem solvers for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Most current LLM-based models for video understanding can process videos within minutes. However, they struggle with lengthy videos due to challenges such as "noise and redundancy", as well as "memory and computation" constraints. In this paper, we present Goldfish, a methodology tailored for comprehending videos of arbitrary lengths. We also introduce the TVQA-long benchmark, specifically designed to evaluate models' capabilities in understanding long videos with questions in both vision and text content. Goldfish approaches these challenges with an efficient retrieval mechanism that initially gathers the top-k video clips relevant to the instruction before proceeding to provide the desired response. This design of the retrieval mechanism enables the Goldfish to efficiently process arbitrarily long video sequences, facilitating its application in contexts such as movies or television series. To facilitate the retrieval process, we developed MiniGPT4-Video that generates detailed descriptions for the video clips. In addressing the scarcity of benchmarks for long video evaluation, we adapted the TVQA short video benchmark for extended content analysis by aggregating questions from entire episodes, thereby shifting the evaluation from partial to full episode comprehension. We attained a 41.78% accuracy rate on the TVQA-long benchmark, surpassing previous methods by 14.94%. Our MiniGPT4-Video also shows exceptional performance in short video comprehension, exceeding existing state-of-the-art methods by 3.23%, 2.03%, 16.5% and 23.59% on the MSVD, MSRVTT, TGIF, and TVQA short video benchmarks, respectively. These results indicate that our models have significant improvements in both long and short-video understanding.

- **Summary**: Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process can incur defects due to melt pool instabilities, spattering, temperature increase, and powder spread anomalies. Identifying defects through in-situ monitoring typically requires collecting, storing, and analyzing large amounts of data generated. The first goal of this work is to propose a new approach to accurately map in-situ data to a three-dimensional (3D) geometry, aiming to reduce the amount of storage. The second goal of this work is to introduce several new IR features for defect detection or process model calibration, which include laser scan order, local preheat temperature, maximum pre-laser scanning temperature, and number of spatters generated locally and their landing locations. For completeness, processing of other common IR features, such as interpass temperature, heat intensity, cooling rates, and melt pool area, are also presented with the underlying algorithm and Python implementation. A number of different parts are printed, monitored, and characterized to provide evidence of process defects and anomalies that different IR features are capable of detecting.

- **Summary**: Due to the fascinating generative performance of text-to-image diffusion models, growing text-to-3D generation works explore distilling the 2D generative priors into 3D, using the score distillation sampling (SDS) loss, to bypass the data scarcity problem. The existing text-to-3D methods have achieved promising results in realism and 3D consistency, but text-to-4D generation still faces challenges, including lack of realism and insufficient dynamic motions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for text-to-4D generation, which ensures the dynamic amplitude and authenticity through direct supervision provided by a video prior. Specifically, we adopt a text-to-video diffusion model to generate a reference video and divide 4D generation into two stages: static generation and dynamic generation. The static 3D generation is achieved under the guidance of the input text and the first frame of the reference video, while in the dynamic generation stage, we introduce a customized SDS loss to ensure multi-view consistency, a video-based SDS loss to improve temporal consistency, and most importantly, direct priors from the reference video to ensure the quality of geometry and texture. Moreover, we design a prior-switching training strategy to avoid conflicts between different priors and fully leverage the benefits of each prior. In addition, to enrich the generated motion, we further introduce a dynamic modeling representation composed of a deformation network and a topology network, which ensures dynamic continuity while modeling topological changes. Our method not only supports text-to-4D generation but also enables 4D generation from monocular videos. The comparison experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to existing methods.

- **Summary**: High resolution micro-ultrasound has demonstrated promise in real-time prostate cancer detection, with deep learning becoming a prominent tool for learning complex tissue properties reflected on ultrasound. However, a significant roadblock to real-world deployment remains, which prior works often overlook: model performance suffers when applied to data from different clinical centers due to variations in data distribution. This distribution shift significantly impacts the model's robustness, posing major challenge to clinical deployment. Domain adaptation and specifically its test-time adaption (TTA) variant offer a promising solution to address this challenge. In a setting designed to reflect real-world conditions, we compare existing methods to state-of-the-art TTA approaches adopted for cancer detection, demonstrating the lack of robustness to distribution shifts in the former. We then propose Diverse Ensemble Entropy Minimization (DEnEM), questioning the effectiveness of current TTA methods on ultrasound data. We show that these methods, although outperforming baselines, are suboptimal due to relying on neural networks output probabilities, which could be uncalibrated, or relying on data augmentation, which is not straightforward to define on ultrasound data. Our results show a significant improvement of $5\%$ to $7\%$ in AUROC over the existing methods and $3\%$ to $5\%$ over TTA methods, demonstrating the advantage of DEnEM in addressing distribution shift.   \keywords{Ultrasound Imaging \and Prostate Cancer \and Computer-aided Diagnosis \and Distribution Shift Robustness \and Test-time Adaptation.}

- **Summary**: 3D reverse engineering, in which a CAD model is inferred given a 3D scan of a physical object, is a research direction that offers many promising practical applications. This paper proposes TransCAD, an end-to-end transformer-based architecture that predicts the CAD sequence from a point cloud. TransCAD leverages the structure of CAD sequences by using a hierarchical learning strategy. A loop refiner is also introduced to regress sketch primitive parameters. Rigorous experimentation on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that TransCAD achieves state-of-the-art results. The result analysis is supported with a proposed metric for CAD sequence, the mean Average Precision of CAD Sequence, that addresses the limitations of existing metrics.

- **Summary**: Latest advances have achieved realistic virtual try-on (VTON) through localized garment inpainting using latent diffusion models, significantly enhancing consumers' online shopping experience. However, existing VTON technologies neglect the need for merchants to showcase garments comprehensively, including flexible control over garments, optional faces, poses, and scenes. To address this issue, we define a virtual dressing (VD) task focused on generating freely editable human images with fixed garments and optional conditions. Meanwhile, we design a comprehensive affinity metric index (CAMI) to evaluate the consistency between generated images and reference garments. Then, we propose IMAGDressing-v1, which incorporates a garment UNet that captures semantic features from CLIP and texture features from VAE. We present a hybrid attention module, including a frozen self-attention and a trainable cross-attention, to integrate garment features from the garment UNet into a frozen denoising UNet, ensuring users can control different scenes through text. IMAGDressing-v1 can be combined with other extension plugins, such as ControlNet and IP-Adapter, to enhance the diversity and controllability of generated images. Furthermore, to address the lack of data, we release the interactive garment pairing (IGPair) dataset, containing over 300,000 pairs of clothing and dressed images, and establish a standard pipeline for data assembly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IMAGDressing-v1 achieves state-of-the-art human image synthesis performance under various controlled conditions.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various vision-language tasks. However, a generalist MLLM typically underperforms compared with a specialist MLLM on most VL tasks, which can be attributed to task interference. In this paper, we propose a mixture of multimodal experts (MoME) to mitigate task interference and obtain a generalist MLLM. Our MoME is composed of two key components, a mixture of vision experts (MoVE) and a mixture of language experts (MoLE). MoVE can adaptively modulate the features transformed from various vision encoders, and has a strong compatibility in transformation architecture. MoLE incorporates sparsely gated experts into LLMs to achieve painless improvements with roughly unchanged inference costs. In response to task interference, our MoME specializes in both vision and language modality to adapt to task discrepancies. Extensive experiments show that MoME significantly improves the performance of generalist MLLMs across various VL tasks. The source code is released at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/MoME

- **Summary**: Diffusion models excel in high-quality generation but suffer from slow inference due to iterative sampling. While recent methods have successfully transformed diffusion models into one-step generators, they neglect model size reduction, limiting their applicability in compute-constrained scenarios. This paper aims to develop small, efficient one-step diffusion models based on the powerful rectified flow framework, by exploring joint compression of inference steps and model size. The rectified flow framework trains one-step generative models using two operations, reflow and distillation. Compared with the original framework, squeezing the model size brings two new challenges: (1) the initialization mismatch between large teachers and small students during reflow; (2) the underperformance of naive distillation on small student models. To overcome these issues, we propose Annealing Reflow and Flow-Guided Distillation, which together comprise our SlimFlow framework. With our novel framework, we train a one-step diffusion model with an FID of 5.02 and 15.7M parameters, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art one-step diffusion model (FID=6.47, 19.4M parameters) on CIFAR10. On ImageNet 64$\times$64 and FFHQ 64$\times$64, our method yields small one-step diffusion models that are comparable to larger models, showcasing the effectiveness of our method in creating compact, efficient one-step diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based semiconductor defect inspection has gained traction in recent years, offering a powerful and versatile approach that provides high accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency in detecting and classifying nano-scale defects. However, semiconductor manufacturing processes are continually evolving, leading to the emergence of new types of defects over time. This presents a significant challenge for conventional supervised defect detectors, as they may suffer from catastrophic forgetting when trained on new defect datasets, potentially compromising performance on previously learned tasks. An alternative approach involves the constant storage of previously trained datasets alongside pre-trained model versions, which can be utilized for (re-)training from scratch or fine-tuning whenever encountering a new defect dataset. However, adhering to such a storage template is impractical in terms of size, particularly when considering High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM). Additionally, semiconductor defect datasets, especially those encompassing stochastic defects, are often limited and expensive to obtain, thus lacking sufficient representation of the entire universal set of defectivity. This work introduces a task-agnostic, meta-learning approach aimed at addressing this challenge, which enables the incremental addition of new defect classes and scales to create a more robust and generalized model for semiconductor defect inspection. We have benchmarked our approach using real resist-wafer SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) datasets for two process steps, ADI and AEI, demonstrating its superior performance compared to conventional supervised training methods.

- **Summary**: Modeling the physical contacts between the hand and object is standard for refining inaccurate hand poses and generating novel human grasp in 3D hand-object reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on geometric constraints that cannot be specified or controlled. This paper introduces a novel task of controllable 3D hand-object contact modeling with natural language descriptions. Challenges include i) the complexity of cross-modal modeling from language to contact, and ii) a lack of descriptive text for contact patterns. To address these issues, we propose NL2Contact, a model that generates controllable contacts by leveraging staged diffusion models. Given a language description of the hand and contact, NL2Contact generates realistic and faithful 3D hand-object contacts. To train the model, we build \textit{ContactDescribe}, the first dataset with hand-centered contact descriptions. It contains multi-level and diverse descriptions generated by large language models based on carefully designed prompts (e.g., grasp action, grasp type, contact location, free finger status). We show applications of our model to grasp pose optimization and novel human grasp generation, both based on a textual contact description.

- **Summary**: Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have significantly advanced a variety of vision-language tasks. The scalability and availability of high-quality training data play a pivotal role in the success of LMMs. In the realm of food, while comprehensive food datasets such as Recipe1M offer an abundance of ingredient and recipe information, they often fall short of providing ample data for nutritional analysis. The Recipe1M+ dataset, despite offering a subset for nutritional evaluation, is limited in the scale and accuracy of nutrition information. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-Food, a unified food dataset that comprises over 100,000 images with various food labels, including categories, ingredients, recipes, and ingredient-level nutritional information. Uni-Food is designed to provide a more holistic approach to food data analysis, thereby enhancing the performance and capabilities of LMMs in this domain. To mitigate the conflicts arising from multi-task supervision during fine-tuning of LMMs, we introduce a novel Linear Rectification Mixture of Diverse Experts (RoDE) approach. RoDE utilizes a diverse array of experts to address tasks of varying complexity, thereby facilitating the coordination of trainable parameters, i.e., it allocates more parameters for more complex tasks and, conversely, fewer parameters for simpler tasks. RoDE implements linear rectification union to refine the router's functionality, thereby enhancing the efficiency of sparse task allocation. These design choices endow RoDE with features that ensure GPU memory efficiency and ease of optimization. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in addressing the inherent challenges of food-related multitasking.

- **Summary**: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) tasks require answering questions about images using extensive background knowledge. Despite significant advancements, generative models often struggle with these tasks due to the limited integration of external knowledge. In this paper, we introduce EchoSight, a novel multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to answer visual questions requiring fine-grained encyclopedic knowledge. To strive for high-performing retrieval, EchoSight first searches wiki articles by using visual-only information, subsequently, these candidate articles are further reranked according to their relevance to the combined text-image query. This approach significantly improves the integration of multimodal knowledge, leading to enhanced retrieval outcomes and more accurate VQA responses. Our experimental results on the Encyclopedic VQA and InfoSeek datasets demonstrate that EchoSight establishes new state-of-the-art results in knowledge-based VQA, achieving an accuracy of 41.8% on Encyclopedic VQA and 31.3% on InfoSeek.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) represent a groundbreaking shift in machine learning approaches to computer vision. Unlike traditional approaches, ViTs employ the self-attention mechanism, which has been widely used in natural language processing, to analyze image patches. Despite their advantages in modeling visual tasks, deploying ViTs on hardware platforms, notably Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), introduces considerable challenges. These challenges stem primarily from the non-linear calculations and high computational and memory demands of ViTs. This paper introduces CHOSEN, a software-hardware co-design framework to address these challenges and offer an automated framework for ViT deployment on the FPGAs in order to maximize performance. Our framework is built upon three fundamental contributions: multi-kernel design to maximize the bandwidth, mainly targeting benefits of multi DDR memory banks, approximate non-linear functions that exhibit minimal accuracy degradation, and efficient use of available logic blocks on the FPGA, and efficient compiler to maximize the performance and memory-efficiency of the computing kernels by presenting a novel algorithm for design space exploration to find optimal hardware configuration that achieves optimal throughput and latency. Compared to the state-of-the-art ViT accelerators, CHOSEN achieves a 1.5x and 1.42x improvement in the throughput on the DeiT-S and DeiT-B models.

- **Summary**: We propose GroundUp, the first sketch-based ideation tool for 3D city massing of urban areas. We focus on early-stage urban design, where sketching is a common tool and the design starts from balancing building volumes (masses) and open spaces. With Human-Centered AI in mind, we aim to help architects quickly revise their ideas by easily switching between 2D sketches and 3D models, allowing for smoother iteration and sharing of ideas. Inspired by feedback from architects and existing workflows, our system takes as a first input a user sketch of multiple buildings in a top-down view. The user then draws a perspective sketch of the envisioned site. Our method is designed to exploit the complementarity of information in the two sketches and allows users to quickly preview and adjust the inferred 3D shapes. Our model has two main components. First, we propose a novel sketch-to-depth prediction network for perspective sketches that exploits top-down sketch shapes. Second, we use depth cues derived from the perspective sketch as a condition to our diffusion model, which ultimately completes the geometry in a top-down view. Thus, our final 3D geometry is represented as a heightfield, allowing users to construct the city `from the ground up'.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViT) have emerged as the de-facto choice for numerous industry grade vision solutions. But their inference cost can be prohibitive for many settings, as they compute self-attention in each layer which suffers from quadratic computational complexity in the number of tokens. On the other hand, spatial information in images and spatio-temporal information in videos is usually sparse and redundant. In this work, we introduce LookupViT, that aims to exploit this information sparsity to reduce ViT inference cost. LookupViT provides a novel general purpose vision transformer block that operates by compressing information from higher resolution tokens to a fixed number of tokens. These few compressed tokens undergo meticulous processing, while the higher-resolution tokens are passed through computationally cheaper layers. Information sharing between these two token sets is enabled through a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism. The approach offers multiple advantages - (a) easy to implement on standard ML accelerators (GPUs/TPUs) via standard high-level operators, (b) applicable to standard ViT and its variants, thus generalizes to various tasks, (c) can handle different tokenization and attention approaches. LookupViT also offers flexibility for the compressed tokens, enabling performance-computation trade-offs in a single trained model. We show LookupViT's effectiveness on multiple domains - (a) for image-classification (ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K), (b) video classification (Kinetics400 and Something-Something V2), (c) image captioning (COCO-Captions) with a frozen encoder. LookupViT provides $2\times$ reduction in FLOPs while upholding or improving accuracy across these domains. In addition, LookupViT also demonstrates out-of-the-box robustness and generalization on image classification (ImageNet-C,R,A,O), improving by up to $4\%$ over ViT.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised visible infrared person re-identification (USVI-ReID) is a challenging retrieval task that aims to retrieve cross-modality pedestrian images without using any label information. In this task, the large cross-modality variance makes it difficult to generate reliable cross-modality labels, and the lack of annotations also provides additional difficulties for learning modality-invariant features. In this paper, we first deduce an optimization objective for unsupervised VI-ReID based on the mutual information between the model's cross-modality input and output. With equivalent derivation, three learning principles, i.e., "Sharpness" (entropy minimization), "Fairness" (uniform label distribution), and "Fitness" (reliable cross-modality matching) are obtained. Under their guidance, we design a loop iterative training strategy alternating between model training and cross-modality matching. In the matching stage, a uniform prior guided optimal transport assignment ("Fitness", "Fairness") is proposed to select matched visible and infrared prototypes. In the training stage, we utilize this matching information to introduce prototype-based contrastive learning for minimizing the intra- and cross-modality entropy ("Sharpness"). Extensive experimental results on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, e.g., 60.6% and 90.3% of Rank-1 accuracy on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB without any annotations.

- **Summary**: The advances of large foundation models necessitate wide-coverage, low-cost, and zero-contamination benchmarks. Despite continuous exploration of language model evaluations, comprehensive studies on the evaluation of Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) remain limited. In this work, we introduce LMMS-EVAL, a unified and standardized multimodal benchmark framework with over 50 tasks and more than 10 models to promote transparent and reproducible evaluations. Although LMMS-EVAL offers comprehensive coverage, we find it still falls short in achieving low cost and zero contamination. To approach this evaluation trilemma, we further introduce LMMS-EVAL LITE, a pruned evaluation toolkit that emphasizes both coverage and efficiency. Additionally, we present Multimodal LIVEBENCH that utilizes continuously updating news and online forums to assess models' generalization abilities in the wild, featuring a low-cost and zero-contamination evaluation approach. In summary, our work highlights the importance of considering the evaluation trilemma and provides practical solutions to navigate the trade-offs in evaluating large multi-modal models, paving the way for more effective and reliable benchmarking of LMMs. We opensource our codebase and maintain leaderboard of LIVEBENCH at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval and https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmms-lab/LiveBench.

- **Summary**: Mitotic activity is an important feature for grading several cancer types. Counting mitotic figures (MFs) is a time-consuming, laborious task prone to inter-observer variation. Inaccurate recognition of MFs can lead to incorrect grading and hence potential suboptimal treatment. In this study, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-aided approach to detect MFs in digitised haematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images (WSIs). Advances in this area are hampered by the limited number and types of cancer datasets of MFs. Here we establish the largest pan-cancer dataset of mitotic figures by combining an in-house dataset of soft tissue tumours (STMF) with five open-source mitotic datasets comprising multiple human cancers and canine specimens (ICPR, TUPAC, CCMCT, CMC and MIDOG++). This new dataset identifies 74,620 MFs and 105,538 mitotic-like figures. We then employed a two-stage framework (the Optimised Mitoses Generator Network (OMG-Net) to classify MFs. The framework first deploys the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to automate the contouring of MFs and surrounding objects. An adapted ResNet18 is subsequently trained to classify MFs. OMG-Net reaches an F1-score of 0.84 on pan-cancer MF detection (breast carcinoma, neuroendocrine tumour and melanoma), largely outperforming the previous state-of-the-art MIDOG++ benchmark model on its hold-out testing set (e.g. +16% F1-score on breast cancer detection, p<0.001) thereby providing superior accuracy in detecting MFs on various types of tumours obtained with different scanners.

- **Summary**: Story visualization aims to create visually compelling images or videos corresponding to textual narratives. Despite recent advances in diffusion models yielding promising results, existing methods still struggle to create a coherent sequence of subject-consistent frames based solely on a story. To this end, we propose DreamStory, an automatic open-domain story visualization framework by leveraging the LLMs and a novel multi-subject consistent diffusion model. DreamStory consists of (1) an LLM acting as a story director and (2) an innovative Multi-Subject consistent Diffusion model (MSD) for generating consistent multi-subject across the images. First, DreamStory employs the LLM to generate descriptive prompts for subjects and scenes aligned with the story, annotating each scene's subjects for subsequent subject-consistent generation. Second, DreamStory utilizes these detailed subject descriptions to create portraits of the subjects, with these portraits and their corresponding textual information serving as multimodal anchors (guidance). Finally, the MSD uses these multimodal anchors to generate story scenes with consistent multi-subject. Specifically, the MSD includes Masked Mutual Self-Attention (MMSA) and Masked Mutual Cross-Attention (MMCA) modules. MMSA and MMCA modules ensure appearance and semantic consistency with reference images and text, respectively. Both modules employ masking mechanisms to prevent subject blending. To validate our approach and promote progress in story visualization, we established a benchmark, DS-500, which can assess the overall performance of the story visualization framework, subject-identification accuracy, and the consistency of the generation model. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DreamStory in both subjective and objective evaluations. Please visit our project homepage at https://dream-xyz.github.io/dreamstory.

- **Summary**: Recent progress in neural rendering has brought forth pioneering methods, such as NeRF and Gaussian Splatting, which revolutionize view rendering across various domains like AR/VR, gaming, and content creation. While these methods excel at interpolating {\em within the training data}, the challenge of generalizing to new scenes and objects from very sparse views persists. Specifically, modeling 3D humans from sparse views presents formidable hurdles due to the inherent complexity of human geometry, resulting in inaccurate reconstructions of geometry and textures. To tackle this challenge, this paper leverages recent advancements in Gaussian Splatting and introduces a new method to learn generalizable human Gaussians that allows photorealistic and accurate view-rendering of a new human subject from a limited set of sparse views in a feed-forward manner. A pivotal innovation of our approach involves reformulating the learning of 3D Gaussian parameters into a regression process defined on the 2D UV space of a human template, which allows leveraging the strong geometry prior and the advantages of 2D convolutions. In addition, a multi-scaffold is proposed to effectively represent the offset details. Our method outperforms recent methods on both within-dataset generalization as well as cross-dataset generalization settings.

- **Summary**: Modern text-to-video synthesis models demonstrate coherent, photorealistic generation of complex videos from a text description. However, most existing models lack fine-grained control over camera movement, which is critical for downstream applications related to content creation, visual effects, and 3D vision. Recently, new methods demonstrate the ability to generate videos with controllable camera poses these techniques leverage pre-trained U-Net-based diffusion models that explicitly disentangle spatial and temporal generation. Still, no existing approach enables camera control for new, transformer-based video diffusion models that process spatial and temporal information jointly. Here, we propose to tame video transformers for 3D camera control using a ControlNet-like conditioning mechanism that incorporates spatiotemporal camera embeddings based on Plucker coordinates. The approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for controllable video generation after fine-tuning on the RealEstate10K dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to enable camera control for transformer-based video diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Domain adversarial training has shown its effective capability for finding domain invariant feature representations and been successfully adopted for various domain adaptation tasks. However, recent advances of large models (e.g., vision transformers) and emerging of complex adaptation scenarios (e.g., DomainNet) make adversarial training being easily biased towards source domain and hardly adapted to target domain. The reason is twofold: relying on large amount of labelled data from source domain for large model training and lacking of labelled data from target domain for fine-tuning. Existing approaches widely focused on either enhancing discriminator or improving the training stability for the backbone networks. Due to unbalanced competition between the feature extractor and the discriminator during the adversarial training, existing solutions fail to function well on complex datasets. To address this issue, we proposed a novel contrastive adversarial training (CAT) approach that leverages the labeled source domain samples to reinforce and regulate the feature generation for target domain. Typically, the regulation forces the target feature distribution being similar to the source feature distribution. CAT addressed three major challenges in adversarial learning: 1) ensure the feature distributions from two domains as indistinguishable as possible for the discriminator, resulting in a more robust domain-invariant feature generation; 2) encourage target samples moving closer to the source in the feature space, reducing the requirement for generalizing classifier trained on the labeled source domain to unlabeled target domain; 3) avoid directly aligning unpaired source and target samples within mini-batch. CAT can be easily plugged into existing models and exhibits significant performance improvements.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel Stylized Motion Diffusion model, dubbed SMooDi, to generate stylized motion driven by content texts and style motion sequences. Unlike existing methods that either generate motion of various content or transfer style from one sequence to another, SMooDi can rapidly generate motion across a broad range of content and diverse styles. To this end, we tailor a pre-trained text-to-motion model for stylization. Specifically, we propose style guidance to ensure that the generated motion closely matches the reference style, alongside a lightweight style adaptor that directs the motion towards the desired style while ensuring realism. Experiments across various applications demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms existing methods in stylized motion generation.

- **Summary**: Systems for multimodal Emotion Recognition (ER) commonly rely on features extracted from different modalities (e.g., visual, audio, and textual) to predict the seven basic emotions. However, compound emotions often occur in real-world scenarios and are more difficult to predict. Compound multimodal ER becomes more challenging in videos due to the added uncertainty of diverse modalities.   In addition, standard features-based models may not fully capture the complex and subtle cues needed to understand compound emotions.   %%%%   Since relevant cues can be extracted in the form of text, we advocate for textualizing all modalities, such as visual and audio, to harness the capacity of large language models (LLMs). These models may understand the complex interaction between modalities and the subtleties of complex emotions. Although training an LLM requires large-scale datasets, a recent surge of pre-trained LLMs, such as BERT and LLaMA, can be easily fine-tuned for downstream tasks like compound ER.   This paper compares two multimodal modeling approaches for compound ER in videos -- standard feature-based vs. text-based. Experiments were conducted on the challenging C-EXPR-DB dataset for compound ER, and contrasted with results on the MELD dataset for basic ER.   Our code is available

- **Summary**: Sparse RGBD scene completion is a challenging task especially when considering consistent textures and geometries throughout the entire scene. Different from existing solutions that rely on human-designed text prompts or predefined camera trajectories, we propose GenRC, an automated training-free pipeline to complete a room-scale 3D mesh with high-fidelity textures. To achieve this, we first project the sparse RGBD images to a highly incomplete 3D mesh. Instead of iteratively generating novel views to fill in the void, we utilized our proposed E-Diffusion to generate a view-consistent panoramic RGBD image which ensures global geometry and appearance consistency. Furthermore, we maintain the input-output scene stylistic consistency through textual inversion to replace human-designed text prompts. To bridge the domain gap among datasets, E-Diffusion leverages models trained on large-scale datasets to generate diverse appearances. GenRC outperforms state-of-the-art methods under most appearance and geometric metrics on ScanNet and ARKitScenes datasets, even though GenRC is not trained on these datasets nor using predefined camera trajectories.

- **Summary**: Trajectory generation is a pivotal task in autonomous driving. Recent studies have introduced the autoregressive paradigm, leveraging the state transition model to approximate future trajectory distributions. This paradigm closely mirrors the real-world trajectory generation process and has achieved notable success. However, its potential is limited by the ineffective representation of realistic trajectories within the redundant state space. To address this limitation, we propose the Kinematic-Driven Generative Model for Realistic Agent Simulation (KiGRAS). Instead of modeling in the state space, KiGRAS factorizes the driving scene into action probability distributions at each time step, providing a compact space to represent realistic driving patterns. By establishing physical causality from actions (cause) to trajectories (effect) through the kinematic model, KiGRAS eliminates massive redundant trajectories. All states derived from actions in the cause space are constrained to be physically feasible. Furthermore, redundant trajectories representing identical action sequences are mapped to the same representation, reflecting their underlying actions. This approach significantly reduces task complexity and ensures physical feasibility.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel metric for measuring semantic continuity in Explainable AI methods and machine learning models. We posit that for models to be truly interpretable and trustworthy, similar inputs should yield similar explanations, reflecting a consistent semantic understanding. By leveraging XAI techniques, we assess semantic continuity in the task of image recognition. We conduct experiments to observe how incremental changes in input affect the explanations provided by different XAI methods. Through this approach, we aim to evaluate the models' capability to generalize and abstract semantic concepts accurately and to evaluate different XAI methods in correctly capturing the model behaviour. This paper contributes to the broader discourse on AI interpretability by proposing a quantitative measure for semantic continuity for XAI methods, offering insights into the models' and explainers' internal reasoning processes, and promoting more reliable and transparent AI systems.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformer (ViT) has become one of the most prevailing fundamental backbone networks in the computer vision community. Despite the high accuracy, deploying it in real applications raises critical challenges including the high computational cost and inference latency. Recently, the post-training quantization (PTQ) technique has emerged as a promising way to enhance ViT's efficiency. Nevertheless, existing PTQ approaches for ViT suffer from the inflexible quantization on the post-Softmax and post-GELU activations that obey the power-law-like distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel non-uniform quantizer, dubbed the Adaptive Logarithm AdaLog (AdaLog) quantizer. It optimizes the logarithmic base to accommodate the power-law-like distribution of activations, while simultaneously allowing for hardware-friendly quantization and de-quantization. By employing the bias reparameterization, the AdaLog quantizer is applicable to both the post-Softmax and post-GELU activations. Moreover, we develop an efficient Fast Progressive Combining Search (FPCS) strategy to determine the optimal logarithm base for AdaLog, as well as the scaling factors and zero points for the uniform quantizers. Extensive experimental results on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for various ViT-based architectures and vision tasks including classification, object detection, and instance segmentation.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in image generation, often times outperforming other generative models. Since their introduction, the powerful noise-to-image denoising pipeline has been extended to various discriminative tasks, including image segmentation. In case of medical imaging, often times the images are large 3D scans, where segmenting one image using DPMs become extremely inefficient due to large memory consumption and time consuming iterative sampling process. In this work, we propose a novel conditional generative modeling framework (LDSeg) that performs diffusion in latent space for medical image segmentation. Our proposed framework leverages the learned inherent low-dimensional latent distribution of the target object shapes and source image embeddings. The conditional diffusion in latent space not only ensures accurate n-D image segmentation for multi-label objects, but also mitigates the major underlying problems of the traditional DPM based segmentation: (1) large memory consumption, (2) time consuming sampling process and (3) unnatural noise injection in forward/reverse process. LDSeg achieved state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy on three medical image datasets with different imaging modalities. Furthermore, we show that our proposed model is significantly more robust to noises, compared to the traditional deterministic segmentation models, which can be potential in solving the domain shift problems in the medical imaging domain.

- **Summary**: The emotion recognition has attracted more attention in recent decades. Although significant progress has been made in the recognition technology of the seven basic emotions, existing methods are still hard to tackle compound emotion recognition that occurred commonly in practical application. This article introduces our achievements in the 7th Field Emotion Behavior Analysis (ABAW) competition. In the competition, we selected pre trained ResNet18 and Transformer, which have been widely validated, as the basic network framework. Considering the continuity of emotions over time, we propose a time pyramid structure network for frame level emotion prediction. Furthermore. At the same time, in order to address the lack of data in composite emotion recognition, we utilized fine-grained labels from the DFEW database to construct training data for emotion categories in competitions. Taking into account the characteristics of valence arousal of various complex emotions, we constructed a classification framework from coarse to fine in the label space.

- **Summary**: Online Temporal Action Localization (On-TAL) is a critical task that aims to instantaneously identify action instances in untrimmed streaming videos as soon as an action concludes -- a major leap from frame-based Online Action Detection (OAD). Yet, the challenge of detecting overlapping actions is often overlooked even though it is a common scenario in streaming videos. Current methods that can address concurrent actions depend heavily on class information, limiting their flexibility. This paper introduces ActionSwitch, the first class-agnostic On-TAL framework capable of detecting overlapping actions. By obviating the reliance on class information, ActionSwitch provides wider applicability to various situations, including overlapping actions of the same class or scenarios where class information is unavailable. This approach is complemented by the proposed "conservativeness loss", which directly embeds a conservative decision-making principle into the loss function for On-TAL. Our ActionSwitch achieves state-of-the-art performance in complex datasets, including Epic-Kitchens 100 targeting the challenging egocentric view and FineAction consisting of fine-grained actions.

- **Summary**: Spatial Transcriptomics is a novel technology that aligns histology images with spatially resolved gene expression profiles. Although groundbreaking, it struggles with gene capture yielding high corruption in acquired data. Given potential applications, recent efforts have focused on predicting transcriptomic profiles solely from histology images. However, differences in databases, preprocessing techniques, and training hyperparameters hinder a fair comparison between methods. To address these challenges, we present a systematically curated and processed database collected from 26 public sources, representing an 8.6-fold increase compared to previous works. Additionally, we propose a state-of-the-art transformer based completion technique for inferring missing gene expression, which significantly boosts the performance of transcriptomic profile predictions across all datasets. Altogether, our contributions constitute the most comprehensive benchmark of gene expression prediction from histology images to date and a stepping stone for future research on spatial transcriptomics.

- **Summary**: Masked AutoEncoders (MAE) have emerged as a robust self-supervised framework, offering remarkable performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. To increase the difficulty of the pretext task and learn richer visual representations, existing works have focused on replacing standard random masking with more sophisticated strategies, such as adversarial-guided and teacher-guided masking. However, these strategies depend on the input data thus commonly increasing the model complexity and requiring additional calculations to generate the mask patterns. This raises the question: Can we enhance MAE performance beyond random masking without relying on input data or incurring additional computational costs? In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective data-independent method, termed ColorMAE, which generates different binary mask patterns by filtering random noise. Drawing inspiration from color noise in image processing, we explore four types of filters to yield mask patterns with different spatial and semantic priors. ColorMAE requires no additional learnable parameters or computational overhead in the network, yet it significantly enhances the learned representations. We provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation, demonstrating our strategy's superiority in downstream tasks compared to random masking. Notably, we report an improvement of 2.72 in mIoU in semantic segmentation tasks relative to baseline MAE implementations.

- **Summary**: Faithful real-time facial animation is essential for avatar-mediated telepresence in Virtual Reality (VR). To emulate authentic communication, avatar animation needs to be efficient and accurate: able to capture both extreme and subtle expressions within a few milliseconds to sustain the rhythm of natural conversations. The oblique and incomplete views of the face, variability in the donning of headsets, and illumination variation due to the environment are some of the unique challenges in generalization to unseen faces. In this paper, we present a method that can animate a photorealistic avatar in realtime from head-mounted cameras (HMCs) on a consumer VR headset. We present a self-supervised learning approach, based on a cross-view reconstruction objective, that enables generalization to unseen users. We present a lightweight expression calibration mechanism that increases accuracy with minimal additional cost to run-time efficiency. We present an improved parameterization for precise ground-truth generation that provides robustness to environmental variation. The resulting system produces accurate facial animation for unseen users wearing VR headsets in realtime. We compare our approach to prior face-encoding methods demonstrating significant improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative results.
