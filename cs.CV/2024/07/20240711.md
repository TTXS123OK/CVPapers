- **Summary**: Tasks at the intersection of vision and language have had a profound impact in advancing the capabilities of vision-language models such as dialog-based assistants. However, models trained on existing tasks are largely limited to turn-based interactions, where each turn must be stepped (i.e., prompted) by the user. Open-ended, asynchronous interactions where an AI model may proactively deliver timely responses or feedback based on the unfolding situation in real-time are an open challenge. In this work, we present the QEVD benchmark and dataset which explores human-AI interaction in the challenging, yet controlled, real-world domain of fitness coaching - a task which intrinsically requires monitoring live user activity and providing timely feedback. It is the first benchmark that requires assistive vision-language models to recognize complex human actions, identify mistakes grounded in those actions, and provide appropriate feedback. Our experiments reveal the limitations of existing state of the art vision-language models for such asynchronous situated interactions. Motivated by this, we propose a simple end-to-end streaming baseline that can respond asynchronously to human actions with appropriate feedbacks at the appropriate time.

- **Summary**: Urban waterlogging poses a major risk to public safety and infrastructure. Conventional methods using water-level sensors need high-maintenance to hardly achieve full coverage. Recent advances employ surveillance camera imagery and deep learning for detection, yet these struggle amidst scarce data and adverse environmental conditions. In this paper, we establish a challenging Urban Waterlogging Benchmark (UW-Bench) under diverse adverse conditions to advance real-world applications. We propose a Large-Small Model co-adapter paradigm (LSM-adapter), which harnesses the substantial generic segmentation potential of large model and the specific task-directed guidance of small model. Specifically, a Triple-S Prompt Adapter module alongside a Dynamic Prompt Combiner are proposed to generate then merge multiple prompts for mask decoder adaptation. Meanwhile, a Histogram Equalization Adap-ter module is designed to infuse the image specific information for image encoder adaptation. Results and analysis show the challenge and superiority of our developed benchmark and algorithm. Project page: \url{https://github.com/zhang-chenxu/LSM-Adapter}

- **Summary**: Dataset distillation synthesizes a small set of images from a large-scale real dataset such that synthetic and real images share similar behavioral properties (e.g, distributions of gradients or features) during a training process. Through extensive analyses on current methods and real datasets, together with empirical observations, we provide in this paper two important things to share for dataset distillation. First, object parts that appear on one side of a real image are highly likely to appear on the opposite side of another image within a dataset, which we call the bilateral equivalence. Second, the bilateral equivalence enforces synthetic images to duplicate discriminative parts of objects on both the left and right sides of the images, limiting the recognition of subtle differences between objects. To address this problem, we introduce a surprisingly simple yet effective technique for dataset distillation, dubbed FYI, that enables distilling rich semantics of real images into synthetic ones. To this end, FYI embeds a horizontal flipping technique into distillation processes, mitigating the influence of the bilateral equivalence, while capturing more details of objects. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet demonstrate that FYI can be seamlessly integrated into several state-of-the-art methods, without modifying training objectives and network architectures, and it improves the performance remarkably.

- **Summary**: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to detect and temporally locate events within audio and visual modalities. Multiple events can overlap in the timeline, making identification challenging. While traditional methods usually focus on improving the early audio-visual encoders to embed more effective features, the decoding phase -- crucial for final event classification, often receives less attention. We aim to advance the decoding phase and improve its interpretability. Specifically, we introduce a new decoding paradigm, \underline{l}abel s\underline{e}m\underline{a}ntic-based \underline{p}rojection (LEAP), that employs labels texts of event categories, each bearing distinct and explicit semantics, for parsing potentially overlapping events.LEAP works by iteratively projecting encoded latent features of audio/visual segments onto semantically independent label embeddings. This process, enriched by modeling cross-modal (audio/visual-label) interactions, gradually disentangles event semantics within video segments to refine relevant label embeddings, guaranteeing a more discriminative and interpretable decoding process. To facilitate the LEAP paradigm, we propose a semantic-aware optimization strategy, which includes a novel audio-visual semantic similarity loss function. This function leverages the Intersection over Union of audio and visual events (EIoU) as a novel metric to calibrate audio-visual similarities at the feature level, accommodating the varied event densities across modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving new state-of-the-art performance for AVVP and also enhancing the relevant audio-visual event localization task.

- **Summary**: Model inversion (MI) attack reconstructs the private training data of a target model given its output, posing a significant threat to deep learning models and data privacy. On one hand, most of existing MI methods focus on searching for latent codes to represent the target identity, yet this iterative optimization-based scheme consumes a huge number of queries to the target model, making it unrealistic especially in black-box scenario. On the other hand, some training-based methods launch an attack through a single forward inference, whereas failing to directly learn high-level mappings from prediction vectors to images. Addressing these limitations, we propose a novel Prediction-to-Image (P2I) method for black-box MI attack. Specifically, we introduce the Prediction Alignment Encoder to map the target model's output prediction into the latent code of StyleGAN. In this way, prediction vector space can be well aligned with the more disentangled latent space, thus establishing a connection between prediction vectors and the semantic facial features. During the attack phase, we further design the Aligned Ensemble Attack scheme to integrate complementary facial attributes of target identity for better reconstruction. Experimental results show that our method outperforms other SOTAs, e.g.,compared with RLB-MI, our method improves attack accuracy by 8.5% and reduces query numbers by 99% on dataset CelebA.

- **Summary**: The spiking neural networks (SNNs) that efficiently encode temporal sequences have shown great potential in extracting audio-visual joint feature representations. However, coupling SNNs (binary spike sequences) with transformers (float-point sequences) to jointly explore the temporal-semantic information still facing challenges. In this paper, we introduce a novel Spiking Tucker Fusion Transformer (STFT) for audio-visual zero-shot learning (ZSL). The STFT leverage the temporal and semantic information from different time steps to generate robust representations. The time-step factor (TSF) is introduced to dynamically synthesis the subsequent inference information. To guide the formation of input membrane potentials and reduce the spike noise, we propose a global-local pooling (GLP) which combines the max and average pooling operations. Furthermore, the thresholds of the spiking neurons are dynamically adjusted based on semantic and temporal cues. Integrating the temporal and semantic information extracted by SNNs and Transformers are difficult due to the increased number of parameters in a straightforward bilinear model. To address this, we introduce a temporal-semantic Tucker fusion module, which achieves multi-scale fusion of SNN and Transformer outputs while maintaining full second-order interactions. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving state-of-the-art performance in three benchmark datasets. The harmonic mean (HM) improvement of VGGSound, UCF101 and ActivityNet are around 15.4\%, 3.9\%, and 14.9\%, respectively.

- **Summary**: Multispectral oriented object detection faces challenges due to both inter-modal and intra-modal discrepancies. Recent studies often rely on transformer-based models to address these issues and achieve cross-modal fusion detection. However, the quadratic computational complexity of transformers limits their performance. Inspired by the efficiency and lower complexity of Mamba in long sequence tasks, we propose Disparity-guided Multispectral Mamba (DMM), a multispectral oriented object detection framework comprised of a Disparity-guided Cross-modal Fusion Mamba (DCFM) module, a Multi-scale Target-aware Attention (MTA) module, and a Target-Prior Aware (TPA) auxiliary task. The DCFM module leverages disparity information between modalities to adaptively merge features from RGB and IR images, mitigating inter-modal conflicts. The MTA module aims to enhance feature representation by focusing on relevant target regions within the RGB modality, addressing intra-modal variations. The TPA auxiliary task utilizes single-modal labels to guide the optimization of the MTA module, ensuring it focuses on targets and their local context. Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle and VEDAI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: This work addresses a new challenge of understanding human nonverbal interaction in social contexts. Nonverbal signals pervade virtually every communicative act. Our gestures, facial expressions, postures, gaze, even physical appearance all convey messages, without anything being said. Despite their critical role in social life, nonverbal signals receive very limited attention as compared to the linguistic counterparts, and existing solutions typically examine nonverbal cues in isolation. Our study marks the first systematic effort to enhance the interpretation of multifaceted nonverbal signals. First, we contribute a novel large-scale dataset, called NVI, which is meticulously annotated to include bounding boxes for humans and corresponding social groups, along with 22 atomic-level nonverbal behaviors under five broad interaction types. Second, we establish a new task NVI-DET for nonverbal interaction detection, which is formalized as identifying triplets in the form <individual, group, interaction> from images. Third, we propose a nonverbal interaction detection hypergraph (NVI-DEHR), a new approach that explicitly models high-order nonverbal interactions using hypergraphs. Central to the model is a dual multi-scale hypergraph that adeptly addresses individual-to-individual and group-to-group correlations across varying scales, facilitating interactional feature learning and eventually improving interaction prediction. Extensive experiments on NVI show that NVI-DEHR improves various baselines significantly in NVI-DET. It also exhibits leading performance on HOI-DET, confirming its versatility in supporting related tasks and strong generalization ability. We hope that our study will offer the community new avenues to explore nonverbal signals in more depth.

- **Summary**: Surface reconstruction from point clouds is a fundamental challenge in computer graphics and medical imaging. In this paper, we explore the application of advanced neural network architectures for the accurate and efficient reconstruction of surfaces from data points. We introduce a novel variant of the Highway network (Hw) called Square-Highway (SqrHw) within the context of multilayer perceptrons and investigate its performance alongside plain neural networks and a simplified Hw in various numerical examples. These examples include the reconstruction of simple and complex surfaces, such as spheres, human hands, and intricate models like the Stanford Bunny. We analyze the impact of factors such as the number of hidden layers, interior and exterior points, and data distribution on surface reconstruction quality. Our results show that the proposed SqrHw architecture outperforms other neural network configurations, achieving faster convergence and higher-quality surface reconstructions. Additionally, we demonstrate the SqrHw's ability to predict surfaces over missing data, a valuable feature for challenging applications like medical imaging. Furthermore, our study delves into further details, demonstrating that the proposed method based on highway networks yields more stable weight norms and backpropagation gradients compared to the Plain Network architecture. This research not only advances the field of computer graphics but also holds utility for other purposes such as function interpolation and physics-informed neural networks, which integrate multilayer perceptrons into their algorithms.

- **Summary**: The area of portrait image animation, propelled by audio input, has witnessed notable progress in the generation of lifelike and dynamic portraits. Conventional methods are limited to utilizing either audios or facial key points to drive images into videos, while they can yield satisfactory results, certain issues exist. For instance, methods driven solely by audios can be unstable at times due to the relatively weaker audio signal, while methods driven exclusively by facial key points, although more stable in driving, can result in unnatural outcomes due to the excessive control of key point information. In addressing the previously mentioned challenges, in this paper, we introduce a novel approach which we named EchoMimic. EchoMimic is concurrently trained using both audios and facial landmarks. Through the implementation of a novel training strategy, EchoMimic is capable of generating portrait videos not only by audios and facial landmarks individually, but also by a combination of both audios and selected facial landmarks. EchoMimic has been comprehensively compared with alternative algorithms across various public datasets and our collected dataset, showcasing superior performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Additional visualization and access to the source code can be located on the EchoMimic project page.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We propose a novel unsupervised cross-modal homography estimation framework based on intra-modal Self-supervised learning, Correlation, and consistent feature map Projection, namely SCPNet. The concept of intra-modal self-supervised learning is first presented to facilitate the unsupervised cross-modal homography estimation. The correlation-based homography estimation network and the consistent feature map projection are combined to form the learnable architecture of SCPNet, boosting the unsupervised learning framework. SCPNet is the first to achieve effective unsupervised homography estimation on the satellite-map image pair cross-modal dataset, GoogleMap, under [-32,+32] offset on a 128x128 image, leading the supervised approach MHN by 14.0% of mean average corner error (MACE). We further conduct extensive experiments on several cross-modal/spectral and manually-made inconsistent datasets, on which SCPNet achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among unsupervised approaches, and owns 49.0%, 25.2%, 36.4%, and 10.7% lower MACEs than the supervised approach MHN.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose a novel learning-based method to jointly estimate the shape and subsurface scattering (SSS) parameters of translucent objects by utilizing polarization cues. Although polarization cues have been used in various applications, such as shape from polarization (SfP), BRDF estimation, and reflection removal, their application in SSS estimation has not yet been explored. Our observations indicate that the SSS affects not only the light intensity but also the polarization signal. Hence, the polarization signal can provide additional cues for SSS estimation. We also introduce the first large-scale synthetic dataset of polarized translucent objects for training our model. Our method outperforms several baselines from the SfP and inverse rendering realms on both synthetic and real data, as demonstrated by qualitative and quantitative results.

- **Summary**: Understanding of video creativity and content often varies among individuals, with differences in focal points and cognitive levels across different ages, experiences, and genders. There is currently a lack of research in this area, and most existing benchmarks suffer from several drawbacks: 1) a limited number of modalities and answers with restrictive length; 2) the content and scenarios within the videos are excessively monotonous, transmitting allegories and emotions that are overly simplistic. To bridge the gap to real-world applications, we introduce a large-scale \textbf{S}ubjective \textbf{R}esponse \textbf{I}ndicators for \textbf{A}dvertisement \textbf{V}ideos dataset, namely SRI-ADV. Specifically, we collected real changes in Electroencephalographic (EEG) and eye-tracking regions from different demographics while they viewed identical video content. Utilizing this multi-modal dataset, we developed tasks and protocols to analyze and evaluate the extent of cognitive understanding of video content among different users. Along with the dataset, we designed a \textbf{H}ypergraph \textbf{M}ulti-modal \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odel (HMLLM) to explore the associations among different demographics, video elements, EEG and eye-tracking indicators. HMLLM could bridge semantic gaps across rich modalities and integrate information beyond different modalities to perform logical reasoning. Extensive experimental evaluations on SRI-ADV and other additional video-based generative performance benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The codes and dataset will be released at \url{https://github.com/suay1113/HMLLM}.

- **Summary**: Data augmentation remains a widely utilized technique in deep learning, particularly in tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Among them, Copy-Paste is a simple yet effective method and gain great attention recently. However, existing Copy-Paste often overlook contextual relevance between source and target images, resulting in inconsistencies in generated outputs. To address this challenge, we propose a context-aware approach that integrates Bidirectional Latent Information Propagation (BLIP) for content extraction from source images. By matching extracted content information with category information, our method ensures cohesive integration of target objects using Segment Anything Model (SAM) and You Only Look Once (YOLO). This approach eliminates the need for manual annotation, offering an automated and user-friendly solution. Experimental evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enhancing data diversity and generating high-quality pseudo-images across various computer vision tasks.

- **Summary**: Content-based histopathological image retrieval (CBHIR) has gained attention in recent years, offering the capability to return histopathology images that are content-wise similar to the query one from an established database. However, in clinical practice, the continuously expanding size of WSI databases limits the practical application of the current CBHIR methods. In this paper, we propose a Lifelong Whole Slide Retrieval (LWSR) framework to address the challenges of catastrophic forgetting by progressive model updating on continuously growing retrieval database. Our framework aims to achieve the balance between stability and plasticity during continuous learning. To preserve system plasticity, we utilize local memory bank with reservoir sampling method to save instances, which can comprehensively encompass the feature spaces of both old and new tasks. Furthermore, A distance consistency rehearsal (DCR) module is designed to ensure the retrieval queue's consistency for previous tasks, which is regarded as stability within a lifelong CBHIR system. We evaluated the proposed method on four public WSI datasets from TCGA projects. The experimental results have demonstrated the proposed method is effective and is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In this study, we introduce a new problem raised by social media and photojournalism, named Image Address Localization (IAL), which aims to predict the readable textual address where an image was taken. Existing two-stage approaches involve predicting geographical coordinates and converting them into human-readable addresses, which can lead to ambiguity and be resource-intensive. In contrast, we propose an end-to-end framework named AddressCLIP to solve the problem with more semantics, consisting of two key ingredients: i) image-text alignment to align images with addresses and scene captions by contrastive learning, and ii) image-geography matching to constrain image features with the spatial distance in terms of manifold learning. Additionally, we have built three datasets from Pittsburgh and San Francisco on different scales specifically for the IAL problem. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves compelling performance on the proposed datasets and outperforms representative transfer learning methods for vision-language models. Furthermore, extensive ablations and visualizations exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed method. The datasets and source code are available at https://github.com/xsx1001/AddressCLIP.

- **Summary**: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) systems often have imperfect performance, which affects robot navigation decisions. This research introduces a novel Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) integrity monitor for VPR which demonstrates improved performance and generalizability over the previous state-of-the-art SVM approach, removing per-environment training and reducing manual tuning requirements. We test our proposed system in extensive real-world experiments, where we also present two real-time integrity-based VPR verification methods: an instantaneous rejection method for a robot navigating to a goal zone (Experiment 1); and a historical method that takes a best, verified, match from its recent trajectory and uses an odometer to extrapolate forwards to a current position estimate (Experiment 2). Noteworthy results for Experiment 1 include a decrease in aggregate mean along-track goal error from ~9.8m to ~3.1m in missions the robot pursued to completion, and an increase in the aggregate rate of successful mission completion from ~41% to ~55%. Experiment 2 showed a decrease in aggregate mean along-track localization error from ~2.0m to ~0.5m, and an increase in the aggregate precision of localization attempts from ~97% to ~99%. Overall, our results demonstrate the practical usefulness of a VPR integrity monitor in real-world robotics to improve VPR localization and consequent navigation performance.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated significant advantages in representing and synthesizing 3D scenes. Explicit NeRF models facilitate the practical NeRF applications with faster rendering speed, and also attract considerable attention in NeRF compression due to its huge storage cost. To address the challenge of the NeRF compression study, in this paper, we construct a new dataset, called Explicit_NeRF_QA. We use 22 3D objects with diverse geometries, textures, and material complexities to train four typical explicit NeRF models across five parameter levels. Lossy compression is introduced during the model generation, pivoting the selection of key parameters such as hash table size for InstantNGP and voxel grid resolution for Plenoxels. By rendering NeRF samples to processed video sequences (PVS), a large scale subjective experiment with lab environment is conducted to collect subjective scores from 21 viewers. The diversity of content, accuracy of mean opinion scores (MOS), and characteristics of NeRF distortion are comprehensively presented, establishing the heterogeneity of the proposed dataset. The state-of-the-art objective metrics are tested in the new dataset. Best Person correlation, which is around 0.85, is collected from the full-reference objective metric. All tested no-reference metrics report very poor results with 0.4 to 0.6 correlations, demonstrating the need for further development of more robust no-reference metrics. The dataset, including NeRF samples, source 3D objects, multiview images for NeRF generation, PVSs, MOS, is made publicly available at the following location: https://github.com/LittlericeChloe/Explicit_NeRF_QA.

- **Summary**: The precise subtype classification of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) based on multimodal information, which assists clinicians in diagnosis and long-term treatment plans, is of great clinical significance. However, it remains a great challenging task due to the lack of diagnostic representativeness for local patches and the absence of diagnostic-relevant features from a single modality. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Screening and Clinical-Enhanced Network (DSCENet) for the subtype classification of MPNs on the multimodal fusion of whole slide images (WSIs) and clinical information. (1) A dynamic screening module is proposed to flexibly adapt the feature learning of local patches, reducing the interference of irrelevant features and enhancing their diagnostic representativeness. (2) A clinical-enhanced fusion module is proposed to integrate clinical indicators to explore complementary features across modalities, providing comprehensive diagnostic information. Our approach has been validated on the real clinical data, achieving an increase of 7.91% AUC and 16.89% accuracy compared with the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

- **Summary**: Estimating depth from a single image is a challenging visual task. Compared to relative depth estimation, metric depth estimation attracts more attention due to its practical physical significance and critical applications in real-life scenarios. However, existing metric depth estimation methods are typically trained on specific datasets with similar scenes, facing challenges in generalizing across scenes with significant scale variations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel monocular depth estimation method called ScaleDepth. Our method decomposes metric depth into scene scale and relative depth, and predicts them through a semantic-aware scale prediction (SASP) module and an adaptive relative depth estimation (ARDE) module, respectively. The proposed ScaleDepth enjoys several merits. First, the SASP module can implicitly combine structural and semantic features of the images to predict precise scene scales. Second, the ARDE module can adaptively estimate the relative depth distribution of each image within a normalized depth space. Third, our method achieves metric depth estimation for both indoor and outdoor scenes in a unified framework, without the need for setting the depth range or fine-tuning model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art performance across indoor, outdoor, unconstrained, and unseen scenes.

- **Summary**: Two-view pose estimation is essential for map-free visual relocalization and object pose tracking tasks. However, traditional matching methods suffer from time-consuming robust estimators, while deep learning-based pose regressors only cater to camera-to-world pose estimation, lacking generalizability to different image sizes and camera intrinsics. In this paper, we propose SRPose, a sparse keypoint-based framework for two-view relative pose estimation in camera-to-world and object-to-camera scenarios. SRPose consists of a sparse keypoint detector, an intrinsic-calibration position encoder, and promptable prior knowledge-guided attention layers. Given two RGB images of a fixed scene or a moving object, SRPose estimates the relative camera or 6D object pose transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRPose achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed, showing generalizability to both scenarios. It is robust to different image sizes and camera intrinsics, and can be deployed with low computing resources.

- **Summary**: Soccer is one of the most popular sport worldwide, with live broadcasts frequently available for major matches. However, extracting detailed, frame-by-frame information on player actions from these videos remains a challenge. Utilizing state-of-the-art computer vision technologies, our system can detect key objects such as soccer balls, players and referees. It also tracks the movements of players and the ball, recognizes player numbers, classifies scenes, and identifies highlights such as goal kicks. By analyzing live TV streams of soccer matches, our system can generate highlight GIFs, tactical illustrations, and diverse summary graphs of ongoing games. Through these visual recognition techniques, we deliver a comprehensive understanding of soccer game videos, enriching the viewer's experience with detailed and insightful analysis.



### Enriching Information and Preserving Semantic Consistency in Expanding Curvilinear Object Segmentation Datasets

- **Summary**: Curvilinear object segmentation plays a crucial role across various applications, yet datasets in this domain often suffer from small scale due to the high costs associated with data acquisition and annotation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach for expanding curvilinear object segmentation datasets, focusing on enhancing the informativeness of generated data and the consistency between semantic maps and generated images.   Our method enriches synthetic data informativeness by generating curvilinear objects through their multiple textual features. By combining textual features from each sample in original dataset, we obtain synthetic images that beyond the original dataset's distribution. This initiative necessitated the creation of the Curvilinear Object Segmentation based on Text Generation (COSTG) dataset. Designed to surpass the limitations of conventional datasets, COSTG incorporates not only standard semantic maps but also some textual descriptions of curvilinear object features.   To ensure consistency between synthetic semantic maps and images, we introduce the Semantic Consistency Preserving ControlNet (SCP ControlNet). This involves an adaptation of ControlNet with Spatially-Adaptive Normalization (SPADE), allowing it to preserve semantic information that would typically be washed away in normalization layers. This modification facilitates more accurate semantic image synthesis.   Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across three types of curvilinear objects (angiography, crack and retina) and six public datasets (CHUAC, XCAD, DCA1, DRIVE, CHASEDB1 and Crack500). The synthetic data generated by our method not only expand the dataset, but also effectively improves the performance of other curvilinear object segmentation models.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the advent of spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology has unlocked unprecedented opportunities for delving into the complexities of gene expression patterns within intricate biological systems. Despite its transformative potential, the prohibitive cost of ST technology remains a significant barrier to its widespread adoption in large-scale studies. An alternative, more cost-effective strategy involves employing artificial intelligence to predict gene expression levels using readily accessible whole-slide images (WSIs) stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E). However, existing methods have yet to fully capitalize on multimodal information provided by H&E images and ST data with spatial location. In this paper, we propose \textbf{mclSTExp}, a multimodal contrastive learning with Transformer and Densenet-121 encoder for Spatial Transcriptomics Expression prediction. We conceptualize each spot as a "word", integrating its intrinsic features with spatial context through the self-attention mechanism of a Transformer encoder. This integration is further enriched by incorporating image features via contrastive learning, thereby enhancing the predictive capability of our model. Our extensive evaluation of \textbf{mclSTExp} on two breast cancer datasets and a skin squamous cell carcinoma dataset demonstrates its superior performance in predicting spatial gene expression. Moreover, mclSTExp has shown promise in interpreting cancer-specific overexpressed genes, elucidating immune-related genes, and identifying specialized spatial domains annotated by pathologists.

- **Summary**: Neural rendering methods can achieve near-photorealistic image synthesis of scenes from posed input images. However, when the images are imperfect, e.g., captured in very low-light conditions, state-of-the-art methods fail to reconstruct high-quality 3D scenes. Recent approaches have tried to address this limitation by modeling various degradation processes in the image formation model; however, this limits them to specific image degradations. In this paper, we propose a generalizable neural rendering method that can perform high-fidelity novel view synthesis under several degradations. Our method, GAURA, is learning-based and does not require any test-time scene-specific optimization. It is trained on a synthetic dataset that includes several degradation types. GAURA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks for low-light enhancement, dehazing, deraining, and on-par for motion deblurring. Further, our model can be efficiently fine-tuned to any new incoming degradation using minimal data. We thus demonstrate adaptation results on two unseen degradations, desnowing and removing defocus blur. Code and video results are available at vinayak-vg.github.io/GAURA.

- **Summary**: Event cameras, mimicking the human retina, capture brightness changes with unparalleled temporal resolution and dynamic range. Integrating events into intensities poses a highly ill-posed challenge, marred by initial condition ambiguities. Traditional regression-based deep learning methods fall short in perceptual quality, offering deterministic and often unrealistic reconstructions. In this paper, we introduce diffusion models to events-to-video reconstruction, achieving colorful, realistic, and perceptually superior video generation from achromatic events. Powered by the image generation ability and knowledge of pretrained diffusion models, the proposed method can achieve a better trade-off between the perception and distortion of the reconstructed frame compared to previous solutions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach can produce diverse, realistic frames with faithfulness to the given events.

- **Summary**: Face anti-spoofing techniques based on domain generalization have recently been studied widely. Adversarial learning and meta-learning techniques have been adopted to learn domain-invariant representations. However, prior approaches often consider the dataset gap as the primary factor behind domain shifts. This perspective is not fine-grained enough to reflect the intrinsic gap among the data accurately. In our work, we redefine domains based on identities rather than datasets, aiming to disentangle liveness and identity attributes. We emphasize ignoring the adverse effect of identity shift, focusing on learning identity-invariant liveness representations through orthogonalizing liveness and identity features. To cope with style shifts, we propose Style Cross module to expand the stylistic diversity and Channel-wise Style Attention module to weaken the sensitivity to style shifts, aiming to learn robust liveness representations. Furthermore, acknowledging the asymmetry between live and spoof samples, we introduce a novel contrastive loss, Asymmetric Augmented Instance Contrast. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under cross-dataset and limited source dataset scenarios. Additionally, our method has good scalability when expanding diversity of identities. The codes will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Most recent unsupervised non-rigid 3D shape matching methods are based on the functional map framework due to its efficiency and superior performance. Nevertheless, respective methods struggle to obtain spatially smooth pointwise correspondences due to the lack of proper regularisation. In this work, inspired by the success of message passing on graphs, we propose a synchronous diffusion process which we use as regularisation to achieve smoothness in non-rigid 3D shape matching problems. The intuition of synchronous diffusion is that diffusing the same input function on two different shapes results in consistent outputs. Using different challenging datasets, we demonstrate that our novel regularisation can substantially improve the state-of-the-art in shape matching, especially in the presence of topological noise.

- **Summary**: Federated learning, a distributed learning paradigm, utilizes multiple clients to build a robust global model. In real-world applications, local clients often operate within their limited domains, leading to a `domain shift' across clients. Privacy concerns limit each client's learning to its own domain data, which increase the risk of overfitting. Moreover, the process of aggregating models trained on own limited domain can be potentially lead to a significant degradation in the global model performance. To deal with these challenges, we introduce the concept of federated feature diversification. Each client diversifies the own limited domain data by leveraging global feature statistics, i.e., the aggregated average statistics over all participating clients, shared through the global model's parameters. This data diversification helps local models to learn client-invariant representations while preserving privacy. Our resultant global model shows robust performance on unseen test domain data. To enhance performance further, we develop an instance-adaptive inference approach tailored for test domain data. Our proposed instance feature adapter dynamically adjusts feature statistics to align with the test input, thereby reducing the domain gap between the test and training domains. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several domain generalization benchmarks within a federated learning setting.

- **Summary**: This paper focuses on the dataset-free Blind Image Super-Resolution (BISR). Unlike existing dataset-free BISR methods that focus on obtaining a degradation kernel for the entire image, we are the first to explicitly design a spatially-variant degradation model for each pixel. Our method also benefits from having a significantly smaller number of learnable parameters compared to data-driven spatially-variant BISR methods. Concretely, each pixel's degradation kernel is expressed as a linear combination of a learnable dictionary composed of a small number of spatially-variant atom kernels. The coefficient matrices of the atom degradation kernels are derived using membership functions of fuzzy set theory. We construct a novel Probabilistic BISR model with tailored likelihood function and prior terms. Subsequently, we employ the Monte Carlo EM algorithm to infer the degradation kernels for each pixel. Our method achieves a significant improvement over other state-of-the-art BISR methods, with an average improvement of 1 dB (2x).Code will be released at https://github.com/shaojieguoECNU/SVDSR.

- **Summary**: Efficient extraction of spectral sequences and geospatial information has always been a hot topic in hyperspectral image classification. In terms of spectral sequence feature capture, RNN and Transformer have become mainstream classification frameworks due to their long-range feature capture capabilities. In terms of spatial information aggregation, CNN enhances the receptive field to retain integrated spatial information as much as possible. However, the spectral feature-capturing architectures exhibit low computational efficiency, and CNNs lack the flexibility to perceive spatial contextual information. To address these issues, this paper proposes GraphMamba--an efficient graph structure learning vision Mamba classification framework that fully considers HSI characteristics to achieve deep spatial-spectral information mining. Specifically, we propose a novel hyperspectral visual GraphMamba processing paradigm (HVGM) that preserves spatial-spectral features by constructing spatial-spectral cubes and utilizes linear spectral encoding to enhance the operability of subsequent tasks. The core components of GraphMamba include the HyperMamba module for improving computational efficiency and the SpectralGCN module for adaptive spatial context awareness. The HyperMamba mitigates clutter interference by employing the global mask (GM) and introduces a parallel training inference architecture to alleviate computational bottlenecks. The SpatialGCN incorporates weighted multi-hop aggregation (WMA) spatial encoding to focus on highly correlated spatial structural features, thus flexibly aggregating contextual information while mitigating spatial noise interference. Extensive experiments were conducted on three different scales of real HSI datasets, and compared with the state-of-the-art classification frameworks, GraphMamba achieved optimal performance.

- **Summary**: Compressed Sensing (CS) facilitates rapid image acquisition by selecting a small subset of measurements sufficient for high-fidelity reconstruction. Adaptive CS seeks to further enhance this process by dynamically choosing future measurements based on information gleaned from data that is already acquired. However, many existing frameworks are often tailored to specific tasks and require intricate training procedures. We propose AdaSense, a novel Adaptive CS approach that leverages zero-shot posterior sampling with pre-trained diffusion models. By sequentially sampling from the posterior distribution, we can quantify the uncertainty of each possible future linear measurement throughout the acquisition process. AdaSense eliminates the need for additional training and boasts seamless adaptation to diverse domains with minimal tuning requirements. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaSense in reconstructing facial images from a small number of measurements. Furthermore, we apply AdaSense for active acquisition of medical images in the domains of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), highlighting its potential for tangible real-world acceleration.

- **Summary**: Models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transformers have steadily been improved. They also have been applied in various computer vision downstream tasks. However, in object detection tasks, accurately localizing and classifying almost infinite categories of foods in images remains challenging. To address these problems, we first segmented the food as the region-of-interest (ROI) by using the segment-anything model (SAM) and masked the rest of the region except ROI as black pixels. This process simplified the problems into a single classification for which annotation and training were much simpler than object detection. The images in which only the ROI was preserved were fed as inputs to fine-tune various off-the-shelf models that encoded their own inductive biases. Among them, Data-efficient image Transformers (DeiTs) had the best classification performance. Nonetheless, when foods' shapes and textures were similar, the contextual features of the ROI-only images were not enough for accurate classification. Therefore, we introduced a novel type of combined architecture, RveRNet, which consisted of ROI, extra-ROI, and integration modules that allowed it to account for both the ROI's and global contexts. The RveRNet's F1 score was 10% better than other individual models when classifying ambiguous food images. If the RveRNet's modules were DeiT with the knowledge distillation from the CNN, performed the best. We investigated how architectures can be made robust against input noise caused by permutation and translocation. The results indicated that there was a trade-off between how much the CNN teacher's knowledge could be distilled to DeiT and DeiT's innate strength.

- **Summary**: Large-scale LiDAR mappings and localization leverage place recognition techniques to mitigate odometry drifts, ensuring accurate mapping. These techniques utilize scene representations from LiDAR point clouds to identify previously visited sites within a database. Local descriptors, assigned to each point within a point cloud, are aggregated to form a scene representation for the point cloud. These descriptors are also used to re-rank the retrieved point clouds based on geometric fitness scores. We propose SALSA, a novel, lightweight, and efficient framework for LiDAR place recognition. It consists of a Sphereformer backbone that uses radial window attention to enable information aggregation for sparse distant points, an adaptive self-attention layer to pool local descriptors into tokens, and a multi-layer-perceptron Mixer layer for aggregating the tokens to generate a scene descriptor. The proposed framework outperforms existing methods on various LiDAR place recognition datasets in terms of both retrieval and metric localization while operating in real-time.

- **Summary**: Thermal infrared tracking is an essential topic in computer vision tasks because of its advantage of all-weather imaging. However, most conventional methods utilize only hand-crafted features, while deep learning-based correlation filtering methods are limited by simple correlation operations. Transformer-based methods ignore temporal and coordinate information, which is critical for TIR tracking that lacks texture and color information. In this paper, to address these issues, we apply natural language modeling to TIR tracking and propose a novel model called NLMTrack, which enhances the utilization of coordinate and temporal information. NLMTrack applies an encoder that unifies feature extraction and feature fusion, which simplifies the TIR tracking pipeline. To address the challenge of low detail and low contrast in TIR images, on the one hand, we design a multi-level progressive fusion module that enhances the semantic representation and incorporates multi-scale features. On the other hand, the decoder combines the TIR features and the coordinate sequence features using a causal transformer to generate the target sequence step by step. Moreover, we explore an adaptive loss aimed at elevating tracking accuracy and a simple template update strategy to accommodate the target's appearance variations. Experiments show that NLMTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. The Code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/ELOESZHANG/NLMTrack}.

- **Summary**: CLIP, as a vision-language model, has significantly advanced Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) with its zero-shot capabilities. Despite its success, its application to OVSS faces challenges due to its initial image-level alignment training, which affects its performance in tasks requiring detailed local context. Our study delves into the impact of CLIP's [CLS] token on patch feature correlations, revealing a dominance of "global" patches that hinders local feature discrimination. To overcome this, we propose CLIPtrase, a novel training-free semantic segmentation strategy that enhances local feature awareness through recalibrated self-correlation among patches. This approach demonstrates notable improvements in segmentation accuracy and the ability to maintain semantic coherence across objects.Experiments show that we are 22.3% ahead of CLIP on average on 9 segmentation benchmarks, outperforming existing state-of-the-art training-free methods.The code are made publicly available at: https://github.com/leaves162/CLIPtrase.

- **Summary**: The performance of object detection systems in automotive solutions must be as high as possible, with minimal response time and, due to the often battery-powered operation, low energy consumption. When designing such solutions, we therefore face challenges typical for embedded vision systems: the problem of fitting algorithms of high memory and computational complexity into small low-power devices. In this paper we propose PowerYOLO - a mixed precision solution, which targets three essential elements of such application. First, we propose a system based on a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS), a novel sensor, that offers low power requirements and operates well in conditions with variable illumination. It is these features that may make event cameras a preferential choice over frame cameras in some applications. Second, to ensure high accuracy and low memory and computational complexity, we propose to use 4-bit width Powers-of-Two (PoT) quantisation for convolution weights of the YOLO detector, with all other parameters quantised linearly. Finally, we embrace from PoT scheme and replace multiplication with bit-shifting to increase the efficiency of hardware acceleration of such solution, with a special convolution-batch normalisation fusion scheme. The use of specific sensor with PoT quantisation and special batch normalisation fusion leads to a unique system with almost 8x reduction in memory complexity and vast computational simplifications, with relation to a standard approach. This efficient system achieves high accuracy of mAP 0.301 on the GEN1 DVS dataset, marking the new state-of-the-art for such compressed model.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present a novel approach for general object segmentation from a monocular image, eliminating the need for manually labeled training data and enabling rapid, straightforward training and adaptation with minimal data. Our model initially learns from LiDAR during the training process, which is subsequently removed from the system, allowing it to function solely on monocular imagery. This study leverages the concept of the Stixel-World to recognize a medium level representation of its surroundings. Our network directly predicts a 2D multi-layer Stixel-World and is capable of recognizing and locating multiple, superimposed objects within an image. Due to the scarcity of comparable works, we have divided the capabilities into modules and present a free space detection in our experiments section. Furthermore, we introduce an improved method for generating Stixels from LiDAR data, which we use as ground truth for our network.

- **Summary**: We present WayveScenes101, a dataset designed to help the community advance the state of the art in novel view synthesis that focuses on challenging driving scenes containing many dynamic and deformable elements with changing geometry and texture. The dataset comprises 101 driving scenes across a wide range of environmental conditions and driving scenarios. The dataset is designed for benchmarking reconstructions on in-the-wild driving scenes, with many inherent challenges for scene reconstruction methods including image glare, rapid exposure changes, and highly dynamic scenes with significant occlusion. Along with the raw images, we include COLMAP-derived camera poses in standard data formats. We propose an evaluation protocol for evaluating models on held-out camera views that are off-axis from the training views, specifically testing the generalisation capabilities of methods. Finally, we provide detailed metadata for all scenes, including weather, time of day, and traffic conditions, to allow for a detailed model performance breakdown across scene characteristics.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in mobile mapping systems have greatly enhanced the efficiency and convenience of acquiring urban 3D data. These systems utilize LiDAR sensors mounted on vehicles to capture vast cityscapes. However, a significant challenge arises due to occlusions caused by roadside parked vehicles, leading to the loss of scene information, particularly on the roads, sidewalks, curbs, and the lower sections of buildings. In this study, we present a novel approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn a model capable of filling gaps in urban scenes that are obscured by vehicle occlusion. We have developed an innovative technique where we place virtual vehicle models along road boundaries in the gap-free scene and utilize a ray-casting algorithm to create a new scene with occluded gaps. This allows us to generate diverse and realistic urban point cloud scenes with and without vehicle occlusion, surpassing the limitations of real-world training data collection and annotation. Furthermore, we introduce the Scene Gap Completion Network (SGC-Net), an end-to-end model that can generate well-defined shape boundaries and smooth surfaces within occluded gaps. The experiment results reveal that 97.66% of the filled points fall within a range of 5 centimeters relative to the high-density ground truth point cloud scene. These findings underscore the efficacy of our proposed model in gap completion and reconstructing urban scenes affected by vehicle occlusions.

- **Summary**: Vegetation indices allow to efficiently monitor vegetation growth and agricultural activities. Previous generations of satellites were capturing a limited number of spectral bands, and a few expert-designed vegetation indices were sufficient to harness their potential. New generations of multi- and hyperspectral satellites can however capture additional bands, but are not yet efficiently exploited. In this work, we propose an explainable-AI-based method to select and design suitable vegetation indices. We first train a deep neural network using multispectral satellite data, then extract feature importance to identify the most influential bands. We subsequently select suitable existing vegetation indices or modify them to incorporate the identified bands and retrain our model. We validate our approach on a crop classification task. Our results indicate that models trained on individual indices achieve comparable results to the baseline model trained on all bands, while the combination of two indices surpasses the baseline in certain cases.

- **Summary**: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly emphasize complex understanding of various visual elements, including multiple objects, text information, and spatial relations. Their development for comprehensive visual perception hinges on the availability of high-quality image-text datasets that offer diverse visual elements and throughout image descriptions. However, the scarcity of such hyper-detailed datasets currently hinders progress within the MLLM community. The bottleneck stems from the limited perceptual capabilities of current caption engines, which fall short in providing complete and accurate annotations. To facilitate the cutting-edge research of MLLMs on comprehensive vision perception, we thereby propose Perceptual Fusion, using a low-budget but highly effective caption engine for complete and accurate image descriptions. Specifically, Perceptual Fusion integrates diverse perception experts as image priors to provide explicit information on visual elements and adopts an efficient MLLM as a centric pivot to mimic advanced MLLMs' perception abilities. We carefully select 1M highly representative images from uncurated LAION dataset and generate dense descriptions using our engine, dubbed DenseFusion-1M. Extensive experiments validate that our engine outperforms its counterparts, where the resulting dataset significantly improves the perception and cognition abilities of existing MLLMs across diverse vision-language benchmarks, especially with high-resolution images as inputs.

- **Summary**: Surgical phase recognition is crucial for enhancing the efficiency and safety of computer-assisted interventions. One of the fundamental challenges involves modeling the long-distance temporal relationships present in surgical videos. Inspired by the recent success of Mamba, a state space model with linear scalability in sequence length, this paper presents SR-Mamba, a novel attention-free model specifically tailored to meet the challenges of surgical phase recognition. In SR-Mamba, we leverage a bidirectional Mamba decoder to effectively model the temporal context in overlong sequences. Moreover, the efficient optimization of the proposed Mamba decoder facilitates single-step neural network training, eliminating the need for separate training steps as in previous works. This single-step training approach not only simplifies the training process but also ensures higher accuracy, even with a lighter spatial feature extractor. Our SR-Mamba establishes a new benchmark in surgical video analysis by demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the Cholec80 and CATARACTS Challenge datasets.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a deep feature extractor for iris recognition at arbitrary resolutions. Resolution degradation reduces the recognition performance of deep learning models trained by high-resolution images. Using various-resolution images for training can improve the model's robustness while sacrificing recognition performance for high-resolution images. To achieve higher recognition performance at various resolutions, we propose a method of resolution-adaptive feature extraction with automatically switching networks. Our framework includes resolution expert modules specialized for different resolution degradations, including down-sampling and out-of-focus blurring. The framework automatically switches them depending on the degradation condition of an input image. Lower-resolution experts are trained by knowledge-distillation from the high-resolution expert in such a manner that both experts can extract common identity features. We applied our framework to three conventional neural network models. The experimental results show that our method enhances the recognition performance at low-resolution in the conventional methods and also maintains their performance at high-resolution.

- **Summary**: The proposed work establishes a novel Graphical User Interface (GUI) framework, primarily designed for intraoperative pedicle screw planning. Current planning workflow in Image Guided Surgeries primarily relies on pre-operative CT planning. Intraoperative CT planning can be time-consuming and expensive and thus is not a common practice. In situations where efficiency and cost-effectiveness are paramount, planning to utilize fluoroscopic images acquired for image registration emerges as the optimal choice. The methodology proposed in this study employs a simulated 3D pedicle screw to calculate its coronal and sagittal projections for pedicle screw planning using anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral (LP) images. The initialization and placement of pedicle screw is computed by utilizing the bounding box of vertebral segmentation, which is obtained by the application of enhanced YOLOv5. The GUI front end includes functionality that allows surgeons or medical practitioners to efficiently choose, set up, and dynamically maneuver the pedicle screw on AP and LP images. This is based on a novel feature called synchronous planning, which involves correlating pedicle screws from the coronal and sagittal planes. This correlation utilizes projective correspondence to ensure that any movement of the pedicle screw in either the AP or LP image will be reflected in the other image. The proposed GUI framework is a time-efficient and cost-effective tool for synchronizing and planning the movement of pedicle screws during intraoperative surgical procedures.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose an innovative Graphical User Interface (GUI) aimed at improving preoperative planning and intra-operative guidance for precise spinal screw placement through vertebrae segmentation. The methodology encompasses both front-end and back-end computations. The front end comprises a GUI that allows surgeons to precisely adjust the placement of screws on X-Ray images, thereby improving the simulation of surgical screw insertion in the patient's spine. On the other hand, the back-end processing involves several steps, including acquiring spinal X-ray images, performing pre-processing techniques to reduce noise, and training a neural network model to achieve real-time segmentation of the vertebrae. The integration of vertebral segmentation in the GUI ensures precise screw placement, reducing complications like nerve injury and ultimately improving surgical outcomes. The Spine-Vision provides a comprehensive solution with innovative features like synchronous AP-LP planning, accurate screw positioning via vertebrae segmentation, effective screw visualization, and dynamic position adjustments. This X-ray image-based GUI workflow emerges as a valuable tool, enhancing precision and safety in spinal screw placement and planning procedures.

- **Summary**: In recent years there has been a growing interest in event cameras, i.e. vision sensors that record changes in illumination independently for each pixel. This type of operation ensures that acquisition is possible in very adverse lighting conditions, both in low light and high dynamic range, and reduces average power consumption. In addition, the independent operation of each pixel results in low latency, which is desirable for robotic solutions. Nowadays, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), along with general-purpose processors (GPPs/CPUs) and programmable graphics processing units (GPUs), are popular architectures for implementing and accelerating computing tasks. In particular, their usefulness in the embedded vision domain has been repeatedly demonstrated over the past 30 years, where they have enabled fast data processing (even in real-time) and energy efficiency. Hence, the combination of event cameras and reconfigurable devices seems to be a good solution, especially in the context of energy-efficient real-time embedded systems. This paper gives an overview of the most important works, where FPGAs have been used in different contexts to process event data. It covers applications in the following areas: filtering, stereovision, optical flow, acceleration of AI-based algorithms (including spiking neural networks) for object classification, detection and tracking, and applications in robotics and inspection systems. Current trends and challenges for such systems are also discussed.

- **Summary**: We propose a new topological tool for computer vision - Scalar Function Topology Divergence (SFTD), which measures the dissimilarity of multi-scale topology between sublevel sets of two functions having a common domain. Functions can be defined on an undirected graph or Euclidean space of any dimensionality. Most of the existing methods for comparing topology are based on Wasserstein distance between persistence barcodes and they don't take into account the localization of topological features. On the other hand, the minimization of SFTD ensures that the corresponding topological features of scalar functions are located in the same places. The proposed tool provides useful visualizations depicting areas where functions have topological dissimilarities. We provide applications of the proposed method to 3D computer vision. In particular, experiments demonstrate that SFTD improves the reconstruction of cellular 3D shapes from 2D fluorescence microscopy images, and helps to identify topological errors in 3D segmentation.

- **Summary**: Robotic grasping in clutters is a fundamental task in robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose an economic framework for 6-DoF grasp detection, aiming to economize the resource cost in training and meanwhile maintain effective grasp performance. To begin with, we discover that the dense supervision is the bottleneck of current SOTA methods that severely encumbers the entire training overload, meanwhile making the training difficult to converge. To solve the above problem, we first propose an economic supervision paradigm for efficient and effective grasping. This paradigm includes a well-designed supervision selection strategy, selecting key labels basically without ambiguity, and an economic pipeline to enable the training after selection. Furthermore, benefit from the economic supervision, we can focus on a specific grasp, and thus we devise a focal representation module, which comprises an interactive grasp head and a composite score estimation to generate the specific grasp more accurately. Combining all together, the EconomicGrasp framework is proposed. Our extensive experiments show that EconomicGrasp surpasses the SOTA grasp method by about 3AP on average, and with extremely low resource cost, for about 1/4 training time cost, 1/8 memory cost and 1/30 storage cost.

- **Summary**: Efficient finetuning of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP for specific downstream tasks is gaining significant attention. Previous works primarily focus on prompt learning to adapt the CLIP into a variety of downstream tasks, however, suffering from task overfitting when finetuned on a small data set. In this paper, we introduce an orthogonal finetuning method for efficiently updating pretrained weights which enhances robustness and generalization, while a cross-regularization strategy is further exploited to maintain the stability in terms of zero-shot generalization of VLMs, dubbed \textbf{\textit{OrthCR}}. Specifically, trainable orthogonal matrices are injected seamlessly into the transformer architecture and enforced with orthogonality constraint using Cayley parameterization, benefiting from the norm-preserving property and thus leading to stable and faster convergence. To alleviate deviation from orthogonal constraint during training, a cross-regularization strategy is further employed with initial pretrained weights within a bypass manner. In addition, to enrich the sample diversity for downstream tasks, we first explore Cutout data augmentation to boost the efficient finetuning and comprehend how our approach improves the specific downstream performance and maintains the generalizability in the perspective of Orthogonality Learning. Beyond existing prompt learning techniques, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method explicitly steers pretrained weight space to represent the task-specific knowledge and presents competitive generalizability under \textit{base-to-base/base-to-new}, \textit{cross-dataset transfer} and \textit{domain generalization} evaluations.

- **Summary**: Long-range imaging inevitably suffers from atmospheric turbulence with severe geometric distortions due to random refraction of light. The further the distance, the more severe the disturbance. Despite existing research has achieved great progress in tackling short-range turbulence, there is less attention paid to long-range turbulence with significant distortions. To address this dilemma and advance the field, we construct a large-scale real long-range atmospheric turbulence dataset (RLR-AT), including 1500 turbulence sequences spanning distances from 1 Km to 13 Km. The advantages of RLR-AT compared to existing ones: turbulence with longer-distances and higher-diversity, scenes with greater-variety and larger-scale. Moreover, most existing work adopts either registration-based or decomposition-based methods to address distortions through one-step mitigation. However, they fail to effectively handle long-range turbulence due to its significant pixel displacements. In this work, we propose a coarse-to-fine framework to handle severe distortions, which cooperates dynamic turbulence and static background priors (CDSP). On the one hand, we discover the pixel motion statistical prior of turbulence, and propose a frequency-aware reference frame for better large-scale distortion registration, greatly reducing the burden of refinement. On the other hand, we take advantage of the static prior of background, and propose a subspace-based low-rank tensor refinement model to eliminate the misalignments inevitably left by registration while well preserving details. The dynamic and static priors complement to each other, facilitating us to progressively mitigate long-range turbulence with severe distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms SOTA methods on different datasets.

- **Summary**: Accurate vision-based speed estimation is much more cost-effective than traditional methods based on radar or LiDAR. However, it is also challenging due to the limitations of perspective projection on a discrete sensor, as well as the high sensitivity to calibration, lighting and weather conditions. Interestingly, deep learning approaches (which dominate the field of computer vision) are very limited in this context due to the lack of available data. Indeed, obtaining video sequences of real road traffic with accurate speed values associated with each vehicle is very complex and costly, and the number of available datasets is very limited. Recently, some approaches are focusing on the use of synthetic data. However, it is still unclear how models trained on synthetic data can be effectively applied to real world conditions. In this work, we propose the use of digital-twins using CARLA simulator to generate a large dataset representative of a specific real-world camera. The synthetic dataset contains a large variability of vehicle types, colours, speeds, lighting and weather conditions. A 3D CNN model is trained on the digital twin and tested on the real sequences. Unlike previous approaches that generate multi-camera sequences, we found that the gap between the the real and the virtual conditions is a key factor in obtaining low speed estimation errors. Even with a preliminary approach, the mean absolute error obtained remains below 3km/h.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in LiDAR technology have significantly lowered costs and improved both its precision and resolution, thereby solidifying its role as a critical component in autonomous vehicle localization. Using sophisticated 3D registration algorithms, LiDAR now facilitates vehicle localization with centimeter-level accuracy. However, these high-precision techniques often face reliability challenges in environments devoid of identifiable map features. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that utilizes road side units (RSU) with vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications to assist vehicle self-localization. By using RSUs as stationary reference points and processing real-time LiDAR data, our method enhances localization accuracy through a cooperative localization framework. By placing RSUs in critical areas, our proposed method can improve the reliability and precision of vehicle localization when the traditional vehicle self-localization technique falls short. Evaluation results in an end-to-end autonomous driving simulator AWSIM show that the proposed method can improve localization accuracy by up to 80% under vulnerable environments compared to traditional localization methods. Additionally, our method also demonstrates robust resistance to network delays and packet loss in heterogeneous network environments.

- **Summary**: We introduce Diff-Tracker, a novel approach for the challenging unsupervised visual tracking task leveraging the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Our main idea is to leverage the rich knowledge encapsulated within the pre-trained diffusion model, such as the understanding of image semantics and structural information, to address unsupervised visual tracking. To this end, we design an initial prompt learner to enable the diffusion model to recognize the tracking target by learning a prompt representing the target. Furthermore, to facilitate dynamic adaptation of the prompt to the target's movements, we propose an online prompt updater. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which also achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Assessing an athlete's performance in canoe sprint is often established by measuring a variety of kinematic parameters during training sessions. Many of these parameters are related to single or multiple paddle stroke cycles. Determining on- and offset of these cycles in force sensor signals is usually not straightforward and requires human interaction. This paper explores convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in terms of their ability to automatically predict these events. In addition, our work proposes an extension to the recently published SoftED metric for event detection in order to properly assess the model performance on time windows. In our results, an RNN based on bidirectional gated recurrent units (BGRUs) turned out to be the most suitable model for paddle stroke detection.

- **Summary**: Forming oral models capable of understanding the complete dynamics of the oral cavity is vital across research areas such as speech correction, designing foods for the aging population, and dentistry. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technologies, capable of capturing oral data essential for creating such detailed representations, offer a powerful tool for illustrating articulatory dynamics. However, its real-time application is hindered by expense and expertise requirements. Ever advancing generative AI approaches present themselves as a way to address this barrier by leveraging multi-modal approaches for generating pseudo-MRI views. Nonetheless, this immediately sparks ethical concerns regarding the utilisation of a technology with the capability to produce MRIs from facial observations.   This paper explores the ethical implications of external-to-internal correlation modeling (E2ICM). E2ICM utilises facial movements to infer internal configurations and provides a cost-effective supporting technology for MRI. In this preliminary work, we employ Pix2PixGAN to generate pseudo-MRI views from external articulatory data, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. Ethical considerations concerning privacy, consent, and potential misuse, which are fundamental to our examination of this innovative methodology, are discussed as a result of this experimentation.

- **Summary**: Continual learning (CL) addresses the problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, which occurs when a trained model tends to overwrite previously learned information, when presented with a new task. CL aims to instill the lifelong learning characteristic of humans in intelligent systems, making them capable of learning continuously while retaining what was already learned. Current CL problems involve either learning new domains (domain-incremental) or new and previously unseen classes (class-incremental). However, general learning processes are not just limited to learning information, but also refinement of existing information. In this paper, we define CLEO - Continual Learning of Evolving Ontologies, as a new incremental learning setting under CL to tackle evolving classes. CLEO is motivated by the need for intelligent systems to adapt to real-world ontologies that change over time, such as those in autonomous driving. We use Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC, and Mapillary Vistas to define the task settings and demonstrate the applicability of CLEO. We highlight the shortcomings of existing CIL methods in adapting to CLEO and propose a baseline solution, called Modelling Ontologies (MoOn). CLEO is a promising new approach to CL that addresses the challenge of evolving ontologies in real-world applications. MoOn surpasses previous CL approaches in the context of CLEO.

- **Summary**: We present a novel pipeline for learning high-quality triangular human avatars from multi-view videos. Recent methods for avatar learning are typically based on neural radiance fields (NeRF), which is not compatible with traditional graphics pipeline and poses great challenges for operations like editing or synthesizing under different environments. To overcome these limitations, our method represents the avatar with an explicit triangular mesh extracted from an implicit SDF field, complemented by an implicit material field conditioned on given poses. Leveraging this triangular avatar representation, we incorporate physics-based rendering to accurately decompose geometry and texture. To enhance both the geometric and appearance details, we further employ a 2D UNet as the network backbone and introduce pseudo normal ground-truth as additional supervision. Experiments show that our method can learn triangular avatars with high-quality geometry reconstruction and plausible material decomposition, inherently supporting editing, manipulation or relighting operations.

- **Summary**: In the realm of motion generation, the creation of long-duration, high-quality motion sequences remains a significant challenge. This paper presents our groundbreaking work on "Infinite Motion", a novel approach that leverages long text to extended motion generation, effectively bridging the gap between short and long-duration motion synthesis. Our core insight is the strategic extension and reassembly of existing high-quality text-motion datasets, which has led to the creation of a novel benchmark dataset to facilitate the training of models for extended motion sequences. A key innovation of our model is its ability to accept arbitrary lengths of text as input, enabling the generation of motion sequences tailored to specific narratives or scenarios. Furthermore, we incorporate the timestamp design for text which allows precise editing of local segments within the generated sequences, offering unparalleled control and flexibility in motion synthesis. We further demonstrate the versatility and practical utility of "Infinite Motion" through three specific applications: natural language interactive editing, motion sequence editing within long sequences and splicing of independent motion sequences. Each application highlights the adaptability of our approach and broadens the spectrum of possibilities for research and development in motion generation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our model in generating long sequence motions compared to existing methods.Project page: https://shuochengzhai.github.io/Infinite-motion.github.io/

- **Summary**: While the field of 3D scene reconstruction is dominated by NeRFs due to their photorealistic quality, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged, offering similar quality with real-time rendering speeds. However, both methods primarily excel with well-controlled 3D scenes, while in-the-wild data - characterized by occlusions, dynamic objects, and varying illumination - remains challenging. NeRFs can adapt to such conditions easily through per-image embedding vectors, but 3DGS struggles due to its explicit representation and lack of shared parameters. To address this, we introduce WildGaussians, a novel approach to handle occlusions and appearance changes with 3DGS. By leveraging robust DINO features and integrating an appearance modeling module within 3DGS, our method achieves state-of-the-art results. We demonstrate that WildGaussians matches the real-time rendering speed of 3DGS while surpassing both 3DGS and NeRF baselines in handling in-the-wild data, all within a simple architectural framework.

- **Summary**: Although recently several foundation models for satellite remote sensing imagery have been proposed, they fail to address major challenges of real/operational applications. Indeed, embeddings that don't take into account the spectral, spatial and temporal dimensions of the data as well as the irregular or unaligned temporal sampling are of little use for most real world uses.As a consequence, we propose an ALIgned Sits Encoder (ALISE), a novel approach that leverages the spatial, spectral, and temporal dimensions of irregular and unaligned SITS while producing aligned latent representations. Unlike SSL models currently available for SITS, ALISE incorporates a flexible query mechanism to project the SITS into a common and learned temporal projection space. Additionally, thanks to a multi-view framework, we explore integration of instance discrimination along a masked autoencoding task to SITS. The quality of the produced representation is assessed through three downstream tasks: crop segmentation (PASTIS), land cover segmentation (MultiSenGE), and a novel crop change detection dataset. Furthermore, the change detection task is performed without supervision. The results suggest that the use of aligned representations is more effective than previous SSL methods for linear probing segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has become a popular method for representing visual signals (e.g., 2D images and 3D scenes), demonstrating promising results in various downstream applications. Given its potential as a medium for visual signals, exploring the development of a neural blending method that utilizes INRs is a natural progression. Neural blending involves merging two INRs to create a new INR that encapsulates information from both original representations. A direct approach involves applying traditional image editing methods to the INR rendering process. However, this method often results in blending distortions, artifacts, and color shifts, primarily due to the discretization of the underlying pixel grid and the introduction of boundary conditions for solving variational problems. To tackle this issue, we introduce the Neural Poisson Solver, a plug-and-play and universally applicable framework across different signal dimensions for blending visual signals represented by INRs. Our Neural Poisson Solver offers a variational problem-solving approach based on the continuous Poisson equation, demonstrating exceptional performance across various domains. Specifically, we propose a gradient-guided neural solver to represent the solution process of the variational problem, refining the target signal to achieve natural blending results. We also develop a Poisson equation-based loss and optimization scheme to train our solver, ensuring it effectively blends the input INR scenes while preserving their inherent structure and semantic content. The lack of dependence on additional prior knowledge makes our method easily adaptable to various task categories, highlighting its versatility. Comprehensive experimental results validate the robustness of our approach across multiple dimensions and blending tasks.

- **Summary**: The impressive advancements in semi-supervised learning have driven researchers to explore its potential in object detection tasks within the field of computer vision. Semi-Supervised Object Detection (SSOD) leverages a combination of a small labeled dataset and a larger, unlabeled dataset. This approach effectively reduces the dependence on large labeled datasets, which are often expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Initially, SSOD models encountered challenges in effectively leveraging unlabeled data and managing noise in generated pseudo-labels for unlabeled data. However, numerous recent advancements have addressed these issues, resulting in substantial improvements in SSOD performance. This paper presents a comprehensive review of 27 cutting-edge developments in SSOD methodologies, from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Transformers. We delve into the core components of semi-supervised learning and its integration into object detection frameworks, covering data augmentation techniques, pseudo-labeling strategies, consistency regularization, and adversarial training methods. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis of various SSOD models, evaluating their performance and architectural differences. We aim to ignite further research interest in overcoming existing challenges and exploring new directions in semi-supervised learning for object detection.

- **Summary**: By converting low-frame-rate, low-resolution videos into high-frame-rate, high-resolution ones, space-time video super-resolution techniques can enhance visual experiences and facilitate more efficient information dissemination. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) for space-time video super-resolution, namely GIRNet. To generate highly accurate features and thus improve performance, the proposed network integrates a feature-level temporal interpolation module with deformable convolutions and a global spatial-temporal information-based residual convolutional long short-term memory (convLSTM) module. In the feature-level temporal interpolation module, we leverage deformable convolution, which adapts to deformations and scale variations of objects across different scene locations. This presents a more efficient solution than conventional convolution for extracting features from moving objects. Our network effectively uses forward and backward feature information to determine inter-frame offsets, leading to the direct generation of interpolated frame features. In the global spatial-temporal information-based residual convLSTM module, the first convLSTM is used to derive global spatial-temporal information from the input features, and the second convLSTM uses the previously computed global spatial-temporal information feature as its initial cell state. This second convLSTM adopts residual connections to preserve spatial information, thereby enhancing the output features. Experiments on the Vimeo90K dataset show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in peak signal-to-noise-ratio (by 1.45 dB, 1.14 dB, and 0.02 dB over STARnet, TMNet, and 3DAttGAN, respectively), structural similarity index(by 0.027, 0.023, and 0.006 over STARnet, TMNet, and 3DAttGAN, respectively), and visually.

By architectural expansion CoT, the proposed model extends its architecture to a 3D format, integrates it smoothly with the base model to utilize the complex contextual information found in MRI scans, emphasizing how elements rely on each other across an extended spatial range. The proposed model synchronizes tumor mass characteristics from CoT, mutually reinforcing feature extraction, facilitating the precise capture of detailed tumor mass structures, including location, size, and boundaries. Several experimental results present the outstanding segmentation performance of the proposed method in comparison to current state-of-the-art approaches, achieving Dice score of 82.0%, 81.5%, 89.0% for Enhancing Tumor, Tumor Core and Whole Tumor, respectively, on BraTS2019.

- **Summary**: We introduce VideoMamba, a novel adaptation of the pure Mamba architecture, specifically designed for video recognition. Unlike transformers that rely on self-attention mechanisms leading to high computational costs by quadratic complexity, VideoMamba leverages Mamba's linear complexity and selective SSM mechanism for more efficient processing. The proposed Spatio-Temporal Forward and Backward SSM allows the model to effectively capture the complex relationship between non-sequential spatial and sequential temporal information in video. Consequently, VideoMamba is not only resource-efficient but also effective in capturing long-range dependency in videos, demonstrated by competitive performance and outstanding efficiency on a variety of video understanding benchmarks. Our work highlights the potential of VideoMamba as a powerful tool for video understanding, offering a simple yet effective baseline for future research in video analysis.

- **Summary**: Despite the progress made in Mamba-based medical image segmentation models, current methods utilizing unidirectional or multi-directional feature scanning mechanisms fail to well model dependencies between neighboring positions in the image, hindering the effective modeling of local features. However, local features are crucial for medical image segmentation as they provide vital information about lesions and tissue structures. To address this limitation, we propose a simple yet effective method named SliceMamba, a locally sensitive pure Mamba medical image segmentation model. The proposed SliceMamba includes an efffcient Bidirectional Slice Scan module (BSS), which performs bidirectional feature segmentation while employing varied scanning mechanisms for distinct features. This ensures that spatially adjacent features maintain proximity in the scanning sequence, thereby enhancing segmentation performance. Extensive experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Contemporary approaches to solving various problems that require analyzing three-dimensional (3D) meshes and point clouds have adopted the use of deep learning algorithms that directly process 3D data such as point coordinates, normal vectors and vertex connectivity information. Our work proposes one such solution to the problem of positioning body and finger animation skeleton joints within 3D models of human bodies. Due to scarcity of annotated real human scans, we resort to generating synthetic samples while varying their shape and pose parameters. Similarly to the state-of-the-art approach, our method computes each joint location as a convex combination of input points. Given only a list of point coordinates and normal vector estimates as input, a dynamic graph convolutional neural network is used to predict the coefficients of the convex combinations. By comparing our method with the state-of-the-art, we show that it is possible to achieve significantly better results with a simpler architecture, especially for finger joints. Since our solution requires fewer precomputed features, it also allows for shorter processing times.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces the point-axis representation for oriented object detection, emphasizing its flexibility and geometrically intuitive nature with two key components: points and axes. 1) Points delineate the spatial extent and contours of objects, providing detailed shape descriptions. 2) Axes define the primary directionalities of objects, providing essential orientation cues crucial for precise detection. The point-axis representation decouples location and rotation, addressing the loss discontinuity issues commonly encountered in traditional bounding box-based approaches. For effective optimization without introducing additional annotations, we propose the max-projection loss to supervise point set learning and the cross-axis loss for robust axis representation learning. Further, leveraging this representation, we present the Oriented DETR model, seamlessly integrating the DETR framework for precise point-axis prediction and end-to-end detection. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements in oriented object detection tasks.

- **Summary**: The Retinex theory models the image as a product of illumination and reflection components, which has received extensive attention and is widely used in image enhancement, segmentation and color restoration. However, it has been rarely used in additive noise removal due to the inclusion of both multiplication and addition operations in the Retinex noisy image modeling. In this paper, we propose an exponential Retinex decomposition model based on hybrid non-convex regularization and weak space oscillation-modeling for image denoising. The proposed model utilizes non-convex first-order total variation (TV) and non-convex second-order TV to regularize the reflection component and the illumination component, respectively, and employs weak $H^{-1}$ norm to measure the residual component. By utilizing different regularizers, the proposed model effectively decomposes the image into reflection, illumination, and noise components. An alternating direction multipliers method (ADMM) combined with the Majorize-Minimization (MM) algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model. Furthermore, we provide a detailed proof of the convergence property of the algorithm. Numerical experiments validate both the proposed model and algorithm. Compared with several state-of-the-art denoising models, the proposed model exhibits superior performance in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean structural similarity (MSSIM).

- **Summary**: Facial video-based remote physiological measurement is a promising research area for detecting human vital signs (e.g., heart rate, respiration frequency) in a non-contact way. Conventional approaches are mostly supervised learning, requiring extensive collections of facial videos and synchronously recorded photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. To tackle it, self-supervised learning has recently gained attentions; due to the lack of ground truth PPG signals, its performance is however limited. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised framework that successfully integrates the popular vision-language models (VLMs) into the remote physiological measurement task. Given a facial video, we first augment its positive and negative video samples with varying rPPG signal frequencies. Next, we introduce a frequency-oriented vision-text pair generation method by carefully creating contrastive spatio-temporal maps from positive and negative samples and designing proper text prompts to describe their relative ratios of signal frequencies. A pre-trained VLM is employed to extract features for these formed vision-text pairs and estimate rPPG signals thereafter. We develop a series of generative and contrastive learning mechanisms to optimize the VLM, including the text-guided visual map reconstruction task, the vision-text contrastive learning task, and the frequency contrastive and ranking task. Overall, our method for the first time adapts VLMs to digest and align the frequency-related knowledge in vision and text modalities. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that it significantly outperforms state of the art self-supervised methods.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing image restoration aims to reconstruct missing or corrupted areas within images. To date, low-rank based models have garnered significant interest in this field. This paper proposes a novel low-rank regularization term, named the Haar nuclear norm (HNN), for efficient and effective remote sensing image restoration.   It leverages the low-rank properties of wavelet coefficients derived from the 2-D frontal slice-wise Haar discrete wavelet transform, effectively modeling the low-rank prior for separated coarse-grained structure and fine-grained textures in the image. Experimental evaluations conducted on hyperspectral image inpainting, multi-temporal image cloud removal, and hyperspectral image denoising have revealed the HNN's potential. Typically, HNN achieves a performance improvement of 1-4 dB and a speedup of 10-28x compared to some state-of-the-art methods (e.g., tensor correlated total variation, and fully-connected tensor network) for inpainting tasks.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we show different fine-tuning methods for Stable Diffusion XL; this includes inference steps, and caption customization for each image to align with generating images in the style of a commercial 2D icon training set. We also show how important it is to properly define what "high-quality" really is especially for a commercial-use environment. As generative AI models continue to gain widespread acceptance and usage, there emerge many different ways to optimize and evaluate them for various applications. Specifically text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion XL and DALL-E 3 require distinct evaluation practices to effectively generate high-quality icons according to a specific style. Although some images that are generated based on a certain style may have a lower FID score (better), we show how this is not absolute in and of itself even for rasterized icons. While FID scores reflect the similarity of generated images to the overall training set, CLIP scores measure the alignment between generated images and their textual descriptions. We show how FID scores miss significant aspects, such as the minority of pixel differences that matter most in an icon, while CLIP scores result in misjudging the quality of icons. The CLIP model's understanding of "similarity" is shaped by its own training data; which does not account for feature variation in our style of choice. Our findings highlight the need for specialized evaluation metrics and fine-tuning approaches when generating high-quality commercial icons, potentially leading to more effective and tailored applications of text-to-image models in professional design contexts.

- **Summary**: Face recognition pipelines have been widely deployed in various mission-critical systems in trust, equitable and responsible AI applications. However, the emergence of adversarial attacks has threatened the security of the entire recognition pipeline. Despite the sheer number of attack methods proposed for crafting adversarial examples in both digital and physical forms, it is never an easy task to assess the real threat level of different attacks and obtain useful insight into the key risks confronted by face recognition systems. Traditional attacks view imperceptibility as the most important measurement to keep perturbations stealthy, while we suspect that industry professionals may possess a different opinion. In this paper, we delve into measuring the threat brought about by adversarial attacks from the perspectives of the industry and the applications of face recognition. In contrast to widely studied sophisticated attacks in the field, we propose an effective yet easy-to-launch physical adversarial attack, named AdvColor, against black-box face recognition pipelines in the physical world. AdvColor fools models in the recognition pipeline via directly supplying printed photos of human faces to the system under adversarial illuminations. Experimental results show that physical AdvColor examples can achieve a fooling rate of more than 96% against the anti-spoofing model and an overall attack success rate of 88% against the face recognition pipeline. We also conduct a survey on the threats of prevailing adversarial attacks, including AdvColor, to understand the gap between the machine-measured and human-assessed threat levels of different forms of adversarial attacks. The survey results surprisingly indicate that, compared to deliberately launched imperceptible attacks, perceptible but accessible attacks pose more lethal threats to real-world commercial systems of face recognition.

- **Summary**: Currently, image-text-driven multi-modal deep learning models have demonstrated their outstanding potential in many fields. In practice, tasks centered around facial images have broad application prospects. This paper presents \textbf{FaceCaption-15M}, a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset of facial images accompanied by their natural language descriptions (facial image-to-text). This dataset aims to facilitate a study on face-centered tasks. FaceCaption-15M comprises over 15 million pairs of facial images and their corresponding natural language descriptions of facial features, making it the largest facial image-caption dataset to date. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of image quality, text naturalness, text complexity, and text-image relevance to demonstrate the superiority of FaceCaption-15M. To validate the effectiveness of FaceCaption-15M, we first trained a facial language-image pre-training model (FLIP, similar to CLIP) to align facial image with its corresponding captions in feature space. Subsequently, using both image and text encoders and fine-tuning only the linear layer, our FLIP-based models achieved state-of-the-art results on two challenging face-centered tasks. The purpose is to promote research in the field of face-related tasks through the availability of the proposed FaceCaption-15M dataset. All data, codes, and models are publicly available. https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenFace-CQUPT/FaceCaption-15M

- **Summary**: The low-rank matrix completion (LRMC) technology has achieved remarkable results in low-level visual tasks. There is an underlying assumption that the real-world matrix data is low-rank in LRMC. However, the real matrix data does not satisfy the strict low-rank property, which undoubtedly present serious challenges for the above-mentioned matrix recovery methods. Fortunately, there are feasible schemes that devise appropriate and effective priori representations for describing the intrinsic information of real data. In this paper, we firstly model the matrix data ${\bf{Y}}$ as the sum of a low-rank approximation component $\bf{X}$ and an approximation error component $\cal{E}$. This finer-grained data decomposition architecture enables each component of information to be portrayed more precisely. Further, we design an overlapping group error representation (OGER) function to characterize the above error structure and propose a generalized low-rank matrix completion model based on OGER. Specifically, the low-rank component describes the global structure information of matrix data, while the OGER component not only compensates for the approximation error between the low-rank component and the real data but also better captures the local block sparsity information of matrix data. Finally, we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) that integrates the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm, which enables the efficient solution of the proposed model. And we analyze the convergence of the algorithm in detail both theoretically and experimentally. In addition, the results of numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing competing models in performance.

  Systems, vol. 14, no. 2, pp. 224-234, Jun. 2024
- **Summary**: In point cloud geometry compression, context models usually use the one-hot encoding of node occupancy as the label, and the cross-entropy between the one-hot encoding and the probability distribution predicted by the context model as the loss function. However, this approach has two main weaknesses. First, the differences between contexts of different nodes are not significant, making it difficult for the context model to accurately predict the probability distribution of node occupancy. Second, as the one-hot encoding is not the actual probability distribution of node occupancy, the cross-entropy loss function is inaccurate. To address these problems, we propose a general structure that can enhance existing context models. We introduce the context feature residuals into the context model to amplify the differences between contexts. We also add a multi-layer perception branch, that uses the mean squared error between its output and node occupancy as a loss function to provide accurate gradients in backpropagation. We validate our method by showing that it can improve the performance of an octree-based model (OctAttention) and a voxel-based model (VoxelDNN) on the object point cloud datasets MPEG 8i and MVUB, as well as the LiDAR point cloud dataset SemanticKITTI.

- **Summary**: While recent vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP are a powerful tool for analyzing text and images in a shared semantic space, they do not explicitly model the hierarchical nature of the set of texts which may describe an image. Conversely, existing multimodal hierarchical representation learning methods require costly training from scratch, failing to leverage the knowledge encoded by state-of-the-art multimodal foundation models. In this work, we study the knowledge of existing foundation models, finding that they exhibit emergent understanding of visual-semantic hierarchies despite not being directly trained for this purpose. We propose the Radial Embedding (RE) framework for probing and optimizing hierarchical understanding, and contribute the HierarCaps dataset, a benchmark facilitating the study of hierarchical knowledge in image--text representations, constructed automatically via large language models. Our results show that foundation VLMs exhibit zero-shot hierarchical understanding, surpassing the performance of prior models explicitly designed for this purpose. Furthermore, we show that foundation models may be better aligned to hierarchical reasoning via a text-only fine-tuning phase, while retaining pretraining knowledge.

- **Summary**: Bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation is crucial for the perception function in autonomous driving tasks. It is difficult to balance the accuracy, efficiency and range of BEV representation. The existing works are restricted to a limited perception range within 50 meters. Extending the BEV representation range can greatly benefit downstream tasks such as topology reasoning, scene understanding, and planning by offering more comprehensive information and reaction time. The Standard-Definition (SD) navigation maps can provide a lightweight representation of road structure topology, characterized by ease of acquisition and low maintenance costs. An intuitive idea is to combine the close-range visual information from onboard cameras with the beyond line-of-sight (BLOS) environmental priors from SD maps to realize expanded perceptual capabilities. In this paper, we propose BLOS-BEV, a novel BEV segmentation model that incorporates SD maps for accurate beyond line-of-sight perception, up to 200m. Our approach is applicable to common BEV architectures and can achieve excellent results by incorporating information derived from SD maps. We explore various feature fusion schemes to effectively integrate the visual BEV representations and semantic features from the SD map, aiming to leverage the complementary information from both sources optimally. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in BEV segmentation on nuScenes and Argoverse benchmark. Through multi-modal inputs, BEV segmentation is significantly enhanced at close ranges below 50m, while also demonstrating superior performance in long-range scenarios, surpassing other methods by over 20% mIoU at distances ranging from 50-200m.

- **Summary**: In point cloud geometry compression, most octreebased context models use the cross-entropy between the onehot encoding of node occupancy and the probability distribution predicted by the context model as the loss. This approach converts the problem of predicting the number (a regression problem) and the position (a classification problem) of occupied child nodes into a 255-dimensional classification problem. As a result, it fails to accurately measure the difference between the one-hot encoding and the predicted probability distribution. We first analyze why the cross-entropy loss function fails to accurately measure the difference between the one-hot encoding and the predicted probability distribution. Then, we propose an attention-based child node number prediction (ACNP) module to enhance the context models. The proposed module can predict the number of occupied child nodes and map it into an 8- dimensional vector to assist the context model in predicting the probability distribution of the occupancy of the current node for efficient entropy coding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed module enhances the coding efficiency of octree-based context models.

- **Summary**: Exemplar-free class-incremental learning using a backbone trained from scratch and starting from a small first task presents a significant challenge for continual representation learning. Prototype-based approaches, when continually updated, face the critical issue of semantic drift due to which the old class prototypes drift to different positions in the new feature space. Through an analysis of prototype-based continual learning, we show that forgetting is not due to diminished discriminative power of the feature extractor, and can potentially be corrected by drift compensation. To address this, we propose Learnable Drift Compensation (LDC), which can effectively mitigate drift in any moving backbone, whether supervised or unsupervised. LDC is fast and straightforward to integrate on top of existing continual learning approaches. Furthermore, we showcase how LDC can be applied in combination with self-supervised CL methods, resulting in the first exemplar-free semi-supervised continual learning approach. We achieve state-of-the-art performance in both supervised and semi-supervised settings across multiple datasets. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/alviur/ldc}.

- **Summary**: Screen content (SC) differs from natural scene (NS) with unique characteristics such as noise-free, repetitive patterns, and high contrast. Aiming at addressing the inadequacies of current learned image compression (LIC) methods for SC, we propose an improved two-stage octave convolutional residual blocks (IToRB) for high and low-frequency feature extraction and a cascaded two-stage multi-scale residual blocks (CTMSRB) for improved multi-scale learning and nonlinearity in SC. Additionally, we employ a window-based attention module (WAM) to capture pixel correlations, especially for high contrast regions in the image. We also construct a diverse SC image compression dataset (SDU-SCICD2K) for training, including text, charts, graphics, animation, movie, game and mixture of SC images and NS images. Experimental results show our method, more suited for SC than NS data, outperforms existing LIC methods in rate-distortion performance on SC images.

- **Summary**: Saliency maps have been widely used to interpret deep learning classifiers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, since AD is heterogeneous and has multiple subtypes, the pathological mechanism of AD remains not fully understood and may vary from patient to patient. Due to the lack of such understanding, it is difficult to comprehensively and effectively assess the saliency map of AD classifier. In this paper, we utilize the anatomical segmentation to allocate saliency values into different brain regions. By plotting the distributions of saliency maps corresponding to AD and NC (Normal Control), we can gain a comprehensive view of the model's decisions process. In order to leverage the fact that the brain volume shrinkage happens in AD patients during disease progression, we define a new evaluation metric, brain volume change score (VCS), by computing the average Pearson correlation of the brain volume changes and the saliency values of a model in different brain regions for each patient. Thus, the VCS metric can help us gain some knowledge of how saliency maps resulting from different models relate to the changes of the volumes across different regions in the whole brain. We trained candidate models on the ADNI dataset and tested on three different datasets. Our results indicate: (i) models with higher VCSs tend to demonstrate saliency maps with more details relevant to the AD pathology, (ii) using gradient-based adversarial training strategies such as FGSM and stochastic masking can improve the VCSs of the models.

- **Summary**: Automatic and precise segmentation of vertebrae from CT images is crucial for various clinical applications. However, due to a lack of explicit and strict constraints, existing methods especially for single-stage methods, still suffer from the challenge of intra-vertebrae segmentation inconsistency, which refers to multiple label predictions inside a singular vertebra. For multi-stage methods, vertebrae detection serving as the first step, is affected by the pathology and mental implants. Thus, incorrect detections cause biased patches before segmentation, then lead to inconsistent labeling and segmentation. In our work, motivated by the perspective of instance segmentation, we try to label individual and complete binary masks to address this limitation. Specifically, a contour-based network is proposed based on Structural Low-Rank Descriptors for shape consistency, termed SLoRD. These contour descriptors are acquired in a data-driven manner in advance. For a more precise representation of contour descriptors, we adopt the spherical coordinate system and devise the spherical centroid. Besides, the contour loss is designed to impose explicit consistency constraints, facilitating regressed contour points close to vertebral boundaries. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on VerSe 2019 demonstrate the superior performance of our framework over other single-stage and multi-stage state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

- **Summary**: Robust localization is the cornerstone of autonomous driving, especially in challenging urban environments where GPS signals suffer from multipath errors. Traditional localization approaches rely on high-definition (HD) maps, which consist of precisely annotated landmarks. However, building HD map is expensive and challenging to scale up. Given these limitations, leveraging navigation maps has emerged as a promising low-cost alternative for localization. Current approaches based on navigation maps can achieve highly accurate localization, but their complex matching strategies lead to unacceptable inference latency that fails to meet the real-time demands. To address these limitations, we propose a novel transformer-based neural re-localization method. Inspired by image registration, our approach performs a coarse-to-fine neural feature registration between navigation map and visual bird's-eye view features. Our method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art OrienterNet on both the nuScenes and Argoverse datasets, which is nearly 10%/20% localization accuracy and 30/16 FPS improvement on single-view and surround-view input settings, separately. We highlight that our research presents an HD-map-free localization method for autonomous driving, offering cost-effective, reliable, and scalable performance in challenging driving environments.

- **Summary**: The activation function plays a crucial role in model optimisation, yet the optimal choice remains unclear. For example, the Sigmoid activation is the de-facto activation in balanced classification tasks, however, in imbalanced classification, it proves inappropriate due to bias towards frequent classes. In this work, we delve deeper in this phenomenon by performing a comprehensive statistical analysis in the classification and intermediate layers of both balanced and imbalanced networks and we empirically show that aligning the activation function with the data distribution, enhances the performance in both balanced and imbalanced tasks. To this end, we propose the Adaptive Parametric Activation (APA) function, a novel and versatile activation function that unifies most common activation functions under a single formula. APA can be applied in both intermediate layers and attention layers, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art on several imbalanced benchmarks such as ImageNet-LT, iNaturalist2018, Places-LT, CIFAR100-LT and LVIS and balanced benchmarks such as ImageNet1K, COCO and V3DET.

- **Summary**: The unsupervised 3D object detection is to accurately detect objects in unstructured environments with no explicit supervisory signals. This task, given sparse LiDAR point clouds, often results in compromised performance for detecting distant or small objects due to the inherent sparsity and limited spatial resolution. In this paper, we are among the early attempts to integrate LiDAR data with 2D images for unsupervised 3D detection and introduce a new method, dubbed LiDAR-2D Self-paced Learning (LiSe). We argue that RGB images serve as a valuable complement to LiDAR data, offering precise 2D localization cues, particularly when scarce LiDAR points are available for certain objects. Considering the unique characteristics of both modalities, our framework devises a self-paced learning pipeline that incorporates adaptive sampling and weak model aggregation strategies. The adaptive sampling strategy dynamically tunes the distribution of pseudo labels during training, countering the tendency of models to overfit easily detected samples, such as nearby and large-sized objects. By doing so, it ensures a balanced learning trajectory across varying object scales and distances. The weak model aggregation component consolidates the strengths of models trained under different pseudo label distributions, culminating in a robust and powerful final model. Experimental evaluations validate the efficacy of our proposed LiSe method, manifesting significant improvements of +7.1% AP$_{BEV}$ and +3.4% AP$_{3D}$ on nuScenes, and +8.3% AP$_{BEV}$ and +7.4% AP$_{3D}$ on Lyft compared to existing techniques.

- **Summary**: Skeletal motion plays a pivotal role in human activity recognition (HAR). Recently, attack methods have been proposed to identify the universal vulnerability of skeleton-based HAR(S-HAR). However, the research of adversarial transferability on S-HAR is largely missing. More importantly, existing attacks all struggle in transfer across unknown S-HAR models. We observed that the key reason is that the loss landscape of the action recognizers is rugged and sharp. Given the established correlation in prior studies~\cite{qin2022boosting,wu2020towards} between loss landscape and adversarial transferability, we assume and empirically validate that smoothing the loss landscape could potentially improve adversarial transferability on S-HAR. This is achieved by proposing a new post-train Dual Bayesian strategy, which can effectively explore the model posterior space for a collection of surrogates without the need for re-training. Furthermore, to craft adversarial examples along the motion manifold, we incorporate the attack gradient with information of the motion dynamics in a Bayesian manner. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, e.g. HDM05 and NTU 60, the average transfer success rate can reach as high as 35.9\% and 45.5\% respectively. In comparison, current state-of-the-art skeletal attacks achieve only 3.6\% and 9.8\%. The high adversarial transferability remains consistent across various surrogate, victim, and even defense models. Through a comprehensive analysis of the results, we provide insights on what surrogates are more likely to exhibit transferability, to shed light on future research.

- **Summary**: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has been witnessed in recent years. Based on the powerful LLMs, multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) extend the modality from text to a broader spectrum of domains, attracting widespread attention due to the broader range of application scenarios. As LLMs and MLLMs rely on vast amounts of model parameters and data to achieve emergent capabilities, the importance of data is receiving increasingly widespread attention and recognition. Tracing and analyzing recent data-oriented works for MLLMs, we find that the development of models and data is not two separate paths but rather interconnected. On the one hand, vaster and higher-quality data contribute to better performance of MLLMs, on the other hand, MLLMs can facilitate the development of data. The co-development of multi-modal data and MLLMs requires a clear view of 1) at which development stage of MLLMs can specific data-centric approaches be employed to enhance which capabilities, and 2) by utilizing which capabilities and acting as which roles can models contribute to multi-modal data. To promote the data-model co-development for MLLM community, we systematically review existing works related to MLLMs from the data-model co-development perspective.

- **Summary**: Continual Learning (CL) is crucial for enabling networks to dynamically adapt as they learn new tasks sequentially, accommodating new data and classes without catastrophic forgetting. Diverging from conventional perspectives on CL, our paper introduces a new perspective wherein forgetting could actually benefit the sequential learning paradigm. Specifically, we present BiasPruner, a CL framework that intentionally forgets spurious correlations in the training data that could lead to shortcut learning. Utilizing a new bias score that measures the contribution of each unit in the network to learning spurious features, BiasPruner prunes those units with the highest bias scores to form a debiased subnetwork preserved for a given task. As BiasPruner learns a new task, it constructs a new debiased subnetwork, potentially incorporating units from previous subnetworks, which improves adaptation and performance on the new task. During inference, BiasPruner employs a simple task-agnostic approach to select the best debiased subnetwork for predictions. We conduct experiments on three medical datasets for skin lesion classification and chest X-Ray classification and demonstrate that BiasPruner consistently outperforms SOTA CL methods in terms of classification performance and fairness.

- **Summary**: Histopathological images are widely used for the analysis of diseased (tumor) tissues and patient treatment selection. While the majority of microscopy image processing was previously done manually by pathologists, recent advances in computer vision allow for accurate recognition of lesion regions with deep learning-based solutions. Such models, however, usually require extensive annotated datasets for training, which is often not the case in the considered task, where the number of available patient data samples is very limited. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel DeepCMorph model pre-trained to learn cell morphology and identify a large number of different cancer types. The model consists of two modules: the first one performs cell nuclei segmentation and annotates each cell type, and is trained on a combination of 8 publicly available datasets to ensure its high generalizability and robustness. The second module combines the obtained segmentation map with the original microscopy image and is trained for the downstream task. We pre-trained this module on the Pan-Cancer TCGA dataset consisting of over 270K tissue patches extracted from 8736 diagnostic slides from 7175 patients. The proposed solution achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on the dataset under consideration, detecting 32 cancer types with over 82% accuracy and outperforming all previously proposed solutions by more than 4%. We demonstrate that the resulting pre-trained model can be easily fine-tuned on smaller microscopy datasets, yielding superior results compared to the current top solutions and models initialized with ImageNet weights.

- **Summary**: Whole-body pose estimation is a challenging task that requires simultaneous prediction of keypoints for the body, hands, face, and feet. Whole-body pose estimation aims to predict fine-grained pose information for the human body, including the face, torso, hands, and feet, which plays an important role in the study of human-centric perception and generation and in various applications. In this work, we present RTMW (Real-Time Multi-person Whole-body pose estimation models), a series of high-performance models for 2D/3D whole-body pose estimation. We incorporate RTMPose model architecture with FPN and HEM (Hierarchical Encoding Module) to better capture pose information from different body parts with various scales. The model is trained with a rich collection of open-source human keypoint datasets with manually aligned annotations and further enhanced via a two-stage distillation strategy. RTMW demonstrates strong performance on multiple whole-body pose estimation benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency and deployment friendliness. We release three sizes: m/l/x, with RTMW-l achieving a 70.2 mAP on the COCO-Wholebody benchmark, making it the first open-source model to exceed 70 mAP on this benchmark. Meanwhile, we explored the performance of RTMW in the task of 3D whole-body pose estimation, conducting image-based monocular 3D whole-body pose estimation in a coordinate classification manner. We hope this work can benefit both academic research and industrial applications.

- **Summary**: Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR) systems aim to enhance the capability of face recognition in challenging cross-modal authentication scenarios. However, the significant domain gap between the source and target modalities poses a considerable challenge for cross-domain matching. Existing literature primarily focuses on developing HFR approaches for specific pairs of face modalities, necessitating the explicit training of models for each source-target combination. In this work, we introduce a novel framework designed to train a modality-agnostic HFR method capable of handling multiple modalities during inference, all without explicit knowledge of the target modality labels. We achieve this by implementing a computationally efficient automatic routing mechanism called Switch Style Modulation Blocks (SSMB) that trains various domain expert modulators which transform the feature maps adaptively reducing the domain gap. Our proposed SSMB can be trained end-to-end and seamlessly integrated into pre-trained face recognition models, transforming them into modality-agnostic HFR models. We have performed extensive evaluations on HFR benchmark datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness. The source code and protocols will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Multimodal AI has demonstrated superior performance over unimodal approaches by leveraging diverse data sources for more comprehensive analysis. However, applying this effectiveness in healthcare is challenging due to the limited availability of public datasets. Federated learning presents an exciting solution, allowing the use of extensive databases from hospitals and health centers without centralizing sensitive data, thus maintaining privacy and security. Yet, research in multimodal federated learning, particularly in scenarios with missing modalities a common issue in healthcare datasets remains scarce, highlighting a critical area for future exploration. Toward this, we propose a novel method for multimodal federated learning with missing modalities. Our contribution lies in a novel cross-modal data augmentation by retrieval, leveraging the small publicly available dataset to fill the missing modalities in the clients. Our method learns the parameters in a federated manner, ensuring privacy protection and improving performance in multiple challenging multimodal benchmarks in the medical domain, surpassing several competitive baselines.

- **Summary**: Evidence is accumulating in favour of using stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) to treat multiple cancer lesions in the lung. Multi-lesion lung SABR plans are complex and require significant resources to create. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage latent transformer framework (LDFormer) for dose prediction of lung SABR plans with varying numbers of lesions. In the first stage, patient anatomical information and the dose distribution are encoded into a latent space. In the second stage, a transformer learns to predict the dose latent from the anatomical latents. Causal attention is modified to adapt to different numbers of lesions. LDFormer outperforms a state-of-the-art generative adversarial network on dose conformality in and around lesions, and the performance gap widens when considering overlapping lesions. LDFormer generates predictions of 3-D dose distributions in under 30s on consumer hardware, and has the potential to assist physicians with clinical decision making, reduce resource costs, and accelerate treatment planning.

- **Summary**: We introduce an approach to bias deep generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models, towards generating data with either enhanced fidelity or increased diversity. Our approach involves manipulating the distribution of training and generated data through a novel metric for individual samples, named pseudo density, which is based on the nearest-neighbor information from real samples. Our approach offers three distinct techniques to adjust the fidelity and diversity of deep generative models: 1) Per-sample perturbation, enabling precise adjustments for individual samples towards either more common or more unique characteristics; 2) Importance sampling during model inference to enhance either fidelity or diversity in the generated data; 3) Fine-tuning with importance sampling, which guides the generative model to learn an adjusted distribution, thus controlling fidelity and diversity. Furthermore, our fine-tuning method demonstrates the ability to improve the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for pre-trained generative models with minimal iterations.

- **Summary**: Visual Question Answering for Remote Sensing (RSVQA) is a task that aims at answering natural language questions about the content of a remote sensing image. The visual features extraction is therefore an essential step in a VQA pipeline. By incorporating attention mechanisms into this process, models gain the ability to focus selectively on salient regions of the image, prioritizing the most relevant visual information for a given question. In this work, we propose to embed an attention mechanism guided by segmentation into a RSVQA pipeline. We argue that segmentation plays a crucial role in guiding attention by providing a contextual understanding of the visual information, underlying specific objects or areas of interest. To evaluate this methodology, we provide a new VQA dataset that exploits very high-resolution RGB orthophotos annotated with 16 segmentation classes and question/answer pairs. Our study shows promising results of our new methodology, gaining almost 10% of overall accuracy compared to a classical method on the proposed dataset.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we consider the problem of prototype-based vision-language reasoning problem. We observe that existing methods encounter three major challenges: 1) escalating resource demands and prolonging training times, 2) contending with excessive learnable parameters, and 3) fine-tuning based only on a single modality. These challenges will hinder their capability to adapt Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks. Motivated by this critical observation, we propose a novel method called NODE-Adapter, which utilizes Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for better vision-language reasoning. To fully leverage both visual and textual modalities and estimate class prototypes more effectively and accurately, we divide our method into two stages: cross-modal prototype construction and cross-modal prototype optimization using neural ordinary differential equations. Specifically, we exploit VLM to encode hand-crafted prompts into textual features and few-shot support images into visual features. Then, we estimate the textual prototype and visual prototype by averaging the textual features and visual features, respectively, and adaptively combine the textual prototype and visual prototype to construct the cross-modal prototype. To alleviate the prototype bias, we then model the prototype optimization process as an initial value problem with Neural ODEs to estimate the continuous gradient flow. Our extensive experimental results, which cover few-shot classification, domain generalization, and visual reasoning on human-object interaction, demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Customizing text-to-image (T2I) models has seen tremendous progress recently, particularly in areas such as personalization, stylization, and conditional generation. However, expanding this progress to video generation is still in its infancy, primarily due to the lack of customized video data. In this work, we introduce Still-Moving, a novel generic framework for customizing a text-to-video (T2V) model, without requiring any customized video data. The framework applies to the prominent T2V design where the video model is built over a text-to-image (T2I) model (e.g., via inflation). We assume access to a customized version of the T2I model, trained only on still image data (e.g., using DreamBooth or StyleDrop). Naively plugging in the weights of the customized T2I model into the T2V model often leads to significant artifacts or insufficient adherence to the customization data. To overcome this issue, we train lightweight $\textit{Spatial Adapters}$ that adjust the features produced by the injected T2I layers. Importantly, our adapters are trained on $\textit{"frozen videos"}$ (i.e., repeated images), constructed from image samples generated by the customized T2I model. This training is facilitated by a novel $\textit{Motion Adapter}$ module, which allows us to train on such static videos while preserving the motion prior of the video model. At test time, we remove the Motion Adapter modules and leave in only the trained Spatial Adapters. This restores the motion prior of the T2V model while adhering to the spatial prior of the customized T2I model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on diverse tasks including personalized, stylized, and conditional generation. In all evaluated scenarios, our method seamlessly integrates the spatial prior of the customized T2I model with a motion prior supplied by the T2V model.

- **Summary**: Motion modeling is critical in flow-based Video Frame Interpolation (VFI). Existing paradigms either consider linear combinations of bidirectional flows or directly predict bilateral flows for given timestamps without exploring favorable motion priors, thus lacking the capability of effectively modeling spatiotemporal dynamics in real-world videos. To address this limitation, in this study, we introduce Generalizable Implicit Motion Modeling (GIMM), a novel and effective approach to motion modeling for VFI. Specifically, to enable GIMM as an effective motion modeling paradigm, we design a motion encoding pipeline to model spatiotemporal motion latent from bidirectional flows extracted from pre-trained flow estimators, effectively representing input-specific motion priors. Then, we implicitly predict arbitrary-timestep optical flows within two adjacent input frames via an adaptive coordinate-based neural network, with spatiotemporal coordinates and motion latent as inputs. Our GIMM can be smoothly integrated with existing flow-based VFI works without further modifications. We show that GIMM performs better than the current state of the art on the VFI benchmarks.

- **Summary**: With the remarkable advancements in image generation and open-form text generation, the creation of interleaved image-text content has become an increasingly intriguing field. Multimodal story generation, characterized by producing narrative texts and vivid images in an interleaved manner, has emerged as a valuable and practical task with broad applications. However, this task poses significant challenges, as it necessitates the comprehension of the complex interplay between texts and images, and the ability to generate long sequences of coherent, contextually relevant texts and visuals. In this work, we propose SEED-Story, a novel method that leverages a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate extended multimodal stories. Our model, built upon the powerful comprehension capability of MLLM, predicts text tokens as well as visual tokens, which are subsequently processed with an adapted visual de-tokenizer to produce images with consistent characters and styles. We further propose multimodal attention sink mechanism to enable the generation of stories with up to 25 sequences (only 10 for training) in a highly efficient autoregressive manner. Additionally, we present a large-scale and high-resolution dataset named StoryStream for training our model and quantitatively evaluating the task of multimodal story generation in various aspects.

- **Summary**: Large Language Models have shown remarkable efficacy in generating streaming data such as text and audio, thanks to their temporally uni-directional attention mechanism, which models correlations between the current token and previous tokens. However, video streaming remains much less explored, despite a growing need for live video processing. State-of-the-art video diffusion models leverage bi-directional temporal attention to model the correlations between the current frame and all the surrounding (i.e. including future) frames, which hinders them from processing streaming videos. To address this problem, we present Live2Diff, the first attempt at designing a video diffusion model with uni-directional temporal attention, specifically targeting live streaming video translation. Compared to previous works, our approach ensures temporal consistency and smoothness by correlating the current frame with its predecessors and a few initial warmup frames, without any future frames. Additionally, we use a highly efficient denoising scheme featuring a KV-cache mechanism and pipelining, to facilitate streaming video translation at interactive framerates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attention mechanism and pipeline, outperforming previous methods in terms of temporal smoothness and/or efficiency.

- **Summary**: This paper explores the synergistic potential of neuromorphic and edge computing to create a versatile machine learning (ML) system tailored for processing data captured by dynamic vision sensors. We construct and train hybrid models, blending spiking neural networks (SNNs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) using PyTorch and Lava frameworks. Our hybrid architecture integrates an SNN for temporal feature extraction and an ANN for classification. We delve into the challenges of deploying such hybrid structures on hardware. Specifically, we deploy individual components on Intel's Neuromorphic Processor Loihi (for SNN) and Jetson Nano (for ANN). We also propose an accumulator circuit to transfer data from the spiking to the non-spiking domain. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive performance analyses of hybrid SNN-ANN models on a heterogeneous system of neuromorphic and edge AI hardware, evaluating accuracy, latency, power, and energy consumption. Our findings demonstrate that the hybrid spiking networks surpass the baseline ANN model across all metrics and outperform the baseline SNN model in accuracy and latency.

- **Summary**: High-resolution inputs enable Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to discern finer visual details, enhancing their comprehension capabilities. To reduce the training and computation costs caused by high-resolution input, one promising direction is to use sliding windows to slice the input into uniform patches, each matching the input size of the well-trained vision encoder. Although efficient, this slicing strategy leads to the fragmentation of original input, i.e., the continuity of contextual information and spatial geometry is lost across patches, adversely affecting performance in cross-patch context perception and position-specific tasks. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce HiRes-LLaVA, a novel framework designed to efficiently process any size of high-resolution input without altering the original contextual and geometric information. HiRes-LLaVA comprises two innovative components: (i) a SliceRestore adapter that reconstructs sliced patches into their original form, efficiently extracting both global and local features via down-up-sampling and convolution layers, and (ii) a Self-Mining Sampler to compresses the vision tokens based on themselves, preserving the original context and positional information while reducing training overhead. To assess the ability of handling context fragmentation, we construct a new benchmark, EntityGrid-QA, consisting of edge-related and position-related tasks. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of HiRes-LLaVA on both existing public benchmarks and on EntityGrid-QA, particularly on document-oriented tasks, establishing new standards for handling high-resolution inputs.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress in document-based Visual Question Answering (i.e., responding to queries about the contents of an input document provided as an image). In this work, we show these models can memorize responses for training samples and regurgitate them even when the relevant visual information has been removed. This includes Personal Identifiable Information (PII) repeated once in the training set, indicating these models could divulge memorised sensitive information and therefore pose a privacy risk. We quantitatively measure the extractability of information in controlled experiments and differentiate between cases where it arises from generalization capabilities or from memorization. We further investigate the factors that influence memorization across multiple state-of-the-art models and propose an effective heuristic countermeasure that empirically prevents the extractability of PII.

- **Summary**: We propose OmniNOCS, a large-scale monocular dataset with 3D Normalized Object Coordinate Space (NOCS) maps, object masks, and 3D bounding box annotations for indoor and outdoor scenes. OmniNOCS has 20 times more object classes and 200 times more instances than existing NOCS datasets (NOCS-Real275, Wild6D). We use OmniNOCS to train a novel, transformer-based monocular NOCS prediction model (NOCSformer) that can predict accurate NOCS, instance masks and poses from 2D object detections across diverse classes. It is the first NOCS model that can generalize to a broad range of classes when prompted with 2D boxes. We evaluate our model on the task of 3D oriented bounding box prediction, where it achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art 3D detection methods such as Cube R-CNN. Unlike other 3D detection methods, our model also provides detailed and accurate 3D object shape and segmentation. We propose a novel benchmark for the task of NOCS prediction based on OmniNOCS, which we hope will serve as a useful baseline for future work in this area. Our dataset and code will be at the project website: https://omninocs.github.io.

- **Summary**: Lip-based biometric authentication (LBBA) has attracted many researchers during the last decade. The lip is specifically interesting for biometric researchers because it is a twin biometric with the potential to function both as a physiological and a behavioral trait. Although much valuable research was conducted on LBBA, none of them considered the different emotions of the client during the video acquisition step of LBBA, which can potentially affect the client's facial expressions and speech tempo. We proposed a novel network structure called WhisperNetV2, which extends our previously proposed network called WhisperNet. Our proposed network leverages a deep Siamese structure with triplet loss having three identical SlowFast networks as embedding networks. The SlowFast network is an excellent candidate for our task since the fast pathway extracts motion-related features (behavioral lip movements) with a high frame rate and low channel capacity. The slow pathway extracts visual features (physiological lip appearance) with a low frame rate and high channel capacity. Using an open-set protocol, we trained our network using the CREMA-D dataset and acquired an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.005 on the test set. Considering that the acquired EER is less than most similar LBBA methods, our method can be considered as a state-of-the-art LBBA method.

- **Summary**: Mirroring the complex structures and diverse functions of natural organisms is a long-standing challenge in robotics. Modern fabrication techniques have dramatically expanded feasible hardware, yet deploying these systems requires control software to translate desired motions into actuator commands. While conventional robots can easily be modeled as rigid links connected via joints, it remains an open challenge to model and control bio-inspired robots that are often multi-material or soft, lack sensing capabilities, and may change their material properties with use. Here, we introduce Neural Jacobian Fields, an architecture that autonomously learns to model and control robots from vision alone. Our approach makes no assumptions about the robot's materials, actuation, or sensing, requires only a single camera for control, and learns to control the robot without expert intervention by observing the execution of random commands. We demonstrate our method on a diverse set of robot manipulators, varying in actuation, materials, fabrication, and cost. Our approach achieves accurate closed-loop control and recovers the causal dynamic structure of each robot. By enabling robot control with a generic camera as the only sensor, we anticipate our work will dramatically broaden the design space of robotic systems and serve as a starting point for lowering the barrier to robotic automation.

- **Summary**: Public urban spaces like streetscapes and plazas serve residents and accommodate social life in all its vibrant variations. Recent advances in Robotics and Embodied AI make public urban spaces no longer exclusive to humans. Food delivery bots and electric wheelchairs have started sharing sidewalks with pedestrians, while diverse robot dogs and humanoids have recently emerged in the street. Ensuring the generalizability and safety of these forthcoming mobile machines is crucial when navigating through the bustling streets in urban spaces. In this work, we present MetaUrban, a compositional simulation platform for Embodied AI research in urban spaces. MetaUrban can construct an infinite number of interactive urban scenes from compositional elements, covering a vast array of ground plans, object placements, pedestrians, vulnerable road users, and other mobile agents' appearances and dynamics. We design point navigation and social navigation tasks as the pilot study using MetaUrban for embodied AI research and establish various baselines of Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning. Experiments demonstrate that the compositional nature of the simulated environments can substantially improve the generalizability and safety of the trained mobile agents. MetaUrban will be made publicly available to provide more research opportunities and foster safe and trustworthy embodied AI in urban spaces.

- **Summary**: Top-down Bird's Eye View (BEV) maps are a popular representation for ground robot navigation due to their richness and flexibility for downstream tasks. While recent methods have shown promise for predicting BEV maps from First-Person View (FPV) images, their generalizability is limited to small regions captured by current autonomous vehicle-based datasets. In this context, we show that a more scalable approach towards generalizable map prediction can be enabled by using two large-scale crowd-sourced mapping platforms, Mapillary for FPV images and OpenStreetMap for BEV semantic maps. We introduce Map It Anywhere (MIA), a data engine that enables seamless curation and modeling of labeled map prediction data from existing open-source map platforms. Using our MIA data engine, we display the ease of automatically collecting a dataset of 1.2 million pairs of FPV images & BEV maps encompassing diverse geographies, landscapes, environmental factors, camera models & capture scenarios. We further train a simple camera model-agnostic model on this data for BEV map prediction. Extensive evaluations using established benchmarks and our dataset show that the data curated by MIA enables effective pretraining for generalizable BEV map prediction, with zero-shot performance far exceeding baselines trained on existing datasets by 35%. Our analysis highlights the promise of using large-scale public maps for developing & testing generalizable BEV perception, paving the way for more robust autonomous navigation.

- **Summary**: The goal of this paper is to address the problem of \textit{global} point cloud registration (PCR) i.e., finding the optimal alignment between point clouds irrespective of the initial poses of the scans. This problem is notoriously challenging for classical optimization methods due to computational constraints. First, we show that state-of-the-art deep learning methods suffer from huge performance degradation when the point clouds are arbitrarily placed in space. We propose that \textit{equivariant deep learning} should be utilized for solving this task and we characterize the specific type of bi-equivariance of PCR. Then, we design BiEquiformer a novel and scalable \textit{bi-equivariant} pipeline i.e. equivariant to the independent transformations of the input point clouds. While a naive approach would process the point clouds independently we design expressive bi-equivariant layers that fuse the information from both point clouds. This allows us to extract high-quality superpoint correspondences and in turn, robust point-cloud registration. Extensive comparisons against state-of-the-art methods show that our method achieves comparable performance in the canonical setting and superior performance in the robust setting in both the 3DMatch and the challenging low-overlap 3DLoMatch dataset.

- **Summary**: We have made significant progress towards building foundational video diffusion models. As these models are trained using large-scale unsupervised data, it has become crucial to adapt these models to specific downstream tasks. Adapting these models via supervised fine-tuning requires collecting target datasets of videos, which is challenging and tedious. In this work, we utilize pre-trained reward models that are learned via preferences on top of powerful vision discriminative models to adapt video diffusion models. These models contain dense gradient information with respect to generated RGB pixels, which is critical to efficient learning in complex search spaces, such as videos. We show that backpropagating gradients from these reward models to a video diffusion model can allow for compute and sample efficient alignment of the video diffusion model. We show results across a variety of reward models and video diffusion models, demonstrating that our approach can learn much more efficiently in terms of reward queries and computation than prior gradient-free approaches.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently emerged as a significant focus in academia and industry. Despite their proficiency in general multi-modal scenarios, the mathematical problem-solving capabilities in visual contexts remain insufficiently explored. We identify three key areas within MLLMs that need to be improved: visual encoding of math diagrams, diagram-language alignment, and mathematical reasoning skills. This draws forth an urgent demand for large-scale, high-quality data and training pipelines in visual mathematics. In this paper, we propose MAVIS, the first MAthematical VISual instruction tuning paradigm for MLLMs, involving a series of mathematical visual datasets and specialized MLLMs. Targeting the three issues, MAVIS contains three progressive training stages from scratch. First, we curate MAVIS-Caption, consisting of 558K diagram-caption pairs, to fine-tune a math-specific vision encoder (CLIP-Math) through contrastive learning, tailored for improved diagram visual encoding. Second, we utilize MAVIS-Caption to align the CLIP-Math with a large language model (LLM) by a projection layer, enhancing vision-language alignment in mathematical domains. Third, we introduce MAVIS-Instruct, including 900K meticulously collected and annotated visual math problems, which is adopted to finally instruct-tune the MLLM for robust mathematical reasoning skills. In MAVIS-Instruct, we incorporate complete chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales for each problem, and minimize textual redundancy, thereby concentrating the model towards the visual elements.
