- **Summary**: The use of a single image restoration framework to achieve multi-task image restoration has garnered significant attention from researchers. However, several practical challenges remain, including meeting the specific and simultaneous demands of different tasks, balancing relationships between tasks, and effectively utilizing task correlations in model design. To address these challenges, this paper explores a multi-expert adaptive selection mechanism. We begin by designing a feature representation method that accounts for both the pixel channel level and the global level, encompassing low-frequency and high-frequency components of the image. Based on this method, we construct a multi-expert selection and ensemble scheme. This scheme adaptively selects the most suitable expert from the expert library according to the content of the input image and the prompts of the current task. It not only meets the individualized needs of different tasks but also achieves balance and optimization across tasks. By sharing experts, our design promotes interconnections between different tasks, thereby enhancing overall performance and resource utilization. Additionally, the multi-expert mechanism effectively eliminates irrelevant experts, reducing interference from them and further improving the effectiveness and accuracy of image restoration. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is both effective and superior to existing approaches, highlighting its potential for practical applications in multi-task image restoration.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation has witnessed significant advancements with the emergence of deep learning. However, the reliance of most neural network models on a substantial amount of annotated data remains a challenge for medical image segmentation. To address this issue, few-shot segmentation methods based on meta-learning have been employed. Presently, the methods primarily focus on aligning the support set and query set to enhance performance, but this approach hinders further improvement of the model's effectiveness. In this paper, our objective is to propose a few-shot medical segmentation model that acquire comprehensive feature representation capabilities, which will boost segmentation accuracy by capturing both local and long-range features. To achieve this, we introduce a plug-and-play attention module that dynamically enhances both query and support features, thereby improving the representativeness of the extracted features. Our model comprises four key modules: a dual-path feature extractor, an attention module, an adaptive prototype prediction module, and a multi-scale prediction fusion module. Specifically, the dual-path feature extractor acquires multi-scale features by obtaining features of 32{\times}32 size and 64{\times}64 size. The attention module follows the feature extractor and captures local and long-range information. The adaptive prototype prediction module automatically adjusts the anomaly score threshold to predict prototypes, while the multi-scale fusion prediction module integrates prediction masks of various scales to produce the final segmentation result. We conducted experiments on publicly available MRI datasets, namely CHAOS and CMR, and compared our method with other advanced techniques. The results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: 3D sensing is a fundamental task for Autonomous Vehicles. Its deployment often relies on aligned RGB cameras and LiDAR. Despite meticulous synchronization and calibration, systematic misalignment persists in LiDAR projected depthmap. This is due to the physical baseline distance between the two sensors. The artifact is often reflected as background LiDAR incorrectly projected onto the foreground, such as cars and pedestrians. The KITTI dataset uses stereo cameras as a heuristic solution to remove artifacts. However most AV datasets, including nuScenes, Waymo, and DDAD, lack stereo images, making the KITTI solution inapplicable. We propose RePLAy, a parameter-free analytical solution to remove the projective artifacts. We construct a binocular vision system between a hypothesized virtual LiDAR camera and the RGB camera. We then remove the projective artifacts by determining the epipolar occlusion with the proposed analytical solution. We show unanimous improvement in the State-of-The-Art (SoTA) monocular depth estimators and 3D object detectors with the artifacts-free depthmaps.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in 3D object detection have benefited from multi-modal information from the multi-view cameras and LiDAR sensors. However, the inherent disparities between the modalities pose substantial challenges. We observe that existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods heavily rely on the LiDAR sensor, treating the camera as an auxiliary modality for augmenting semantic details. This often leads to not only underutilization of camera data but also significant performance degradation in scenarios where LiDAR data is unavailable. Additionally, existing fusion methods overlook the detrimental impact of sensor noise induced by environmental changes, on detection performance. In this paper, we propose MEFormer to address the LiDAR over-reliance problem by harnessing critical information for 3D object detection from every available modality while concurrently safeguarding against corrupted signals during the fusion process. Specifically, we introduce Modality Agnostic Decoding (MOAD) that extracts geometric and semantic features with a shared transformer decoder regardless of input modalities and provides promising improvement with a single modality as well as multi-modality. Additionally, our Proximity-based Modality Ensemble (PME) module adaptively utilizes the strengths of each modality depending on the environment while mitigating the effects of a noisy sensor. Our MEFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance of 73.9% NDS and 71.5% mAP in the nuScenes validation set. Extensive analyses validate that our MEFormer improves robustness against challenging conditions such as sensor malfunctions or environmental changes.

- **Summary**: Both self-supervised depth estimation and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) recover scene depth from RGB videos. Despite sharing a similar objective, the two approaches are disconnected. Prior works of self-supervision backpropagate losses defined within immediate neighboring frames. Instead of learning-through-loss, this work proposes an alternative scheme by performing local SfM. First, with calibrated RGB or RGB-D images, we employ a depth and correspondence estimator to infer depthmaps and pair-wise correspondence maps. Then, a novel bundle-RANSAC-adjustment algorithm jointly optimizes camera poses and one depth adjustment for each depthmap. Finally, we fix camera poses and employ a NeRF, however, without a neural network, for dense triangulation and geometric verification. Poses, depth adjustments, and triangulated sparse depths are our outputs. For the first time, we show self-supervision within $5$ frames already benefits SoTA supervised depth and correspondence models.

- **Summary**: The rapid development of multimedia has provided a large amount of data with different distributions for visual tasks, forming different domains. Federated Learning (FL) can efficiently use this diverse data distributed on different client media in a decentralized manner through model sharing. However, in open-world scenarios, there is a challenge: global models may struggle to predict well on entirely new domain data captured by certain media, which were not encountered during training. Existing methods still rely on strong statistical correlations between samples and labels to address this issue, which can be misleading, as some features may establish spurious short-cut correlations with the predictions. To comprehensively address this challenge, we introduce FedCD (Cross-Domain Invariant Federated Learning), an overall optimization framework at both the local and global levels. We introduce the Spurious Correlation Intervener (SCI), which employs invariance theory to locally generate interventers for features in a self-supervised manner to reduce the model's susceptibility to spurious correlated features. Our approach requires no sharing of data or features, only the gradients related to the model. Additionally, we develop the simple yet effective Risk Extrapolation Aggregation strategy (REA), determining aggregation coefficients through mathematical optimization to facilitate global causal invariant predictions. Extensive experiments and ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of our approach. In both classification and object detection generalization tasks, our method outperforms the baselines by an average of at least 1.45% in Acc, 4.8% and 1.27% in mAP50.

By employing a two-stage training strategy on the constructed dataset, Power-LLaVA demonstrates exceptional performance at a comparatively low training cost. Extensive experiments further prove the great capabilities of Power-LLaVA within the realm of power transmission line inspection. Code shall be released.

- **Summary**: Forest fires pose a significant threat to ecosystems, economies, and human health worldwide. Early detection and assessment of forest fires are crucial for effective management and conservation efforts. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced computer vision algorithms offer a promising solution for forest fire detection and assessment. In this paper, we optimize an integrated forest fire risk assessment framework using UAVs and multi-stage object detection algorithms. We introduce improvements to our previous framework, including the adoption of Faster R-CNN, Grid R-CNN, Sparse R-CNN, Cascade R-CNN, Dynamic R-CNN, and Libra R-CNN detectors, and explore optimizations such as CBAM for attention enhancement, random erasing for preprocessing, and different color space representations. We evaluate these enhancements through extensive experimentation using aerial image footage from various regions in British Columbia, Canada. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-stage detectors and optimizations in improving the accuracy of forest fire risk assessment. This research contributes to the advancement of UAV-based forest fire detection and assessment systems, enhancing their efficiency and effectiveness in supporting sustainable forest management and conservation efforts.

- **Summary**: Large multimodal language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding and manipulating images. However, many of these models struggle with comprehending intensive textual contents embedded within the images, primarily due to the limited text recognition and layout understanding ability. To understand the sources of these limitations, we perform an exploratory analysis showing the drawbacks of classical visual encoders on visual text understanding. Hence, we present LLaVA-Read, a multimodal large language model that utilizes dual visual encoders along with a visual text encoder. Our model surpasses existing state-of-the-art models in various text-rich image understanding tasks, showcasing enhanced comprehension of textual content within images. Together, our research suggests visual text understanding remains an open challenge and an efficient visual text encoder is crucial for future successful multimodal systems.

- **Summary**: Accurate nuclei segmentation is an essential foundation for various applications in computational pathology, including cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. Even slight variations in nuclei representations can significantly impact these downstream tasks. However, achieving accurate segmentation remains challenging due to factors like clustered nuclei, high intra-class variability in size and shape, resemblance to other cells, and color or contrast variations between nuclei and background. Despite the extensive utilization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in medical image segmentation, they may have trouble capturing long-range dependencies crucial for accurate nuclei delineation. Transformers address this limitation but might miss essential low-level features. To overcome these limitations, we utilized CNN-Transformer-based techniques for nuclei segmentation in H&E stained histology images. In this work, we proposed two CNN-Transformer architectures, Nuclei Hybrid Vision Transformer (NucleiHVT) and Channel Boosted Nuclei Hybrid Vision Transformer (CB-NucleiHVT), that leverage the strengths of both CNNs and Transformers to effectively learn nuclei boundaries in multi-organ histology images. The first architecture, NucleiHVT is inspired by the UNet architecture and incorporates the dual attention mechanism to capture both multi-level and multi-scale context effectively. The CB-NucleiHVT network, on the other hand, utilizes the concept of channel boosting to learn diverse feature spaces, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish subtle variations in nuclei characteristics. Detailed evaluation of two medical image segmentation datasets shows that the proposed architectures outperform existing CNN-based, Transformer-based, and hybrid methods. The proposed networks demonstrated effective results both in terms of quantitative metrics, and qualitative visual assessment.

- **Summary**: Nowadays, misinformation is widely spreading over various social media platforms and causes extremely negative impacts on society. To combat this issue, automatically identifying misinformation, especially those containing multimodal content, has attracted growing attention from the academic and industrial communities, and induced an active research topic named Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD). Typically, existing MMD methods capture the semantic correlation and inconsistency between multiple modalities, but neglect some potential clues in multimodal content. Recent studies suggest that manipulated traces of the images in articles are non-trivial clues for detecting misinformation. Meanwhile, we find that the underlying intentions behind the manipulation, e.g., harmful and harmless, also matter in MMD. Accordingly, in this work, we propose to detect misinformation by learning manipulation features that indicate whether the image has been manipulated, as well as intention features regarding the harmful and harmless intentions of the manipulation. Unfortunately, the manipulation and intention labels that make these features discriminative are unknown. To overcome the problem, we propose two weakly supervised signals as alternatives by introducing additional datasets on image manipulation detection and formulating two classification tasks as positive and unlabeled learning problems. Based on these ideas, we propose a novel MMD method, namely Harmfully Manipulated Images Matter in MMD (HAMI-M3D). Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets can demonstrate that HAMI-M3D can consistently improve the performance of any MMD baselines.

- **Summary**: This study proves the two-phase dynamics of a deep neural network (DNN) learning interactions. Despite the long disappointing view of the faithfulness of post-hoc explanation of a DNN, in recent years, a series of theorems have been proven to show that given an input sample, a small number of interactions between input variables can be considered as primitive inference patterns, which can faithfully represent every detailed inference logic of the DNN on this sample. Particularly, it has been observed that various DNNs all learn interactions of different complexities with two-phase dynamics, and this well explains how a DNN's generalization power changes from under-fitting to over-fitting. Therefore, in this study, we prove the dynamics of a DNN gradually encoding interactions of different complexities, which provides a theoretically grounded mechanism for the over-fitting of a DNN. Experiments show that our theory well predicts the real learning dynamics of various DNNs on different tasks.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates the role of CLIP image embeddings within the Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) framework, focusing on their impact on video generation quality and computational efficiency. Our findings indicate that CLIP embeddings, while crucial for aesthetic quality, do not significantly contribute towards the subject and background consistency of video outputs. Moreover, the computationally expensive cross-attention mechanism can be effectively replaced by a simpler linear layer. This layer is computed only once at the first diffusion inference step, and its output is then cached and reused throughout the inference process, thereby enhancing efficiency while maintaining high-quality outputs. Building on these insights, we introduce the VCUT, a training-free approach optimized for efficiency within the SVD architecture. VCUT eliminates temporal cross-attention and replaces spatial cross-attention with a one-time computed linear layer, significantly reducing computational load. The implementation of VCUT leads to a reduction of up to 322T Multiple-Accumulate Operations (MACs) per video and a decrease in model parameters by up to 50M, achieving a 20% reduction in latency compared to the baseline. Our approach demonstrates that conditioning during the Semantic Binding stage is sufficient, eliminating the need for continuous computation across all inference steps and setting a new standard for efficient video generation.

- **Summary**: The requirement for 3D content is growing as AR/VR application emerges. At the same time, 3D modelling is only available for skillful experts, because traditional methods like Computer-Aided Design (CAD) are often too labor-intensive and skill-demanding, making it challenging for novice users. Our proposed method, Magic3DSketch, employs a novel technique that encodes sketches to predict a 3D mesh, guided by text descriptions and leveraging external prior knowledge obtained through text and language-image pre-training. The integration of language-image pre-trained neural networks complements the sparse and ambiguous nature of single-view sketch inputs. Our method is also more useful and offers higher degree of controllability compared to existing text-to-3D approaches, according to our user study. Moreover, Magic3DSketch achieves state-of-the-art performance in both synthetic and real dataset with the capability of producing more detailed structures and realistic shapes with the help of text input. Users are also more satisfied with models obtained by Magic3DSketch according to our user study. Additionally, we are also the first, to our knowledge, add color based on text description to the sketch-derived shapes. By combining sketches and text guidance with the help of language-image pretrained models, our Magic3DSketch can allow novice users to create custom 3D models with minimal effort and maximum creative freedom, with the potential to revolutionize future 3D modeling pipelines.

- **Summary**: Radio frequency (RF) signals have been proved to be flexible for human silhouette segmentation (HSS) under complex environments. Existing studies are mainly based on a one-shot approach, which lacks a coherent projection ability from the RF domain. Additionally, the spatio-temporal patterns have not been fully explored for human motion dynamics in HSS. Therefore, we propose a two-stage Sequential Diffusion Model (SDM) to progressively synthesize high-quality segmentation jointly with the considerations on motion dynamics. Cross-view transformation blocks are devised to guide the diffusion model in a multi-scale manner for comprehensively characterizing human related patterns in an individual frame such as directional projection from signal planes. Moreover, spatio-temporal blocks are devised to fine-tune the frame-level model to incorporate spatio-temporal contexts and motion dynamics, enhancing the consistency of the segmentation maps. Comprehensive experiments on a public benchmark -- HIBER demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method with an IoU 0.732. Our code is available at https://github.com/ph-w2000/SDM.

- **Summary**: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) aims to explore the relationships between objects in images and obtain scene summary graphs, thereby better serving downstream tasks. However, the long-tailed problem has adversely affected the scene graph's quality. The predictions are dominated by coarse-grained relationships, lacking more informative fine-grained ones. The union region of one object pair (i.e., one sample) contains rich and dedicated contextual information, enabling the prediction of the sample-specific bias for refining the original relationship prediction. Therefore, we propose a novel Sample-Level Bias Prediction (SBP) method for fine-grained SGG (SBG). Firstly, we train a classic SGG model and construct a correction bias set by calculating the margin between the ground truth label and the predicted label with one classic SGG model. Then, we devise a Bias-Oriented Generative Adversarial Network (BGAN) that learns to predict the constructed correction biases, which can be utilized to correct the original predictions from coarse-grained relationships to fine-grained ones. The extensive experimental results on VG, GQA, and VG-1800 datasets demonstrate that our SBG outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of Average@K across three mainstream SGG models: Motif, VCtree, and Transformer. Compared to dataset-level correction methods on VG, SBG shows a significant average improvement of 5.6%, 3.9%, and 3.2% on Average@K for tasks PredCls, SGCls, and SGDet, respectively. The code will be available at https://github.com/Zhuzi24/SBG.

- **Summary**: This work presents a novel and effective method for fitting multidimensional ellipsoids to scattered data in the contamination of noise and outliers. We approach the problem as a Bayesian parameter estimate process and maximize the posterior probability of a certain ellipsoidal solution given the data. We establish a more robust correlation between these points based on the predictive distribution within the Bayesian framework. We incorporate a uniform prior distribution to constrain the search for primitive parameters within an ellipsoidal domain, ensuring ellipsoid-specific results regardless of inputs. We then establish the connection between measurement point and model data via Bayes' rule to enhance the method's robustness against noise. Due to independent of spatial dimensions, the proposed method not only delivers high-quality fittings to challenging elongated ellipsoids but also generalizes well to multidimensional spaces. To address outlier disturbances, often overlooked by previous approaches, we further introduce a uniform distribution on top of the predictive distribution to significantly enhance the algorithm's robustness against outliers. We introduce an {\epsilon}-accelerated technique to expedite the convergence of EM considerably. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive method capable of performing multidimensional ellipsoid specific fitting within the Bayesian optimization paradigm under diverse disturbances. We evaluate it across lower and higher dimensional spaces in the presence of heavy noise, outliers, and substantial variations in axis ratios. Also, we apply it to a wide range of practical applications such as microscopy cell counting, 3D reconstruction, geometric shape approximation, and magnetometer calibration tasks.

- **Summary**: The Quick-view (QV) technique serves as a primary method for detecting defects within sewerage systems. However, the effectiveness of QV is impeded by the limited visual range of its hardware, resulting in suboptimal image quality for distant portions of the sewer network. Image super-resolution is an effective way to improve image quality and has been applied in a variety of scenes. However, research on super-resolution for sewer images remains considerably unexplored. In response, this study leverages the inherent depth relationships present within QV images and introduces a novel Depth-guided, Reference-based Super-Resolution framework denoted as DSRNet. It comprises two core components: a depth extraction module and a depth information matching module (DMM). DSRNet utilizes the adjacent frames of the low-resolution image as reference images and helps them recover texture information based on the correlation. By combining these modules, the integration of depth priors significantly enhances both visual quality and performance benchmarks. Besides, in pursuit of computational efficiency and compactness, our paper introduces a super-resolution knowledge distillation model based on an attention mechanism. This mechanism facilitates the acquisition of feature similarity between a more complex teacher model and a streamlined student model, the latter being a lightweight version of DSRNet. Experimental results demonstrate that DSRNet significantly improves PSNR and SSIM compared with other methods. This study also conducts experiments on sewer defect semantic segmentation, object detection, and classification on the Pipe dataset and Sewer-ML dataset. Experiments show that the method can improve the performance of low-resolution sewer images in these tasks.

- **Summary**: Our findings indicate that adopting "advanced" computational elements fails to significantly improve registration accuracy. Instead, well-established registration-specific designs offer fair improvements, enhancing results by a marginal 1.5\% over the baseline. Our findings emphasize the importance of rigorous, unbiased evaluation and contribution disentanglement of all low- and high-level registration components, rather than simply following the computer vision trends with "more advanced" computational blocks. We advocate for simpler yet effective solutions and novel evaluation metrics that go beyond conventional registration accuracy, warranting further research across diverse organs and modalities.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral imaging holds promises in surgical imaging by offering biological tissue differentiation capabilities with detailed information that is invisible to the naked eye. For intra-operative guidance, real-time spectral data capture and display is mandated. Snapshot mosaic hyperspectral cameras are currently seen as the most suitable technology given this requirement. However, snapshot mosaic imaging requires a demosaicking algorithm to fully restore the spatial and spectral details in the images. Modern demosaicking approaches typically rely on synthetic datasets to develop supervised learning methods, as it is practically impossible to simultaneously capture both snapshot and high-resolution spectral images of the exact same surgical scene. In this work, we present a self-supervised demosaicking and RGB reconstruction method that does not depend on paired high-resolution data as ground truth. We leverage unpaired standard high-resolution surgical microscopy images, which only provide RGB data but can be collected during routine surgeries. Adversarial learning complemented by self-supervised approaches are used to drive our hyperspectral-based RGB reconstruction into resembling surgical microscopy images and increasing the spatial resolution of our demosaicking. The spatial and spectral fidelity of the reconstructed hyperspectral images have been evaluated quantitatively. Moreover, a user study was conducted to evaluate the RGB visualisation generated from these spectral images. Both spatial detail and colour accuracy were assessed by neurosurgical experts. Our proposed self-supervised demosaicking method demonstrates improved results compared to existing methods, demonstrating its potential for seamless integration into intra-operative workflows.

- **Summary**: Pancreatic cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Precise segmentation of pancreatic tumors from medical images is a bottleneck for effective clinical decision-making. However, achieving a high accuracy is often limited by the small size and availability of real patient data for training deep learning models. Recent approaches have employed synthetic data generation to augment training datasets. While promising, these methods may not yet meet the performance benchmarks required for real-world clinical use. This study critically evaluates the limitations of existing generative-AI based frameworks for pancreatic tumor segmentation. We conduct a series of experiments to investigate the impact of synthetic \textit{tumor size} and \textit{boundary definition} precision on model performance. Our findings demonstrate that: (1) strategically selecting a combination of synthetic tumor sizes is crucial for optimal segmentation outcomes, and (2) generating synthetic tumors with precise boundaries significantly improves model accuracy. These insights highlight the importance of utilizing refined synthetic data augmentation for enhancing the clinical utility of segmentation models in pancreatic cancer decision making including diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment plans.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there have been significant advancements in applying attention mechanisms to point cloud analysis. However, attention module variants featured in various research papers often operate under diverse settings and tasks, incorporating potential training strategies. This heterogeneity poses challenges in establishing a fair comparison among these attention module variants. In this paper, we address this issue by rethinking and exploring attention module design within a consistent base framework and settings. Both global-based and local-based attention methods are studied, with a focus on the selection basis and scales of neighbors for local-based attention. Different combinations of aggregated local features and computation methods for attention scores are evaluated, ranging from the initial addition/concatenation-based approach to the widely adopted dot product-based method and the recently proposed vector attention technique. Various position encoding methods are also investigated. Our extensive experimental analysis reveals that there is no universally optimal design across diverse point cloud tasks. Instead, drawing from best practices, we propose tailored attention modules for specific tasks, leading to superior performance on point cloud classification and segmentation benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Surgery requires comprehensive medical knowledge, visual assessment skills, and procedural expertise. While recent surgical AI models have focused on solving task-specific problems, there is a need for general-purpose systems that can understand surgical scenes and interact through natural language. This paper introduces GP-VLS, a general-purpose vision language model for surgery that integrates medical and surgical knowledge with visual scene understanding. For comprehensively evaluating general-purpose surgical models, we propose SurgiQual, which evaluates across medical and surgical knowledge benchmarks as well as surgical vision-language questions. To train GP-VLS, we develop six new datasets spanning medical knowledge, surgical textbooks, and vision-language pairs for tasks like phase recognition and tool identification. We show that GP-VLS significantly outperforms existing open- and closed-source models on surgical vision-language tasks, with 8-21% improvements in accuracy across SurgiQual benchmarks. GP-VLS also demonstrates strong performance on medical and surgical knowledge tests compared to open-source alternatives. Overall, GP-VLS provides an open-source foundation for developing AI assistants to support surgeons across a wide range of tasks and scenarios.



### Symmetrical Joint Learning Support-query Prototypes for Few-shot Segmentation

- **Summary**: We propose Sym-Net, a novel framework for Few-Shot Segmentation (FSS) that addresses the critical issue of intra-class variation by jointly learning both query and support prototypes in a symmetrical manner. Unlike previous methods that generate query prototypes solely by matching query features to support prototypes, which is a form of bias learning towards the few-shot support samples, Sym-Net leverages a balanced symmetrical learning approach for both query and support prototypes, ensuring that the learning process does not favor one set (support or query) over the other. One of main modules of Sym-Net is the visual-text alignment-based prototype aggregation module, which is not just query-guided prototype refinement, it is a jointly learning from both support and query samples, which makes the model beneficial for handling intra-class discrepancies and allows it to generalize better to new, unseen classes. Specifically, a parameter-free prior mask generation module is designed to accurately localize both local and global regions of the query object by using sliding windows of different sizes and a self-activation kernel to suppress incorrect background matches. Additionally, to address the information loss caused by spatial pooling during prototype learning, a top-down hyper-correlation module is integrated to capture multi-scale spatial relationships between support and query images. This approach is further jointly optimized by implementing a co-optimized hard triplet mining strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed Sym-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models, which demonstrates that jointly learning support-query prototypes in a symmetrical manner for FSS offers a promising direction to enhance segmentation performance with limited annotated data.

- **Summary**: As deep vision models' popularity rapidly increases, there is a growing emphasis on explanations for model predictions. The inherently explainable attribution method aims to enhance the understanding of model behavior by identifying the important regions in images that significantly contribute to predictions. It is achieved by cooperatively training a selector (generating an attribution map to identify important features) and a predictor (making predictions using the identified features). Despite many advancements, existing methods suffer from the incompleteness problem, where discriminative features are masked out, and the interlocking problem, where the non-optimized selector initially selects noise, causing the predictor to fit on this noise and perpetuate the cycle. To address these problems, we introduce a new objective that discourages the presence of discriminative features in the masked-out regions thus enhancing the comprehensiveness of feature selection. A pre-trained detector is introduced to detect discriminative features in the masked-out region. If the selector selects noise instead of discriminative features, the detector can observe and break the interlocking situation by penalizing the selector. Extensive experiments show that our model makes accurate predictions with higher accuracy than the regular black-box model, and produces attribution maps with high feature coverage, localization ability, fidelity and robustness.

- **Summary**: Detecting and segmenting human skin regions in digital images is an intensively explored topic of computer vision with a variety of approaches proposed over the years that have been found useful in numerous practical applications. The first methods were based on pixel-wise skin color modeling and they were later enhanced with context-based analysis to include the textural and geometrical features, recently extracted using deep convolutional neural networks. It has been also demonstrated that skin regions can be segmented from grayscale images without using color information at all. However, the possibility to combine these two sources of information has not been explored so far and we address this research gap with the contribution reported in this paper. We propose to train a convolutional network using the datasets focused on different features to create an ensemble whose individual outcomes are effectively combined using yet another convolutional network trained to produce the final segmentation map. The experimental results clearly indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the basic classifiers, as well as an ensemble based on the voting scheme. We expect that this study will help in developing new ensemble-based techniques that will improve the performance of semantic segmentation systems, reaching beyond the problem of detecting human skin.

- **Summary**: To address the challenges of similarity between lesions and surrounding tissues, overlapping appearances of partially benign and malignant nodules, and difficulty in classification, a deep learning network that integrates CNN and Transformer is proposed for the classification of benign and malignant breast lesions in ultrasound images. This network adopts a dual-branch architecture for local-global feature extraction, making full use of the advantages of CNN in extracting local features and the ability of ViT to extract global features to enhance the network's feature extraction capabilities for breast nodules. The local feature extraction branch employs a residual network with multiple attention-guided modules, which can effectively capture the local details and texture features of breast nodules, enhance sensitivity to subtle changes within the nodules, and thus can aid in accurate classification of their benign and malignancy. The global feature extraction branch utilizes the multi-head self-attention ViT network, which can capture the overall shape, boundary, and relationship with surrounding tissues, and thereby enhancing the understanding and modeling of both nodule and global image features. Experimental results on a public ultrasound breast nodule data set show that the proposed method is better than other comparison networks, This indicates that the fusion of CNN and Transformer networks can effectively improve the performance of the classification model and provide a powerful solution for the benign-malignant classification of ultrasound breast.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing textureless areas in MVS poses challenges due to the absence of reliable pixel correspondences within fixed patch. Although certain methods employ patch deformation to expand the receptive field, their patches mistakenly skip depth edges to calculate areas with depth discontinuity, thereby causing ambiguity. Consequently, we introduce Multi-granularity Segmentation Prior Multi-View Stereo (MSP-MVS). Specifically, we first propose multi-granularity segmentation prior by integrating multi-granularity depth edges to restrict patch deformation within homogeneous areas. Moreover, we present anchor equidistribution that bring deformed patches with more uniformly distributed anchors to ensure an adequate coverage of their own homogeneous areas. Furthermore, we introduce iterative local search optimization to represent larger patch with sparse representative candidates, significantly boosting the expressive capacity for each patch. The state-of-the-art results on ETH3D and Tanks & Temples benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robust generalization ability of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: Segmenting polyps in colonoscopy images is essential for the early identification and diagnosis of colorectal cancer, a significant cause of worldwide cancer deaths. Prior deep learning based models such as Attention based variation, UNet variations and Transformer-derived networks have had notable success in capturing intricate features and complex polyp shapes. In this study, we have introduced the DeepLabv3++ model which is an enhanced version of the DeepLabv3+ architecture. It is designed to improve the precision and robustness of polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images. We have utilized The proposed model incorporates diverse separable convolutional layers and attention mechanisms within the MSPP block, enhancing its capacity to capture multi-scale and directional features. Additionally, the redesigned decoder further transforms the extracted features from the encoder into a more meaningful segmentation map. Our model was evaluated on three public datasets (CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG) achieving Dice coefficient scores of 96.20%, 96.54%, and 96.08%, respectively. The experimental analysis shows that DeepLabV3++ outperforms several state-of-the-art models in polyp segmentation tasks. Furthermore, compared to the baseline DeepLabV3+ model, our DeepLabV3++ with its MSPP module and redesigned decoder architecture, significantly reduced segmentation errors (e.g., false positives/negatives) across small, medium, and large polyps. This improvement in polyp delineation is crucial for accurate clinical decision-making in colonoscopy.
