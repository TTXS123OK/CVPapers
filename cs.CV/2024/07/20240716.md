- **Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative techniques for solving inverse problems. Despite their success in a variety of inverse problems in imaging, these models require many steps to converge, leading to slow inference time. Recently, there has been a trend in diffusion models for employing sophisticated noise schedules that involve more frequent iterations of timesteps at lower noise levels, thereby improving image generation and convergence speed. However, application of these ideas for solving inverse problems with diffusion models remain challenging, as these noise schedules do not perform well when using empirical tuning for the forward model log-likelihood term weights. To tackle these challenges, we propose zero-shot approximate posterior sampling (ZAPS) that leverages connections to zero-shot physics-driven deep learning. ZAPS fixes the number of sampling steps, and uses zero-shot training with a physics-guided loss function to learn log-likelihood weights at each irregular timestep. We apply ZAPS to the recently proposed diffusion posterior sampling method as baseline, though ZAPS can also be used with other posterior sampling diffusion models. We further approximate the Hessian of the logarithm of the prior using a diagonalization approach with learnable diagonal entries for computational efficiency. These parameters are optimized over a fixed number of epochs with a given computational budget. Our results for various noisy inverse problems, including Gaussian and motion deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution show that ZAPS reduces inference time, provides robustness to irregular noise schedules and improves reconstruction quality.

- **Summary**: The hippocampus is a crucial brain structure associated with various psychiatric disorders, and its automatic and precise segmentation is essential for studying these diseases. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have made significant progress in hippocampus segmentation. However, training deep neural network models requires substantial computational resources and time, as well as a large amount of labeled training data, which is often difficult to obtain in medical image segmentation. To address this issue, we propose a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning method called LoRA-PT. This method transfers the pre-trained UNETR model on the BraTS2021 dataset to the hippocampus segmentation task. Specifically, the LoRA-PT method categorizes the parameter matrix of the transformer structure into three sizes, forming three 3D tensors. Through tensor singular value decomposition, these tensors are decomposed to generate low-rank tensors with the principal singular values and singular vectors, while the remaining singular values and vectors form the residual tensor. Similar to the LoRA method, during parameter fine-tuning, we only update the low-rank tensors, i.e. the principal tensor singular values and vectors, while keeping the residual tensor unchanged. We validated the proposed method on three public hippocampus datasets. Experimental results show that LoRA-PT outperforms existing parameter-efficient transfer learning methods in segmentation accuracy while significantly reducing the number of parameter updates.

- **Summary**: The generation of large-scale urban layouts has garnered substantial interest across various disciplines. Prior methods have utilized procedural generation requiring manual rule coding or deep learning needing abundant data. However, prior approaches have not considered the context-sensitive nature of urban layout generation. Our approach addresses this gap by leveraging a canonical graph representation for the entire city, which facilitates scalability and captures the multi-layer semantics inherent in urban layouts. We introduce a novel graph-based masked autoencoder (GMAE) for city-scale urban layout generation. The method encodes attributed buildings, city blocks, communities and cities into a unified graph structure, enabling self-supervised masked training for graph autoencoder. Additionally, we employ scheduled iterative sampling for 2.5D layout generation, prioritizing the generation of important city blocks and buildings. Our approach achieves good realism, semantic consistency, and correctness across the heterogeneous urban styles in 330 US cities.

- **Summary**: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology enables the construction of environmental maps and localization, serving as a key technique for indoor autonomous navigation of mobile robots. Traditional SLAM methods typically require exhaustive traversal of all rooms during indoor navigation to obtain a complete map, resulting in lengthy path planning times and prolonged time to reach target points. Moreover, cumulative errors during motion lead to inaccurate robot localization, impacting navigation efficiency.This paper proposes an improved SLAM method, FR-SLAM, based on floor plan registration, utilizing a morphology-based floor plan registration algorithm to align and transform original floor plans. This approach facilitates the rapid acquisition of comprehensive motion maps and efficient path planning, enabling swift navigation to target positions within a shorter timeframe. To enhance registration and robot motion localization accuracy, a real-time update strategy is employed, comparing the current position's building structure with the map and dynamically updating floor plan registration results for precise localization. Comparative tests conducted on real and simulated datasets demonstrate that, compared to other benchmark algorithms, this method achieves higher floor plan registration accuracy and shorter time consumption to reach target positions.

- **Summary**: Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) is a complex and significant task that requires perceiving emotions from various contextual cues. Previous approaches primarily focus on designing sophisticated architectures to extract emotional cues from images. However, their knowledge is confined to specific training datasets and may reflect the subjective emotional biases of the annotators. Furthermore, acquiring large amounts of labeled data is often challenging in real-world applications. In this paper, we systematically explore the potential of leveraging Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to empower the CAER task from three paradigms: 1) We fine-tune LVLMs on two CAER datasets, which is the most common way to transfer large models to downstream tasks. 2) We design zero-shot and few-shot patterns to evaluate the performance of LVLMs in scenarios with limited data or even completely unseen. In this case, a training-free framework is proposed to fully exploit the In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities of LVLMs. Specifically, we develop an image similarity-based ranking algorithm to retrieve examples; subsequently, the instructions, retrieved examples, and the test example are combined to feed LVLMs to obtain the corresponding sentiment judgment. 3) To leverage the rich knowledge base of LVLMs, we incorporate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into our framework to enhance the model's reasoning ability and provide interpretable results. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that LVLMs achieve competitive performance in the CAER task across different paradigms. Notably, the superior performance in few-shot settings indicates the feasibility of LVLMs for accomplishing specific tasks without extensive training.

- **Summary**: We present Polynomial Attention Drop-in Replacement (PADRe), a novel and unifying framework designed to replace the conventional self-attention mechanism in transformer models. Notably, several recent alternative attention mechanisms, including Hyena, Mamba, SimA, Conv2Former, and Castling-ViT, can be viewed as specific instances of our PADRe framework. PADRe leverages polynomial functions and draws upon established results from approximation theory, enhancing computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. PADRe's key components include multiplicative nonlinearities, which we implement using straightforward, hardware-friendly operations such as Hadamard products, incurring only linear computational and memory costs. PADRe further avoids the need for using complex functions such as Softmax, yet it maintains comparable or superior accuracy compared to traditional self-attention. We assess the effectiveness of PADRe as a drop-in replacement for self-attention across diverse computer vision tasks. These tasks include image classification, image-based 2D object detection, and 3D point cloud object detection. Empirical results demonstrate that PADRe runs significantly faster than the conventional self-attention (11x ~ 43x faster on server GPU and mobile NPU) while maintaining similar accuracy when substituting self-attention in the transformer models.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from 2D images and generating diverse views over time presents a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and temporal dynamics involved. While recent advancements in neural implicit models and dynamic Gaussian Splatting have shown promise, limitations persist, particularly in accurately capturing the underlying geometry of highly dynamic scenes. Some approaches address this by incorporating strong semantic and geometric priors through diffusion models. However, we explore a different avenue by investigating the potential of regularizing the native warp field within the dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework. Our method is grounded on the key intuition that an accurate warp field should produce continuous space-time motions. While enforcing the motion constraints on warp fields is non-trivial, we show that we can exploit knowledge innate to the forward warp field network to derive an analytical velocity field, then time integrate for scene flows to effectively constrain both the 2D motion and 3D positions of the Gaussians. This derived Lucas-Kanade style analytical regularization enables our method to achieve superior performance in reconstructing highly dynamic scenes, even under minimal camera movement, extending the boundaries of what existing dynamic Gaussian Splatting frameworks can achieve.

- **Summary**: Development of artificial intelligence (AI) for medical imaging demands curation and cleaning of large-scale clinical datasets comprising hundreds of thousands of images. Some modalities, such as mammography, contain highly standardized imaging. In contrast, breast ultrasound imaging (BUS) can contain many irregularities not indicated by scan metadata, such as enhanced scan modes, sonographer annotations, or additional views. We present an open-source software solution for automatically processing clinical BUS datasets. The algorithm performs BUS scan filtering, cleaning, and knowledge extraction from sonographer annotations. Its modular design enables users to adapt it to new settings. Experiments on an internal testing dataset of 430 clinical BUS images achieve >95% sensitivity and >98% specificity in detecting every type of text annotation, >98% sensitivity and specificity in detecting scans with blood flow highlighting, alternative scan modes, or invalid scans. A case study on a completely external, public dataset of BUS scans found that BUSClean identified text annotations and scans with blood flow highlighting with 88.6% and 90.9% sensitivity and 98.3% and 99.9% specificity, respectively. Adaptation of the lesion caliper detection method to account for a type of caliper specific to the case study demonstrates intended use of BUSClean in new data distributions and improved performance in lesion caliper detection from 43.3% and 93.3% out-of-the-box to 92.1% and 92.3% sensitivity and specificity, respectively.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models have been extensively explored across a wide range of tasks, achieving satisfactory performance; however, their application in medical imaging remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a unified framework - LiteGPT - for the medical imaging. We leverage multiple pre-trained visual encoders to enrich information and enhance the performance of vision-language models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize vision-language models for the novel task of joint localization and classification in medical images. Besides, we are pioneers in providing baselines for disease localization in chest X-rays. Finally, we set new state-of-the-art performance in the image classification task on the well-benchmarked VinDr-CXR dataset.

- **Summary**: Transformers are widely used in computer vision areas and have achieved remarkable success. Most state-of-the-art approaches split images into regular grids and represent each grid region with a vision token. However, fixed token distribution disregards the semantic meaning of different image regions, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose the Token Clustering Transformer (TCFormer), which generates dynamic vision tokens based on semantic meaning. Our dynamic tokens possess two crucial characteristics: (1) Representing image regions with similar semantic meanings using the same vision token, even if those regions are not adjacent, and (2) concentrating on regions with valuable details and represent them using fine tokens. Through extensive experimentation across various applications, including image classification, human pose estimation, semantic segmentation, and object detection, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our TCFormer. The code and models for this work are available at https://github.com/zengwang430521/TCFormer.

- **Summary**: Existing Video Object Segmentation (VOS) relies on explicit user instructions, such as categories, masks, or short phrases, restricting their ability to perform complex video segmentation requiring reasoning with world knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Reasoning Video Object Segmentation (ReasonVOS). This task aims to generate a sequence of segmentation masks in response to implicit text queries that require complex reasoning abilities based on world knowledge and video contexts, which is crucial for structured environment understanding and object-centric interactions, pivotal in the development of embodied AI. To tackle ReasonVOS, we introduce VISA (Video-based large language Instructed Segmentation Assistant), to leverage the world knowledge reasoning capabilities of multi-modal LLMs while possessing the ability to segment and track objects in videos with a mask decoder. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 35,074 instruction-mask sequence pairs from 1,042 diverse videos, which incorporates complex world knowledge reasoning into segmentation tasks for instruction-tuning and evaluation purposes of ReasonVOS models. Experiments conducted on 8 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VISA in tackling complex reasoning segmentation and vanilla referring segmentation in both video and image domains.

- **Summary**: Existing methods enhance open-vocabulary object detection by leveraging the robust open-vocabulary recognition capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP.However, two main challenges emerge:(1) A deficiency in concept representation, where the category names in CLIP's text space lack textual and visual knowledge.(2) An overfitting tendency towards base categories, with the open vocabulary knowledge biased towards base categories during the transfer from VLMs to detectors.To address these challenges, we propose the Language Model Instruction (LaMI) strategy, which leverages the relationships between visual concepts and applies them within a simple yet effective DETR-like detector, termed LaMI-DETR.LaMI utilizes GPT to construct visual concepts and employs T5 to investigate visual similarities across categories.These inter-category relationships refine concept representation and avoid overfitting to base categories.Comprehensive experiments validate our approach's superior performance over existing methods in the same rigorous setting without reliance on external training resources.LaMI-DETR achieves a rare box AP of 43.4 on OV-LVIS, surpassing the previous best by 7.8 rare box AP.

- **Summary**: Lane topology, which is usually modeled by a centerline graph, is essential for high-level autonomous driving. For a high-quality graph, both topology connectivity and spatial continuity of centerline segments are critical. However, most of existing approaches pay more attention to connectivity while neglect the continuity. Such kind of centerline graph usually cause problem to planning of autonomous driving. To overcome this problem, we present an end-to-end network, CGNet, with three key modules: 1)Junction Aware Query Enhancement module, which provides positional prior to accurately predict junction points; 2)B\'ezier Space Connection module, which enforces continuity constraints on any two topologically connected segments in a B\'ezier space; 3) Iterative Topology Refinement module, which is a graph-based network with memory to iteratively refine the predicted topological connectivity. CGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on both nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets.

- **Summary**: Computational neuromorphic imaging (CNI) with event cameras offers advantages such as minimal motion blur and enhanced dynamic range, compared to conventional frame-based methods. Existing event-based radiance field rendering methods are built on neural radiance field, which is computationally heavy and slow in reconstruction speed. Motivated by the two aspects, we introduce Ev-GS, the first CNI-informed scheme to infer 3D Gaussian splatting from a monocular event camera, enabling efficient novel view synthesis. Leveraging 3D Gaussians with pure event-based supervision, Ev-GS overcomes challenges such as the detection of fast-moving objects and insufficient lighting. Experimental results show that Ev-GS outperforms the method that takes frame-based signals as input by rendering realistic views with reduced blurring and improved visual quality. Moreover, it demonstrates competitive reconstruction quality and reduced computing occupancy compared to existing methods, which paves the way to a highly efficient CNI approach for signal processing.

- **Summary**: Fusing an arbitrary number of modalities is vital for achieving robust multi-modal fusion of semantic segmentation yet remains less explored to date. Recent endeavors regard RGB modality as the center and the others as the auxiliary, yielding an asymmetric architecture with two branches. However, the RGB modality may struggle in certain circumstances, e.g., nighttime, while others, e.g., event data, own their merits; thus, it is imperative for the fusion model to discern robust and fragile modalities, and incorporate the most robust and fragile ones to learn a resilient multi-modal framework. To this end, we propose a novel method, named MAGIC, that can be flexibly paired with various backbones, ranging from compact to high-performance models. Our method comprises two key plug-and-play modules. Firstly, we introduce a multi-modal aggregation module to efficiently process features from multi-modal batches and extract complementary scene information. On top, a unified arbitrary-modal selection module is proposed to utilize the aggregated features as the benchmark to rank the multi-modal features based on the similarity scores. This way, our method can eliminate the dependence on RGB modality and better overcome sensor failures while ensuring the segmentation performance. Under the commonly considered multi-modal setting, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing the model parameters by 60%. Moreover, our method is superior in the novel modality-agnostic setting, where it outperforms prior arts by a large margin of +19.41% mIoU

- **Summary**: We present an inverse image-formation module that can enhance the robustness of existing visual SLAM pipelines for casually captured scenarios. Casual video captures often suffer from motion blur and varying appearances, which degrade the final quality of coherent 3D visual representation. We propose integrating the physical imaging into the SLAM system, which employs linear HDR radiance maps to collect measurements. Specifically, individual frames aggregate images of multiple poses along the camera trajectory to explain prevalent motion blur in hand-held videos. Additionally, we accommodate per-frame appearance variation by dedicating explicit variables for image formation steps, namely white balance, exposure time, and camera response function. Through joint optimization of additional variables, the SLAM pipeline produces high-quality images with more accurate trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can be incorporated into recent visual SLAM pipelines using various scene representations, such as neural radiance fields or Gaussian splatting.

- **Summary**: The flatfish is a major farmed species consumed globally in large quantities. However, due to the densely populated farming environment, flatfish are susceptible to injuries and diseases, making early disease detection crucial. Traditionally, diseases were detected through visual inspection, but observing large numbers of fish is challenging. Automated approaches based on deep learning technologies have been widely used, to address this problem, but accurate detection remains difficult due to the diversity of the fish and the lack of the fish disease dataset. In this study, augments fish disease images using generative adversarial networks and image harmonization methods. Next, disease detectors are trained separately for three body parts (head, fins, and body) to address individual diseases properly. In addition, a flatfish disease image dataset called \texttt{FlatIMG} is created and verified on the dataset using the proposed methods. A flash salmon disease dataset is also tested to validate the generalizability of the proposed methods. The results achieved 12\% higher performance than the baseline framework. This study is the first attempt to create a large-scale flatfish disease image dataset and propose an effective disease detection framework. Automatic disease monitoring could be achieved in farming environments based on the proposed methods and dataset.

- **Summary**: Image modality is not perfect as it often fails in certain conditions, e.g., night and fast motion. This significantly limits the robustness and versatility of existing multi-modal (i.e., Image+X) semantic segmentation methods when confronting modality absence or failure, as often occurred in real-world applications. Inspired by the open-world learning capability of multi-modal vision-language models (MVLMs), we explore a new direction in learning the modality-agnostic representation via knowledge distillation (KD) from MVLMs. Intuitively, we propose Any2Seg, a novel framework that can achieve robust segmentation from any combination of modalities in any visual conditions. Specifically, we first introduce a novel language-guided semantic correlation distillation (LSCD) module to transfer both inter-modal and intra-modal semantic knowledge in the embedding space from MVLMs, e.g., LanguageBind. This enables us to minimize the modality gap and alleviate semantic ambiguity to combine any modalities in any visual conditions. Then, we introduce a modality-agnostic feature fusion (MFF) module that reweights the multi-modal features based on the inter-modal correlation and selects the fine-grained feature. This way, our Any2Seg finally yields an optimal modality-agnostic representation. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks with four modalities demonstrate that Any2Seg achieves the state-of-the-art under the multi-modal setting (+3.54 mIoU) and excels in the challenging modality-incomplete setting(+19.79 mIoU).

- **Summary**: Despite the recent success of domain generalization in medical image segmentation, voxel-wise annotation for all source domains remains a huge burden. Semi-supervised domain generalization has been proposed very recently to combat this challenge by leveraging limited labeled data along with abundant unlabeled data collected from multiple medical institutions, depending on precisely harnessing unlabeled data while improving generalization simultaneously. In this work, we observe that domain shifts between medical institutions cause disparate feature statistics, which significantly deteriorates pseudo-label quality due to an unexpected normalization process. Nevertheless, this phenomenon could be exploited to facilitate unseen domain generalization. Therefore, we propose 1) multiple statistics-individual branches to mitigate the impact of domain shifts for reliable pseudo-labels and 2) one statistics-aggregated branch for domain-invariant feature learning. Furthermore, to simulate unseen domains with statistics difference, we approach this from two aspects, i.e., a perturbation with histogram matching at image level and a random batch normalization selection strategy at feature level, producing diverse statistics to expand the training distribution. Evaluation results on three medical image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with recent SOTA methods. The code is available at https://github.com/qiumuyang/SIAB.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated effectiveness in various fields. However, DNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which inject a unique pattern, called trigger, into the input to cause misclassification to an attack-chosen target label. While existing works have proposed various methods to mitigate backdoor effects in poisoned models, they tend to be less effective against recent advanced attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel post-training defense technique UNIT that can effectively eliminate backdoor effects for a variety of attacks. In specific, UNIT approximates a unique and tight activation distribution for each neuron in the model. It then proactively dispels substantially large activation values that exceed the approximated boundaries. Our experimental results demonstrate that UNIT outperforms 7 popular defense methods against 14 existing backdoor attacks, including 2 advanced attacks, using only 5\% of clean training data. UNIT is also cost efficient. The code is accessible at https://github.com/Megum1/UNIT.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in deep neural networks have shown promise in aiding disease diagnosis and medical decision-making. However, ensuring transparent decision-making processes of AI models in compliance with regulations requires a comprehensive understanding of the model's internal workings. However, previous methods heavily rely on expensive pixel-wise annotated datasets for interpreting the model, presenting a significant drawback in medical domains. In this paper, we propose a novel medical neuron concept annotation method, named Mask-free Medical Model Interpretation (MAMMI), addresses these challenges. By using a vision-language model, our method relaxes the need for pixel-level masks for neuron concept annotation. MAMMI achieves superior performance compared to other interpretation methods, demonstrating its efficacy in providing rich representations for neurons in medical image analysis. Our experiments on a model trained on NIH chest X-rays validate the effectiveness of MAMMI, showcasing its potential for transparent clinical decision-making in the medical domain.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we use spectral analysis to investigate transfer learning and study model sensitivity to frequency shortcuts in medical imaging. By analyzing the power spectrum density of both pre-trained and fine-tuned model gradients, as well as artificially generated frequency shortcuts, we observe notable differences in learning priorities between models pre-trained on natural vs medical images, which generally persist during fine-tuning. We find that when a model's learning priority aligns with the power spectrum density of an artifact, it results in overfitting to that artifact. Based on these observations, we show that source data editing can alter the model's resistance to shortcut learning.

- **Summary**: Recently, Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) has gained considerable attention in pattern recognition for its diverse applications in document understanding. Current methods typically approach HMER as an image-to-sequence generation task within an autoregressive (AR) encoder-decoder framework. However, these approaches suffer from several drawbacks: 1) a lack of overall language context, limiting information utilization beyond the current decoding step; 2) error accumulation during AR decoding; and 3) slow decoding speed. To tackle these problems, this paper makes the first attempt to build a novel bottom-up Non-AutoRegressive Modeling approach for HMER, called NAMER. NAMER comprises a Visual Aware Tokenizer (VAT) and a Parallel Graph Decoder (PGD). Initially, the VAT tokenizes visible symbols and local relations at a coarse level. Subsequently, the PGD refines all tokens and establishes connectivities in parallel, leveraging comprehensive visual and linguistic contexts. Experiments on CROHME 2014/2016/2019 and HME100K datasets demonstrate that NAMER not only outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on ExpRate by 1.93%/2.35%/1.49%/0.62%, but also achieves significant speedups of 13.7x and 6.7x faster in decoding time and overall FPS, proving the effectiveness and efficiency of NAMER.

- **Summary**: Updated building footprints with refugee camps from high-resolution satellite imagery can support related humanitarian operations. This study explores the utilization of the "Segment Anything Model" (SAM) and one of its branches, SAM-Adapter, for semantic segmentation tasks in the building extraction from satellite imagery. SAM-Adapter is a lightweight adaptation of the SAM and emerges as a powerful tool for this extraction task across diverse refugee camps. Our research proves that SAM-Adapter excels in scenarios where data availability is limited compared to other classic (e.g., U-Net) or advanced semantic segmentation models (e.g., Transformer). Furthermore, the impact of upscaling techniques on model performance is highlighted, with methods like super-resolution (SR) models proving invaluable for improving model performance. Additionally, the study unveils intriguing phenomena, including the model's rapid convergence in the first training epoch when using upscaled image data for training, suggesting opportunities for future research. The codes covering each step from data preparation, model training, model inferencing, and the generation of Shapefiles for predicted masks are available on a GitHub repository to benefit the extended scientific community and humanitarian operations.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes an algorithm for automatically labeling 3D objects from 2D point or box prompts, especially focusing on applications in autonomous driving. Unlike previous arts, our auto-labeler predicts 3D shapes instead of bounding boxes and does not require training on a specific dataset. We propose a Segment, Lift, and Fit (SLF) paradigm to achieve this goal. Firstly, we segment high-quality instance masks from the prompts using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and transform the remaining problem into predicting 3D shapes from given 2D masks. Due to the ill-posed nature of this problem, it presents a significant challenge as multiple 3D shapes can project into an identical mask. To tackle this issue, we then lift 2D masks to 3D forms and employ gradient descent to adjust their poses and shapes until the projections fit the masks and the surfaces conform to surrounding LiDAR points. Notably, since we do not train on a specific dataset, the SLF auto-labeler does not overfit to biased annotation patterns in the training set as other methods do. Thus, the generalization ability across different datasets improves. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that the SLF auto-labeler produces high-quality bounding box annotations, achieving an AP@0.5 IoU of nearly 90\%. Detectors trained with the generated pseudo-labels perform nearly as well as those trained with actual ground-truth annotations. Furthermore, the SLF auto-labeler shows promising results in detailed shape predictions, providing a potential alternative for the occupancy annotation of dynamic objects.

- **Summary**: In healthcare and medical diagnostics, Visual Question Answering (VQA) mayemergeasapivotal tool in scenarios where analysis of intricate medical images becomes critical for accurate diagnoses. Current text-based VQA systems limit their utility in scenarios where hands-free interaction and accessibility are crucial while performing tasks. A speech-based VQA system may provide a better means of interaction where information can be accessed while performing tasks simultaneously. To this end, this work implements a speech-based VQA system by introducing a Textless Multilingual Pathological VQA (TMPathVQA) dataset, an expansion of the PathVQA dataset, containing spoken questions in English, German & French. This dataset comprises 98,397 multilingual spoken questions and answers based on 5,004 pathological images along with 70 hours of audio. Finally, this work benchmarks and compares TMPathVQA systems implemented using various combinations of acoustic and visual features.

- **Summary**: Controllable Image Captioning (CIC) aims at generating natural language descriptions for an image, conditioned on information provided by end users, e.g., regions, entities or events of interest. However, available image-language datasets mainly contain captions that describe the entirety of an image, making them ineffective for training CIC models that can potentially attend to any subset of regions or relationships. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel, fully automatic method to sample additional focused and visually grounded captions using a unified structured semantic representation built on top of the existing set of captions associated with an image. We leverage Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), a cross-lingual graph-based semantic formalism, to encode all possible spatio-semantic relations between entities, beyond the typical spatial-relations-only focus of current methods. We use this Structured Semantic Augmentation (SSA) framework to augment existing image-caption datasets with the grounded controlled captions, increasing their spatial and semantic diversity and focal coverage. We then develop a new model, CIC-BART-SSA, specifically tailored for the CIC task, that sources its control signals from SSA-diversified datasets. We empirically show that, compared to SOTA CIC models, CIC-BART-SSA generates captions that are superior in diversity and text quality, are competitive in controllability, and, importantly, minimize the gap between broad and highly focused controlled captioning performance by efficiently generalizing to the challenging highly focused scenarios.

- **Summary**: Score distillation sampling (SDS) has emerged as an effective framework in text-driven 3D editing tasks due to its inherent 3D consistency. However, existing SDS-based 3D editing methods suffer from extensive training time and lead to low-quality results, primarily because these methods deviate from the sampling dynamics of diffusion models. In this paper, we propose DreamCatalyst, a novel framework that interprets SDS-based editing as a diffusion reverse process. Our objective function considers the sampling dynamics, thereby making the optimization process of DreamCatalyst an approximation of the diffusion reverse process in editing tasks. DreamCatalyst aims to reduce training time and improve editing quality. DreamCatalyst presents two modes: (1) a faster mode, which edits the NeRF scene in only about 25 minutes, and (2) a high-quality mode, which produces superior results in less than 70 minutes. Specifically, our high-quality mode outperforms current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods both in terms of speed and quality.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in 4D generation mainly focus on generating 4D content by distilling pre-trained text or single-view image-conditioned models. It is inconvenient for them to take advantage of various off-the-shelf 3D assets with multi-view attributes, and their results suffer from spatiotemporal inconsistency owing to the inherent ambiguity in the supervision signals. In this work, we present Animate3D, a novel framework for animating any static 3D model. The core idea is two-fold: 1) We propose a novel multi-view video diffusion model (MV-VDM) conditioned on multi-view renderings of the static 3D object, which is trained on our presented large-scale multi-view video dataset (MV-Video). 2) Based on MV-VDM, we introduce a framework combining reconstruction and 4D Score Distillation Sampling (4D-SDS) to leverage the multi-view video diffusion priors for animating 3D objects. Specifically, for MV-VDM, we design a new spatiotemporal attention module to enhance spatial and temporal consistency by integrating 3D and video diffusion models. Additionally, we leverage the static 3D model's multi-view renderings as conditions to preserve its identity. For animating 3D models, an effective two-stage pipeline is proposed: we first reconstruct motions directly from generated multi-view videos, followed by the introduced 4D-SDS to refine both appearance and motion. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that Animate3D significantly outperforms previous approaches. Data, code, and models will be open-released.

- **Summary**: Determining the necessity of resecting malignant polyps during colonoscopy screen is crucial for patient outcomes, yet challenging due to the time-consuming and costly nature of histopathology examination. While deep learning-based classification models have shown promise in achieving optical biopsy with endoscopic images, they often suffer from a lack of explainability. To overcome this limitation, we introduce EndoFinder, a content-based image retrieval framework to find the 'digital twin' polyp in the reference database given a newly detected polyp. The clinical semantics of the new polyp can be inferred referring to the matched ones. EndoFinder pioneers a polyp-aware image encoder that is pre-trained on a large polyp dataset in a self-supervised way, merging masked image modeling with contrastive learning. This results in a generic embedding space ready for different downstream clinical tasks based on image retrieval. We validate the framework on polyp re-identification and optical biopsy tasks, with extensive experiments demonstrating that EndoFinder not only achieves explainable diagnostics but also matches the performance of supervised classification models. EndoFinder's reliance on image retrieval has the potential to support diverse downstream decision-making tasks during real-time colonoscopy procedures.

- **Summary**: We study the challenging problem of simultaneously localizing a sequence of queries in the form of instructional diagrams in a video. This requires understanding not only the individual queries but also their interrelationships. However, most existing methods focus on grounding one query at a time, ignoring the inherent structures among queries such as the general mutual exclusiveness and the temporal order. Consequently, the predicted timespans of different step diagrams may overlap considerably or violate the temporal order, thus harming the accuracy. In this paper, we tackle this issue by simultaneously grounding a sequence of step diagrams. Specifically, we propose composite queries, constructed by exhaustively pairing up the visual content features of the step diagrams and a fixed number of learnable positional embeddings. Our insight is that self-attention among composite queries carrying different content features suppress each other to reduce timespan overlaps in predictions, while the cross-attention corrects the temporal misalignment via content and position joint guidance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the IAW dataset for grounding step diagrams and the YouCook2 benchmark for grounding natural language queries, significantly outperforming existing methods while simultaneously grounding multiple queries.

- **Summary**: Image steganography is the process of hiding secret data in a cover image by subtle perturbation. Recent studies show that it is feasible to use a fixed neural network for data embedding and extraction. Such Fixed Neural Network Steganography (FNNS) demonstrates favorable performance without the need for training networks, making it more practical for real-world applications. However, the stego-images generated by the existing FNNS methods exhibit high distortion, which is prone to be detected by steganalysis tools. To deal with this issue, we propose a Cover-separable Fixed Neural Network Steganography, namely Cs-FNNS. In Cs-FNNS, we propose a Steganographic Perturbation Search (SPS) algorithm to directly encode the secret data into an imperceptible perturbation, which is combined with an AI-generated cover image for transmission. Through accessing the same deep generative models, the receiver could reproduce the cover image using a pre-agreed key, to separate the perturbation in the stego-image for data decoding. such an encoding/decoding strategy focuses on the secret data and eliminates the disturbance of the cover images, hence achieving a better performance. We apply our Cs-FNNS to the steganographic field that hiding secret images within cover images. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of visual quality and undetectability. Moreover, we show the flexibility of our Cs-FNNS in terms of hiding multiple secret images for different receivers.

- **Summary**: Prompt tuning methods have achieved remarkable success in parameter-efficient fine-tuning on large pre-trained models. However, their application to dual-modal fusion-based visual-language pre-trained models (VLPMs), such as GLIP, has encountered issues. Existing prompt tuning methods have not effectively addressed the modal mapping and aligning problem for tokens in different modalities, leading to poor transfer generalization. To address this issue, we propose Synchronous Dual Prompt Tuning (SDPT). SDPT initializes a single set of learnable unified prototype tokens in the established modal aligning space to represent the aligned semantics of text and image modalities for downstream tasks. Furthermore, SDPT establishes inverse linear projections that require no training to embed the information of unified prototype tokens into the input space of different modalities. The inverse linear projections allow the unified prototype token to synchronously represent the two modalities and enable SDPT to share the unified semantics of text and image for downstream tasks across different modal prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that SDPT assists fusion-based VLPMs to achieve superior outcomes with only 0.04\% of model parameters for training across various scenarios, outperforming other single- or dual-modal methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/wuyongjianCODE/SDPT.

- **Summary**: Orthodontic treatment usually requires regular face-to-face examinations to monitor dental conditions of the patients. When in-person diagnosis is not feasible, an alternative is to utilize five intra-oral photographs for remote dental monitoring. However, it lacks of 3D information, and how to reconstruct 3D dental models from such sparse view photographs is a challenging problem. In this study, we propose a 3D teeth reconstruction framework, named TeethDreamer, aiming to restore the shape and position of the upper and lower teeth. Given five intra-oral photographs, our approach first leverages a large diffusion model's prior knowledge to generate novel multi-view images with known poses to address sparse inputs and then reconstructs high-quality 3D teeth models by neural surface reconstruction. To ensure the 3D consistency across generated views, we integrate a 3D-aware feature attention mechanism in the reverse diffusion process. Moreover, a geometry-aware normal loss is incorporated into the teeth reconstruction process to enhance geometry accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over current state-of-the-arts, giving the potential to monitor orthodontic treatment remotely.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown promising performance on a variety of vision-language tasks. However, they remain susceptible to hallucinations, generating outputs misaligned with visual content or instructions. While various mitigation strategies have been proposed, they often neglect a key contributor to hallucinations: lack of fine-grained reasoning supervision during training. Without intermediate reasoning steps, models may establish superficial shortcuts between instructions and responses, failing to internalize the inherent reasoning logic. To address this challenge, we propose reflective instruction tuning, which integrates rationale learning into visual instruction tuning. Unlike previous methods that learning from responses only, our approach entails the model predicting rationales justifying why responses are correct or incorrect. This fosters a deeper engagement with the fine-grained reasoning underlying each response, thus enhancing the model's reasoning proficiency. To facilitate this approach, we propose REVERIE, the first large-scale instruction-tuning dataset with ReflEctiVE RatIonalE annotations. REVERIE comprises 115k machine-generated reasoning instructions, each meticulously annotated with a corresponding pair of correct and confusing responses, alongside comprehensive rationales elucidating the justification behind the correctness or erroneousness of each response. Experimental results on multiple LVLM benchmarks reveal that reflective instruction tuning with the REVERIE dataset yields noticeable performance gain over the baseline model, demonstrating the effectiveness of reflecting from the rationales.

- **Summary**: Model inversion attacks (MIAs) aim to reconstruct private images from a target classifier's training set, thereby raising privacy concerns in AI applications. Previous GAN-based MIAs tend to suffer from inferior generative fidelity due to GAN's inherent flaws and biased optimization within latent space. To alleviate these issues, leveraging on diffusion models' remarkable synthesis capabilities, we propose Diffusion-based Model Inversion (Diff-MI) attacks. Specifically, we introduce a novel target-specific conditional diffusion model (CDM) to purposely approximate target classifier's private distribution and achieve superior accuracy-fidelity balance. Our method involves a two-step learning paradigm. Step-1 incorporates the target classifier into the entire CDM learning under a pretrain-then-finetune fashion, with creating pseudo-labels as model conditions in pretraining and adjusting specified layers with image predictions in fine-tuning. Step-2 presents an iterative image reconstruction method, further enhancing the attack performance through a combination of diffusion priors and target knowledge. Additionally, we propose an improved max-margin loss that replaces the hard max with top-k maxes, fully leveraging feature information and soft labels from the target classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Diff-MI significantly improves generative fidelity with an average decrease of 20% in FID while maintaining competitive attack accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods across various datasets and models. We will release our code and models.

- **Summary**: This paper is the first to propose an end-to-end framework of mutually reinforcing images to 3D surface recurrent neural network-like for model-adaptation indoor 3D reconstruction,where multi-view dense matching and point cloud surface optimization are mutually reinforced by a RNN-like structure rather than being treated as a separate issue.The characteristics are as follows:In the multi-view dense matching module, the model-adaptation strategy is used to fine-tune and optimize a Transformer-based multi-view dense matching DNN,so that it has the higher image feature for matching and detail expression capabilities;In the point cloud surface optimization module,the 3D surface reconstruction network based on 3D implicit field is optimized by using model-adaptation strategy,which solves the problem of point cloud surface optimization without knowing normal vector of 3D surface.To improve and finely reconstruct 3D surfaces from point cloud,smooth loss is proposed and added to this module;The MRIo3DS-Net is a RNN-like framework,which utilizes the finely optimized 3D surface obtained by PCSOM to recursively reinforce the differentiable warping for optimizing MVDMM.This refinement leads to achieving better dense matching results, and better dense matching results leads to achieving better 3D surface results recursively and mutually.Hence, model-adaptation strategy can better collaborate the differences between the two network modules,so that they complement each other to achieve the better effect;To accelerate the transfer learning and training convergence from source domain to target domain,a multi-task loss function based on Bayesian uncertainty is used to adaptively adjust the weights between the two networks loss functions of MVDMM and PCSOM;In this multi-task cascade network framework,any modules can be replaced by any state-of-the-art networks to achieve better 3D reconstruction results.

- **Summary**: Recognition and generation are two fundamental tasks in computer vision, which are often investigated separately in the exiting literature. However, these two tasks are highly correlated in essence as they both require understanding the underline semantics of visual concepts. In this paper, we propose a new learning framework, coined as CycleHOI, to boost the performance of human-object interaction (HOI) detection by bridging the DETR-based detection pipeline and the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Our key design is to introduce a novel cycle consistency loss for the training of HOI detector, which is able to explicitly leverage the knowledge captured in the powerful diffusion model to guide the HOI detector training. Specifically, we build an extra generation task on top of the decoded instance representations from HOI detector to enforce a detection-generation cycle consistency. Moreover, we perform feature distillation from diffusion model to detector encoder to enhance its representation power. In addition, we further utilize the generation power of diffusion model to augment the training set in both aspects of label correction and sample generation. We perform extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness and generalization power of our CycleHOI with three HOI detection frameworks on two public datasets: HICO-DET and V-COCO. The experimental results demonstrate our CycleHOI can significantly improve the performance of the state-of-the-art HOI detectors.

- **Summary**: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has been extensively applied to whole slide histopathology image (WSI) analysis. The existing aggregation strategy in MIL, which primarily relies on the first-order distance (e.g., mean difference) between instances, fails to accurately approximate the true feature distribution of each instance, leading to biased slide-level representations. Moreover, the scarcity of WSI observations easily leads to model overfitting, resulting in unstable testing performance and limited generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new Bayesian nonparametric framework for multiple instance learning, which adopts a cascade of Dirichlet processes (cDP) to incorporate the instance-to-bag characteristic of the WSIs. We perform feature aggregation based on the latent clusters formed by the Dirichlet process, which incorporates the covariances of the patch features and forms more representative clusters. We then perform bag-level prediction with another Dirichlet process model on the bags, which imposes a natural regularization on learning to prevent overfitting and enhance generalizability. Moreover, as a Bayesian nonparametric method, the cDP model can accurately generate posterior uncertainty, which allows for the detection of outlier samples and tumor localization. Extensive experiments on five WSI benchmarks validate the superior performance of our method, as well as its generalizability and ability to estimate uncertainties.

- **Summary**: Contextualized Image Captioning (CIC) evolves traditional image captioning into a more complex domain, necessitating the ability for multimodal reasoning. It aims to generate image captions given specific contextual information. This paper further introduces a novel domain of Controllable Contextualized Image Captioning (Ctrl-CIC). Unlike CIC, which solely relies on broad context, Ctrl-CIC accentuates a user-defined highlight, compelling the model to tailor captions that resonate with the highlighted aspects of the context. We present two approaches, Prompting-based Controller (P-Ctrl) and Recalibration-based Controller (R-Ctrl), to generate focused captions. P-Ctrl conditions the model generation on highlight by prepending captions with highlight-driven prefixes, whereas R-Ctrl tunes the model to selectively recalibrate the encoder embeddings for highlighted tokens. Additionally, we design a GPT-4V empowered evaluator to assess the quality of the controlled captions alongside standard assessment methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficient and effective controllability of our method, charting a new direction in achieving user-adaptive image captioning.

- **Summary**: The latent space of diffusion model mostly still remains unexplored, despite its great success and potential in the field of generative modeling. In fact, the latent space of existing diffusion models are entangled, with a distorted mapping from its latent space to image space. To tackle this problem, we present Isometric Diffusion, equipping a diffusion model with a geometric regularizer to guide the model to learn a geometrically sound latent space of the training data manifold. This approach allows diffusion models to learn a more disentangled latent space, which enables smoother interpolation, more accurate inversion, and more precise control over attributes directly in the latent space. Our extensive experiments consisting of image interpolations, image inversions, and linear editing show the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: In computer vision, object detection is an important task that finds its application in many scenarios. However, obtaining extensive labels can be challenging, especially in crowded scenes. Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has been proposed as a powerful zero-shot segmenter, offering a novel approach to instance segmentation tasks. However, the accuracy and efficiency of SAM and its variants are often compromised when handling objects in crowded and occluded scenes. In this paper, we introduce Crowd-SAM, a SAM-based framework designed to enhance SAM's performance in crowded and occluded scenes with the cost of few learnable parameters and minimal labeled images. We introduce an efficient prompt sampler (EPS) and a part-whole discrimination network (PWD-Net), enhancing mask selection and accuracy in crowded scenes. Despite its simplicity, Crowd-SAM rivals state-of-the-art (SOTA) fully-supervised object detection methods on several benchmarks including CrowdHuman and CityPersons.

- **Summary**: Video tasks are compute-heavy and thus pose a challenge when deploying in real-time applications, particularly for tasks that require state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs). Several research efforts have tried to address this challenge by leveraging the fact that large portions of the video undergo very little change across frames, leading to redundant computations in frame-based video processing. In particular, some works leverage pixel or semantic differences across frames, however, this yields limited latency benefits with significantly increased memory overhead. This paper, in contrast, presents a strategy for masking regions in video frames that leverages the semantic information in images and the temporal correlation between frames to significantly reduce FLOPs and latency with little to no penalty in performance over baseline models. In particular, we demonstrate that by leveraging extracted features from previous frames, ViT backbones directly benefit from region masking, skipping up to 80% of input regions, improving FLOPs and latency by 3.14x and 1.5x. We improve memory and latency over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 2.3x and 1.14x, while maintaining similar detection performance. Additionally, our approach demonstrates promising results on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and provides latency improvements over the SOTA up to 1.3x using specialized computational kernels.

- **Summary**: Current Facial Action Unit (FAU) detection methods generally encounter difficulties due to the scarcity of labeled video training data and the limited number of training face IDs, which renders the trained feature extractor insufficient coverage for modeling the large diversity of inter-person facial structures and movements. To explicitly address the above challenges, we propose a novel video-level pre-training scheme by fully exploring the multi-label property of FAUs in the video as well as the temporal label consistency. At the heart of our design is a pre-trained video feature extractor based on the video-masked autoencoder together with a fine-tuning network that jointly completes the multi-level video FAUs analysis tasks, \emph{i.e.} integrating both video-level and frame-level FAU detections, thus dramatically expanding the supervision set from sparse FAUs annotations to ALL video frames including masked ones. Moreover, we utilize inter-frame and intra-frame AU pair state matrices as prior knowledge to guide network training instead of traditional Graph Neural Networks, for better temporal supervision. Our approach demonstrates substantial enhancement in performance compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods used in BP4D and DISFA FAUs datasets.

- **Summary**: Current cervical cytopathology whole slide image (WSI) screening primarily relies on detection-based approaches, which are limited in performance due to the expense and time-consuming annotation process. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a weakly supervised approach that relies solely on bag-level labels, can effectively alleviate these challenges. Nonetheless, MIL commonly employs frozen pretrained models or self-supervised learning for feature extraction, which suffers from low efficacy or inefficiency. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for cervical cytopathology WSI classification using only WSI-level labels through unsupervised and weakly supervised learning. Given the sparse and dispersed nature of abnormal cells within cytopathological WSIs, we propose a strategy that leverages the pretrained foundation model to filter the top$k$ high-risk patches. Subsequently, we suggest parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of a large foundation model using contrastive learning on the filtered patches to enhance its representation ability for task-specific signals. By training only the added linear adapters, we enhance the learning of patch-level features with substantially reduced time and memory consumption. Experiments conducted on the CSD and FNAC 2019 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the performance of various MIL methods and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

- **Summary**: Vision and language navigation is a task that requires an agent to navigate according to a natural language instruction. Recent methods predict sub-goals on constructed topology map at each step to enable long-term action planning. However, they suffer from high computational cost when attempting to support such high-level predictions with GCN-like models. In this work, we propose an alternative method that facilitates navigation planning by considering the alignment between instructions and directed fidelity trajectories, which refers to a path from the initial node to the candidate locations on a directed graph without detours. This planning strategy leads to an efficient model while achieving strong performance. Specifically, we introduce a directed graph to illustrate the explored area of the environment, emphasizing directionality. Then, we firstly define the trajectory representation as a sequence of directed edge features, which are extracted from the panorama based on the corresponding orientation. Ultimately, we assess and compare the alignment between instruction and different trajectories during navigation to determine the next navigation target. Our method outperforms previous SOTA method BEVBert on RxR dataset and is comparable on R2R dataset while largely reducing the computational cost.

- **Summary**: In the realm of stochastic human motion prediction (SHMP), researchers have often turned to generative models like GANS, VAEs and diffusion models. However, most previous approaches have struggled to accurately predict motions that are both realistic and coherent with past motion due to a lack of guidance on the latent distribution. In this paper, we introduce Semantic Latent Directions (SLD) as a solution to this challenge, aiming to constrain the latent space to learn meaningful motion semantics and enhance the accuracy of SHMP. SLD defines a series of orthogonal latent directions and represents the hypothesis of future motion as a linear combination of these directions. By creating such an information bottleneck, SLD excels in capturing meaningful motion semantics, thereby improving the precision of motion predictions. Moreover, SLD offers controllable prediction capabilities by adjusting the coefficients of the latent directions during the inference phase. Expanding on SLD, we introduce a set of motion queries to enhance the diversity of predictions. By aligning these motion queries with the SLD space, SLD is further promoted to more accurate and coherent motion predictions. Through extensive experiments conducted on widely used benchmarks, we showcase the superiority of our method in accurately predicting motions while maintaining a balance of realism and diversity. Our code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/GuoweiXu368/SLD-HMP.

- **Summary**: With the rapid growth of User-Generated Content (UGC) exchanged between users and sharing platforms, the need for video quality assessment in the wild has emerged. UGC is mostly acquired using consumer devices and undergoes multiple rounds of compression or transcoding before reaching the end user. Therefore, traditional quality metrics that require the original content as a reference cannot be used. In this paper, we propose ReLaX-VQA, a novel No-Reference Video Quality Assessment (NR-VQA) model that aims to address the challenges of evaluating the diversity of video content and the assessment of its quality without reference videos. ReLaX-VQA uses fragments of residual frames and optical flow, along with different expressions of spatial features of the sampled frames, to enhance motion and spatial perception. Furthermore, the model enhances abstraction by employing layer-stacking techniques in deep neural network features (from Residual Networks and Vision Transformers). Extensive testing on four UGC datasets confirms that ReLaX-VQA outperforms existing NR-VQA methods with an average SRCC value of 0.8658 and PLCC value of 0.8872. We will open source the code and trained models to facilitate further research and applications of NR-VQA: https://github.com/xinyiW915/ReLaX-VQA.

- **Summary**: In incremental object detection, knowledge distillation has been proven to be an effective way to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. However, previous works focused on preserving the knowledge of old models, ignoring that images could simultaneously contain categories from past, present, and future stages. The co-occurrence of objects makes the optimization objectives inconsistent across different stages since the definition for foreground objects differs across various stages, which limits the model's performance greatly. To overcome this problem, we propose a method called ``Bridge Past and Future'' (BPF), which aligns models across stages, ensuring consistent optimization directions. In addition, we propose a novel Distillation with Future (DwF) loss, fully leveraging the background probability to mitigate the forgetting of old classes while ensuring a high level of adaptability in learning new classes. Extensive experiments are conducted on both Pascal VOC and MS COCO benchmarks. Without memory, BPF outperforms current state-of-the-art methods under various settings.

- **Summary**: The diagnostic accuracy and subjectivity of existing Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) ordinal grading systems has been a subject of on-going debate and concern. Existing automated solutions are trained to emulate these imperfect systems, whilst also being reliant on large annotated databases for fully-supervised training. This work proposes a three stage approach for automated continuous grading of knee OA that is built upon the principles of Anomaly Detection (AD); learning a robust representation of healthy knee X-rays and grading disease severity based on its distance to the centre of normality. In the first stage, SS-FewSOME is proposed, a self-supervised AD technique that learns the 'normal' representation, requiring only examples of healthy subjects and <3% of the labels that existing methods require. In the second stage, this model is used to pseudo label a subset of unlabelled data as 'normal' or 'anomalous', followed by denoising of pseudo labels with CLIP. The final stage involves retraining on labelled and pseudo labelled data using the proposed Dual Centre Representation Learning (DCRL) which learns the centres of two representation spaces; normal and anomalous. Disease severity is then graded based on the distance to the learned centres. The proposed methodology outperforms existing techniques by margins of up to 24% in terms of OA detection and the disease severity scores correlate with the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system at the same level as human expert performance.

- **Summary**: Visual text generation has significantly advanced through diffusion models aimed at producing images with readable and realistic text. Recent works primarily use a ControlNet-based framework, employing standard font text images to control diffusion models. Recognizing the critical role of control information in generating high-quality text, we investigate its influence from three perspectives: input encoding, role at different stages, and output features. Our findings reveal that: 1) Input control information has unique characteristics compared to conventional inputs like Canny edges and depth maps. 2) Control information plays distinct roles at different stages of the denoising process. 3) Output control features significantly differ from the base and skip features of the U-Net decoder in the frequency domain. Based on these insights, we propose TextGen, a novel framework designed to enhance generation quality by optimizing control information. We improve input and output features using Fourier analysis to emphasize relevant information and reduce noise. Additionally, we employ a two-stage generation framework to align the different roles of control information at different stages. Furthermore, we introduce an effective and lightweight dataset for training. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Chinese and English text generation. The code and dataset will be made available.

- **Summary**: Existing few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods mainly focus on prototype feature generation and the query-support matching mechanism. As a crucial prompt for generating prototype features, the pair of image-mask types in the support set has become the default setting. However, various types such as image, text, box, and mask all can provide valuable information regarding the objects in context, class, localization, and shape appearance. Existing work focuses on specific combinations of guidance, leading FSS into different research branches. Rethinking guidance types in FSS is expected to explore the efficient joint representation of the coupling between the support set and query set, giving rise to research trends in the weakly or strongly annotated guidance to meet the customized requirements of practical users. In this work, we provide the generalized FSS with seven guidance paradigms and develop a universal vision-language framework (UniFSS) to integrate prompts from text, mask, box, and image. Leveraging the advantages of large-scale pre-training vision-language models in textual and visual embeddings, UniFSS proposes high-level spatial correction and embedding interactive units to overcome the semantic ambiguity drawbacks typically encountered by pure visual matching methods when facing intra-class appearance diversities. Extensive experiments show that UniFSS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Notably, the weakly annotated class-aware box paradigm even surpasses the finely annotated mask paradigm.

- **Summary**: Single-image dehazing is a pivotal challenge in computer vision that seeks to remove haze from images and restore clean background details. Recognizing the limitations of traditional physical model-based methods and the inefficiencies of current attention-based solutions, we propose a new dehazing network combining an innovative Haze-Aware Attention Module (HAAM) with a Multiscale Frequency Enhancement Module (MFEM). The HAAM is inspired by the atmospheric scattering model, thus skillfully integrating physical principles into high-dimensional features for targeted dehazing. It picks up on latent features during the image restoration process, which gives a significant boost to the metrics, while the MFEM efficiently enhances high-frequency details, thus sidestepping wavelet or Fourier transform complexities. It employs multiscale fields to extract and emphasize key frequency components with minimal parameter overhead. Integrated into a simple U-Net framework, our Haze-Aware Attention Network (HAA-Net) for single-image dehazing significantly outperforms existing attention-based and transformer models in efficiency and effectiveness. Tested across various public datasets, the HAA-Net sets new performance benchmarks. Our work not only advances the field of image dehazing but also offers insights into the design of attention mechanisms for broader applications in computer vision.

- **Summary**: Colorway creation is the task of generating textile samples in alternate color variations maintaining an underlying pattern. The individuation of a suitable color palette for a colorway is a complex creative task, responding to client and market needs, stylistic and cultural specifications, and mood. We introduce a modification of this task, the "generative colorway" creation, that includes minimal shape modifications, and propose a framework, "ColorwAI", to tackle this task using color disentanglement on StyleGAN and Diffusion. We introduce a variation of the InterfaceGAN method for supervised disentanglement, ShapleyVec. We use Shapley values to subselect a few dimensions of the detected latent direction. Moreover, we introduce a general framework to adopt common disentanglement methods on any architecture with a semantic latent space and test it on Diffusion and GANs. We interpret the color representations within the models' latent space. We find StyleGAN's W space to be the most aligned with human notions of color. Finally, we suggest that disentanglement can solicit a creative system for colorway creation, and evaluate it through expert questionnaires and creativity theory.

- **Summary**: Vision language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in diverse applications, becoming a prevalent research direction. In this paper, we build FIRE, a feedback-refinement dataset, consisting of 1.1M multi-turn conversations that are derived from 27 source datasets, empowering VLMs to spontaneously refine their responses based on user feedback across diverse tasks. To scale up the data collection, FIRE is collected in two components: FIRE-100K and FIRE-1M, where FIRE-100K is generated by GPT-4V, and FIRE-1M is freely generated via models trained on FIRE-100K. Then, we build FIRE-Bench, a benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the feedback-refining capability of VLMs, which contains 11K feedback-refinement conversations as the test data, two evaluation settings, and a model to provide feedback for VLMs. We develop the FIRE-LLaVA model by fine-tuning LLaVA on FIRE-100K and FIRE-1M, which shows remarkable feedback-refining capability on FIRE-Bench and outperforms untrained VLMs by 50%, making more efficient user-agent interactions and underscoring the significance of the FIRE dataset.

- **Summary**: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening condition where rapid and accurate diagnosis is imperative yet difficult due to predominantly atypical symptomatology. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is acknowledged as the gold standard imaging tool in clinics, yet it can be contraindicated for emergency department (ED) patients and represents an onerous procedure, thus necessitating PE identification through non-contrast CT (NCT) scans. In this work, we explore the feasibility of applying a deep-learning approach to NCT scans for PE identification. We propose a novel Cross-Phase Mutual learNing framework (CPMN) that fosters knowledge transfer from CTPA to NCT, while concurrently conducting embolism segmentation and abnormality classification in a multi-task manner. The proposed CPMN leverages the Inter-Feature Alignment (IFA) strategy that enhances spatial contiguity and mutual learning between the dual-pathway network, while the Intra-Feature Discrepancy (IFD) strategy can facilitate precise segmentation of PE against complex backgrounds for single-pathway networks. For a comprehensive assessment of the proposed approach, a large-scale dual-phase dataset containing 334 PE patients and 1,105 normal subjects has been established. Experimental results demonstrate that CPMN achieves the leading identification performance, which is 95.4\% and 99.6\% in patient-level sensitivity and specificity on NCT scans, indicating the potential of our approach as an economical, accessible, and precise tool for PE identification in clinical practice.

- **Summary**: The target duration of a synthesized human motion is a critical attribute that requires modeling control over the motion dynamics and style. Speeding up an action performance is not merely fast-forwarding it. However, state-of-the-art techniques for human behavior synthesis have limited control over the target sequence length.   We introduce the problem of generating length-aware 3D human motion sequences from textual descriptors, and we propose a novel model to synthesize motions of variable target lengths, which we dub "Length-Aware Latent Diffusion" (LADiff). LADiff consists of two new modules: 1) a length-aware variational auto-encoder to learn motion representations with length-dependent latent codes; 2) a length-conforming latent diffusion model to generate motions with a richness of details that increases with the required target sequence length. LADiff significantly improves over the state-of-the-art across most of the existing motion synthesis metrics on the two established benchmarks of HumanML3D and KIT-ML.

- **Summary**: Masked image modeling (MIM) has gained significant traction for its remarkable prowess in representation learning. As an alternative to the traditional approach, the reconstruction from corrupted images has recently emerged as a promising pretext task. However, the regular corrupted images are generated using generic generators, often lacking relevance to the specific reconstruction task involved in pre-training. Hence, reconstruction from regular corrupted images cannot ensure the difficulty of the pretext task, potentially leading to a performance decline. Moreover, generating corrupted images might introduce an extra generator, resulting in a notable computational burden. To address these issues, we propose to incorporate adversarial examples into masked image modeling, as the new reconstruction targets. Adversarial examples, generated online using only the trained models, can directly aim to disrupt tasks associated with pre-training. Therefore, the incorporation not only elevates the level of challenge in reconstruction but also enhances efficiency, contributing to the acquisition of superior representations by the model. In particular, we introduce a novel auxiliary pretext task that reconstructs the adversarial examples corresponding to the original images. We also devise an innovative adversarial attack to craft more suitable adversarial examples for MIM pre-training. It is noted that our method is not restricted to specific model architectures and MIM strategies, rendering it an adaptable plug-in capable of enhancing all MIM methods. Experimental findings substantiate the remarkable capability of our approach in amplifying the generalization and robustness of existing MIM methods. Notably, our method surpasses the performance of baselines on various tasks, including ImageNet, its variants, and other downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Inter prediction is a key technology to reduce the temporal redundancy in video coding. In natural videos, there are usually multiple moving objects with variable velocity, resulting in complex motion fields that are difficult to represent compactly. In Versatile Video Coding (VVC), existing inter prediction methods usually assume uniform speed motion between consecutive frames and use the linear models for motion estimation (ME) and motion compensation (MC), which may not well handle the complex motion fields in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce a uniformly accelerated motion model (UAMM) to exploit motion-related elements (velocity, acceleration) of moving objects between the video frames, and further combine them to assist the inter prediction methods to handle the variable motion in the temporal domain. Specifically, first, the theory of UAMM is mentioned. Second, based on that, we propose the UAMM-based parameter derivation and extrapolation schemes in the coding process. Third, we integrate the UAMM into existing inter prediction modes (Merge, MMVD, CIIP) to achieve higher prediction accuracy. The proposed method is implemented into the VVC reference software, VTM version 12.0. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves up to 0.38% and on average 0.13% BD-rate reduction compared to the VTM anchor, under the Low-delay P configuration, with a slight increase of time complexity on the encoding/decoding side.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we investigate improving the perception performance of autonomous vehicles through communication with other vehicles and road infrastructures. To this end, we introduce a collaborative perception model $\textbf{V2X-M2C}$, consisting of multiple modules, each generating inter-agent complementary information, spatial global context, and spatial local information. Inspired by the question of why most existing architectures are sequential, we analyze both the $\textit{sequential}$ and $\textit{parallel}$ connections of the modules. The sequential connection synergizes the modules, whereas the parallel connection independently improves each module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V2X-M2C achieves state-of-the-art perception performance, increasing the detection accuracy by 8.00% to 10.87% and decreasing the FLOPs by 42.81% to 52.64%.

- **Summary**: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to erase data from a model as if it never saw them during training. To this extent, existing MU approaches assume complete or partial access to the training data, which can be limited over time due to privacy regulations. However, no setting or benchmark exists to probe the effectiveness of MU methods in such scenarios, i.e. when training data is missing. To fill this gap, we propose a novel task we call One-Shot Unlearning of Personal Identities (O-UPI) that evaluates unlearning models when the training data is not accessible. Specifically, we focus on the identity unlearning case, which is relevant due to current regulations requiring data deletion after training. To cope with data absence, we expect users to provide a portraiting picture to perform unlearning. To evaluate methods in O-UPI, we benchmark the forgetting on CelebA and CelebA-HQ datasets with different unlearning set sizes. We test applicable methods on this challenging benchmark, proposing also an effective method that meta-learns to forget identities from a single image. Our findings indicate that existing approaches struggle when data availability is limited, with greater difficulty when there is dissimilarity between provided samples and data used at training time. We will release the code and benchmark upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: We present a novel approach for generating minority samples that live on low-density regions of a data manifold. Our framework is built upon diffusion models, leveraging the principle of guided sampling that incorporates an arbitrary energy-based guidance during inference time. The key defining feature of our sampler lies in its \emph{self-contained} nature, \ie, implementable solely with a pretrained model. This distinguishes our sampler from existing techniques that require expensive additional components (like external classifiers) for minority generation. Specifically, we first estimate the likelihood of features within an intermediate latent sample by evaluating a reconstruction loss w.r.t. its posterior mean. The generation then proceeds with the minimization of the estimated likelihood, thereby encouraging the emergence of minority features in the latent samples of subsequent timesteps. To further improve the performance of our sampler, we provide several time-scheduling techniques that properly manage the influence of guidance over inference steps. Experiments on benchmark real datasets demonstrate that our approach can greatly improve the capability of creating realistic low-likelihood minority instances over the existing techniques without the reliance on costly additional elements.

- **Summary**: In recent years, transformer-based models have exhibited considerable potential in point cloud instance segmentation. Despite the promising performance achieved by existing methods, they encounter challenges such as instance query initialization problems and excessive reliance on stacked layers, rendering them incompatible with large-scale 3D scenes. This paper introduces a novel method, named SGIFormer, for 3D instance segmentation, which is composed of the Semantic-guided Mix Query (SMQ) initialization and the Geometric-enhanced Interleaving Transformer (GIT) decoder. Specifically, the principle of our SMQ initialization scheme is to leverage the predicted voxel-wise semantic information to implicitly generate the scene-aware query, yielding adequate scene prior and compensating for the learnable query set. Subsequently, we feed the formed overall query into our GIT decoder to alternately refine instance query and global scene features for further capturing fine-grained information and reducing complex design intricacies simultaneously. To emphasize geometric property, we consider bias estimation as an auxiliary task and progressively integrate shifted point coordinates embedding to reinforce instance localization. SGIFormer attains state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet V2, ScanNet200 datasets, and the challenging high-fidelity ScanNet++ benchmark, striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Digital image manipulation has become increasingly accessible and realistic with the advent of generative AI technologies. Recent developments allow for text-guided inpainting, making sophisticated image edits possible with minimal effort. This poses new challenges for digital media forensics. For example, diffusion model-based approaches could either splice the inpainted region into the original image, or regenerate the entire image. In the latter case, traditional image forgery localization (IFL) methods typically fail. This paper introduces the Text-Guided Inpainting Forgery (TGIF) dataset, a comprehensive collection of images designed to support the training and evaluation of image forgery localization and synthetic image detection (SID) methods. The TGIF dataset includes approximately 80k forged images, originating from popular open-source and commercial methods; SD2, SDXL, and Adobe Firefly. Using this data, we benchmark several state-of-the-art IFL and SID methods. Whereas traditional IFL methods can detect spliced images, they fail to detect regenerated inpainted images. Moreover, traditional SID may detect the regenerated inpainted images to be fake, but cannot localize the inpainted area. Finally, both types of methods fail when exposed to stronger compression, while they are less robust to modern compression algorithms, such as WEBP. As such, this work demonstrates the inefficiency of state-of-the-art detectors on local manipulations performed by modern generative approaches, and aspires to help with the development of more capable IFL and SID methods.

- **Summary**: Although LiDAR semantic segmentation advances rapidly, state-of-the-art methods often incorporate specifically designed inductive bias derived from benchmarks originating from mechanical spinning LiDAR. This can limit model generalizability to other kinds of LiDAR technologies and make hyperparameter tuning more complex. To tackle these issues, we propose a generalized framework to accommodate various types of LiDAR prevalent in the market by replacing window-attention with our sparse focal point modulation. Our SFPNet is capable of extracting multi-level contexts and dynamically aggregating them using a gate mechanism. By implementing a channel-wise information query, features that incorporate both local and global contexts are encoded. We also introduce a novel large-scale hybrid-solid LiDAR semantic segmentation dataset for robotic applications. SFPNet demonstrates competitive performance on conventional benchmarks derived from mechanical spinning LiDAR, while achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark derived from solid-state LiDAR. Additionally, it outperforms existing methods on our novel dataset sourced from hybrid-solid LiDAR.

- **Summary**: With the advent of large pre-trained transformer models, fine-tuning these models for various downstream tasks is a critical problem. Paucity of training data, the existence of data silos, and stringent privacy constraints exacerbate this fine-tuning problem in the medical imaging domain, creating a strong need for algorithms that enable collaborative fine-tuning of pre-trained models. Moreover, the large size of these models necessitates the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to reduce the communication burden in federated learning. In this work, we systematically investigate various federated PEFT strategies for adapting a Vision Transformer (ViT) model (pre-trained on a large natural image dataset) for medical image classification. Apart from evaluating known PEFT techniques, we introduce new federated variants of PEFT algorithms such as visual prompt tuning (VPT), low-rank decomposition of visual prompts, stochastic block attention fine-tuning, and hybrid PEFT methods like low-rank adaptation (LoRA)+VPT. Moreover, we perform a thorough empirical analysis to identify the optimal PEFT method for the federated setting and understand the impact of data distribution on federated PEFT, especially for out-of-domain (OOD) and non-IID data. The key insight of this study is that while most federated PEFT methods work well for in-domain transfer, there is a substantial accuracy vs. efficiency trade-off when dealing with OOD and non-IID scenarios, which is commonly the case in medical imaging. Specifically, every order of magnitude reduction in fine-tuned/exchanged parameters can lead to a 4% drop in accuracy. Thus, the initial model choice is crucial for federated PEFT. It is preferable to use medical foundation models learned from in-domain medical image data (if available) rather than general vision models.

- **Summary**: This study introduces a novel Remote Sensing (RS) Urban Prediction (UP) task focused on future urban planning, which aims to forecast urban layouts by utilizing information from existing urban layouts and planned change maps. To address the proposed RS UP task, we propose UP-Diff, which leverages a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to capture positionaware embeddings of pre-change urban layouts and planned change maps. In specific, the trainable cross-attention layers within UP-Diff's iterative diffusion modules enable the model to dynamically highlight crucial regions for targeted modifications. By utilizing our UP-Diff, designers can effectively refine and adjust future urban city plans by making modifications to the change maps in a dynamic and adaptive manner. Compared with conventional RS Change Detection (CD) methods, the proposed UP-Diff for the RS UP task avoids the requirement of paired prechange and post-change images, which enhances the practical usage in city development. Experimental results on LEVIRCD and SYSU-CD datasets show UP-Diff's ability to accurately predict future urban layouts with high fidelity, demonstrating its potential for urban planning.

- **Summary**: Recently, video diffusion models (VDMs) have garnered significant attention due to their notable advancements in generating coherent and realistic video content. However, processing multiple frame features concurrently, coupled with the considerable model size, results in high latency and extensive memory consumption, hindering their broader application. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is an effective technique to reduce memory footprint and improve computational efficiency. Unlike image diffusion, we observe that the temporal features, which are integrated into all frame features, exhibit pronounced skewness. Furthermore, we investigate significant inter-channel disparities and asymmetries in the activation of video diffusion models, resulting in low coverage of quantization levels by individual channels and increasing the challenge of quantization. To address these issues, we introduce the first PTQ strategy tailored for video diffusion models, dubbed QVD. Specifically, we propose the High Temporal Discriminability Quantization (HTDQ) method, designed for temporal features, which retains the high discriminability of quantized features, providing precise temporal guidance for all video frames. In addition, we present the Scattered Channel Range Integration (SCRI) method which aims to improve the coverage of quantization levels across individual channels. Experimental validations across various models, datasets, and bit-width settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our QVD in terms of diverse metrics. In particular, we achieve near-lossless performance degradation on W8A8, outperforming the current methods by 205.12 in FVD.

- **Summary**: Human trajectory prediction is a practical task of predicting the future positions of pedestrians on the road, which typically covers all temporal ranges from short-term to long-term within a trajectory. However, existing works attempt to address the entire trajectory prediction with a singular, uniform training paradigm, neglecting the distinction between short-term and long-term dynamics in human trajectories. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel Progressive Pretext Task learning (PPT) framework, which progressively enhances the model's capacity of capturing short-term dynamics and long-term dependencies for the final entire trajectory prediction. Specifically, we elaborately design three stages of training tasks in the PPT framework. In the first stage, the model learns to comprehend the short-term dynamics through a stepwise next-position prediction task. In the second stage, the model is further enhanced to understand long-term dependencies through a destination prediction task. In the final stage, the model aims to address the entire future trajectory task by taking full advantage of the knowledge from previous stages. To alleviate the knowledge forgetting, we further apply a cross-task knowledge distillation. Additionally, we design a Transformer-based trajectory predictor, which is able to achieve highly efficient two-step reasoning by integrating a destination-driven prediction strategy and a group of learnable prompt embeddings. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks have demonstrated that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

- **Summary**: Since LIC has made rapid progress recently compared to traditional methods, this paper attempts to discuss the question about 'Where is the boundary of Learned Image Compression(LIC)?' with regard to subjective matrics. Thus this paper splits the above problem into two sub-problems:1)Where is the boundary of rate-distortion performance of PSNR? 2)How to further improve the compression gain and achieve the boundary? Therefore this paper analyzes the effectiveness of scaling parameters for encoder, decoder and context model, which are the three components of LIC. Then we conclude that scaling for LIC is to scale for context model and decoder within LIC. Extensive experiments demonstrate that overfitting can actually serve as an effective context. By optimizing the context, this paper further improves PSNR and achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing a performance gain of 14.39% with BD-RATE over VVC.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful foundation models for a variety of tasks, with a large focus in synthetic image generation. However, their requirement of large annotated datasets for training limits their applicability in medical imaging, where datasets are typically smaller and sparsely annotated. We introduce DiNO-Diffusion, a self-supervised method for training latent diffusion models (LDMs) that conditions the generation process on image embeddings extracted from DiNO. By eliminating the reliance on annotations, our training leverages over 868k unlabelled images from public chest X-Ray (CXR) datasets. Despite being self-supervised, DiNO-Diffusion shows comprehensive manifold coverage, with FID scores as low as 4.7, and emerging properties when evaluated in downstream tasks. It can be used to generate semantically-diverse synthetic datasets even from small data pools, demonstrating up to 20% AUC increase in classification performance when used for data augmentation. Images were generated with different sampling strategies over the DiNO embedding manifold and using real images as a starting point. Results suggest, DiNO-Diffusion could facilitate the creation of large datasets for flexible training of downstream AI models from limited amount of real data, while also holding potential for privacy preservation. Additionally, DiNO-Diffusion demonstrates zero-shot segmentation performance of up to 84.4% Dice score when evaluating lung lobe segmentation. This evidences good CXR image-anatomy alignment, akin to segmenting using textual descriptors on vanilla DMs. Finally, DiNO-Diffusion can be easily adapted to other medical imaging modalities or state-of-the-art diffusion models, opening the door for large-scale, multi-domain image generation pipelines for medical imaging.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel method for reconstructing meshes from sparse point clouds by predicting edge connection. Existing implicit methods usually produce superior smooth and watertight meshes due to the isosurface extraction algorithms~(e.g., Marching Cubes). However, these methods become memory and computationally intensive with increasing resolution. Explicit methods are more efficient by directly forming the face from points. Nevertheless, the challenge of selecting appropriate faces from enormous candidates often leads to undesirable faces and holes. Moreover, the reconstruction performance of both approaches tends to degrade when the point cloud gets sparse. To this end, we propose MEsh Reconstruction via edGE~(MergeNet), which converts mesh reconstruction into local connectivity prediction problems. Specifically, MergeNet learns to extract the features of candidate edges and regress their distances to the underlying surface. Consequently, the predicted distance is utilized to filter out edges that lay on surfaces. Finally, the meshes are reconstructed by refining the triangulations formed by these edges. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-scanned datasets demonstrate the superiority of MergeNet to SoTA explicit methods.

- **Summary**: Visual validation of regression models in scatterplots is a common practice for assessing model quality, yet its efficacy remains unquantified. We conducted two empirical experiments to investigate individuals' ability to visually validate linear regression models (linear trends) and to examine the impact of common visualization designs on validation quality. The first experiment showed that the level of accuracy for visual estimation of slope (i.e., fitting a line to data) is higher than for visual validation of slope (i.e., accepting a shown line). Notably, we found bias toward slopes that are "too steep" in both cases. This lead to novel insights that participants naturally assessed regression with orthogonal distances between the points and the line (i.e., ODR regression) rather than the common vertical distances (OLS regression). In the second experiment, we investigated whether incorporating common designs for regression visualization (error lines, bounding boxes, and confidence intervals) would improve visual validation. Even though error lines reduced validation bias, results failed to show the desired improvements in accuracy for any design. Overall, our findings suggest caution in using visual model validation for linear trends in scatterplots.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present DiT-MoE, a sparse version of the diffusion Transformer, that is scalable and competitive with dense networks while exhibiting highly optimized inference. The DiT-MoE includes two simple designs: shared expert routing and expert-level balance loss, thereby capturing common knowledge and reducing redundancy among the different routed experts. When applied to conditional image generation, a deep analysis of experts specialization gains some interesting observations: (i) Expert selection shows preference with spatial position and denoising time step, while insensitive with different class-conditional information; (ii) As the MoE layers go deeper, the selection of experts gradually shifts from specific spacial position to dispersion and balance. (iii) Expert specialization tends to be more concentrated at the early time step and then gradually uniform after half. We attribute it to the diffusion process that first models the low-frequency spatial information and then high-frequency complex information. Based on the above guidance, a series of DiT-MoE experimentally achieves performance on par with dense networks yet requires much less computational load during inference. More encouragingly, we demonstrate the potential of DiT-MoE with synthesized image data, scaling diffusion model at a 16.5B parameter that attains a new SoTA FID-50K score of 1.80 in 512$\times$512 resolution settings.

- **Summary**: We present REMM, a rotation-equivariant framework for end-to-end multimodal image matching, which fully encodes rotational differences of descriptors in the whole matching pipeline. Previous learning-based methods mainly focus on extracting modal-invariant descriptors, while consistently ignoring the rotational invariance. In this paper, we demonstrate that our REMM is very useful for multimodal image matching, including multimodal feature learning module and cyclic shift module. We first learn modal-invariant features through the multimodal feature learning module. Then, we design the cyclic shift module to rotationally encode the descriptors, greatly improving the performance of rotation-equivariant matching, which makes them robust to any angle. To validate our method, we establish a comprehensive rotation and scale-matching benchmark for evaluating the anti-rotation performance of multimodal images, which contains a combination of multi-angle and multi-scale transformations from four publicly available datasets. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in benchmarking and generalizes well to independent datasets. Additionally, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the key components of the REMM to validate the improvements brought about by the cyclic shift module.

- **Summary**: When planning for autonomous driving, it is crucial to consider essential traffic elements such as lanes, intersections, traffic regulations, and dynamic agents. However, they are often overlooked by the traditional end-to-end planning methods, likely leading to inefficiencies and non-compliance with traffic regulations. In this work, we endeavor to integrate the perception of these elements into the planning task. To this end, we propose Perception Helps Planning (PHP), a novel framework that reconciles lane-level planning with perception. This integration ensures that planning is inherently aligned with traffic constraints, thus facilitating safe and efficient driving. Specifically, PHP focuses on both edges of a lane for planning and perception purposes, taking into consideration the 3D positions of both lane edges and attributes for lane intersections, lane directions, lane occupancy, and planning. In the algorithmic design, the process begins with the transformer encoding multi-camera images to extract the above features and predicting lane-level perception results. Next, the hierarchical feature early fusion module refines the features for predicting planning attributes. Finally, the double-edge interpreter utilizes a late-fusion process specifically designed to integrate lane-level perception and planning information, culminating in the generation of vehicle control signals. Experiments on three Carla benchmarks show significant improvements in driving score of 27.20%, 33.47%, and 15.54% over existing algorithms, respectively, achieving the state-of-the-art performance, with the system operating up to 22.57 FPS.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose an enhanced audio-visual deep detection method. Recent methods in audio-visual deepfake detection mostly assess the synchronization between audio and visual features. Although they have shown promising results, they are based on the maximization/minimization of isolated feature distances without considering feature statistics. Moreover, they rely on cumbersome deep learning architectures and are heavily dependent on empirically fixed hyperparameters. Herein, to overcome these limitations, we propose: (1) a statistical feature loss to enhance the discrimination capability of the model, instead of relying solely on feature distances; (2) using the waveform for describing the audio as a replacement of frequency-based representations; (3) a post-processing normalization of the fakeness score; (4) the use of shallower network for reducing the computational complexity. Experiments on the DFDC and FakeAVCeleb datasets demonstrate the relevance of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving approach to train models on decentralized data. Its potential in healthcare is significant, but challenges arise due to cross-client variations in medical image data, exacerbated by limited annotations. This paper introduces Cross-Client Variations Adaptive Federated Learning (CCVA-FL) to address these issues. CCVA-FL aims to minimize cross-client variations by transforming images into a common feature space. It involves expert annotation of a subset of images from each client, followed by the selection of a client with the least data complexity as the target. Synthetic medical images are then generated using Scalable Diffusion Models with Transformers (DiT) based on the target client's annotated images. These synthetic images, capturing diversity and representing the original data, are shared with other clients. Each client then translates its local images into the target image space using image-to-image translation. The translated images are subsequently used in a federated learning setting to develop a server model. Our results demonstrate that CCVA-FL outperforms Vanilla Federated Averaging by effectively addressing data distribution differences across clients without compromising privacy.

This challenge consists of three tasks: action unit detection, facial expression recognition, and valance-arousal estimation. We address the research problems of this challenge from three aspects: 1)For learning robust visual feature representations, we introduce the pre-trained large model Dinov2. 2) To adaptively extract the required features of eack task, we design a task-adaptive block that performs cross-attention between a set of learnable query vectors and pre-extracted features. 3) By proposing the AU-assisted Graph Convolutional Network(AU-GCN), we make full use of the correlation information between AUs to assist in solving the EXPR and VA tasks. Finally, we achieve the evaluation measure of \textbf{1.2542} on the validation set provided by the organizers.

- **Summary**: Creating in-silico data with generative AI promises a cost-effective alternative to staining, imaging, and annotating whole slide images in computational pathology. Diffusion models are the state-of-the-art solution for generating in-silico images, offering unparalleled fidelity and realism. Using appearance transfer diffusion models allows for zero-shot image generation, facilitating fast application and making model training unnecessary. However current appearance transfer diffusion models are designed for natural images, where the main task is to transfer the foreground object from an origin to a target domain, while the background is of insignificant importance. In computational pathology, specifically in oncology, it is however not straightforward to define which objects in an image should be classified as foreground and background, as all objects in an image may be of critical importance for the detailed understanding the tumor micro-environment. We contribute to the applicability of appearance transfer diffusion models to immunohistochemistry-stained images by modifying the appearance transfer guidance to alternate between class-specific AdaIN feature statistics matchings using existing segmentation masks. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on the downstream task of supervised epithelium segmentation, showing that the number of manual annotations required for model training can be reduced by 75%, outperforming the baseline approach. Additionally, we consulted with a certified pathologist to investigate future improvements. We anticipate this work to inspire the application of zero-shot diffusion models in computational pathology, providing an efficient method to generate in-silico images with unmatched fidelity and realism, which prove meaningful for downstream tasks, such as training existing deep learning models or finetuning foundation models.

- **Summary**: Atmospheric states derived from reanalysis comprise a substantial portion of weather and climate simulation outputs. Many stakeholders -- such as researchers, policy makers, and insurers -- use this data to better understand the earth system and guide policy decisions. Atmospheric states have also received increased interest as machine learning approaches to weather prediction have shown promising results. A key issue for all audiences is that dense time series of these high-dimensional states comprise an enormous amount of data, precluding all but the most well resourced groups from accessing and using historical data and future projections. To address this problem, we propose a method for compressing atmospheric states using methods from the neural network literature, adapting spherical data to processing by conventional neural architectures through the use of the area-preserving HEALPix projection. We investigate two model classes for building neural compressors: the hyperprior model from the neural image compression literature and recent vector-quantised models. We show that both families of models satisfy the desiderata of small average error, a small number of high-error reconstructed pixels, faithful reproduction of extreme events such as hurricanes and heatwaves, preservation of the spectral power distribution across spatial scales. We demonstrate compression ratios in excess of 1000x, with compression and decompression at a rate of approximately one second per global atmospheric state.

- **Summary**: This work addresses the challenge of sub-pixel accuracy in detecting 2D local features, a cornerstone problem in computer vision. Despite the advancements brought by neural network-based methods like SuperPoint and ALIKED, these modern approaches lag behind classical ones such as SIFT in keypoint localization accuracy due to their lack of sub-pixel precision. We propose a novel network that enhances any detector with sub-pixel precision by learning an offset vector for detected features, thereby eliminating the need for designing specialized sub-pixel accurate detectors. This optimization directly minimizes test-time evaluation metrics like relative pose error. Through extensive testing with both nearest neighbors matching and the recent LightGlue matcher across various real-world datasets, our method consistently outperforms existing methods in accuracy. Moreover, it adds only around 7 ms to the time of a particular detector. The code is available at https://github.com/KimSinjeong/keypt2subpx .

- **Summary**: Video-language alignment is a crucial multi-modal task that benefits various downstream applications, e.g., video-text retrieval and video question answering. Existing methods either utilize multi-modal information in video-text pairs or apply global and local alignment techniques to promote alignment precision. However, these methods often fail to fully explore the spatio-temporal relationships among vision tokens within video and across different video-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer module to uniformly learn spatial and temporal contexts for video-language alignment pre-training (dubbed STGT). Specifically, our STGT combines spatio-temporal graph structure information with attention in transformer block, effectively utilizing the spatio-temporal contexts. In this way, we can model the relationships between vision tokens, promoting video-text alignment precision for benefiting downstream tasks. In addition, we propose a self-similarity alignment loss to explore the inherent self-similarity in the video and text. With the initial optimization achieved by contrastive learning, it can further promote the alignment accuracy between video and text. Experimental results on challenging downstream tasks, including video-text retrieval and video question answering, verify the superior performance of our method.

- **Summary**: Online high-definition (HD) map construction is an important and challenging task in autonomous driving. Recently, there has been a growing interest in cost-effective multi-view camera-based methods without relying on other sensors like LiDAR. However, these methods suffer from a lack of explicit depth information, necessitating the use of large models to achieve satisfactory performance. To address this, we employ the Knowledge Distillation (KD) idea for efficient HD map construction for the first time and introduce a novel KD-based approach called MapDistill to transfer knowledge from a high-performance camera-LiDAR fusion model to a lightweight camera-only model. Specifically, we adopt the teacher-student architecture, i.e., a camera-LiDAR fusion model as the teacher and a lightweight camera model as the student, and devise a dual BEV transform module to facilitate cross-modal knowledge distillation while maintaining cost-effective camera-only deployment. Additionally, we present a comprehensive distillation scheme encompassing cross-modal relation distillation, dual-level feature distillation, and map head distillation. This approach alleviates knowledge transfer challenges between modalities, enabling the student model to learn improved feature representations for HD map construction. Experimental results on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of MapDistill, surpassing existing competitors by over 7.7 mAP or 4.5X speedup.

- **Summary**: Change captioning aims to succinctly describe the semantic change between a pair of similar images, while being immune to distractors (illumination and viewpoint changes). Under these distractors, unchanged objects often appear pseudo changes about location and scale, and certain objects might overlap others, resulting in perturbational and discrimination-degraded features between two images. However, most existing methods directly capture the difference between them, which risk obtaining error-prone difference features. In this paper, we propose a distractors-immune representation learning network that correlates the corresponding channels of two image representations and decorrelates different ones in a self-supervised manner, thus attaining a pair of stable image representations under distractors. Then, the model can better interact them to capture the reliable difference features for caption generation. To yield words based on the most related difference features, we further design a cross-modal contrastive regularization, which regularizes the cross-modal alignment by maximizing the contrastive alignment between the attended difference features and generated words. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four public datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/tuyunbin/DIRL.

- **Summary**: Deconvolution with a box (square wave) is a key operation for super-resolution with pixel-shift cameras. In general convolution with a box is not invertible. However, we can obtain perfect reconstructions of sparse signals using convex optimization. We give a direct proof that improves on the reconstruction bound that follows from previous results. We also show our bound is tight and matches an information theoretic limit.

- **Summary**: We present VLMEvalKit: an open-source toolkit for evaluating large multi-modality models based on PyTorch. The toolkit aims to provide a user-friendly and comprehensive framework for researchers and developers to evaluate existing multi-modality models and publish reproducible evaluation results. In VLMEvalKit, we implement over 70 different large multi-modality models, including both proprietary APIs and open-source models, as well as more than 20 different multi-modal benchmarks. By implementing a single interface, new models can be easily added to the toolkit, while the toolkit automatically handles the remaining workloads, including data preparation, distributed inference, prediction post-processing, and metric calculation. Although the toolkit is currently mainly used for evaluating large vision-language models, its design is compatible with future updates that incorporate additional modalities, such as audio and video. Based on the evaluation results obtained with the toolkit, we host OpenVLM Leaderboard, a comprehensive leaderboard to track the progress of multi-modality learning research. The toolkit is released at https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit and is actively maintained.

- **Summary**: Quantization has become increasingly pivotal in addressing the steadily increasing computational and memory requirements of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). By reducing the number of bits used to represent weights and activations (typically from 32-bit floating-point to 16-bit or 8-bit integers), quantization reduces the memory footprint, energy consumption, and execution time of DNN models. However, traditional quantization methods typically focus on the inference of DNNs, while the training process still relies on floating-point operations. To date, only one work in the literature has addressed integer-only training for Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architectures. This work introduces NITRO-D, a new framework for training arbitrarily deep integer-only Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that operate entirely< in the integer-only domain for both training and inference. NITRO-D is the first framework in the literature enabling the training of integer-only CNNs without the need to introduce a quantization scheme. Specifically, NITRO-D introduces a novel architecture integrating multiple integer local-loss blocks, which include the proposed NITRO Scaling Layer and the NITRO-ReLU activation function. Additionally, it introduces a novel integer-only learning algorithm derived from Local Error Signals (LES), utilizing IntegerSGD, an optimizer specifically designed to operate in an integer-only context. NITRO-D is implemented in an open-source Python library. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness across several state-of-the-art image recognition datasets. Results show significant performance improvements from 2.47% to 5.96% for integer-only MLP architectures over the state-of-the-art solution, and the capability of training integer-only CNN architectures with minimal accuracy degradation from -0.15% to -4.22% compared to floating-point LES.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a general scheme for enhancing the convergence and performance of DETR (DEtection TRansformer). We investigate the slow convergence problem in transformers from a new perspective, suggesting that it arises from the self-attention that introduces no structural bias over inputs. To address this issue, we explore incorporating position relation prior as attention bias to augment object detection, following the verification of its statistical significance using a proposed quantitative macroscopic correlation (MC) metric. Our approach, termed Relation-DETR, introduces an encoder to construct position relation embeddings for progressive attention refinement, which further extends the traditional streaming pipeline of DETR into a contrastive relation pipeline to address the conflicts between non-duplicate predictions and positive supervision. Extensive experiments on both generic and task-specific datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Under the same configurations, Relation-DETR achieves a significant improvement (+2.0% AP compared to DINO), state-of-the-art performance (51.7% AP for 1x and 52.1% AP for 2x settings), and a remarkably faster convergence speed (over 40% AP with only 2 training epochs) than existing DETR detectors on COCO val2017. Moreover, the proposed relation encoder serves as a universal plug-in-and-play component, bringing clear improvements for theoretically any DETR-like methods. Furthermore, we introduce a class-agnostic detection dataset, SA-Det-100k. The experimental results on the dataset illustrate that the proposed explicit position relation achieves a clear improvement of 1.3% AP, highlighting its potential towards universal object detection. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/xiuqhou/Relation-DETR.

- **Summary**: Recently, the field of Image Coding for Machines (ICM) has garnered heightened interest and significant advances thanks to the rapid progress of learning-based techniques for image compression and analysis. Previous studies often require training separate codecs to support various bitrate levels, machine tasks, and networks, thus lacking both flexibility and practicality. To address these challenges, we propose a rate-distortion-cognition controllable versatile image compression, which method allows the users to adjust the bitrate (i.e., Rate), image reconstruction quality (i.e., Distortion), and machine task accuracy (i.e., Cognition) with a single neural model, achieving ultra-controllability. Specifically, we first introduce a cognition-oriented loss in the primary compression branch to train a codec for diverse machine tasks. This branch attains variable bitrate by regulating quantization degree through the latent code channels. To further enhance the quality of the reconstructed images, we employ an auxiliary branch to supplement residual information with a scalable bitstream. Ultimately, two branches use a `$\beta x + (1 - \beta) y$' interpolation strategy to achieve a balanced cognition-distortion trade-off. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method yields satisfactory ICM performance and flexible Rate-Distortion-Cognition controlling.

- **Summary**: Olfaction, often overlooked in cultural heritage studies, holds profound significance in shaping human experiences and identities. Examining historical depictions of olfactory scenes can offer valuable insights into the role of smells in history. We show that a transfer-learning approach using weakly labeled training data can remarkably improve the classification of fragrant spaces and, more generally, artistic scene depictions. We fine-tune Places365-pre-trained models by querying two cultural heritage data sources and using the search terms as supervision signal. The models are evaluated on two manually corrected test splits. This work lays a foundation for further exploration of fragrant spaces recognition and artistic scene classification. All images and labels are released as the ArtPlaces dataset at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11584328.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised video object segmentation (VOS), also known as video salient object detection, aims to detect the most prominent object in a video at the pixel level. Recently, two-stream approaches that leverage both RGB images and optical flow maps have gained significant attention. However, the limited amount of training data remains a substantial challenge. In this study, we propose a novel data generation method that simulates fake optical flows from single images, thereby creating large-scale training data for stable network learning. Inspired by the observation that optical flow maps are highly dependent on depth maps, we generate fake optical flows by refining and augmenting the estimated depth maps of each image. By incorporating our simulated image-flow pairs, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on all public benchmark datasets without relying on complex modules. We believe that our data generation method represents a potential breakthrough for future VOS research.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Large Models (VLMs) recently become primary backbone of AI, due to the impressive performance. However, their expensive computation costs, i.e., throughput and delay, impede potentials in the real-world scenarios. To achieve acceleration for VLMs, most existing methods focus on the model perspective: pruning, distillation, quantization, but completely overlook the data-perspective redundancy. To fill the overlook, this paper pioneers the severity of data redundancy, and designs one plug-and-play Turbo module guided by information degree to prune inefficient tokens from visual or textual data. In pursuit of efficiency-performance trade-offs, information degree takes two crucial factors into consideration: mutual redundancy and semantic value. Concretely, the former evaluates data duplication between sequential tokens; while the latter evaluates each token by its contribution to the overall semantics. As a result, tokens with high information degree carry less redundancy and stronger semantics. For VLMs' calculation, Turbo works as a user-friendly plug-in that sorts data referring to information degree, utilizing only top-level ones to save costs. Its advantages are multifaceted, e.g., being generally compatible to various VLMs across understanding and generation, simple use without re-training and trivial engineering efforts. On multiple VLMs benchmarks, we fully experiment to demonstrate the good acceleration of Turbo, under negligible performance drop.

- **Summary**: Camera-based 3D occupancy prediction has recently garnered increasing attention in outdoor driving scenes. However, research in indoor scenes remains relatively unexplored. The core differences in indoor scenes lie in the complexity of scene scale and the variance in object size. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named ISO, for predicting indoor scene occupancy using monocular images. ISO harnesses the advantages of a pretrained depth model to achieve accurate depth predictions. Furthermore, we introduce the Dual Feature Line of Sight Projection (D-FLoSP) module within ISO, which enhances the learning of 3D voxel features. To foster further research in this domain, we introduce Occ-ScanNet, a large-scale occupancy benchmark for indoor scenes. With a dataset size 40 times larger than the NYUv2 dataset, it facilitates future scalable research in indoor scene analysis. Experimental results on both NYUv2 and Occ-ScanNet demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The dataset and code are made publicly at https://github.com/hongxiaoy/ISO.git.

- **Summary**: In open-set semi-supervised learning (OSSL), we consider unlabeled datasets that may contain unknown classes. Existing OSSL methods often use the softmax confidence for classifying data as in-distribution (ID) or out-of-distribution (OOD). Additionally, many works for OSSL rely on ad-hoc thresholds for ID/OOD classification, without considering the statistics of the problem. We propose a new score for ID/OOD classification based on angles in feature space between data and an ID subspace. Moreover, we propose an approach to estimate the conditional distributions of scores given ID or OOD data, enabling probabilistic predictions of data being ID or OOD. These components are put together in a framework for OSSL, termed \emph{ProSub}, that is experimentally shown to reach SOTA performance on several benchmark problems. Our code is available at https://github.com/walline/prosub.

- **Summary**: Visual loop closure detection is an important module in visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which associates current camera observation with previously visited places. Loop closures correct drifts in trajectory estimation to build a globally consistent map. However, a false loop closure can be fatal, so verification is required as an additional step to ensure robustness by rejecting the false positive loops. Geometric verification has been a well-acknowledged solution that leverages spatial clues provided by local feature matching to find true positives. Existing feature matching methods focus on homography and pose estimation in long-term visual localization, lacking references for geometric verification. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a unified benchmark targeting geometric verification of loop closure detection under long-term conditional variations. Furthermore, we evaluate six representative local feature matching methods (handcrafted and learning-based) under the benchmark, with in-depth analysis for limitations and future directions.

- **Summary**: Accurately quantifying tree cover is an important metric for ecosystem monitoring and for assessing progress in restored sites. Recent works have shown that deep learning-based segmentation algorithms are capable of accurately mapping trees at country and continental scales using high-resolution aerial and satellite imagery. Mapping at high (ideally sub-meter) resolution is necessary to identify individual trees, however there are few open-access datasets containing instance level annotations and those that exist are small or not geographically diverse. We present a novel open-access dataset for individual tree crown delineation (TCD) in high-resolution aerial imagery sourced from OpenAerialMap (OAM). Our dataset, OAM-TCD, comprises 5072 2048x2048 px images at 10 cm/px resolution with associated human-labeled instance masks for over 280k individual and 56k groups of trees. By sampling imagery from around the world, we are able to better capture the diversity and morphology of trees in different terrestrial biomes and in both urban and natural environments. Using our dataset, we train reference instance and semantic segmentation models that compare favorably to existing state-of-the-art models. We assess performance through k-fold cross-validation and comparison with existing datasets; additionally we demonstrate compelling results on independent aerial imagery captured over Switzerland and compare to municipal tree inventories and LIDAR-derived canopy maps in the city of Zurich. Our dataset, models and training/benchmark code are publicly released under permissive open-source licenses: Creative Commons (majority CC BY 4.0), and Apache 2.0 respectively.

- **Summary**: The convergence of the physical and digital realms has ushered in a new era of immersive experiences and seamless interactions. As the boundaries between the real world and virtual environments blur and result in a "mixed reality," there arises a need for robust and efficient methods to connect physical objects with their virtual counterparts. In this thesis, we present a novel approach to bridging this gap through the design, fabrication, and detection of embedded machine-readable markers.   We categorize the proposed marking approaches into three distinct categories: natural markers, structural markers, and internal markers. Natural markers, such as those used in SensiCut, are inherent fingerprints of objects repurposed as machine-readable identifiers, while structural markers, such as StructCode and G-ID, leverage the structural artifacts in objects that emerge during the fabrication process itself. Internal markers, such as InfraredTag and BrightMarker, are embedded inside fabricated objects using specialized materials. Leveraging a combination of methods from computer vision, machine learning, computational imaging, and material science, the presented approaches offer robust and versatile solutions for object identification, tracking, and interaction.   These markers, seamlessly integrated into real-world objects, effectively communicate an object's identity, origin, function, and interaction, functioning as gateways to "ubiquitous metadata" - a concept where metadata is embedded into physical objects, similar to metadata in digital files. Across the different chapters, we demonstrate the applications of the presented methods in diverse domains, including product design, manufacturing, retail, logistics, education, entertainment, security, and sustainability.

- **Summary**: To tackle the difficulties in fitting paired real-world data for single image deraining (SID), recent unsupervised methods have achieved notable success. However, these methods often struggle to generate high-quality, rain-free images due to a lack of attention to semantic representation and image content, resulting in ineffective separation of content from the rain layer. In this paper, we propose a novel cycle contrastive generative adversarial network for unsupervised SID, called CCLGAN. This framework combines cycle contrastive learning (CCL) and location contrastive learning (LCL). CCL improves image reconstruction and rain-layer removal by bringing similar features closer and pushing dissimilar features apart in both semantic and discriminative spaces. At the same time, LCL preserves content information by constraining mutual information at the same location across different exemplars. CCLGAN shows superior performance, as extensive experiments demonstrate the benefits of CCLGAN and the effectiveness of its components.

- **Summary**: Farmers face various challenges when it comes to identifying diseases in rice leaves during their early stages of growth, which is a major reason for poor produce. Therefore, early and accurate disease identification is important in agriculture to avoid crop loss and improve cultivation. In this research, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning (DL) classifier designed by extending the Squeeze-and-Excitation network architecture with a channel attention mechanism and the Swish ReLU activation function. The channel attention mechanism in our proposed model identifies the most important feature channels required for classification during feature extraction and selection. The dying ReLU problem is mitigated by utilizing the Swish ReLU activation function, and the Squeeze-andExcitation blocks improve information propagation and cross-channel interaction. Upon evaluation, our model achieved a high F1-score of 99.76% and an accuracy of 99.74%, surpassing the performance of existing models. These outcomes demonstrate the potential of state-of-the-art DL techniques in agriculture, contributing to the advancement of more efficient and reliable disease detection systems.

- **Summary**: In the past decade, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) achieved state-of-the-art performance in a broad range of problems, spanning from object classification and action recognition to smart building and healthcare. The flexibility that makes DNNs such a pervasive technology comes at a price: the computational requirements preclude their deployment on most of the resource-constrained edge devices available today to solve real-time and real-world tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to address this challenge by combining the concept of predefined sparsity with Split Computing (SC) and Early Exit (EE). In particular, SC aims at splitting a DNN with a part of it deployed on an edge device and the rest on a remote server. Instead, EE allows the system to stop using the remote server and rely solely on the edge device's computation if the answer is already good enough. Specifically, how to apply such a predefined sparsity to a SC and EE paradigm has never been studied. This paper studies this problem and shows how predefined sparsity significantly reduces the computational, storage, and energy burdens during the training and inference phases, regardless of the hardware platform. This makes it a valuable approach for enhancing the performance of SC and EE applications. Experimental results showcase reductions exceeding 4x in storage and computational complexity without compromising performance.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved visual quality inspection and predictive maintenance within industrial settings. However, deploying these technologies on low-resource edge devices poses substantial challenges due to their high computational demands and the inherent complexity of Explainable AI (XAI) methods. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel XAI-integrated Visual Quality Inspection framework that optimizes the deployment of semantic segmentation models on low-resource edge devices. Our framework incorporates XAI and the Large Vision Language Model to deliver human-centered interpretability through visual and textual explanations to end-users. This is crucial for end-user trust and model interpretability. We outline a comprehensive methodology consisting of six fundamental modules: base model fine-tuning, XAI-based explanation generation, evaluation of XAI approaches, XAI-guided data augmentation, development of an edge-compatible model, and the generation of understandable visual and textual explanations. Through XAI-guided data augmentation, the enhanced model incorporating domain expert knowledge with visual and textual explanations is successfully deployed on mobile devices to support end-users in real-world scenarios. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed framework, with the mobile model achieving competitive accuracy while significantly reducing model size. This approach paves the way for the broader adoption of reliable and interpretable AI tools in critical industrial applications, where decisions must be both rapid and justifiable.

- **Summary**: High-quality 3D photoacoustic imaging (PAI) reconstruction under sparse view or limited view has long been challenging. Traditional 3D iterative-based reconstruction methods suffer from both slow speed and high memory consumption. Recently, in computer graphics, the differentiable rendering has made significant progress, particularly with the rise of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Inspired by these, we introduce differentiable radiation into PAI, developing a novel reconstruction algorithm: the Sliding Ball Adaptive Growth algorithm (SlingBAG) for 3D PAI, which shows ability in high-quality 3D PAI reconstruction both under extremely sparse view and limited view.   We established the point cloud dataset in PAI, and used unique differentiable rapid radiator based on the spherical decomposition strategy and the randomly initialized point cloud adaptively optimized according to sparse sensor data. Each point undergoes updates in 3D coordinates, initial pressure, and resolution (denoted by the radius of ball). Points undergo adaptive growth during iterative process, including point destroying, splitting and duplicating along the gradient of their positions, manifesting the sliding ball effect.   Finally, our point cloud to voxel grid shader renders the final reconstruction results. Simulation and in vivo experiments demonstrate that our SlingBAG reconstruction result's SNR can be more than 40 dB under extremely sparse view, while the SNR of traditional back-projection algorithm's result is less than 20 dB. Moreover, the result of SlingBAG's structural similarity to the ground truth is significantly higher, with an SSIM value of 95.6%.   Notably, our differentiable rapid radiator can conduct forward PA simulation in homogeneous, non-viscous media substantially faster than current methods that numerically simulate the wave propagation, such as k-Wave. The dataset and all code will be open source.

- **Summary**: The emergence of large-scale multi-modal generative models has drastically advanced artificial intelligence, introducing unprecedented levels of performance and functionality. However, optimizing these models remains challenging due to historically isolated paths of model-centric and data-centric developments, leading to suboptimal outcomes and inefficient resource utilization. In response, we present a novel sandbox suite tailored for integrated data-model co-development. This sandbox provides a comprehensive experimental platform, enabling rapid iteration and insight-driven refinement of both data and models. Our proposed "Probe-Analyze-Refine" workflow, validated through applications on state-of-the-art LLaVA-like and DiT based models, yields significant performance boosts, such as topping the VBench leaderboard. We also uncover fruitful insights gleaned from exhaustive benchmarks, shedding light on the critical interplay between data quality, diversity, and model behavior. With the hope of fostering deeper understanding and future progress in multi-modal data and generative modeling, our codes, datasets, and models are maintained and accessible at https://github.com/modelscope/data-juicer/blob/main/docs/Sandbox.md.

- **Summary**: Interactive segmentation of 3D Gaussians opens a great opportunity for real-time manipulation of 3D scenes thanks to the real-time rendering capability of 3D Gaussian Splatting. However, the current methods suffer from time-consuming post-processing to deal with noisy segmentation output. Also, they struggle to provide detailed segmentation, which is important for fine-grained manipulation of 3D scenes. In this study, we propose Click-Gaussian, which learns distinguishable feature fields of two-level granularity, facilitating segmentation without time-consuming post-processing. We delve into challenges stemming from inconsistently learned feature fields resulting from 2D segmentation obtained independently from a 3D scene. 3D segmentation accuracy deteriorates when 2D segmentation results across the views, primary cues for 3D segmentation, are in conflict. To overcome these issues, we propose Global Feature-guided Learning (GFL). GFL constructs the clusters of global feature candidates from noisy 2D segments across the views, which smooths out noises when training the features of 3D Gaussians. Our method runs in 10 ms per click, 15 to 130 times as fast as the previous methods, while also significantly improving segmentation accuracy.

- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation (KD) involves transferring the knowledge from one neural network to another, often from a larger, well-trained model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student). Traditional KD methods minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the probabilistic outputs of the teacher and student networks. However, this approach often overlooks crucial structural knowledge embedded within the teacher's network. In this paper, we introduce Invariant Consistency Distillation (ICD), a novel methodology designed to enhance KD by ensuring that the student model's representations are consistent with those of the teacher. Our approach combines contrastive learning with an explicit invariance penalty, capturing significantly more information from the teacher's representation of the data. Our results on CIFAR-100 demonstrate that ICD outperforms traditional KD techniques and surpasses 13 state-of-the-art methods. In some cases, the student model even exceeds the teacher model in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, we successfully transfer our method to other datasets, including Tiny ImageNet and STL-10. The code will be made public soon.

- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for transferring knowledge from a large, well-trained teacher model to a smaller, more efficient student model. Despite its success, one of the main challenges in KD is ensuring the efficient transfer of complex knowledge while maintaining the student's computational efficiency. Unlike previous works that applied contrastive objectives promoting explicit negative instances, we introduce Relational Representation Distillation (RRD). Our approach leverages pairwise similarities to explore and reinforce the relationships between the teacher and student models. Inspired by self-supervised learning principles, it uses a relaxed contrastive loss that focuses on similarity rather than exact replication. This method aligns the output distributions of teacher samples in a large memory buffer, improving the robustness and performance of the student model without the need for strict negative instance differentiation. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on CIFAR-100, outperforming traditional KD techniques and surpassing 13 state-of-the-art methods. It also transfers successfully to other datasets like Tiny ImageNet and STL-10. The code will be made public soon.

- **Summary**: Action-centric sequence descriptions like recipe instructions and do-it-yourself projects include non-linear patterns in which the next step may require to be visually consistent not on the immediate previous step but on earlier steps. Current video synthesis approaches fail to generate consistent multi-scene videos for such task descriptions. We propose a contrastive sequential video diffusion method that selects the most suitable previously generated scene to guide and condition the denoising process of the next scene. The result is a multi-scene video that is grounded in the scene descriptions and coherent w.r.t the scenes that require consistent visualisation. Our experiments with real-world data demonstrate the practicality and improved consistency of our model compared to prior work.

- **Summary**: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to achieve pixel-level localization of sound sources in videos, while Audio-Visual Semantic Segmentation (AVSS), as an extension of AVS, further pursues semantic understanding of audio-visual scenes. However, since the AVSS task requires the establishment of audio-visual correspondence and semantic understanding simultaneously, we observe that previous methods have struggled to handle this mashup of objectives in end-to-end training, resulting in insufficient learning and sub-optimization. Therefore, we propose a two-stage training strategy called \textit{Stepping Stones}, which decomposes the AVSS task into two simple subtasks from localization to semantic understanding, which are fully optimized in each stage to achieve step-by-step global optimization. This training strategy has also proved its generalization and effectiveness on existing methods. To further improve the performance of AVS tasks, we propose a novel framework Adaptive Audio Visual Segmentation, in which we incorporate an adaptive audio query generator and integrate masked attention into the transformer decoder, facilitating the adaptive fusion of visual and audio features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art results on all three AVS benchmarks.

- **Summary**: In the rapidly evolving field of 3D reconstruction, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) represent significant advancements. Although 2DGS compresses 3D Gaussian primitives into 2D Gaussian surfels to effectively enhance mesh extraction quality, this compression can potentially lead to a decrease in rendering quality. Additionally, unreliable densification processes and the calculation of depth through the accumulation of opacity can compromise the detail of mesh extraction. To address this issue, we introduce MVG-Splatting, a solution guided by Multi-View considerations. Specifically, we integrate an optimized method for calculating normals, which, combined with image gradients, helps rectify inconsistencies in the original depth computations. Additionally, utilizing projection strategies akin to those in Multi-View Stereo (MVS), we propose an adaptive quantile-based method that dynamically determines the level of additional densification guided by depth maps, from coarse to fine detail. Experimental evidence demonstrates that our method not only resolves the issues of rendering quality degradation caused by depth discrepancies but also facilitates direct mesh extraction from dense Gaussian point clouds using the Marching Cubes algorithm. This approach significantly enhances the overall fidelity and accuracy of the 3D reconstruction process, ensuring that both the geometric details and visual quality.

- **Summary**: The unsupervised task of Joint Alignment (JA) of images is beset by challenges such as high complexity, geometric distortions, and convergence to poor local or even global optima. Although Vision Transformers (ViT) have recently provided valuable features for JA, they fall short of fully addressing these issues. Consequently, researchers frequently depend on expensive models and numerous regularization terms, resulting in long training times and challenging hyperparameter tuning. We introduce the Spatial Joint Alignment Model (SpaceJAM), a novel approach that addresses the JA task with efficiency and simplicity. SpaceJAM leverages a compact architecture with only 16K trainable parameters and uniquely operates without the need for regularization or atlas maintenance. Evaluations on SPair-71K and CUB datasets demonstrate that SpaceJAM matches the alignment capabilities of existing methods while significantly reducing computational demands and achieving at least a 10x speedup. SpaceJAM sets a new standard for rapid and effective image alignment, making the process more accessible and efficient. Our code is available at: https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/SpaceJAM/.

- **Summary**: Sign language translation (SLT) addresses the problem of translating information from a sign language in video to a spoken language in text. Existing studies, while showing progress, are often limited to narrow domains and/or few sign languages and struggle with open-domain tasks. In this paper, we push forward the frontier of SLT by scaling pretraining data, model size, and number of translation directions. We perform large-scale SLT pretraining on different data including 1) noisy multilingual YouTube SLT data, 2) parallel text corpora, and 3) SLT data augmented by translating video captions to other languages with off-the-shelf machine translation models. We unify different pretraining tasks with task-specific prompts under the encoder-decoder architecture, and initialize the SLT model with pretrained (m/By)T5 models across model sizes. SLT pretraining results on How2Sign and FLEURS-ASL#0 (ASL to 42 spoken languages) demonstrate the significance of data/model scaling and cross-lingual cross-modal transfer, as well as the feasibility of zero-shot SLT. We finetune the pretrained SLT models on 5 downstream open-domain SLT benchmarks covering 5 sign languages. Experiments show substantial quality improvements over the vanilla baselines, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) by wide margins.

- **Summary**: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation(CISS) aims to learn new classes without forgetting the old ones, using only the labels of the new classes. To achieve this, two popular strategies are employed: 1) pseudo-labeling and knowledge distillation to preserve prior knowledge; and 2) background weight transfer, which leverages the broad coverage of background in learning new classes by transferring background weight to the new class classifier. However, the first strategy heavily relies on the old model in detecting old classes while undetected pixels are regarded as the background, thereby leading to the background shift towards the old classes(i.e., misclassification of old class as background). Additionally, in the case of the second approach, initializing the new class classifier with background knowledge triggers a similar background shift issue, but towards the new classes. To address these issues, we propose a background-class separation framework for CISS. To begin with, selective pseudo-labeling and adaptive feature distillation are to distill only trustworthy past knowledge. On the other hand, we encourage the separation between the background and new classes with a novel orthogonal objective along with label-guided output distillation. Our state-of-the-art results validate the effectiveness of these proposed methods.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel approach to image denoising that leverages the advantages of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Specifically, we propose a model that combines elements of the Pix2Pix model and the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP). This hybrid framework seeks to capitalize on the denoising capabilities of conditional GANs, as demonstrated in the Pix2Pix model, while mitigating the need for an exhaustive search for optimal hyperparameters that could potentially ruin the stability of the learning process. In the proposed method, the GAN's generator is employed to produce denoised images, harnessing the power of a conditional GAN for noise reduction. Simultaneously, the implementation of the Lipschitz continuity constraint during updates, as featured in WGAN-GP, aids in reducing susceptibility to mode collapse. This innovative design allows the proposed model to benefit from the strong points of both Pix2Pix and WGAN-GP, generating superior denoising results while ensuring training stability. Drawing on previous work on image-to-image translation and GAN stabilization techniques, the proposed research highlights the potential of GANs as a general-purpose solution for denoising. The paper details the development and testing of this model, showcasing its effectiveness through numerical experiments. The dataset was created by adding synthetic noise to clean images. Numerical results based on real-world dataset validation underscore the efficacy of this approach in image-denoising tasks, exhibiting significant enhancements over traditional techniques. Notably, the proposed model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, performing effectively even when trained with synthetic noise.

- **Summary**: Image composition is a complex task which requires a lot of information about the scene for an accurate and realistic composition, such as perspective, lighting, shadows, occlusions, and object interactions. Previous methods have predominantly used 2D information for image composition, neglecting the potentials of 3D spatial information. In this work, we propose DepGAN, a Generative Adversarial Network that utilizes depth maps and alpha channels to rectify inaccurate occlusions and enhance transparency effects in image composition. Central to our network is a novel loss function called Depth Aware Loss which quantifies the pixel wise depth difference to accurately delineate occlusion boundaries while compositing objects at different depth levels. Furthermore, we enhance our network's learning process by utilizing opacity data, enabling it to effectively manage compositions involving transparent and semi-transparent objects. We tested our model against state-of-the-art image composition GANs on benchmark (both real and synthetic) datasets. The results reveal that DepGAN significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy of object placement semantics, transparency and occlusion handling, both visually and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Recently, human-computer interaction with various modalities has shown promising applications, like GPT-4o and Gemini. Given the foundational role of multimodal joint representation in understanding and generation pipelines, high-quality omni joint representations would be a step toward co-processing more diverse multimodal information. In this work, we present OmniBind, large-scale multimodal joint representation models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 30 billion parameters, which support 3D, audio, image, and language inputs. Due to the scarcity of data pairs across all modalities, instead of training large models from scratch, we propose remapping and binding the spaces of various pre-trained specialist models together. This approach enables "scaling up" by indirectly increasing the model parameters and the amount of seen data. To effectively integrate various spaces, we dynamically assign weights to different spaces by learning routers with two objectives: cross-modal overall alignment and language representation decoupling. Notably, since binding and routing spaces both only require lightweight networks, OmniBind is extremely training-efficient. Learning the largest 30B model requires merely unpaired unimodal data and approximately 3 days on a single 8-4090 node. Extensive experiments demonstrate the versatility and superiority of OmniBind as an omni representation model, highlighting its great potential for diverse applications, such as any-query and composable multimodal understanding.

- **Summary**: This paradigm encapsulates knowledge from various models into a solitary prompt without altering the original models or requiring access to the training data, which enables us to achieve efficient and convenient knowledge transfer in more realistic scenarios. From a practicality standpoint, this paradigm not only for the first time proves the effectiveness of Visual Prompt in data inaccessible contexts, but also solves the problems of low model reusability and high storage resource consumption faced by traditional Data-Free Knowledge Transfer, which means that we can realize the parallel knowledge transfer of multiple models without modifying any source model. Extensive experiments across various datasets and models demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed KiOP knowledge transfer paradigm. Without access to real training data and with rigorous storage capacity constraints, it is also capable of yielding considerable outcomes when dealing with cross-model backbone setups and handling parallel knowledge transfer processing requests with multiple (more than 2) models.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of tools in robot-assisted surgery is critical for machine perception, as it facilitates numerous downstream tasks including augmented reality feedback. While current feed-forward neural network-based methods exhibit excellent segmentation performance under ideal conditions, these models have proven susceptible to even minor corruptions, significantly impairing the model's performance. This vulnerability is especially problematic in surgical settings where predictions might be used to inform high-stakes decisions. To better understand model behavior under non-adversarial corruptions, prior work has explored introducing artificial corruptions, like Gaussian noise or contrast perturbation to test set images, to assess model robustness. However, these corruptions are either not photo-realistic or model/task agnostic. Thus, these investigations provide limited insights into model deterioration under realistic surgical corruptions. To address this limitation, we introduce the SegSTRONG-C challenge that aims to promote the development of algorithms robust to unforeseen but plausible image corruptions of surgery, like smoke, bleeding, and low brightness. We collect and release corruption-free mock endoscopic video sequences for the challenge participants to train their algorithms and benchmark them on video sequences with photo-realistic non-adversarial corruptions for a binary robot tool segmentation task. This new benchmark will allow us to carefully study neural network robustness to non-adversarial corruptions of surgery, thus constituting an important first step towards more robust models for surgical computer vision. In this paper, we describe the data collection and annotation protocol, baseline evaluations of established segmentation models, and data augmentation-based techniques to enhance model robustness.

- **Summary**: Attribution maps are one of the most established tools to explain the functioning of computer vision models. They assign importance scores to input features, indicating how relevant each feature is for the prediction of a deep neural network. While much research has gone into proposing new attribution methods, their proper evaluation remains a difficult challenge. In this work, we propose a novel evaluation protocol that overcomes two fundamental limitations of the widely used incremental-deletion protocol, i.e., the out-of-domain issue and lacking inter-model comparisons. This allows us to evaluate 23 attribution methods and how eight different design choices of popular vision models affect their attribution quality. We find that intrinsically explainable models outperform standard models and that raw attribution values exhibit a higher attribution quality than what is known from previous work. Further, we show consistent changes in the attribution quality when varying the network design, indicating that some standard design choices promote attribution quality.

- **Summary**: In quantised autoencoders, images are usually split into local patches, each encoded by one token. This representation is redundant in the sense that the same number of tokens is spend per region, regardless of the visual information content in that region. Adaptive discretisation schemes like quadtrees are applied to allocate tokens for patches with varying sizes, but this just varies the region of influence for a token which nevertheless remains a local descriptor. Modern architectures add an attention mechanism to the autoencoder which infuses some degree of global information into the local tokens. Despite the global context, tokens are still associated with a local image region. In contrast, our method is inspired by spectral decompositions which transform an input signal into a superposition of global frequencies. Taking the data-driven perspective, we learn custom basis functions corresponding to the codebook entries in our VQ-VAE setup. Furthermore, a decoder combines these basis functions in a non-linear fashion, going beyond the simple linear superposition of spectral decompositions. We can achieve this global description with an efficient transpose operation between features and channels and demonstrate our performance on compression.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) represents a significant advancement in computer vision, offering implicit neural network-based scene representation and novel view synthesis capabilities. Its applications span diverse fields including robotics, urban mapping, autonomous navigation, virtual reality/augmented reality, etc., some of which are considered high-risk AI applications. However, despite its widespread adoption, the robustness and security of NeRF remain largely unexplored. In this study, we contribute to this area by introducing the Illusory Poisoning Attack against Neural Radiance Fields (IPA-NeRF). This attack involves embedding a hidden backdoor view into NeRF, allowing it to produce predetermined outputs, i.e. illusory, when presented with the specified backdoor view while maintaining normal performance with standard inputs. Our attack is specifically designed to deceive users or downstream models at a particular position while ensuring that any abnormalities in NeRF remain undetectable from other viewpoints. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our Illusory Poisoning Attack, successfully presenting the desired illusory on the specified viewpoint without impacting other views. Notably, we achieve this attack by introducing small perturbations solely to the training set. The code can be found at https://github.com/jiang-wenxiang/IPA-NeRF.

- **Summary**: This study explores the recently proposed challenging multi-view Anomaly Detection (AD) task. Single-view tasks would encounter blind spots from other perspectives, resulting in inaccuracies in sample-level prediction. Therefore, we introduce the \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{A}nomaly \textbf{D}etection (\textbf{MVAD}) framework, which learns and integrates features from multi-views. Specifically, we proposed a \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{S}election (\textbf{MVAS}) algorithm for feature learning and fusion across multiple views. The feature maps are divided into neighbourhood attention windows to calculate a semantic correlation matrix between single-view windows and all other views, which is a conducted attention mechanism for each single-view window and the top-K most correlated multi-view windows. Adjusting the window sizes and top-K can minimise the computational complexity to linear. Extensive experiments on the Real-IAD dataset for cross-setting (multi/single-class) validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance among sample \textbf{4.1\%}$\uparrow$/ image \textbf{5.6\%}$\uparrow$/pixel \textbf{6.7\%}$\uparrow$ levels with a total of ten metrics with only \textbf{18M} parameters and fewer GPU memory and training time.

- **Summary**: Polysomnography (PSG), the current gold standard method for monitoring and detecting sleep disorders, is cumbersome and costly. At-home testing solutions, known as home sleep apnea testing (HSAT), exist. However, they are contact-based, a feature which limits the ability of some patient populations to tolerate testing and discourages widespread deployment. Previous work on non-contact sleep monitoring for sleep apnea detection either estimates respiratory effort using radar or nasal airflow using a thermal camera, but has not compared the two or used them together. We conducted a study on 10 participants, ages 34 - 78, with suspected sleep disorders using a hardware setup with a synchronized radar and thermal camera. We show the first comparison of radar and thermal imaging for sleep monitoring, and find that our thermal imaging method outperforms radar significantly. Our thermal imaging method detects apneas with an accuracy of 0.99, a precision of 0.68, a recall of 0.74, an F1 score of 0.71, and an intra-class correlation of 0.70; our radar method detects apneas with an accuracy of 0.83, a precision of 0.13, a recall of 0.86, an F1 score of 0.22, and an intra-class correlation of 0.13. We also present a novel proposal for classifying obstructive and central sleep apnea by leveraging a multimodal setup. This method could be used accurately detect and classify apneas during sleep with non-contact sensors, thereby improving diagnostic capacities in patient populations unable to tolerate current technology.

- **Summary**: The need for more transparent face recognition (FR), along with other visual-based decision-making systems has recently attracted more attention in research, society, and industry. The reasons why two face images are matched or not matched by a deep learning-based face recognition system are not obvious due to the high number of parameters and the complexity of the models. However, it is important for users, operators, and developers to ensure trust and accountability of the system and to analyze drawbacks such as biased behavior. While many previous works use spatial semantic maps to highlight the regions that have a significant influence on the decision of the face recognition system, frequency components which are also considered by CNNs, are neglected. In this work, we take a step forward and investigate explainable face recognition in the unexplored frequency domain. This makes this work the first to propose explainability of verification-based decisions in the frequency domain, thus explaining the relative influence of the frequency components of each input toward the obtained outcome. To achieve this, we manipulate face images in the spatial frequency domain and investigate the impact on verification outcomes. In extensive quantitative experiments, along with investigating two special scenarios cases, cross-resolution FR and morphing attacks (the latter in supplementary material), we observe the applicability of our proposed frequency-based explanations.

- **Summary**: Transformers have achieved the state-of-the-art performance on solving the inverse problem of Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) for video, whose ill-posedness is rooted in the mixed degradation of spatial masking and temporal aliasing. However, previous Transformers lack an insight into the degradation and thus have limited performance and efficiency. In this work, we tailor an efficient reconstruction architecture without temporal aggregation in early layers and Hierarchical Separable Video Transformer (HiSViT) as building block. HiSViT is built by multiple groups of Cross-Scale Separable Multi-head Self-Attention (CSS-MSA) and Gated Self-Modulated Feed-Forward Network (GSM-FFN) with dense connections, each of which is conducted within a separate channel portions at a different scale, for multi-scale interactions and long-range modeling. By separating spatial operations from temporal ones, CSS-MSA introduces an inductive bias of paying more attention within frames instead of between frames while saving computational overheads. GSM-FFN further enhances the locality via gated mechanism and factorized spatial-temporal convolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods by $\!>\!0.5$ dB with comparable or fewer parameters and complexity. The source codes and pretrained models are released at https://github.com/pwangcs/HiSViT.

- **Summary**: Stereo matching provides depth estimation from binocular images for downstream applications. These applications mostly take video streams as input and require temporally consistent depth maps. However, existing methods mainly focus on the estimation at the single-frame level. This commonly leads to temporally inconsistent results, especially in ill-posed regions. In this paper, we aim to leverage temporal information to improve the temporal consistency, accuracy, and efficiency of stereo matching. To achieve this, we formulate video stereo matching as a process of temporal disparity completion followed by continuous iterative refinements. Specifically, we first project the disparity of the previous timestamp to the current viewpoint, obtaining a semi-dense disparity map. Then, we complete this map through a disparity completion module to obtain a well-initialized disparity map. The state features from the current completion module and from the past refinement are fused together, providing a temporally coherent state for subsequent refinement. Based on this coherent state, we introduce a dual-space refinement module to iteratively refine the initialized result in both disparity and disparity gradient spaces, improving estimations in ill-posed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively alleviates temporal inconsistency while enhancing both accuracy and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Long-term action anticipation has become an important task for many applications such as autonomous driving and human-robot interaction. Unlike short-term anticipation, predicting more actions into the future imposes a real challenge with the increasing uncertainty in longer horizons. While there has been a significant progress in predicting more actions into the future, most of the proposed methods address the task in a deterministic setup and ignore the underlying uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel Gated Temporal Diffusion (GTD) network that models the uncertainty of both the observation and the future predictions. As generator, we introduce a Gated Anticipation Network (GTAN) to model both observed and unobserved frames of a video in a mutual representation. On the one hand, using a mutual representation for past and future allows us to jointly model ambiguities in the observation and future, while on the other hand GTAN can by design treat the observed and unobserved parts differently and steer the information flow between them. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the Breakfast, Assembly101 and 50Salads datasets in both stochastic and deterministic settings. Code: https://github.com/olga-zats/GTDA .

- **Summary**: This paper introduces Motion-oriented Compositional Neural Radiance Fields (MoCo-NeRF), a framework designed to perform free-viewpoint rendering of monocular human videos via novel non-rigid motion modeling approach. In the context of dynamic clothed humans, complex cloth dynamics generate non-rigid motions that are intrinsically distinct from skeletal articulations and critically important for the rendering quality. The conventional approach models non-rigid motions as spatial (3D) deviations in addition to skeletal transformations. However, it is either time-consuming or challenging to achieve optimal quality due to its high learning complexity without a direct supervision. To target this problem, we propose a novel approach of modeling non-rigid motions as radiance residual fields to benefit from more direct color supervision in the rendering and utilize the rigid radiance fields as a prior to reduce the complexity of the learning process. Our approach utilizes a single multiresolution hash encoding (MHE) to concurrently learn the canonical T-pose representation from rigid skeletal motions and the radiance residual field for non-rigid motions. Additionally, to further improve both training efficiency and usability, we extend MoCo-NeRF to support simultaneous training of multiple subjects within a single framework, thanks to our effective design for modeling non-rigid motions. This scalability is achieved through the integration of a global MHE and learnable identity codes in addition to multiple local MHEs. We present extensive results on ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap, clearly demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both single- and multi-subject settings. The code and model will be made publicly available at the project page: https://stevejaehyeok.github.io/publications/moco-nerf.

- **Summary**: Cities, as the most fundamental environment of human life, encompass diverse physical elements such as buildings, roads and vegetation with complex interconnection. Crafting realistic, interactive 3D urban environments plays a crucial role in constructing AI agents capable of perceiving, decision-making, and acting like humans in real-world environments. However, creating high-fidelity 3D urban environments usually entails extensive manual labor from designers, involving intricate detailing and accurate representation of complex urban features. Therefore, how to accomplish this in an automatical way remains a longstanding challenge. Toward this problem, we propose UrbanWorld, the first generative urban world model that can automatically create a customized, realistic and interactive 3D urban world with flexible control conditions. UrbanWorld incorporates four key stages in the automatical crafting pipeline: 3D layout generation from openly accessible OSM data, urban scene planning and designing with a powerful urban multimodal large language model (Urban MLLM), controllable urban asset rendering with advanced 3D diffusion techniques, and finally the MLLM-assisted scene refinement. The crafted high-fidelity 3D urban environments enable realistic feedback and interactions for general AI and machine perceptual systems in simulations. We are working on contributing UrbanWorld as an open-source and versatile platform for evaluating and improving AI abilities in perception, decision-making, and interaction in realistic urban environments.

- **Summary**: Good weight initialization serves as an effective measure to reduce the training cost of a deep neural network (DNN) model. The choice of how to initialize parameters is challenging and may require manual tuning, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. To overcome such limitations, this work takes a novel step towards building a weight generator to synthesize the neural weights for initialization. We use the image-to-image translation task with generative adversarial networks (GANs) as an example due to the ease of collecting model weights spanning a wide range. Specifically, we first collect a dataset with various image editing concepts and their corresponding trained weights, which are later used for the training of the weight generator. To address the different characteristics among layers and the substantial number of weights to be predicted, we divide the weights into equal-sized blocks and assign each block an index. Subsequently, a diffusion model is trained with such a dataset using both text conditions of the concept and the block indexes. By initializing the image translation model with the denoised weights predicted by our diffusion model, the training requires only 43.3 seconds. Compared to training from scratch (i.e., Pix2pix), we achieve a 15x training time acceleration for a new concept while obtaining even better image generation quality.

- **Summary**: Food segmentation, including in videos, is vital for addressing real-world health, agriculture, and food biotechnology issues. Current limitations lead to inaccurate nutritional analysis, inefficient crop management, and suboptimal food processing, impacting food security and public health. Improving segmentation techniques can enhance dietary assessments, agricultural productivity, and the food production process. This study introduces the development of a robust framework for high-quality, near-real-time segmentation and tracking of food items in videos, using minimal hardware resources. We present FoodMem, a novel framework designed to segment food items from video sequences of 360-degree unbounded scenes. FoodMem can consistently generate masks of food portions in a video sequence, overcoming the limitations of existing semantic segmentation models, such as flickering and prohibitive inference speeds in video processing contexts. To address these issues, FoodMem leverages a two-phase solution: a transformer segmentation phase to create initial segmentation masks and a memory-based tracking phase to monitor food masks in complex scenes. Our framework outperforms current state-of-the-art food segmentation models, yielding superior performance across various conditions, such as camera angles, lighting, reflections, scene complexity, and food diversity. This results in reduced segmentation noise, elimination of artifacts, and completion of missing segments. Here, we also introduce a new annotated food dataset encompassing challenging scenarios absent in previous benchmarks. Extensive experiments conducted on Nutrition5k and Vegetables & Fruits datasets demonstrate that FoodMem enhances the state-of-the-art by 2.5% mean average precision in food video segmentation and is 58 x faster on average.

- **Summary**: Given a model trained on source data, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enables adaptation and inference in test data streams with domain shifts from the source. Current methods predominantly optimize the model for each incoming test data batch using self-training loss. While these methods yield commendable results in ideal test data streams, where batches are independently and identically sampled from the target distribution, they falter under more practical test data streams that are not independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.). The data batches in a non-i.i.d. stream display prominent label shifts relative to each other. It leads to conflicting optimization objectives among batches during the TTA process. Given the inherent risks of adapting the source model to unpredictable test-time distributions, we reverse the adaptation process and propose a novel Distribution Alignment loss for TTA. This loss guides the distributions of test-time features back towards the source distributions, which ensures compatibility with the well-trained source model and eliminates the pitfalls associated with conflicting optimization objectives. Moreover, we devise a domain shift detection mechanism to extend the success of our proposed TTA method in the continual domain shift scenarios. Our extensive experiments validate the logic and efficacy of our method. On six benchmark datasets, we surpass existing methods in non-i.i.d. scenarios and maintain competitive performance under the ideal i.i.d. assumption.

- **Summary**: This work presents a novel approach to monocular 6D pose estimation of surgical instruments in open surgery, addressing challenges such as object articulations, symmetries, occlusions, and lack of annotated real-world data. The method leverages synthetic data generation and domain adaptation techniques to overcome these obstacles. The proposed approach consists of three main components: (1) synthetic data generation using 3D modeling of surgical tools with articulation rigging and physically-based rendering; (2) a tailored pose estimation framework combining object detection with pose estimation and a hybrid geometric fusion strategy; and (3) a training strategy that utilizes both synthetic and real unannotated data, employing domain adaptation on real video data using automatically generated pseudo-labels. Evaluations conducted on videos of open surgery demonstrate the good performance and real-world applicability of the proposed method, highlighting its potential for integration into medical augmented reality and robotic systems. The approach eliminates the need for extensive manual annotation of real surgical data.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image generative models have recently attracted considerable interest, enabling the synthesis of high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these models often lack the capability to generate specific subjects from given reference images or to synthesize novel renditions under varying conditions. Methods like DreamBooth and Subject-driven Text-to-Image (SuTI) have made significant progress in this area. Yet, both approaches primarily focus on enhancing similarity to reference images and require expensive setups, often overlooking the need for efficient training and avoiding overfitting to the reference images. In this work, we present the $\lambda$-Harmonic reward function, which provides a reliable reward signal and enables early stopping for faster training and effective regularization. By combining the Bradley-Terry preference model, the $\lambda$-Harmonic reward function also provides preference labels for subject-driven generation tasks. We propose Reward Preference Optimization (RPO), which offers a simpler setup (requiring only $3\%$ of the negative samples used by DreamBooth) and fewer gradient steps for fine-tuning. Unlike most existing methods, our approach does not require training a text encoder or optimizing text embeddings and achieves text-image alignment by fine-tuning only the U-Net component. Empirically, $\lambda$-Harmonic proves to be a reliable approach for model selection in subject-driven generation tasks. Based on preference labels and early stopping validation from the $\lambda$-Harmonic reward function, our algorithm achieves a state-of-the-art CLIP-I score of 0.833 and a CLIP-T score of 0.314 on DreamBench.

- **Summary**: Generative diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for high-quality image synthesis, yet their iterative nature demands significant computational resources. This paper proposes an efficient time step sampling method based on an image spectral analysis of the diffusion process, aimed at optimizing the denoising process. Instead of the traditional uniform distribution-based time step sampling, we introduce a Beta distribution-like sampling technique that prioritizes critical steps in the early and late stages of the process. Our hypothesis is that certain steps exhibit significant changes in image content, while others contribute minimally. We validated our approach using Fourier transforms to measure frequency response changes at each step, revealing substantial low-frequency changes early on and high-frequency adjustments later. Experiments with ADM and Stable Diffusion demonstrated that our Beta Sampling method consistently outperforms uniform sampling, achieving better FID and IS scores, and offers competitive efficiency relative to state-of-the-art methods like AutoDiffusion. This work provides a practical framework for enhancing diffusion model efficiency by focusing computational resources on the most impactful steps, with potential for further optimization and broader application.

- **Summary**: This study investigates the relationship between deep learning (DL) image reconstruction quality and anomaly detection performance, and evaluates the efficacy of an artificial intelligence (AI) assistant in enhancing radiologists' interpretation of meniscal anomalies on reconstructed images. A retrospective study was conducted using an in-house reconstruction and anomaly detection pipeline to assess knee MR images from 896 patients. The original and 14 sets of DL-reconstructed images were evaluated using standard reconstruction and object detection metrics, alongside newly developed box-based reconstruction metrics. Two clinical radiologists reviewed a subset of 50 patients' images, both original and AI-assisted reconstructed, with subsequent assessment of their accuracy and performance characteristics. Results indicated that the structural similarity index (SSIM) showed a weaker correlation with anomaly detection metrics (mAP, r=0.64, p=0.01; F1 score, r=0.38, p=0.18), while box-based SSIM had a stronger association with detection performance (mAP, r=0.81, p<0.01; F1 score, r=0.65, p=0.01). Minor SSIM fluctuations did not affect detection outcomes, but significant changes reduced performance. Radiologists' AI-assisted evaluations demonstrated improved accuracy (86.0% without assistance vs. 88.3% with assistance, p<0.05) and interrater agreement (Cohen's kappa, 0.39 without assistance vs. 0.57 with assistance). An additional review led to the incorporation of 17 more lesions into the dataset. The proposed anomaly detection method shows promise in evaluating reconstruction algorithms for automated tasks and aiding radiologists in interpreting DL-reconstructed MR images.

- **Summary**: Continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) learns a series of tasks sequentially on the unlabeled data. Two main challenges of continual learning are catastrophic forgetting and task confusion. While CSSL problem has been studied to address the catastrophic forgetting challenge, little work has been done to address the task confusion aspect. In this work, we show through extensive experiments that self-supervised learning (SSL) can make CSSL more susceptible to the task confusion problem, particularly in less diverse settings of class incremental learning because different classes belonging to different tasks are not trained concurrently. Motivated by this challenge, we present a novel cross-model feature Mixup (CroMo-Mixup) framework that addresses this issue through two key components: 1) Cross-Task data Mixup, which mixes samples across tasks to enhance negative sample diversity; and 2) Cross-Model feature Mixup, which learns similarities between embeddings obtained from current and old models of the mixed sample and the original images, facilitating cross-task class contrast learning and old knowledge retrieval. We evaluate the effectiveness of CroMo-Mixup to improve both Task-ID prediction and average linear accuracy across all tasks on three datasets, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and tinyImageNet under different class-incremental learning settings. We validate the compatibility of CroMo-Mixup on four state-of-the-art SSL objectives. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/ErumMushtaq/CroMo-Mixup}.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art approaches for 6D object pose estimation assume the availability of CAD models and require the user to manually set up physically-based rendering (PBR) pipelines for synthetic training data generation. Both factors limit the application of these methods in real-world scenarios. In this work, we present a pipeline that does not require CAD models and allows training a state-of-the-art pose estimator requiring only a small set of real images as input. Our method is based on a NeuS2 object representation, that we learn through a semi-automated procedure based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and object-agnostic segmentation. We exploit the novel-view synthesis ability of NeuS2 and simple cut-and-paste augmentation to automatically generate photorealistic object renderings, which we use to train the correspondence-based SurfEmb pose estimator. We evaluate our method on the LINEMOD-Occlusion dataset, extensively studying the impact of its individual components and showing competitive performance with respect to approaches based on CAD models and PBR data. We additionally demonstrate the ease of use and effectiveness of our pipeline on self-collected real-world objects, showing that our method outperforms state-of-the-art CAD-model-free approaches, with better accuracy and robustness to mild occlusions. To allow the robotics community to benefit from this system, we will publicly release it at https://www.github.com/ethz-asl/neusurfemb.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a machine learning approach where the data itself provides supervision, eliminating the need for external labels. The model is forced to learn about the data structure or context by solving a pretext task. With SSL, models can learn from abundant and cheap unlabeled data, significantly reducing the cost of training models where labels are expensive or inaccessible. In Computer Vision, SSL is widely used as pre-training followed by a downstream task, such as supervised transfer, few-shot learning on smaller labeled data sets, and/or unsupervised clustering. Unfortunately, it is infeasible to evaluate SSL methods on all possible downstream tasks and objectively measure the quality of the learned representation. Instead, SSL methods are evaluated using in-domain evaluation protocols, such as fine-tuning, linear probing, and k-nearest neighbors (kNN). However, it is not well understood how well these evaluation protocols estimate the representation quality of a pre-trained model for different downstream tasks under different conditions, such as dataset, metric, and model architecture. We study how classification-based evaluation protocols for SSL correlate and how well they predict downstream performance on different dataset types. Our study includes eleven common image datasets and 26 models that were pre-trained with different SSL methods or have different model backbones. We find that in-domain linear/kNN probing protocols are, on average, the best general predictors for out-of-domain performance. We further investigate the importance of batch normalization and evaluate how robust correlations are for different kinds of dataset domain shifts. We challenge assumptions about the relationship between discriminative and generative self-supervised methods, finding that most of their performance differences can be explained by changes to model backbones.

- **Summary**: With the rise of digital media content production, the need for analyzing movies and TV series episodes to locate the main cast of characters precisely is gaining importance.Specifically, Video Face Clustering aims to group together detected video face tracks with common facial identities. This problem is very challenging due to the large range of pose, expression, appearance, and lighting variations of a given face across video frames. Generic pre-trained Face Identification (ID) models fail to adapt well to the video production domain, given its high dynamic range content and also unique cinematic style. Furthermore, traditional clustering algorithms depend on hyperparameters requiring individual tuning across datasets. In this paper, we present a novel video face clustering approach that learns to adapt a generic face ID model to new video face tracks in a fully self-supervised fashion. We also propose a parameter-free clustering algorithm that is capable of automatically adapting to the finetuned model's embedding space for any input video. Due to the lack of comprehensive movie face clustering benchmarks, we also present a first-of-kind movie dataset: MovieFaceCluster. Our dataset is handpicked by film industry professionals and contains extremely challenging face ID scenarios. Experiments show our method's effectiveness in handling difficult mainstream movie scenes on our benchmark dataset and state-of-the-art performance on traditional TV series datasets.

- **Summary**: We propose and demonstrate an alternating Fourier and image domain filtering approach for feature extraction as an efficient alternative to build a vision backbone without using the computationally intensive attention. The performance among the lightweight models reaches the state-of-the-art level on ImageNet-1K classification, and improves downstream tasks on object detection and segmentation consistently as well. Our approach also serves as a new tool to compress vision transformers (ViTs).
