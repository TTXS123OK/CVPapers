- **Summary**: In appearance-based localization and mapping, loop closure detection is the process used to determinate if the current observation comes from a previously visited location or a new one. As the size of the internal map increases, so does the time required to compare new observations with all stored locations, eventually limiting online processing. This paper presents an online loop closure detection approach for large-scale and long-term operation. The approach is based on a memory management method, which limits the number of locations used for loop closure detection so that the computation time remains under real-time constraints. The idea consists of keeping the most recent and frequently observed locations in a Working Memory (WM) used for loop closure detection, and transferring the others into a Long-Term Memory (LTM). When a match is found between the current location and one stored in WM, associated locations stored in LTM can be updated and remembered for additional loop closure detections. Results demonstrate the approach's adaptability and scalability using ten standard data sets from other appearance-based loop closure approaches, one custom data set using real images taken over a 2 km loop of our university campus, and one custom data set (7 hours) using virtual images from the racing video game ``Need for Speed: Most Wanted''.

- **Summary**: Histopathological image classification constitutes a pivotal task in computer-aided diagnostics. The precise identification and categorization of histopathological images are of paramount significance for early disease detection and treatment. In the diagnostic process of pathologists, a multi-tiered approach is typically employed to assess abnormalities in cell regions at different magnifications. However, feature extraction is often performed at a single granularity, overlooking the multi-granular characteristics of cells. To address this issue, we propose the Fuzzy-guided Multi-granularity Deep Neural Network (FMDNN). Inspired by the multi-granular diagnostic approach of pathologists, we perform feature extraction on cell structures at coarse, medium, and fine granularity, enabling the model to fully harness the information in histopathological images. We incorporate the theory of fuzzy logic to address the challenge of redundant key information arising during multi-granular feature extraction. Cell features are described from different perspectives using multiple fuzzy membership functions, which are fused to create universal fuzzy features. A fuzzy-guided cross-attention module guides universal fuzzy features toward multi-granular features. We propagate these features through an encoder to all patch tokens, aiming to achieve enhanced classification accuracy and robustness. In experiments on multiple public datasets, our model exhibits a significant improvement in accuracy over commonly used classification methods for histopathological image classification and shows commendable interpretability.

- **Summary**: We present Open-CD, a change detection toolbox that contains a rich set of change detection methods as well as related components and modules. The toolbox started from a series of open source general vision task tools, including OpenMMLab Toolkits, PyTorch Image Models, etc. It gradually evolves into a unified platform that covers many popular change detection methods and contemporary modules. It not only includes training and inference codes, but also provides some useful scripts for data analysis. We believe this toolbox is by far the most complete change detection toolbox. In this report, we introduce the various features, supported methods and applications of Open-CD. In addition, we also conduct a benchmarking study on different methods and components. We wish that the toolbox and benchmark could serve the growing research community by providing a flexible toolkit to reimplement existing methods and develop their own new change detectors. Code and models are available at \url{https://github.com/likyoo/open-cd}. Pioneeringly, this report also includes brief descriptions of the algorithms supported in Open-CD, mainly contributed by their authors. We sincerely encourage researchers in this field to participate in this project and work together to create a more open community. This toolkit and report will be kept updated.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral image (HI) analysis approaches have recently become increasingly complex and sophisticated. Recently, the combination of spectral-spatial information and superpixel techniques have addressed some hyperspectral data issues, such as the higher spatial variability of spectral signatures and dimensionality of the data. However, most existing superpixel approaches do not account for specific HI characteristics resulting from its high spectral dimension. In this work, we propose a multiscale superpixel method that is computationally efficient for processing hyperspectral data. The Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) oversegmentation algorithm, on which the technique is based, has been extended hierarchically. Using a novel robust homogeneity testing, the proposed hierarchical approach leads to superpixels of variable sizes but with higher spectral homogeneity when compared to the classical SLIC segmentation. For validation, the proposed homogeneity-based hierarchical method was applied as a preprocessing step in the spectral unmixing and classification tasks carried out using, respectively, the Multiscale sparse Unmixing Algorithm (MUA) and the CNN-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (CEGCN) methods. Simulation results with both synthetic and real data show that the technique is competitive with state-of-the-art solutions.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models, known for their tremendous ability to generate novel and high-quality samples, have recently raised concerns due to their data memorization behavior, which poses privacy risks. Recent approaches for memory mitigation either only focused on the text modality problem in cross-modal generation tasks or utilized data augmentation strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework for diffusion models from the perspective of visual modality, which is more generic and fundamental for mitigating memorization. To facilitate ``forgetting'' of stored information in diffusion model parameters, we propose an iterative ensemble training strategy by splitting the data into multiple shards for training multiple models and intermittently aggregating these model parameters. Moreover, practical analysis of losses illustrates that the training loss for easily memorable images tends to be obviously lower. Thus, we propose an anti-gradient control method to exclude the sample with a lower loss value from the current mini-batch to avoid memorizing. Extensive experiments and analysis on \crnote{four} datasets are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method, and results show that our method successfully reduces memory capacity while even improving the performance slightly. Moreover, to save the computing cost, we successfully apply our method to fine-tune the well-trained diffusion models by limited epochs, demonstrating the applicability of our method.

- **Summary**: This paper presents the Multi-scale Disparity Transformer (MDT), a novel Transformer tailored for light field image super-resolution (LFSR) that addresses the issues of computational redundancy and disparity entanglement caused by the indiscriminate processing of sub-aperture images inherent in conventional methods. MDT features a multi-branch structure, with each branch utilising independent disparity self-attention (DSA) to target specific disparity ranges, effectively reducing computational complexity and disentangling disparities. Building on this architecture, we present LF-MDTNet, an efficient LFSR network. Experimental results demonstrate that LF-MDTNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 0.37 dB and 0.41 dB PSNR at the 2x and 4x scales, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters and higher speed.

- **Summary**: Camera and LiDAR serve as informative sensors for accurate and robust autonomous driving systems. However, these sensors often exhibit heterogeneous natures, resulting in distributional modality gaps that present significant challenges for fusion. To address this, a robust fusion technique is crucial, particularly for enhancing 3D object detection. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic adjustment technology aimed at aligning modal distributions and learning effective modality representations to enhance the fusion process. Specifically, we propose a triphase domain aligning module. This module adjusts the feature distributions from both the camera and LiDAR, bringing them closer to the ground truth domain and minimizing differences. Additionally, we explore improved representation acquisition methods for dynamic fusion, which includes modal interaction and specialty enhancement. Finally, an adaptive learning technique that merges the semantics and geometry information for dynamical instance optimization. Extensive experiments in the nuScenes dataset present competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches. Our code will be released in the future.

- **Summary**: Thermal imaging has a variety of applications, from agricultural monitoring to building inspection to imaging under poor visibility, such as in low light, fog, and rain. However, reconstructing thermal scenes in 3D presents several challenges due to the comparatively lower resolution and limited features present in long-wave infrared (LWIR) images. To overcome these challenges, we propose a unified framework for scene reconstruction from a set of LWIR and RGB images, using a multispectral radiance field to represent a scene viewed by both visible and infrared cameras, thus leveraging information across both spectra. We calibrate the RGB and infrared cameras with respect to each other, as a preprocessing step using a simple calibration target. We demonstrate our method on real-world sets of RGB and LWIR photographs captured from a handheld thermal camera, showing the effectiveness of our method at scene representation across the visible and infrared spectra. We show that our method is capable of thermal super-resolution, as well as visually removing obstacles to reveal objects that are occluded in either the RGB or thermal channels.

- **Summary**: Deep learning provides powerful methods to impute structured information from large-scale, unstructured text and image datasets. For example, economists might wish to detect the presence of economic activity in satellite images, or to measure the topics or entities mentioned in social media, the congressional record, or firm filings. This review introduces deep neural networks, covering methods such as classifiers, regression models, generative AI, and embedding models. Applications include classification, document digitization, record linkage, and methods for data exploration in massive scale text and image corpora. When suitable methods are used, deep learning models can be cheap to tune and can scale affordably to problems involving millions or billions of data points.. The review is accompanied by a companion website, EconDL, with user-friendly demo notebooks, software resources, and a knowledge base that provides technical details and additional applications.

- **Summary**: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires both image and world knowledge to answer questions. Current methods first retrieve knowledge from the image and external knowledge base with the original complex question, then generate answers with Large Language Models (LLMs). However, since the original question contains complex elements that require knowledge from different sources, acquiring different kinds of knowledge in a coupled manner may confuse models and hinder them from retrieving precise knowledge. Furthermore, the ``forward-only'' answering process fails to explicitly capture the knowledge needs of LLMs, which can further hurt answering quality. To cope with the above limitations, we propose DKA: Disentangled Knowledge Acquisition from LLM feedback, a training-free framework that disentangles knowledge acquisition to avoid confusion and uses LLM's feedback to specify the required knowledge. Specifically, DKA requires LLMs to specify what knowledge they need to answer the question and decompose the original complex question into two simple sub-questions: Image-based sub-question and Knowledge-based sub-question. Then we use the two sub-questions to retrieve knowledge from the image and knowledge base, respectively. In this way, two knowledge acquisition models can focus on the content that corresponds to them and avoid disturbance of irrelevant elements in the original complex question, which can help to provide more precise knowledge and better align the knowledge needs of LLMs to yield correct answers. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that DKA significantly outperforms SOTA models. To facilitate future research, our data and code are available at \url{https://github.com/Lackel/DKA}.

- **Summary**: Topology reasoning aims to provide a precise understanding of road scenes, enabling autonomous systems to identify safe and efficient routes. In this paper, we present RoadPainter, an innovative approach for detecting and reasoning the topology of lane centerlines using multi-view images. The core concept behind RoadPainter is to extract a set of points from each centerline mask to improve the accuracy of centerline prediction. We start by implementing a transformer decoder that integrates a hybrid attention mechanism and a real-virtual separation strategy to predict coarse lane centerlines and establish topological associations. Then, we generate centerline instance masks guided by the centerline points from the transformer decoder. Moreover, we derive an additional set of points from each mask and combine them with previously detected centerline points for further refinement. Additionally, we introduce an optional module that incorporates a Standard Definition (SD) map to further optimize centerline detection and enhance topological reasoning performance. Experimental evaluations on the OpenLane-V2 dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of RoadPainter.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the challenge of fine-grained video event understanding in traffic scenarios, vital for autonomous driving and safety. Traditional datasets focus on driver or vehicle behavior, often neglecting pedestrian perspectives. To fill this gap, we introduce the WTS dataset, highlighting detailed behaviors of both vehicles and pedestrians across over 1.2k video events in hundreds of traffic scenarios. WTS integrates diverse perspectives from vehicle ego and fixed overhead cameras in a vehicle-infrastructure cooperative environment, enriched with comprehensive textual descriptions and unique 3D Gaze data for a synchronized 2D/3D view, focusing on pedestrian analysis. We also pro-vide annotations for 5k publicly sourced pedestrian-related traffic videos. Additionally, we introduce LLMScorer, an LLM-based evaluation metric to align inference captions with ground truth. Using WTS, we establish a benchmark for dense video-to-text tasks, exploring state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models with an instance-aware VideoLLM method as a baseline. WTS aims to advance fine-grained video event understanding, enhancing traffic safety and autonomous driving development.

- **Summary**: The Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation is a critical factor that directly impacts the 3D object detection performance, but the traditional BEV grid representation induces quadratic computational cost as the spatial resolution grows. To address this limitation, we present a new camera-based 3D object detector with high-resolution vector representation: VectorFormer. The presented high-resolution vector representation is combined with the lower-resolution BEV representation to efficiently exploit 3D geometry from multi-camera images at a high resolution through our two novel modules: vector scattering and gathering. To this end, the learned vector representation with richer scene contexts can serve as the decoding query for final predictions. We conduct extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in NDS and inference time. Furthermore, we investigate query-BEV-based methods incorporated with our proposed vector representation and observe a consistent performance improvement.

- **Summary**: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has gained increasing popularity as a data representation method, serving as a prerequisite for innovative generation models. Unlike gradient-based methods, which exhibit lower efficiency in inference, the adoption of hyper-network for generating parameters in Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), responsible for executing INR functions, has surfaced as a promising and efficient alternative. However, as a global continuous function, MLP is challenging in modeling highly discontinuous signals, resulting in slow convergence during the training phase and inaccurate reconstruction performance. Moreover, MLP requires massive representation parameters, which implies inefficiencies in data representation. In this paper, we propose a novel Attention-based Localized INR (ANR) composed of a localized attention layer (LAL) and a global MLP that integrates coordinate features with data features and converts them to meaningful outputs. Subsequently, we design an instance representation framework that delivers a transformer-like hyper-network to represent data instances as a compact representation vector. With instance-specific representation vector and instance-agnostic ANR parameters, the target signals are well reconstructed as a continuous function. We further address aliasing artifacts with variational coordinates when obtaining the super-resolution inference results. Extensive experimentation across four datasets showcases the notable efficacy of our ANR method, e.g. enhancing the PSNR value from 37.95dB to 47.25dB on the CelebA dataset.

- **Summary**: Rapid and accurate diagnosis of pneumothorax, utilizing chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT), is crucial for assisted diagnosis. Chest X-ray is commonly used for initial localization of pneumothorax, while CT ensures accurate quantification. However, CT scans involve high radiation doses and can be costly. To achieve precise quantitative diagnosis while minimizing radiation exposure, we proposed X-Recon, a CT ultra-sparse reconstruction network based on ortho-lateral chest X-ray images. X-Recon integrates generative adversarial networks (GANs), including a generator with a multi-scale fusion rendering module and a discriminator enhanced by 3D coordinate convolutional layers, designed to facilitate CT reconstruction. To improve precision, a projective spatial transformer is utilized to incorporate multi-angle projection loss. Additionally, we proposed PTX-Seg, a zero-shot pneumothorax segmentation algorithm, combining image processing techniques with deep-learning models for the segmentation of air-accumulated regions and lung structures. Experiments on a large-scale dataset demonstrate its superiority over existing approaches. X-Recon achieved a significantly higher reconstruction resolution with a higher average spatial resolution and a lower average slice thickness. The reconstruction metrics achieved state-of-the-art performance in terms of several metrics including peak signal-to-noise ratio. The zero-shot segmentation algorithm, PTX-Seg, also demonstrated high segmentation precision for the air-accumulated region, the left lung, and the right lung. Moreover, the consistency analysis for the pneumothorax chest occupancy ratio between reconstructed CT and original CT obtained a high correlation coefficient.

- **Summary**: Remarkable strides in computational pathology have been made in the task-agnostic foundation model that advances the performance of a wide array of downstream clinical tasks. Despite the promising performance, there are still several challenges. First, prior works have resorted to either vision-only or vision-captions data, disregarding invaluable pathology reports and gene expression profiles which respectively offer distinct knowledge for versatile clinical applications. Second, the current progress in pathology FMs predominantly concentrates on the patch level, where the restricted context of patch-level pretraining fails to capture whole-slide patterns. Here we curated the largest multimodal dataset consisting of H\&E diagnostic whole slide images and their associated pathology reports and RNA-Seq data, resulting in 26,169 slide-level modality pairs from 10,275 patients across 32 cancer types. To leverage these data for CPath, we propose a novel whole-slide pretraining paradigm which injects multimodal knowledge at the whole-slide context into the pathology FM, called Multimodal Self-TAught PRetraining (mSTAR). The proposed paradigm revolutionizes the workflow of pretraining for CPath, which enables the pathology FM to acquire the whole-slide context. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate multimodal knowledge at the slide level for enhancing pathology FMs, expanding the modelling context from unimodal to multimodal knowledge and from patch-level to slide-level. To systematically evaluate the capabilities of mSTAR, extensive experiments including slide-level unimodal and multimodal applications, are conducted across 7 diverse types of tasks on 43 subtasks, resulting in the largest spectrum of downstream tasks. The average performance in various slide-level applications consistently demonstrates significant performance enhancements for mSTAR compared to SOTA FMs.

Current tensor decomposition methods emphasize representing small targets with sparsity but struggle to separate targets from complex backgrounds due to insufficient use of intrinsic directional information and reduced target visibility during decomposition. To address these challenges, this study introduces a Sparse Differential Directionality prior (SDD) framework. SDD leverages the distinct directional characteristics of targets to differentiate them from the background, applying mixed sparse constraints on the differential directional images and continuity difference matrix of the temporal component, both derived from Tucker decomposition. We further enhance target detectability with a saliency coherence strategy that intensifies target contrast against the background during hierarchical decomposition. A Proximal Alternating Minimization-based (PAM) algorithm efficiently solves our proposed model. Experimental results on several real-world datasets validate our method's effectiveness, outperforming ten state-of-the-art methods in target detection and clutter suppression.

- **Summary**: This study proposes a neural disparity field (NDF) that establishes an implicit, continuous representation of scene disparity based on a neural field and an iterative approach to address the inverse problem of NDF reconstruction from light-field data. NDF enables seamless and precise characterization of disparity variations in three-dimensional scenes and can discretize disparity at any arbitrary resolution, overcoming the limitations of traditional disparity maps that are prone to sampling errors and interpolation inaccuracies. The proposed NDF network architecture utilizes hash encoding combined with multilayer perceptrons to capture detailed disparities in texture levels, thereby enhancing its ability to represent the geometric information of complex scenes. By leveraging the spatial-angular consistency inherent in light-field data, a differentiable forward model to generate a central view image from the light-field data is developed. Based on the forward model, an optimization scheme for the inverse problem of NDF reconstruction using differentiable propagation operators is established. Furthermore, an iterative solution method is adopted to reconstruct the NDF in the optimization scheme, which does not require training datasets and applies to light-field data captured by various acquisition methods. Experimental results demonstrate that high-quality NDF can be reconstructed from light-field data using the proposed method. High-resolution disparity can be effectively recovered by NDF, demonstrating its capability for the implicit, continuous representation of scene disparities.

- **Summary**: This paper aims to adapt the source model to the target environment, leveraging small user feedback (i.e., labeled target data) readily available in real-world applications. We find that existing semi-supervised domain adaptation (SemiSDA) methods often suffer from poorly improved adaptation performance when directly utilizing such feedback data, as shown in Figure 1. We analyze this phenomenon via a novel concept called Negatively Biased Feedback (NBF), which stems from the observation that user feedback is more likely for data points where the model produces incorrect predictions. To leverage this feedback while avoiding the issue, we propose a scalable adapting approach, Retrieval Latent Defending. This approach helps existing SemiSDA methods to adapt the model with a balanced supervised signal by utilizing latent defending samples throughout the adaptation process. We demonstrate the problem caused by NBF and the efficacy of our approach across various benchmarks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, and a real-world medical imaging application. Our extensive experiments reveal that integrating our approach with multiple state-of-the-art SemiSDA methods leads to significant performance improvements.

- **Summary**: Adversarial training (AT) can help improve the robustness of Vision Transformers (ViT) against adversarial attacks by intentionally injecting adversarial examples into the training data. However, this way of adversarial injection inevitably incurs standard accuracy degradation to some extent, thereby calling for a trade-off between standard accuracy and robustness. Besides, the prominent AT solutions are still vulnerable to adaptive attacks. To tackle such shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel ViT architecture, including a detector and a classifier bridged by our newly developed adaptive ensemble. Specifically, we empirically discover that detecting adversarial examples can benefit from the Guided Backpropagation technique. Driven by this discovery, a novel Multi-head Self-Attention (MSA) mechanism is introduced to enhance our detector to sniff adversarial examples. Then, a classifier with two encoders is employed for extracting visual representations respectively from clean images and adversarial examples, with our adaptive ensemble to adaptively adjust the proportion of visual representations from the two encoders for accurate classification. This design enables our ViT architecture to achieve a better trade-off between standard accuracy and robustness. Besides, our adaptive ensemble technique allows us to mask off a random subset of image patches within input data, boosting our ViT's robustness against adaptive attacks, while maintaining high standard accuracy. Experimental results exhibit that our ViT architecture, on CIFAR-10, achieves the best standard accuracy and adversarial robustness of 90.3% and 49.8%, respectively.

- **Summary**: The scene graph generation (SGG) task involves detecting objects within an image and predicting predicates that represent the relationships between the objects. However, in SGG benchmark datasets, each subject-object pair is annotated with a single predicate even though a single predicate may exhibit diverse semantics (i.e., semantic diversity), existing SGG models are trained to predict the one and only predicate for each pair. This in turn results in the SGG models to overlook the semantic diversity that may exist in a predicate, thus leading to biased predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel model-agnostic Semantic Diversity-aware Prototype-based Learning (DPL) framework that enables unbiased predictions based on the understanding of the semantic diversity of predicates. Specifically, DPL learns the regions in the semantic space covered by each predicate to distinguish among the various different semantics that a single predicate can represent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model-agnostic DPL framework brings significant performance improvement on existing SGG models, and also effectively understands the semantic diversity of predicates.

- **Summary**: Understanding knowledge mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for advancing towards trustworthy AGI. This paper reviews knowledge mechanism analysis from a novel taxonomy including knowledge utilization and evolution. Knowledge utilization delves into the mechanism of memorization, comprehension and application, and creation. Knowledge evolution focuses on the dynamic progression of knowledge within individual and group LLMs. Moreover, we discuss what knowledge LLMs have learned, the reasons for the fragility of parametric knowledge, and the potential dark knowledge (hypothesis) that will be challenging to address. We hope this work can help understand knowledge in LLMs and provide insights for future research.

- **Summary**: With the release of large-scale motion datasets with textual annotations, the task of establishing a robust latent space for language and 3D human motion has recently witnessed a surge of interest. Methods have been proposed to convert human motion and texts into features to achieve accurate correspondence between them. Despite these efforts to align language and motion representations, we claim that the temporal element is often overlooked, especially for compound actions, resulting in chronological inaccuracies. To shed light on the temporal alignment in motion-language latent spaces, we propose Chronologically Accurate Retrieval (CAR) to evaluate the chronological understanding of the models. We decompose textual descriptions into events, and prepare negative text samples by shuffling the order of events in compound action descriptions. We then design a simple task for motion-language models to retrieve the more likely text from the ground truth and its chronologically shuffled version. CAR reveals many cases where current motion-language models fail to distinguish the event chronology of human motion, despite their impressive performance in terms of conventional evaluation metrics. To achieve better temporal alignment between text and motion, we further propose to use these texts with shuffled sequence of events as negative samples during training to reinforce the motion-language models. We conduct experiments on text-motion retrieval and text-to-motion generation using the reinforced motion-language models, which demonstrate improved performance over conventional approaches, indicating the necessity to consider temporal elements in motion-language alignment.

- **Summary**: We introduce LocoTrack, a highly accurate and efficient model designed for the task of tracking any point (TAP) across video sequences. Previous approaches in this task often rely on local 2D correlation maps to establish correspondences from a point in the query image to a local region in the target image, which often struggle with homogeneous regions or repetitive features, leading to matching ambiguities. LocoTrack overcomes this challenge with a novel approach that utilizes all-pair correspondences across regions, i.e., local 4D correlation, to establish precise correspondences, with bidirectional correspondence and matching smoothness significantly enhancing robustness against ambiguities. We also incorporate a lightweight correlation encoder to enhance computational efficiency, and a compact Transformer architecture to integrate long-term temporal information. LocoTrack achieves unmatched accuracy on all TAP-Vid benchmarks and operates at a speed almost 6 times faster than the current state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: With the widespread deployment of video surveillance devices and the demand for intelligent system development, video anomaly detection (VAD) has become an important part of constructing intelligent surveillance systems. Expanding the discriminative boundary between normal and abnormal events to enhance performance is the common goal and challenge of VAD. To address this problem, we propose a Bidirectional Skip-frame Prediction (BiSP) network based on a dual-stream autoencoder, from the perspective of learning the intra-domain disparity between different features. The BiSP skips frames in the training phase to achieve the forward and backward frame prediction respectively, and in the testing phase, it utilizes bidirectional consecutive frames to co-predict the same intermediate frames, thus expanding the degree of disparity between normal and abnormal events. The BiSP designs the variance channel attention and context spatial attention from the perspectives of movement patterns and object scales, respectively, thus ensuring the maximization of the disparity between normal and abnormal in the feature extraction and delivery with different dimensions. Extensive experiments from four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BiSP, which substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods.

- **Summary**: With the rapid growth of the PCB manufacturing industry, there is an increasing demand for computer vision inspection to detect defects during production. Improving the accuracy and generalization of PCB defect detection models remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a high-precision, robust, and real-time end-to-end method for PCB defect detection based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Traditional methods often suffer from low accuracy and limited applicability. We propose a novel approach combining YOLOv5 and multiscale modules for hierarchical residual-like connections. In PCB defect detection, noise can confuse the background and small targets. The YOLOv5 model provides a strong foundation with its real-time processing and accurate object detection capabilities. The multi-scale module extends traditional approaches by incorporating hierarchical residual-like connections within a single block, enabling multiscale feature extraction. This plug-and-play module significantly enhances performance by extracting features at multiple scales and levels, which are useful for identifying defects of varying sizes and complexities. Our multi-scale architecture integrates feature extraction, defect localization, and classification into a unified network. Experiments on a large-scale PCB dataset demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score compared to existing methods. This work advances computer vision inspection for PCB defect detection, providing a reliable solution for high-precision, robust, real-time, and domain-adaptive defect detection in the PCB manufacturing industry.

- **Summary**: Continual semantic segmentation (CSS) based on incremental learning (IL) is a great endeavour in developing human-like segmentation models. However, current CSS approaches encounter challenges in the trade-off between preserving old knowledge and learning new ones, where they still need large-scale annotated data for incremental training and lack interpretability. In this paper, we present Learning at a Glance (LAG), an efficient, robust, human-like and interpretable approach for CSS. Specifically, LAG is a simple and model-agnostic architecture, yet it achieves competitive CSS efficiency with limited incremental data. Inspired by human-like recognition patterns, we propose a semantic-invariance modelling approach via semantic features decoupling that simultaneously reconciles solid knowledge inheritance and new-term learning. Concretely, the proposed decoupling manner includes two ways, i.e., channel-wise decoupling and spatial-level neuron-relevant semantic consistency. Our approach preserves semantic-invariant knowledge as solid prototypes to alleviate catastrophic forgetting, while also constraining sample-specific contents through an asymmetric contrastive learning method to enhance model robustness during IL steps. Experimental results in multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we introduce a novel CSS protocol that better reflects realistic data-limited CSS settings, and LAG achieves superior performance under multiple data-limited conditions.

- **Summary**: The photorealistic reconstruction and rendering of architectural scenes have extensive applications in industries such as film, games, and transportation. It also plays an important role in urban planning, architectural design, and the city's promotion, especially in protecting historical and cultural relics. The 3D Gaussian Splatting, due to better performance over NeRF, has become a mainstream technology in 3D reconstruction. Its only input is a set of images but it relies heavily on geometric parameters computed by the SfM process. At the same time, there is an existing abundance of raw 3D models, that could inform the structural perception of certain buildings but cannot be applied. In this paper, we propose a straightforward method to harness these raw 3D models to guide 3D Gaussians in capturing the basic shape of the building and improve the visual quality of textures and details when photos are captured non-systematically. This exploration opens up new possibilities for improving the effectiveness of 3D reconstruction techniques in the field of architectural design.

- **Summary**: For a given scene, humans can easily reason for the locations and pose to place objects. Designing a computational model to reason about these affordances poses a significant challenge, mirroring the intuitive reasoning abilities of humans. This work tackles the problem of realistic human insertion in a given background scene termed as \textbf{Semantic Human Placement}. This task is extremely challenging given the diverse backgrounds, scale, and pose of the generated person and, finally, the identity preservation of the person. We divide the problem into the following two stages \textbf{i)} learning \textit{semantic masks} using text guidance for localizing regions in the image to place humans and \textbf{ii)} subject-conditioned inpainting to place a given subject adhering to the scene affordance within the \textit{semantic masks}. For learning semantic masks, we leverage rich object-scene priors learned from the text-to-image generative models and optimize a novel parameterization of the semantic mask, eliminating the need for large-scale training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first ones to provide an effective solution for realistic human placements in diverse real-world scenes. The proposed method can generate highly realistic scene compositions while preserving the background and subject identity. Further, we present results for several downstream tasks - scene hallucination from a single or multiple generated persons and text-based attribute editing. With extensive comparisons against strong baselines, we show the superiority of our method in realistic human placement.

- **Summary**: Video-based pretraining offers immense potential for learning strong visual representations on an unprecedented scale. Recently, masked video modeling methods have shown promising scalability, yet fall short in capturing higher-level semantics due to reconstructing predefined low-level targets such as pixels. To tackle this, we present Sinkhorn-guided Masked Video Modelling (SIGMA), a novel video pretraining method that jointly learns the video model in addition to a target feature space using a projection network. However, this simple modification means that the regular L2 reconstruction loss will lead to trivial solutions as both networks are jointly optimized. As a solution, we distribute features of space-time tubes evenly across a limited number of learnable clusters. By posing this as an optimal transport problem, we enforce high entropy in the generated features across the batch, infusing semantic and temporal meaning into the feature space. The resulting cluster assignments are used as targets for a symmetric prediction task where the video model predicts cluster assignment of the projection network and vice versa. Experimental results on ten datasets across three benchmarks validate the effectiveness of SIGMA in learning more performant, temporally-aware, and robust video representations improving upon state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Existing 2D human pose estimation research predominantly concentrates on well-lit scenarios, with limited exploration of poor lighting conditions, which are a prevalent aspect of daily life. Recent studies on low-light pose estimation require the use of paired well-lit and low-light images with ground truths for training, which are impractical due to the inherent challenges associated with annotation on low-light images. To this end, we introduce a novel approach that eliminates the need for low-light ground truths. Our primary novelty lies in leveraging two complementary-teacher networks to generate more reliable pseudo labels, enabling our model achieves competitive performance on extremely low-light images without the need for training with low-light ground truths. Our framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, our model is trained on well-lit data with low-light augmentations. In the second stage, we propose a dual-teacher framework to utilize the unlabeled low-light data, where a center-based main teacher produces the pseudo labels for relatively visible cases, while a keypoints-based complementary teacher focuses on producing the pseudo labels for the missed persons of the main teacher. With the pseudo labels from both teachers, we propose a person-specific low-light augmentation to challenge a student model in training to outperform the teachers. Experimental results on real low-light dataset (ExLPose-OCN) show, our method achieves 6.8% (2.4 AP) improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, despite no low-light ground-truth data is used in our approach, in contrast to the SOTA method.

- **Summary**: Multispectral (MS) snapshot cameras equipped with a MS filter array (MSFA), capture multiple spectral bands in a single shot, resulting in a raw mosaic image where each pixel holds only one channel value. The fully-defined MS image is estimated from the raw one through $\textit{demosaicing}$, which inevitably introduces spatio-spectral artifacts. Moreover, training on fully-defined MS images can be computationally intensive, particularly with deep neural networks (DNNs), and may result in features lacking discrimination power due to suboptimal learning of spatio-spectral interactions. Furthermore, outdoor MS image acquisition occurs under varying lighting conditions, leading to illumination-dependent features. This paper presents an original approach to learn discriminant and illumination-robust features directly from raw images. It involves: $\textit{raw spectral constancy}$ to mitigate the impact of illumination, $\textit{MSFA-preserving}$ transformations suited for raw image augmentation to train DNNs on diverse raw textures, and $\textit{raw-mixing}$ to capture discriminant spatio-spectral interactions in raw images. Experiments on MS image classification show that our approach outperforms both handcrafted and recent deep learning-based methods, while also requiring significantly less computational effort.

- **Summary**: The advancement in computing power has significantly reduced the training times for deep learning, fostering the rapid development of networks designed for object recognition. However, the exploration of object utility, which is the affordance of the object, as opposed to object recognition, has received comparatively less attention. This work focuses on the problem of exploration of object affordances using existing networks trained on the object classification dataset. While pre-trained networks have proven to be instrumental in transfer learning for classification tasks, this work diverges from conventional object classification methods. Instead, it employs pre-trained networks to discern affordance labels without the need for specialized layers, abstaining from modifying the final layers through the addition of classification layers. To facilitate the determination of affordance labels without such modifications, two approaches, i.e. subspace clustering and manifold curvature methods are tested. These methods offer a distinct perspective on affordance label recognition. Especially, manifold curvature method has been successfully tested with nine distinct pre-trained networks, each achieving an accuracy exceeding 95%. Moreover, it is observed that manifold curvature and subspace clustering methods explore affordance labels that are not marked in the ground truth, but object affords in various cases.

The existing harmonization methods can only produce one deterministic result for a composite image, ignoring that a composite image could have multiple plausible harmonization results due to multiple plausible reflectances. In this work, we first propose a reflectance-guided harmonization network, which can achieve better performance with the guidance of ground-truth foreground reflectance. Then, we also design a diverse reflectance generation network to predict multiple plausible foreground reflectances, leading to multiple plausible harmonization results. The extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: We propose 6DGS to estimate the camera pose of a target RGB image given a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model representing the scene. 6DGS avoids the iterative process typical of analysis-by-synthesis methods (e.g. iNeRF) that also require an initialization of the camera pose in order to converge. Instead, our method estimates a 6DoF pose by inverting the 3DGS rendering process. Starting from the object surface, we define a radiant Ellicell that uniformly generates rays departing from each ellipsoid that parameterize the 3DGS model. Each Ellicell ray is associated with the rendering parameters of each ellipsoid, which in turn is used to obtain the best bindings between the target image pixels and the cast rays. These pixel-ray bindings are then ranked to select the best scoring bundle of rays, which their intersection provides the camera center and, in turn, the camera rotation. The proposed solution obviates the necessity of an "a priori" pose for initialization, and it solves 6DoF pose estimation in closed form, without the need for iterations. Moreover, compared to the existing Novel View Synthesis (NVS) baselines for pose estimation, 6DGS can improve the overall average rotational accuracy by 12% and translation accuracy by 22% on real scenes, despite not requiring any initialization pose. At the same time, our method operates near real-time, reaching 15fps on consumer hardware.

- **Summary**: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is one of the most successful methods to diminish late-stage Parkinson's Disease (PD) symptoms. It is a delicate surgical procedure which requires detailed pre-surgical patient's study. High-field Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has proven its improved capacity of capturing the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) - the main target of DBS in PD - in greater detail than lower field images. Here, we present a comparison between the performance of two different Deep Learning (DL) automatic segmentation architectures, one based in the registration to a brain template and the other performing the segmentation in in the MRI acquisition native space. The study was based on publicly available high-field 7 Tesla (T) brain MRI datasets of T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences. nnUNet was used on the segmentation step of both architectures, while the data pre and post-processing pipelines diverged. The evaluation metrics showed that the performance of the segmentation directly in the native space yielded better results for the STN segmentation, despite not showing any advantage over the template-based method for the to other analysed structures: the Red Nucleus (RN) and the Substantia Nigra (SN).

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in a large number of downstream tasks. Nonetheless, compositional image understanding remains a rather difficult task due to the object bias present in training data. In this work, we investigate the reasons for such a lack of capability by performing an extensive bench-marking of compositional understanding in VLMs. We compare contrastive models with generative ones and analyze their differences in architecture, pre-training data, and training tasks and losses. Furthermore, we leverage In-Context Learning (ICL) as a way to improve the ability of VLMs to perform more complex reasoning and understanding given an image. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms baseline models across multiple compositional understanding datasets.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have made significant strides in text-driven and layout-driven image generation. However, most diffusion models are limited to visible RGB image generation. In fact, human perception of the world is enriched by diverse viewpoints, including chromatic contrast, thermal illumination, and depth information. In this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion model for general layout-guided cross-modal "RGB+X" generation, called DiffX. We firstly construct the cross-modal image datasets with text descriptions using the LLaVA model for image captioning, supplemented by manual corrections. Notably, DiffX presents a simple yet effective cross-modal generative modeling pipeline, which conducts diffusion and denoising processes in the modality-shared latent space, facilitated by our Dual-Path Variational AutoEncoder (DP-VAE). Furthermore, we incorporate the gated cross-attention mechanism to connect the layout and text conditions, leveraging Long-CLIP for embedding long captions to enhance user guidance. Through extensive experiments, DiffX demonstrates robustness and flexibility in cross-modal generation across three RGB+X datasets: FLIR, MFNet, and COME15K, guided by various layout types. It also shows the potential for adaptive generation of "RGB+X+Y" or more diverse modalities. Our code and processed image captions are available at https://github.com/zeyuwang-zju/DiffX.

- **Summary**: Generative AI technologies produce hyper-realistic imagery that can be used for nefarious purposes such as producing misleading or harmful content, among others. This makes Synthetic Image Detection (SID) an essential tool for defending against AI-generated harmful content. Current SID methods typically resize input images to a fixed resolution or perform center-cropping due to computational concerns, leading to challenges in effectively detecting artifacts in high-resolution images. To this end, we propose TextureCrop, a novel image pre-processing technique. By focusing on high-frequency image parts where generation artifacts are prevalent, TextureCrop effectively enhances SID accuracy while maintaining manageable memory requirements. Experimental results demonstrate a consistent improvement in AUC across various detectors by 5.7% compared to center cropping and by 14% compared to resizing, across high-resolution images from the Forensynths and Synthbuster datasets.

- **Summary**: In the era of content creation revolution propelled by advancements in generative models, the field of web design remains unexplored despite its critical role in modern digital communication. The web design process is complex and often time-consuming, especially for those with limited expertise. In this paper, we introduce Web Rendering Parameters Generation (WebRPG), a new task that aims at automating the generation for visual presentation of web pages based on their HTML code. WebRPG would contribute to a faster web development workflow. Since there is no existing benchmark available, we develop a new dataset for WebRPG through an automated pipeline. Moreover, we present baseline models, utilizing VAE to manage numerous elements and rendering parameters, along with custom HTML embedding for capturing essential semantic and hierarchical information from HTML. Extensive experiments, including customized quantitative evaluations for this specific task, are conducted to evaluate the quality of the generated results.

- **Summary**: Generating high-resolution images with generative models has recently been made widely accessible by leveraging diffusion models pre-trained on large-scale datasets. Various techniques, such as MultiDiffusion and SyncDiffusion, have further pushed image generation beyond training resolutions, i.e., from square images to panorama, by merging multiple overlapping diffusion paths or employing gradient descent to maintain perceptual coherence. However, these methods suffer from significant computational inefficiencies due to generating and averaging numerous predictions, which is required in practice to produce high-quality and seamless images. This work addresses this limitation and presents a novel approach that eliminates the need to generate and average numerous overlapping denoising predictions. Our method shifts non-overlapping denoising windows over time, ensuring that seams in one timestep are corrected in the next. This results in coherent, high-resolution images with fewer overall steps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, comparing it with MultiDiffusion, SyncDiffusion, and StitchDiffusion. Our method offers several key benefits, including improved computational efficiency and faster inference times while producing comparable or better image quality.

- **Summary**: Multi-sensor ML models for EO aim to enhance prediction accuracy by integrating data from various sources. However, the presence of missing data poses a significant challenge, particularly in non-persistent sensors that can be affected by external factors. Existing literature has explored strategies like temporal dropout and sensor-invariant models to address the generalization to missing data issues. Inspired by these works, we study two novel methods tailored for multi-sensor scenarios, namely Input Sensor Dropout (ISensD) and Ensemble Sensor Invariant (ESensI). Through experimentation on three multi-sensor temporal EO datasets, we demonstrate that these methods effectively increase the robustness of model predictions to missing sensors. Particularly, we focus on how the predictive performance of models drops when sensors are missing at different levels. We observe that ensemble multi-sensor models are the most robust to the lack of sensors. In addition, the sensor dropout component in ISensD shows promising robustness results.

- **Summary**: Generative artificial intelligence has transformed the generation of synthetic data, providing innovative solutions to challenges like data scarcity and privacy, which are particularly critical in fields such as medicine. However, the effective use of this synthetic data to train high-performance models remains a significant challenge. This paper addresses this issue by introducing Knowledge Recycling (KR), a pipeline designed to optimise the generation and use of synthetic data for training downstream classifiers. At the heart of this pipeline is Generative Knowledge Distillation (GKD), the proposed technique that significantly improves the quality and usefulness of the information provided to classifiers through a synthetic dataset regeneration and soft labelling mechanism. The KR pipeline has been tested on a variety of datasets, with a focus on six highly heterogeneous medical image datasets, ranging from retinal images to organ scans. The results show a significant reduction in the performance gap between models trained on real and synthetic data, with models based on synthetic data outperforming those trained on real data in some cases. Furthermore, the resulting models show almost complete immunity to Membership Inference Attacks, manifesting privacy properties missing in models trained with conventional techniques.

- **Summary**: Event cameras have the ability to capture asynchronous per-pixel brightness changes, called "events", offering advantages over traditional frame-based cameras for computer vision applications. Efficiently coding event data is critical for transmission and storage, given the significant volume of events. This paper proposes a novel double deep learning-based architecture for both event data coding and classification, using a point cloud-based representation for events. In this context, the conversions from events to point clouds and back to events are key steps in the proposed solution, and therefore its impact is evaluated in terms of compression and classification performance. Experimental results show that it is possible to achieve a classification performance of compressed events which is similar to one of the original events, even after applying a lossy point cloud codec, notably the recent learning-based JPEG Pleno Point Cloud Coding standard, with a clear rate reduction. Experimental results also demonstrate that events coded using JPEG PCC achieve better classification performance than those coded using the conventional lossy MPEG Geometry-based Point Cloud Coding standard. Furthermore, the adoption of learning-based coding offers high potential for performing computer vision tasks in the compressed domain, which allows skipping the decoding stage while mitigating the impact of coding artifacts.

- **Summary**: Camera relocalization relies on 3D models of the scene with a large memory footprint that is incompatible with the memory budget of several applications. One solution to reduce the scene memory size is map compression by removing certain 3D points and descriptor quantization. This achieves high compression but leads to performance drop due to information loss. To address the memory performance trade-off, we train a light-weight scene-specific auto-encoder network that performs descriptor quantization-dequantization in an end-to-end differentiable manner updating both product quantization centroids and network parameters through back-propagation. In addition to optimizing the network for descriptor reconstruction, we encourage it to preserve the descriptor-matching performance with margin-based metric loss functions. Results show that for a local descriptor memory of only 1MB, the synergistic combination of the proposed network and map compression achieves the best performance on the Aachen Day-Night compared to existing compression methods.

- **Summary**: Learning efficient representations of local features is a key challenge in feature volume-based 3D neural mapping, especially in large-scale environments. In this paper, we introduce Decomposition-based Neural Mapping (DNMap), a storage-efficient large-scale 3D mapping method that employs a discrete representation based on a decomposition strategy. This decomposition strategy aims to efficiently capture repetitive and representative patterns of shapes by decomposing each discrete embedding into component vectors that are shared across the embedding space. Our DNMap optimizes a set of component vectors, rather than entire discrete embeddings, and learns composition rather than indexing the discrete embeddings. Furthermore, to complement the mapping quality, we additionally learn low-resolution continuous embeddings that require tiny storage space. By combining these representations with a shallow neural network and an efficient octree-based feature volume, our DNMap successfully approximates signed distance functions and compresses the feature volume while preserving mapping quality. Our source code is available at https://github.com/minseong-p/dnmap.

- **Summary**: The rapid growth of online video resources has significantly promoted the development of video retrieval methods. As a standard evaluation metric for video retrieval, Average Precision (AP) assesses the overall rankings of relevant videos at the top list, making the predicted scores a reliable reference for users. However, recent video retrieval methods utilize pair-wise losses that treat all sample pairs equally, leading to an evident gap between the training objective and evaluation metric. To effectively bridge this gap, in this work, we aim to address two primary challenges: a) The current similarity measure and AP-based loss are suboptimal for video retrieval; b) The noticeable noise from frame-to-frame matching introduces ambiguity in estimating the AP loss. In response to these challenges, we propose the Hierarchical learning framework for Average-Precision-oriented Video Retrieval (HAP-VR). For the former challenge, we develop the TopK-Chamfer Similarity and QuadLinear-AP loss to measure and optimize video-level similarities in terms of AP. For the latter challenge, we suggest constraining the frame-level similarities to achieve an accurate AP loss estimation. Experimental results present that HAP-VR outperforms existing methods on several benchmark datasets, providing a feasible solution for video retrieval tasks and thus offering potential benefits for the multi-media application.

- **Summary**: Object-centric (OC) representations, which represent the state of a visual scene by modeling it as a composition of objects, have the potential to be used in various downstream tasks to achieve systematic compositional generalization and facilitate reasoning. However, these claims have not been thoroughly analyzed yet. Recently, foundation models have demonstrated unparalleled capabilities across diverse domains from language to computer vision, marking them as a potential cornerstone of future research for a multitude of computational tasks. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study on representation learning for downstream Visual Question Answering (VQA), which requires an accurate compositional understanding of the scene. We thoroughly investigate the benefits and trade-offs of OC models and alternative approaches including large pre-trained foundation models on both synthetic and real-world data, and demonstrate a viable way to achieve the best of both worlds. The extensiveness of our study, encompassing over 800 downstream VQA models and 15 different types of upstream representations, also provides several additional insights that we believe will be of interest to the community at large.

- **Summary**: In the field of affective computing, fully leveraging information from a variety of sensory modalities is essential for the comprehensive understanding and processing of human emotions. Inspired by the process through which the human brain handles emotions and the theory of cross-modal plasticity, we propose UMBEnet, a brain-like unified modal affective processing network. The primary design of UMBEnet includes a Dual-Stream (DS) structure that fuses inherent prompts with a Prompt Pool and a Sparse Feature Fusion (SFF) module. The design of the Prompt Pool is aimed at integrating information from different modalities, while inherent prompts are intended to enhance the system's predictive guidance capabilities and effectively manage knowledge related to emotion classification. Moreover, considering the sparsity of effective information across different modalities, the SSF module aims to make full use of all available sensory data through the sparse integration of modality fusion prompts and inherent prompts, maintaining high adaptability and sensitivity to complex emotional states. Extensive experiments on the largest benchmark datasets in the Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) field, including DFEW, FERV39k, and MAFW, have proven that UMBEnet consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. Notably, in scenarios of Modality Missingness and multimodal contexts, UMBEnet significantly surpasses the leading current methods, demonstrating outstanding performance and adaptability in tasks that involve complex emotional understanding with rich multimodal information.

- **Summary**: Accurate localization in diverse environments is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and robotics. The task involves determining a sensor's precise position and orientation, typically a camera, within a given space. Traditional localization methods often rely on passive sensing, which may struggle in scenarios with limited features or dynamic environments. In response, this paper explores the domain of active localization, emphasizing the importance of viewpoint selection to enhance localization accuracy. Our contributions involve using a data-driven approach with a simple architecture designed for real-time operation, a self-supervised data training method, and the capability to consistently integrate our map into a planning framework tailored for real-world robotics applications. Our results demonstrate that our method performs better than the existing one, targeting similar problems and generalizing on synthetic and real data. We also release an open-source implementation to benefit the community.

- **Summary**: Foundation models (FMs) are large neural networks trained on broad datasets, excelling in downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. Human activity recognition in video has advanced with FMs, driven by competition among different architectures. However, high accuracies on standard benchmarks can draw an artificially rosy picture, as they often overlook real-world factors like changing camera perspectives. Popular benchmarks, mostly from YouTube or movies, offer diverse views but only coarse actions, which are insufficient for use-cases needing fine-grained, domain-specific actions. Domain-specific datasets (e.g., for industrial assembly) typically use data from limited static perspectives. This paper empirically evaluates how perspective changes affect different FMs in fine-grained human activity recognition. We compare multiple backbone architectures and design choices, including image- and video- based models, and various strategies for temporal information fusion, including commonly used score averaging and more novel attention-based temporal aggregation mechanisms. This is the first systematic study of different foundation models and specific design choices for human activity recognition from unknown views, conducted with the goal to provide guidance for backbone- and temporal- fusion scheme selection. Code and models will be made publicly available to the community.

- **Summary**: Recent work shows that documents from encyclopedias serve as helpful auxiliary information for zero-shot learning. Existing methods align the entire semantics of a document with corresponding images to transfer knowledge. However, they disregard that semantic information is not equivalent between them, resulting in a suboptimal alignment. In this work, we propose a novel network to extract multi-view semantic concepts from documents and images and align the matching rather than entire concepts. Specifically, we propose a semantic decomposition module to generate multi-view semantic embeddings from visual and textual sides, providing the basic concepts for partial alignment. To alleviate the issue of information redundancy among embeddings, we propose the local-to-semantic variance loss to capture distinct local details and multiple semantic diversity loss to enforce orthogonality among embeddings. Subsequently, two losses are introduced to partially align visual-semantic embedding pairs according to their semantic relevance at the view and word-to-patch levels. Consequently, we consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods under two document sources in three standard benchmarks for document-based zero-shot learning. Qualitatively, we show that our model learns the interpretable partial association.

- **Summary**: Facial Expression Analysis remains a challenging task due to unexpected task-irrelevant noise, such as identity, head pose, and background. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework, called Norface, that is unified for both Action Unit (AU) analysis and Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) tasks. Norface consists of a normalization network and a classification network. First, the carefully designed normalization network struggles to directly remove the above task-irrelevant noise, by maintaining facial expression consistency but normalizing all original images to a common identity with consistent pose, and background. Then, these additional normalized images are fed into the classification network. Due to consistent identity and other factors (e.g. head pose, background, etc.), the normalized images enable the classification network to extract useful expression information more effectively. Additionally, the classification network incorporates a Mixture of Experts to refine the latent representation, including handling the input of facial representations and the output of multiple (AU or emotion) labels. Extensive experiments validate the carefully designed framework with the insight of identity normalization. The proposed method outperforms existing SOTA methods in multiple facial expression analysis tasks, including AU detection, AU intensity estimation, and FER tasks, as well as their cross-dataset tasks.

- **Summary**: Visual Odometry (VO) is essential to downstream mobile robotics and augmented/virtual reality tasks. Despite recent advances, existing VO methods still rely on heuristic design choices that require several weeks of hyperparameter tuning by human experts, hindering generalizability and robustness. We address these challenges by reframing VO as a sequential decision-making task and applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to adapt the VO process dynamically. Our approach introduces a neural network, operating as an agent within the VO pipeline, to make decisions such as keyframe and grid-size selection based on real-time conditions. Our method minimizes reliance on heuristic choices using a reward function based on pose error, runtime, and other metrics to guide the system. Our RL framework treats the VO system and the image sequence as an environment, with the agent receiving observations from keypoints, map statistics, and prior poses. Experimental results using classical VO methods and public benchmarks demonstrate improvements in accuracy and robustness, validating the generalizability of our RL-enhanced VO approach to different scenarios. We believe this paradigm shift advances VO technology by eliminating the need for time-intensive parameter tuning of heuristics.

- **Summary**: Virtual interventions enable the physics-based simulation of device deployment within coronary arteries. This framework allows for counterfactual reasoning by deploying the same device in different arterial anatomies. However, current methods to create such counterfactual arteries face a trade-off between controllability and realism. In this study, we investigate how Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) can custom synthesize coronary anatomy for virtual intervention studies based on mid-level anatomic constraints such as topological validity, local morphological shape, and global skeletal structure. We also extend diffusion model guidance strategies to the context of morpho-skeletal conditioning and propose a novel guidance method for continuous attributes that adaptively updates the negative guiding condition throughout sampling. Our framework enables the generation and editing of coronary anatomy in a controllable manner, allowing device designers to derive mechanistic insights regarding anatomic variation and simulated device deployment.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have achieved great progress in image animation due to powerful generative capabilities. However, maintaining spatio-temporal consistency with detailed information from the input static image over time (e.g., style, background, and object of the input static image) and ensuring smoothness in animated video narratives guided by textual prompts still remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Cinemo, a novel image animation approach towards achieving better motion controllability, as well as stronger temporal consistency and smoothness. In general, we propose three effective strategies at the training and inference stages of Cinemo to accomplish our goal. At the training stage, Cinemo focuses on learning the distribution of motion residuals, rather than directly predicting subsequent via a motion diffusion model. Additionally, a structural similarity index-based strategy is proposed to enable Cinemo to have better controllability of motion intensity. At the inference stage, a noise refinement technique based on discrete cosine transformation is introduced to mitigate sudden motion changes. Such three strategies enable Cinemo to produce highly consistent, smooth, and motion-controllable results. Compared to previous methods, Cinemo offers simpler and more precise user controllability. Extensive experiments against several state-of-the-art methods, including both commercial tools and research approaches, across multiple metrics, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Automotive simulation can potentially compensate for a lack of training data in computer vision applications. However, there has been little to no image quality evaluation of automotive simulation and the impact of optical degradations on simulation is little explored. In this work, we investigate Virtual KITTI and the impact of applying variations of Gaussian blur on image sharpness. Furthermore, we consider object detection, a common computer vision application on three different state-of-the-art models, thus allowing us to characterize the relationship between object detection and sharpness. It was found that while image sharpness (MTF50) degrades from an average of 0.245cy/px to approximately 0.119cy/px; object detection performance stays largely robust within 0.58\%(Faster RCNN), 1.45\%(YOLOF) and 1.93\%(DETR) across all respective held-out test sets.

- **Summary**: Inferring step-wise actions to assemble 3D objects with primitive bricks from images is a challenging task due to complex constraints and the vast number of possible combinations. Recent studies have demonstrated promising results on sequential LEGO brick assembly through the utilization of LEGO-Graph modeling to predict sequential actions. However, existing approaches are class-specific and require significant computational and 3D annotation resources. In this work, we first propose a computationally efficient breadth-first search (BFS) LEGO-Tree structure to model the sequential assembly actions by considering connections between consecutive layers. Based on the LEGO-Tree structure, we then design a class-agnostic tree-transformer framework to predict the sequential assembly actions from the input multi-view images. A major challenge of the sequential brick assembly task is that the step-wise action labels are costly and tedious to obtain in practice. We mitigate this problem by leveraging synthetic-to-real transfer learning. Specifically, our model is first pre-trained on synthetic data with full supervision from the available action labels. We then circumvent the requirement for action labels in the real data by proposing an action-to-silhouette projection that replaces action labels with input image silhouettes for self-supervision. Without any annotation on the real data, our model outperforms existing methods with 3D supervision by 7.8% and 11.3% in mIoU on the MNIST and ModelNet Construction datasets, respectively.

- **Summary**: In autonomous driving, deep models have shown remarkable performance across various visual perception tasks with the demand of high-quality and huge-diversity training datasets. Such datasets are expected to cover various driving scenarios with adverse weather, lighting conditions and diverse moving objects. However, manually collecting these data presents huge challenges and expensive cost. With the rapid development of large generative models, we propose DriveDiTFit, a novel method for efficiently generating autonomous Driving data by Fine-tuning pre-trained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). Specifically, DriveDiTFit utilizes a gap-driven modulation technique to carefully select and efficiently fine-tune a few parameters in DiTs according to the discrepancy between the pre-trained source data and the target driving data. Additionally, DriveDiTFit develops an effective weather and lighting condition embedding module to ensure diversity in the generated data, which is initialized by a nearest-semantic-similarity initialization approach. Through progressive tuning scheme to refined the process of detail generation in early diffusion process and enlarging the weights corresponding to small objects in training loss, DriveDiTFit ensures high-quality generation of small moving objects in the generated data. Extensive experiments conducted on driving datasets confirm that our method could efficiently produce diverse real driving data.

- **Summary**: Place recognition is a challenging task in computer vision, crucial for enabling autonomous vehicles and robots to navigate previously visited environments. While significant progress has been made in learnable multimodal methods that combine onboard camera images and LiDAR point clouds, the full potential of these methods remains largely unexplored in localization applications. In this paper, we study the impact of leveraging a multi-camera setup and integrating diverse data sources for multimodal place recognition, incorporating explicit visual semantics and text descriptions. Our proposed method named MSSPlace utilizes images from multiple cameras, LiDAR point clouds, semantic segmentation masks, and text annotations to generate comprehensive place descriptors. We employ a late fusion approach to integrate these modalities, providing a unified representation. Through extensive experiments on the Oxford RobotCar and NCLT datasets, we systematically analyze the impact of each data source on the overall quality of place descriptors. Our experiments demonstrate that combining data from multiple sensors significantly improves place recognition model performance compared to single modality approaches and leads to state-of-the-art quality. We also show that separate usage of visual or textual semantics (which are more compact representations of sensory data) can achieve promising results in place recognition.

- **Summary**: Sign Language Recognition has been studied and developed throughout the years to help the deaf and hard-of-hearing people in their day-to-day lives. These technologies leverage manual sign recognition algorithms, however, most of them lack the recognition of facial expressions, which are also an essential part of Sign Language as they allow the speaker to add expressiveness to their dialogue or even change the meaning of certain manual signs. SLVideo is a video moment retrieval software for Sign Language videos with a focus on both hands and facial signs. The system extracts embedding representations for the hand and face signs from video frames to capture the language signs in full. This will then allow the user to search for a specific sign language video segment with text queries, or to search by similar sign language videos. To test this system, a collection of five hours of annotated Sign Language videos is used as the dataset, and the initial results are promising in a zero-shot setting.SLVideo is shown to not only address the problem of searching sign language videos but also supports a Sign Language thesaurus with a search by similarity technique.

- **Summary**: Accurate prediction of driving scenes is essential for road safety and autonomous driving. Occupancy Grid Maps (OGMs) are commonly employed for scene prediction due to their structured spatial representation, flexibility across sensor modalities and integration of uncertainty. Recent studies have successfully combined OGMs with deep learning methods to predict the evolution of scene and learn complex behaviours. These methods, however, do not consider prediction of flow or velocity vectors in the scene. In this work, we propose a novel multi-task framework that leverages dynamic OGMs and semantic information to predict both future vehicle semantic grids and the future flow of the scene. This incorporation of semantic flow not only offers intermediate scene features but also enables the generation of warped semantic grids. Evaluation on the real-world NuScenes dataset demonstrates improved prediction capabilities and enhanced ability of the model to retain dynamic vehicles within the scene.

- **Summary**: Hallucination has been a major problem for large language models and remains a critical challenge when it comes to multimodality in which vision-language models (VLMs) have to deal with not just textual but also visual inputs. Despite rapid progress in VLMs, resources for evaluating and addressing multimodal hallucination are limited and mostly focused on evaluation. This work introduces HaloQuest, a novel visual question answering dataset that captures various aspects of multimodal hallucination such as false premises, insufficient contexts, and visual challenges. A novel idea from HaloQuest is to leverage synthetic images, apart from real ones, to enable dataset creation at scale. With over 7.7K examples spanning across a wide variety of categories, HaloQuest was designed to be both a challenging benchmark for VLMs and a fine-tuning dataset for advancing multimodal reasoning. Our experiments reveal that current models struggle with HaloQuest, with all open-source VLMs achieving below 36% accuracy. On the other hand, fine-tuning on HaloQuest significantly reduces hallucination rates while preserving performance on standard reasoning tasks. Our results discover that benchmarking with generated images is highly correlated (r=0.97) with real images. Last but not least, we propose a novel Auto-Eval mechanism that is highly correlated with human raters (r=0.99) for evaluating VLMs. In sum, this work makes concrete strides towards understanding, evaluating, and mitigating hallucination in VLMs, serving as an important step towards more reliable multimodal AI systems in the future.

- **Summary**: Transfer-based targeted adversarial attacks against black-box deep neural networks (DNNs) have been proven to be significantly more challenging than untargeted ones. The impressive transferability of current SOTA, the generative methods, comes at the cost of requiring massive amounts of additional data and time-consuming training for each targeted label. This results in limited efficiency and flexibility, significantly hindering their deployment in practical applications. In this paper, we offer a self-universal perspective that unveils the great yet underexplored potential of input transformations in pursuing this goal. Specifically, transformations universalize gradient-based attacks with intrinsic but overlooked semantics inherent within individual images, exhibiting similar scalability and comparable results to time-consuming learning over massive additional data from diverse classes. We also contribute a surprising empirical insight that one of the most fundamental transformations, simple image scaling, is highly effective, scalable, sufficient, and necessary in enhancing targeted transferability. We further augment simple scaling with orthogonal transformations and block-wise applicability, resulting in the Simple, faSt, Self-universal yet Strong Scale Transformation (S$^4$ST) for self-universal TTA. On the ImageNet-Compatible benchmark dataset, our method achieves a 19.8% improvement in the average targeted transfer success rate against various challenging victim models over existing SOTA transformation methods while only consuming 36% time for attacking. It also outperforms resource-intensive attacks by a large margin in various challenging settings.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel approach for the differentiable rendering of convex polyhedra, addressing the limitations of recent methods that rely on implicit field supervision. Our technique introduces a strategy that combines non-differentiable computation of hyperplane intersection through duality transform with differentiable optimization for vertex positioning with three-plane intersection, enabling gradient-based optimization without the need for 3D implicit fields. This allows for efficient shape representation across a range of applications, from shape parsing to compact mesh reconstruction. This work not only overcomes the challenges of previous approaches but also sets a new standard for representing shapes with convex polyhedra.

- **Summary**: Wrist fractures are highly prevalent among children and can significantly impact their daily activities, such as attending school, participating in sports, and performing basic self-care tasks. If not treated properly, these fractures can result in chronic pain, reduced wrist functionality, and other long-term complications. Recently, advancements in object detection have shown promise in enhancing fracture detection, with systems achieving accuracy comparable to, or even surpassing, that of human radiologists. The YOLO series, in particular, has demonstrated notable success in this domain. This study is the first to provide a thorough evaluation of various YOLOv10 variants to assess their performance in detecting pediatric wrist fractures using the GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset. It investigates how changes in model complexity, scaling the architecture, and implementing a dual-label assignment strategy can enhance detection performance. Experimental results indicate that our trained model achieved mean average precision (mAP@50-95) of 51.9\% surpassing the current YOLOv9 benchmark of 43.3\% on this dataset. This represents an improvement of 8.6\%. The implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/ammarlodhi255/YOLOv10-Fracture-Detection

- **Summary**: Skeleton-based action recognition has garnered significant attention due to the utilization of concise and resilient skeletons. Nevertheless, the absence of detailed body information in skeletons restricts performance, while other multimodal methods require substantial inference resources and are inefficient when using multimodal data during both training and inference stages. To address this and fully harness the complementary multimodal features, we propose a novel multi-modality co-learning (MMCL) framework by leveraging the multimodal large language models (LLMs) as auxiliary networks for efficient skeleton-based action recognition, which engages in multi-modality co-learning during the training stage and keeps efficiency by employing only concise skeletons in inference. Our MMCL framework primarily consists of two modules. First, the Feature Alignment Module (FAM) extracts rich RGB features from video frames and aligns them with global skeleton features via contrastive learning. Second, the Feature Refinement Module (FRM) uses RGB images with temporal information and text instruction to generate instructive features based on the powerful generalization of multimodal LLMs. These instructive text features will further refine the classification scores and the refined scores will enhance the model's robustness and generalization in a manner similar to soft labels. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120 and Northwestern-UCLA benchmarks consistently verify the effectiveness of our MMCL, which outperforms the existing skeleton-based action recognition methods. Meanwhile, experiments on UTD-MHAD and SYSU-Action datasets demonstrate the commendable generalization of our MMCL in zero-shot and domain-adaptive action recognition. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/liujf69/MMCL-Action.

- **Summary**: We observe that the performance of SOTA visual trackers surprisingly strongly varies across different video attributes and datasets. No single tracker remains the best performer across all tracking attributes and datasets. To bridge this gap, for a given video sequence, we predict the "Best of the N Trackers", called the BofN meta-tracker. At its core, a Tracking Performance Prediction Network (TP2N) selects a predicted best performing visual tracker for the given video sequence using only a few initial frames. We also introduce a frame-level BofN meta-tracker which keeps predicting best performer after regular temporal intervals. The TP2N is based on self-supervised learning architectures MocoV2, SwAv, BT, and DINO; experiments show that the DINO with ViT-S as a backbone performs the best. The video-level BofN meta-tracker outperforms, by a large margin, existing SOTA trackers on nine standard benchmarks - LaSOT, TrackingNet, GOT-10K, VOT2019, VOT2021, VOT2022, UAV123, OTB100, and WebUAV-3M. Further improvement is achieved by the frame-level BofN meta-tracker effectively handling variations in the tracking scenarios within long sequences. For instance, on GOT-10k, BofN meta-tracker average overlap is 88.7% and 91.1% with video and frame-level settings respectively. The best performing tracker, RTS, achieves 85.20% AO. On VOT2022, BofN expected average overlap is 67.88% and 70.98% with video and frame level settings, compared to the best performing ARTrack, 64.12%. This work also presents an extensive evaluation of competitive tracking methods on all commonly used benchmarks, following their protocols. The code, the trained models, and the results will soon be made publicly available on https://github.com/BasitAlawode/Best_of_N_Trackers.

- **Summary**: The spike camera, with its high temporal resolution, low latency, and high dynamic range, addresses high-speed imaging challenges like motion blur. It captures photons at each pixel independently, creating binary spike streams rich in temporal information but challenging for image reconstruction. Current algorithms, both traditional and deep learning-based, still need to be improved in the utilization of the rich temporal detail and the restoration of the details of the reconstructed image. To overcome this, we introduce Swin Spikeformer (SwinSF), a novel model for dynamic scene reconstruction from spike streams. SwinSF is composed of Spike Feature Extraction, Spatial-Temporal Feature Extraction, and Final Reconstruction Module. It combines shifted window self-attention and proposed temporal spike attention, ensuring a comprehensive feature extraction that encapsulates both spatial and temporal dynamics, leading to a more robust and accurate reconstruction of spike streams. Furthermore, we build a new synthesized dataset for spike image reconstruction which matches the resolution of the latest spike camera, ensuring its relevance and applicability to the latest developments in spike camera imaging. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network SwinSF sets a new benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a series of datasets, including both real-world and synthesized data across various resolutions. Our codes and proposed dataset will be available soon.

- **Summary**: Cracks pose safety risks to infrastructure and cannot be overlooked. The prevailing structures in existing crack segmentation networks predominantly consist of CNNs or Transformers. However, CNNs exhibit a deficiency in global modeling capability, hindering the representation to entire crack features. Transformers can capture long-range dependencies but suffer from high and quadratic complexity. Recently, Mamba has garnered extensive attention due to its linear spatial and computational complexity and its powerful global perception. This study explores the representation capabilities of Mamba to crack features. Specifically, this paper uncovers the connection between Mamba and the attention mechanism, providing a profound insight, an attention perspective, into interpreting Mamba and devising a novel Mamba module following the principles of attention blocks, namely CrackMamba. We compare CrackMamba with the most prominent visual Mamba modules, Vim and Vmamba, on two datasets comprising asphalt pavement and concrete pavement cracks, and steel cracks, respectively. The quantitative results show that CrackMamba stands out as the sole Mamba block consistently enhancing the baseline model's performance across all evaluation measures, while reducing its parameters and computational costs. Moreover, this paper substantiates that Mamba can achieve global receptive fields through both theoretical analysis and visual interpretability. The discoveries of this study offer a dual contribution. First, as a plug-and-play and simple yet effective Mamba module, CrackMamba exhibits immense potential for integration into various crack segmentation models. Second, the proposed innovative Mamba design concept, integrating Mamba with the attention mechanism, holds significant reference value for all Mamba-based computer vision models, not limited to crack segmentation networks, as investigated in this study.

- **Summary**: Lack of standardization and various intrinsic parameters for magnetic resonance (MR) image acquisition results in heterogeneous images across different sites and devices, which adversely affects the generalization of deep neural networks. To alleviate this issue, this work proposes a novel unsupervised harmonization framework that leverages normalizing flows to align MR images, thereby emulating the distribution of a source domain. The proposed strategy comprises three key steps. Initially, a normalizing flow network is trained to capture the distribution characteristics of the source domain. Then, we train a shallow harmonizer network to reconstruct images from the source domain via their augmented counterparts. Finally, during inference, the harmonizer network is updated to ensure that the output images conform to the learned source domain distribution, as modeled by the normalizing flow network. Our approach, which is unsupervised, source-free, and task-agnostic is assessed in the context of both adults and neonatal cross-domain brain MRI segmentation, as well as neonatal brain age estimation, demonstrating its generalizability across tasks and population demographics. The results underscore its superior performance compared to existing methodologies. The code is available at https://github.com/farzad-bz/Harmonizing-Flows

- **Summary**: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that often progresses from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), leading to memory loss and significantly impacting patients' lives. Clinical trials indicate that early targeted interventions for MCI patients can potentially slow or halt the development and progression of AD. Previous research has shown that accurate medical classification requires the inclusion of extensive multimodal data, such as assessment scales and various neuroimaging techniques like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). However, consistently tracking the diagnosis of the same individual over time and simultaneously collecting multimodal data poses significant challenges. To address this issue, we introduce GFE-Mamba, a classifier based on Generative Feature Extraction (GFE). This classifier effectively integrates data from assessment scales, MRI, and PET, enabling deeper multimodal fusion. It efficiently extracts both long and short sequence information and incorporates additional information beyond the pixel space. This approach not only improves classification accuracy but also enhances the interpretability and stability of the model. We constructed datasets of over 3000 samples based on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) for a two-step training process. Our experimental results demonstrate that the GFE-Mamba model is effective in predicting the conversion from MCI to AD and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. Our source code and ADNI dataset processing code are available at https://github.com/Tinysqua/GFE-Mamba.

- **Summary**: In deep learning, achieving high performance on image classification tasks requires diverse training sets. However, dataset diversity is incompletely understood. The current best practice is to try to maximize dataset size and class balance. Yet large, class-balanced datasets are not guaranteed to be diverse: images can still be arbitrarily similar. We hypothesized that, for a given model architecture, better model performance can be achieved by maximizing dataset diversity more directly. This could open a path for performance improvement without additional computational resources or architectural advances. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a comprehensive framework of diversity measures, developed in ecology, that generalizes familiar quantities like Shannon entropy by accounting for similarities and differences among images. (Dataset size and class balance emerge from this framework as special cases.) By analyzing thousands of subsets from seven medical datasets representing ultrasound, X-ray, CT, and pathology images, we found that the best correlates of performance were not size or class balance but $A$ -- ``big alpha'' -- a set of generalized entropy measures interpreted as the effective number of image-class pairs in the dataset, after accounting for similarities among images. One of these, $A_0$, explained 67\% of the variance in balanced accuracy across all subsets, vs. 54\% for class balance and just 39\% for size. The best pair was size and $A_1$ (79\%), which outperformed size and class balance (74\%). $A$ performed best for subsets from individual datasets as well as across datasets, supporting the generality of these results. We propose maximizing $A$ as a potential new way to improve the performance of deep learning in medical imaging.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a new approach for effective segmentation of images that can be integrated into any model and methodology; the paradigm that we choose is classification of medical images (3-D chest CT scans) for Covid-19 detection. Our approach includes a combination of vision-language models that segment the CT scans, which are then fed to a deep neural architecture, named RACNet, for Covid-19 detection. In particular, a novel framework, named SAM2CLIP2SAM, is introduced for segmentation that leverages the strengths of both Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to accurately segment the right and left lungs in CT scans, subsequently feeding these segmented outputs into RACNet for classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. At first, SAM produces multiple part-based segmentation masks for each slice in the CT scan; then CLIP selects only the masks that are associated with the regions of interest (ROIs), i.e., the right and left lungs; finally SAM is given these ROIs as prompts and generates the final segmentation mask for the lungs. Experiments are presented across two Covid-19 annotated databases which illustrate the improved performance obtained when our method has been used for segmentation of the CT scans.



### Zero-Shot Embeddings Inform Learning and Forgetting with Vision-Language Encoders

- **Summary**: Despite the proliferation of large vision-language foundation models, estimation of the learning and forgetting outcomes following fine-tuning of these models remains largely unexplored. Inspired by work highlighting the significance of the modality gap in contrastive dual-encoders, we propose the Inter-Intra Modal Measure (IIMM). Combining terms quantifying the similarity between image embeddings and the similarity between incorrect image and label embedding pairs, the IIMM functions as a strong predictor of performance changes with fine-tuning. Our extensive empirical analysis across four state-of-the-art vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, CoCa, EVA-02-CLIP) and five fine-tuning techniques (full fine-tuning, BitFit, attention-weight tuning, LoRA, CLIP-Adapter) demonstrates a strong, statistically significant linear relationship: fine-tuning on tasks with higher IIMM scores produces greater in-domain performance gains but also induces more severe out-of-domain performance degradation, with some parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods showing extreme forgetting. We compare our measure against transfer scores from state-of-the-art model selection methods and show that the IIMM is significantly more predictive of accuracy gains. With only a single forward pass of the target data, practitioners can leverage this key insight to heuristically evaluate the degree to which a model can be expected to improve following fine-tuning. Given additional knowledge about the model's performance on a few diverse tasks, this heuristic further evolves into a strong predictor of expected performance changes when training for new tasks.

- **Summary**: In recent years, research on out-of-distribution (OoD) detection for semantic segmentation has mainly focused on road scenes -- a domain with a constrained amount of semantic diversity. In this work, we challenge this constraint and extend the domain of this task to general natural images. To this end, we introduce: 1. the ADE-OoD benchmark, which is based on the ADE20k dataset and includes images from diverse domains with a high semantic diversity, and 2. a novel approach that uses Diffusion score matching for OoD detection (DOoD) and is robust to the increased semantic diversity. ADE-OoD features indoor and outdoor images, defines 150 semantic categories as in-distribution, and contains a variety of OoD objects. For DOoD, we train a diffusion model with an MLP architecture on semantic in-distribution embeddings and build on the score matching interpretation to compute pixel-wise OoD scores at inference time. On common road scene OoD benchmarks, DOoD performs on par or better than the state of the art, without using outliers for training or making assumptions about the data domain. On ADE-OoD, DOoD outperforms previous approaches, but leaves much room for future improvements.

- **Summary**: Large multimodal models (LMMs) are processing increasingly longer and richer inputs. Albeit the progress, few public benchmark is available to measure such development. To mitigate this gap, we introduce LongVideoBench, a question-answering benchmark that features video-language interleaved inputs up to an hour long. Our benchmark includes 3,763 varying-length web-collected videos with their subtitles across diverse themes, designed to comprehensively evaluate LMMs on long-term multimodal understanding. To achieve this, we interpret the primary challenge as to accurately retrieve and reason over detailed multimodal information from long inputs. As such, we formulate a novel video question-answering task termed referring reasoning. Specifically, as part of the question, it contains a referring query that references related video contexts, called referred context. The model is then required to reason over relevant video details from the referred context. Following the paradigm of referring reasoning, we curate 6,678 human-annotated multiple-choice questions in 17 fine-grained categories, establishing one of the most comprehensive benchmarks for long-form video understanding. Evaluations suggest that the LongVideoBench presents significant challenges even for the most advanced proprietary models (e.g. GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, GPT-4-Turbo), while their open-source counterparts show an even larger performance gap. In addition, our results indicate that model performance on the benchmark improves only when they are capable of processing more frames, positioning LongVideoBench as a valuable benchmark for evaluating future-generation long-context LMMs.

- **Summary**: Object detection is a pivotal task in computer vision that has received significant attention in previous years. Nonetheless, the capability of a detector to localise objects out of the training distribution remains unexplored. Whilst recent approaches in object-level out-of-distribution (OoD) detection heavily rely on class labels, such approaches contradict truly open-world scenarios where the class distribution is often unknown. In this context, anomaly detection focuses on detecting unseen instances rather than classifying detections as OoD. This work aims to bridge this gap by leveraging an open-world object detector and an OoD detector via virtual outlier synthesis. This is achieved by using the detector backbone features to first learn object pseudo-classes via self-supervision. These pseudo-classes serve as the basis for class-conditional virtual outlier sampling of anomalous features that are classified by an OoD head. Our approach empowers our overall object detector architecture to learn anomaly-aware feature representations without relying on class labels, hence enabling truly open-world object anomaly detection. Empirical validation of our approach demonstrates its effectiveness across diverse datasets encompassing various imaging modalities (visible, infrared, and X-ray). Moreover, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance on object-level anomaly detection, achieving an average recall score improvement of over 5.4% for natural images and 23.5% for a security X-ray dataset compared to the current approaches. In addition, our method detects anomalies in datasets where current approaches fail. Code available at https://github.com/KostadinovShalon/oln-ssos.

- **Summary**: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to address the distribution shift between the training and test data with only unlabeled data at test time. Existing TTA methods often focus on improving recognition performance specifically for test data associated with classes in the training set. However, during the open-world inference process, there are inevitably test data instances from unknown classes, commonly referred to as outliers. This paper pays attention to the problem that conducts both sample recognition and outlier rejection during inference while outliers exist. To address this problem, we propose a new approach called STAble Memory rePlay (STAMP), which performs optimization over a stable memory bank instead of the risky mini-batch. In particular, the memory bank is dynamically updated by selecting low-entropy and label-consistent samples in a class-balanced manner. In addition, we develop a self-weighted entropy minimization strategy that assigns higher weight to low-entropy samples. Extensive results demonstrate that STAMP outperforms existing TTA methods in terms of both recognition and outlier detection performance.

- **Summary**: Cochlear Implant (CI) procedures involve inserting an array of electrodes into the cochlea located inside the inner ear. Mastoidectomy is a surgical procedure that uses a high-speed drill to remove part of the mastoid region of the temporal bone, providing safe access to the cochlea through the middle and inner ear. We aim to develop an intraoperative navigation system that registers plans created using 3D preoperative Computerized Tomography (CT) volumes with the 2D surgical microscope view. Herein, we propose a method to synthesize the mastoidectomy volume using only the preoperative CT scan, where the mastoid is intact. We introduce an unsupervised learning framework designed to synthesize mastoidectomy. For model training purposes, this method uses postoperative CT scans to avoid manual data cleaning or labeling, even when the region removed during mastoidectomy is visible but affected by metal artifacts, low signal-to-noise ratio, or electrode wiring. Our approach estimates mastoidectomy regions with a mean dice score of 70.0%. This approach represents a major step forward for CI intraoperative navigation by predicting realistic mastoidectomy-removed regions in preoperative planning that can be used to register the pre-surgery plan to intraoperative microscopy.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in keypoint detection and descriptor extraction have shown impressive performance in local feature learning tasks. However, existing methods generally exhibit suboptimal performance under extreme conditions such as significant appearance changes and domain shifts. In this study, we introduce a multi-level feature aggregation network that incorporates two pivotal components to facilitate the learning of robust and accurate features with domain adaptation. First, we employ domain adaptation supervision to align high-level feature distributions across different domains to achieve invariant domain representations. Second, we propose a Transformer-based booster that enhances descriptor robustness by integrating visual and geometric information through wave position encoding concepts, effectively handling complex conditions. To ensure the accuracy and robustness of features, we adopt a hierarchical architecture to capture comprehensive information and apply meticulous targeted supervision to keypoint detection, descriptor extraction, and their coupled processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, RADA, achieves excellent results in image matching, camera pose estimation, and visual localization tasks.

- **Summary**: With the emergence of Transformers and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP, large pre-trained models have become a common strategy to enhance performance in Continual Learning scenarios. This led to the development of numerous prompting strategies to effectively fine-tune transformer-based models without succumbing to catastrophic forgetting. However, these methods struggle to specialize the model on domains significantly deviating from the pre-training and preserving its zero-shot capabilities. In this work, we propose Continual Generative training for Incremental prompt-Learning, a novel approach to mitigate forgetting while adapting a VLM, which exploits generative replay to align prompts to tasks. We also introduce a new metric to evaluate zero-shot capabilities within CL benchmarks. Through extensive experiments on different domains, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in adapting to new tasks while improving zero-shot capabilities. Further analysis reveals that our approach can bridge the gap with joint prompt tuning. The codebase is available at https://github.com/aimagelab/mammoth.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised video object segmentation (WSVOS) enables the identification of segmentation maps without requiring an extensive training dataset of object masks, relying instead on coarse video labels indicating object presence. Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) targets the identification of anomalies within images from arbitrary novel categories. This study introduces AdaCLIP for the ZSAD task, leveraging a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), CLIP. AdaCLIP incorporates learnable prompts into CLIP and optimizes them through training on auxiliary annotated anomaly detection data. Two types of learnable prompts are proposed: static and dynamic. Static prompts are shared across all images, serving to preliminarily adapt CLIP for ZSAD. In contrast, dynamic prompts are generated for each test image, providing CLIP with dynamic adaptation capabilities. The combination of static and dynamic prompts is referred to as hybrid prompts, and yields enhanced ZSAD performance. Extensive experiments conducted across 14 real-world anomaly detection datasets from industrial and medical domains indicate that AdaCLIP outperforms other ZSAD methods and can generalize better to different categories and even domains. Finally, our analysis highlights the importance of diverse auxiliary data and optimized prompts for enhanced generalization capacity. Code is available at https://github.com/caoyunkang/AdaCLIP.

- **Summary**: Annotating lidar point clouds for autonomous driving is a notoriously expensive and time-consuming task. In this work, we show that the quality of recent self-supervised lidar scan representations allows a great reduction of the annotation cost. Our method has two main steps. First, we show that self-supervised representations allow a simple and direct selection of highly informative lidar scans to annotate: training a network on these selected scans leads to much better results than a random selection of scans and, more interestingly, to results on par with selections made by SOTA active learning methods. In a second step, we leverage the same self-supervised representations to cluster points in our selected scans. Asking the annotator to classify each cluster, with a single click per cluster, then permits us to close the gap with fully-annotated training sets, while only requiring one thousandth of the point labels.

- **Summary**: The objective of the Multiple Appropriate Facial Reaction Generation (MAFRG) task is to produce contextually appropriate and diverse listener facial behavioural responses based on the multimodal behavioural data of the conversational partner (i.e., the speaker). Current methodologies typically assume continuous availability of speech and facial modality data, neglecting real-world scenarios where these data may be intermittently unavailable, which often results in model failures. Furthermore, despite utilising advanced deep learning models to extract information from the speaker's multimodal inputs, these models fail to adequately leverage the speaker's emotional context, which is vital for eliciting appropriate facial reactions from human listeners. To address these limitations, we propose an Emotion-aware Modality Compensatory (EMC) framework. This versatile solution can be seamlessly integrated into existing models, thereby preserving their advantages while significantly enhancing performance and robustness in scenarios with missing modalities. Our framework ensures resilience when faced with missing modality data through the Compensatory Modality Alignment (CMA) module. It also generates more appropriate emotion-aware reactions via the Emotion-aware Attention (EA) module, which incorporates the speaker's emotional information throughout the entire encoding and decoding process. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves the appropriateness metric FRCorr by an average of 57.2\% compared to the original model structure. In scenarios where speech modality data is missing, the performance of appropriate generation shows an improvement, and when facial data is missing, it only exhibits minimal degradation.

- **Summary**: The application of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to image denoising has notably challenged traditional denoising methods, particularly within complex noise scenarios prevalent in medical imaging. Despite the effectiveness of traditional and some DNN-based methods, their reliance on high-quality, noiseless ground truth images limits their practical utility. In response to this, our work introduces and benchmarks innovative unsupervised learning strategies, notably Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE), its extension (eSURE), and our novel implementation, the Extended Poisson Unbiased Risk Estimator (ePURE), within medical imaging frameworks.   This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of these methods on MRI data afflicted with Gaussian and Poisson noise types, a scenario typical in medical imaging but challenging for most denoising algorithms. Our main contribution lies in the effective adaptation and implementation of the SURE, eSURE, and particularly the ePURE frameworks for medical images, showcasing their robustness and efficacy in environments where traditional noiseless ground truth cannot be obtained.

- **Summary**: Progress in machine understanding of sign languages has been slow and hampered by limited data. In this paper, we present FSboard, an American Sign Language fingerspelling dataset situated in a mobile text entry use case, collected from 147 paid and consenting Deaf signers using Pixel 4A selfie cameras in a variety of environments. Fingerspelling recognition is an incomplete solution that is only one small part of sign language translation, but it could provide some immediate benefit to Deaf/Hard of Hearing signers as more broadly capable technology develops. At >3 million characters in length and >250 hours in duration, FSboard is the largest fingerspelling recognition dataset to date by a factor of >10x. As a simple baseline, we finetune 30 Hz MediaPipe Holistic landmark inputs into ByT5-Small and achieve 11.1% Character Error Rate (CER) on a test set with unique phrases and signers. This quality degrades gracefully when decreasing frame rate and excluding face/body landmarks: plausible optimizations to help models run on device in real time.

- **Summary**: Facial Recognition Systems (FRSs) are being developed and deployed globally at unprecedented rates. Most platforms are designed in a limited set of countries but deployed in worldwide, without adequate checkpoints. This is especially problematic for Global South countries which lack strong legislation to safeguard persons facing disparate performance of these systems. A combination of unavailability of datasets, lack of understanding of FRS functionality and low-resource bias mitigation measures accentuate the problem. In this work, we propose a new face dataset composed of 6,579 unique male and female sportspersons from eight countries around the world. More than 50% of the dataset comprises individuals from the Global South countries and is demographically diverse. To aid adversarial audits and robust model training, each image has four adversarial variants, totaling over 40,000 images. We also benchmark five popular FRSs, both commercial and open-source, for the task of gender prediction (and country prediction for one of the open-source models as an example of red-teaming). Experiments on industrial FRSs reveal accuracies ranging from 98.2%--38.1%, with a large disparity between males and females in the Global South (max difference of 38.5%). Biases are also observed in all FRSs between females of the Global North and South (max difference of ~50%). Grad-CAM analysis identifies the nose, forehead and mouth as the regions of interest on one of the open-source FRSs. Utilizing this insight, we design simple, low-resource bias mitigation solutions using few-shot and novel contrastive learning techniques significantly improving the accuracy with disparity between males and females reducing from 50% to 1.5% in one of the settings. In the red-teaming experiment with the open-source Deepface model, contrastive learning proves more effective than simple fine-tuning.

- **Summary**: As scaling laws in generative AI push performance, they also simultaneously concentrate the development of these models among actors with large computational resources. With a focus on text-to-image (T2I) generative models, we aim to address this bottleneck by demonstrating very low-cost training of large-scale T2I diffusion transformer models. As the computational cost of transformers increases with the number of patches in each image, we propose to randomly mask up to 75% of the image patches during training. We propose a deferred masking strategy that preprocesses all patches using a patch-mixer before masking, thus significantly reducing the performance degradation with masking, making it superior to model downscaling in reducing computational cost. We also incorporate the latest improvements in transformer architecture, such as the use of mixture-of-experts layers, to improve performance and further identify the critical benefit of using synthetic images in micro-budget training. Finally, using only 37M publicly available real and synthetic images, we train a 1.16 billion parameter sparse transformer with only \$1,890 economical cost and achieve a 12.7 FID in zero-shot generation on the COCO dataset. Notably, our model achieves competitive FID and high-quality generations while incurring 118$\times$ lower cost than stable diffusion models and 14$\times$ lower cost than the current state-of-the-art approach that costs \$28,400. We aim to release our end-to-end training pipeline to further democratize the training of large-scale diffusion models on micro-budgets.

- **Summary**: Can we endow visuomotor robots with generalization capabilities to operate in diverse open-world scenarios? In this paper, we propose \textbf{Maniwhere}, a generalizable framework tailored for visual reinforcement learning, enabling the trained robot policies to generalize across a combination of multiple visual disturbance types. Specifically, we introduce a multi-view representation learning approach fused with Spatial Transformer Network (STN) module to capture shared semantic information and correspondences among different viewpoints. In addition, we employ a curriculum-based randomization and augmentation approach to stabilize the RL training process and strengthen the visual generalization ability. To exhibit the effectiveness of Maniwhere, we meticulously design 8 tasks encompassing articulate objects, bi-manual, and dexterous hand manipulation tasks, demonstrating Maniwhere's strong visual generalization and sim2real transfer abilities across 3 hardware platforms. Our experiments show that Maniwhere significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Videos are provided at https://gemcollector.github.io/maniwhere/.

- **Summary**: Molecular testing of tumor samples for targetable biomarkers is restricted by a lack of standardization, turnaround-time, cost, and tissue availability across cancer types. Additionally, targetable alterations of low prevalence may not be tested in routine workflows. Algorithms that predict DNA alterations from routinely generated hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained images could prioritize samples for confirmatory molecular testing. Costs and the necessity of a large number of samples containing mutations limit approaches that train individual algorithms for each alteration. In this work, models were trained for simultaneous prediction of multiple DNA alterations from H&E images using a multi-task approach. Compared to biomarker-specific models, this approach performed better on average, with pronounced gains for rare mutations. The models reasonably generalized to independent temporal-holdout, externally-stained, and multi-site TCGA test sets. Additionally, whole slide image embeddings derived using multi-task models demonstrated strong performance in downstream tasks that were not a part of training. Overall, this is a promising approach to develop clinically useful algorithms that provide multiple actionable predictions from a single slide.

- **Summary**: Accurately segmenting and individualizing cells in SEM images is a highly promising technique for elucidating tissue architecture in oncology. While current AI-based methods are effective, errors persist, necessitating time-consuming manual corrections, particularly in areas where the quality of cell contours in the image is poor and requires gap filling. This study presents a novel AI-driven approach for refining cell boundary delineation to improve instance-based cell segmentation in SEM images, also reducing the necessity for residual manual correction. A CNN COp-Net is introduced to address gaps in cell contours, effectively filling in regions with deficient or absent information. The network takes as input cell contour probability maps with potentially inadequate or missing information and outputs corrected cell contour delineations. The lack of training data was addressed by generating low integrity probability maps using a tailored PDE. We showcase the efficacy of our approach in augmenting cell boundary precision using both private SEM images from PDX hepatoblastoma tissues and publicly accessible images datasets. The proposed cell contour closing operator exhibits a notable improvement in tested datasets, achieving respectively close to 50% (private data) and 10% (public data) increase in the accurately-delineated cell proportion compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the need for manual corrections was significantly reduced, therefore facilitating the overall digitalization process. Our results demonstrate a notable enhancement in the accuracy of cell instance segmentation, particularly in highly challenging regions where image quality compromises the integrity of cell boundaries, necessitating gap filling. Therefore, our work should ultimately facilitate the study of tumour tissue bioarchitecture in onconanotomy field.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces Chain-of-Sight, a vision-language bridge module that accelerates the pre-training of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our approach employs a sequence of visual resamplers that capture visual details at various spacial scales. This architecture not only leverages global and local visual contexts effectively, but also facilitates the flexible extension of visual tokens through a compound token scaling strategy, allowing up to a 16x increase in the token count post pre-training. Consequently, Chain-of-Sight requires significantly fewer visual tokens in the pre-training phase compared to the fine-tuning phase. This intentional reduction of visual tokens during pre-training notably accelerates the pre-training process, cutting down the wall-clock training time by ~73%. Empirical results on a series of vision-language benchmarks reveal that the pre-train acceleration through Chain-of-Sight is achieved without sacrificing performance, matching or surpassing the standard pipeline of utilizing all visual tokens throughout the entire training process. Further scaling up the number of visual tokens for pre-training leads to stronger performances, competitive to existing approaches in a series of benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has emerged as a promising method for deriving visual representations from unlabeled image data by predicting missing pixels from masked portions of images. It excels in region-aware learning and provides strong initializations for various tasks, but struggles to capture high-level semantics without further supervised fine-tuning, likely due to the low-level nature of its pixel reconstruction objective. A promising yet unrealized framework is learning representations through masked reconstruction in latent space, combining the locality of MIM with the high-level targets. However, this approach poses significant training challenges as the reconstruction targets are learned in conjunction with the model, potentially leading to trivial or suboptimal solutions.Our study is among the first to thoroughly analyze and address the challenges of such framework, which we refer to as Latent MIM. Through a series of carefully designed experiments and extensive analysis, we identify the source of these challenges, including representation collapsing for joint online/target optimization, learning objectives, the high region correlation in latent space and decoding conditioning. By sequentially addressing these issues, we demonstrate that Latent MIM can indeed learn high-level representations while retaining the benefits of MIM models.

- **Summary**: Despite the effectiveness of vision-language supervised fine-tuning in enhancing the performance of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). However, existing visual instruction tuning datasets include the following limitations: (1) Instruction annotation quality: despite existing VLLMs exhibiting strong performance, instructions generated by those advanced VLLMs may still suffer from inaccuracies, such as hallucinations. (2) Instructions and image diversity: the limited range of instruction types and the lack of diversity in image data may impact the model's ability to generate diversified and closer to real-world scenarios outputs. To address these challenges, we construct a high-quality, diverse visual instruction tuning dataset MMInstruct, which consists of 973K instructions from 24 domains. There are four instruction types: Judgement, Multiple-Choice, Long Visual Question Answering and Short Visual Question Answering. To construct MMInstruct, we propose an instruction generation data engine that leverages GPT-4V, GPT-3.5, and manual correction. Our instruction generation engine enables semi-automatic, low-cost, and multi-domain instruction generation at 1/6 the cost of manual construction. Through extensive experiment validation and ablation experiments, we demonstrate that MMInstruct could significantly improve the performance of VLLMs, e.g., the model fine-tuning on MMInstruct achieves new state-of-the-art performance on 10 out of 12 benchmarks. The code and data shall be available at https://github.com/yuecao0119/MMInstruct.

- **Summary**: We propose SlowFast-LLaVA (or SF-LLaVA for short), a training-free video large language model (LLM) that can jointly capture the detailed spatial semantics and long-range temporal context without exceeding the token budget of commonly used LLMs. This is realized by using a two-stream SlowFast design of inputs for Video LLMs to aggregate features from sampled video frames in an effective way. Specifically, the Slow pathway extracts features at a low frame rate while keeping as many spatial details as possible (e.g., with 24x24 tokens), and the Fast pathway operates on a high frame rate but uses a larger spatial pooling stride (e.g., downsampling 6x) to focus on the motion cues. As a result, this design allows us to adequately capture both spatial and temporal features that are beneficial for understanding details along the video. Experimental results show that SF-LLaVA outperforms existing training-free methods on a wide range of video tasks. On some benchmarks, it achieves comparable or even better performance compared to state-of-the-art Video LLMs that are fine-tuned on video datasets.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models entangle content and style generation during the denoising process, leading to undesired content modification when directly applied to stylization tasks. Existing methods struggle to effectively control the diffusion model to meet the aesthetic-level requirements for stylization. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Artist}, a training-free approach that aesthetically controls the content and style generation of a pretrained diffusion model for text-driven stylization. Our key insight is to disentangle the denoising of content and style into separate diffusion processes while sharing information between them. We propose simple yet effective content and style control methods that suppress style-irrelevant content generation, resulting in harmonious stylization results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method excels at achieving aesthetic-level stylization requirements, preserving intricate details in the content image and aligning well with the style prompt. Furthermore, we showcase the highly controllability of the stylization strength from various perspectives. Code will be released, project home page: https://DiffusionArtist.github.io

- **Summary**: The choice of representation plays a key role in self-driving. Bird's eye view (BEV) representations have shown remarkable performance in recent years. In this paper, we propose to learn object-centric representations in BEV to distill a complex scene into more actionable information for self-driving. We first learn to place objects into slots with a slot attention model on BEV sequences. Based on these object-centric representations, we then train a transformer to learn to drive as well as reason about the future of other vehicles. We found that object-centric slot representations outperform both scene-level and object-level approaches that use the exact attributes of objects. Slot representations naturally incorporate information about objects from their spatial and temporal context such as position, heading, and speed without explicitly providing it. Our model with slots achieves an increased completion rate of the provided routes and, consequently, a higher driving score, with a lower variance across multiple runs, affirming slots as a reliable alternative in object-centric approaches. Additionally, we validate our model's performance as a world model through forecasting experiments, demonstrating its capability to predict future slot representations accurately. The code and the pre-trained models can be found at https://kuis-ai.github.io/CarFormer/.

- **Summary**: Predicting camera-space hand meshes from single RGB images is crucial for enabling realistic hand interactions in 3D virtual and augmented worlds. Previous work typically divided the task into two stages: given a cropped image of the hand, predict meshes in relative coordinates, followed by lifting these predictions into camera space in a separate and independent stage, often resulting in the loss of valuable contextual and scale information. To prevent the loss of these cues, we propose unifying these two stages into an end-to-end solution that addresses the 2D-3D correspondence problem. This solution enables back-propagation from camera space outputs to the rest of the network through a new differentiable global positioning module. We also introduce an image rectification step that harmonizes both the training dataset and the input image as if they were acquired with the same camera, helping to alleviate the inherent scale-depth ambiguity of the problem. We validate the effectiveness of our framework in evaluations against several baselines and state-of-the-art approaches across three public benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Current methods for reconstructing training data from trained classifiers are restricted to very small models, limited training set sizes, and low-resolution images. Such restrictions hinder their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel approach enabling data reconstruction in realistic settings for models trained on high-resolution images. Our method adapts the reconstruction scheme of arXiv:2206.07758 to real-world scenarios -- specifically, targeting models trained via transfer learning over image embeddings of large pre-trained models like DINO-ViT and CLIP. Our work employs data reconstruction in the embedding space rather than in the image space, showcasing its applicability beyond visual data. Moreover, we introduce a novel clustering-based method to identify good reconstructions from thousands of candidates. This significantly improves on previous works that relied on knowledge of the training set to identify good reconstructed images. Our findings shed light on a potential privacy risk for data leakage from models trained using transfer learning.

Generalizable and MVS-based NeRFs, although capable of mitigating training time, often incur tradeoffs in quality. This paper presents a novel approach called BoostMVSNeRFs to enhance the rendering quality of MVS-based NeRFs in large-scale scenes. We first identify limitations in MVS-based NeRF methods, such as restricted viewport coverage and artifacts due to limited input views. Then, we address these limitations by proposing a new method that selects and combines multiple cost volumes during volume rendering. Our method does not require training and can adapt to any MVS-based NeRF methods in a feed-forward fashion to improve rendering quality. Furthermore, our approach is also end-to-end trainable, allowing fine-tuning on specific scenes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on large-scale datasets, showing significant rendering quality improvements in large-scale scenes and unbounded outdoor scenarios. We release the source code of BoostMVSNeRFs at https://su-terry.github.io/BoostMVSNeRFs/.

- **Summary**: Our objective is to generate Audio Descriptions (ADs) for both movies and TV series in a training-free manner. We use the power of off-the-shelf Visual-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), and develop visual and text prompting strategies for this task. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) We demonstrate that a VLM can successfully name and refer to characters if directly prompted with character information through visual indications without requiring any fine-tuning; (ii) A two-stage process is developed to generate ADs, with the first stage asking the VLM to comprehensively describe the video, followed by a second stage utilising a LLM to summarise dense textual information into one succinct AD sentence; (iii) A new dataset for TV audio description is formulated. Our approach, named AutoAD-Zero, demonstrates outstanding performance (even competitive with some models fine-tuned on ground truth ADs) in AD generation for both movies and TV series, achieving state-of-the-art CRITIC scores.
