- **Summary**: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) is a critical task in video analysis, identifying precise start and end times of actions. Existing methods like CNNs, RNNs, GCNs, and Transformers have limitations in capturing long-range dependencies and temporal causality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel TAL architecture leveraging the Selective State Space Model (S6). Our approach integrates the Feature Aggregated Bi-S6 block, Dual Bi-S6 structure, and a recurrent mechanism to enhance temporal and channel-wise dependency modeling without increasing parameter complexity. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results with mAP scores of 74.2% on THUMOS-14, 42.9% on ActivityNet, 29.6% on FineAction, and 45.8% on HACS. Ablation studies validate our method's effectiveness, showing that the Dual structure in the Stem module and the recurrent mechanism outperform traditional approaches. Our findings demonstrate the potential of S6-based models in TAL tasks, paving the way for future research.

- **Summary**: While rendering and animation of photorealistic 3D human body models have matured and reached an impressive quality over the past years, modeling the spatial audio associated with such full body models has been largely ignored so far. In this work, we present a framework that allows for high-quality spatial audio generation, capable of rendering the full 3D soundfield generated by a human body, including speech, footsteps, hand-body interactions, and others. Given a basic audio-visual representation of the body in form of 3D body pose and audio from a head-mounted microphone, we demonstrate that we can render the full acoustic scene at any point in 3D space efficiently and accurately. To enable near-field and realtime rendering of sound, we borrow the idea of volumetric primitives from graphical neural rendering and transfer them into the acoustic domain. Our acoustic primitives result in an order of magnitude smaller soundfield representations and overcome deficiencies in near-field rendering compared to previous approaches.

- **Summary**: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging is pivotal in diagnosing ophthalmic conditions by providing detailed cross-sectional images of the anterior and posterior segments of the eye. Nonetheless, speckle noise and other imaging artifacts inherent to OCT impede the accuracy of diagnosis significantly. In this study, we proposed an enhanced denoising model using a Residual U-Net architecture that effectively diminishes noise and improves image clarity across both Anterior Segment OCT (ASOCT) and polarization-sensitive OCT (PSOCT) images. Our approach demonstrated substantial improvements in image quality metrics: the Peak Signal Noise Ratio (PSNR) was 34.343 $\pm$ 1.113 for PSOCT images, and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) values were 0.885 $\pm$ 0.030, indicating enhanced preservation of tissue integrity and textural details. For ASOCT images, we observed the PSNR to be 23.525 $\pm$ 0.872 dB and SSIM 0.407 $\pm$ 0.044, reflecting significant enhancements in visual quality and structural accuracy. These metrics substantiate the models efficacy in not only reducing noise but also in maintaining crucial anatomical features, thereby enabling more precise and efficient clinical evaluations. The dual functionality across both ASOCT and PSOCT modalities underscores the versatility and potential for broad application in clinical settings, optimizing diagnostic processes and reducing the necessity for prolonged imaging sessions.

- **Summary**: The accurate diagnosis of pathological subtypes of lung cancer is of paramount importance for follow-up treatments and prognosis managements. Assessment methods utilizing deep learning technologies have introduced novel approaches for clinical diagnosis. However, the majority of existing models rely solely on single-modality image input, leading to limited diagnostic accuracy. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning network designed to accurately classify lung cancer subtype with multi-dimensional and multi-modality images, i.e., CT and pathological images. The strength of the proposed model lies in its ability to dynamically process both paired CT-pathological image sets as well as independent CT image sets, and consequently optimize the pathology-related feature extractions from CT images. This adaptive learning approach enhances the flexibility in processing multi-dimensional and multi-modality datasets and results in performance elevating in the model testing phase. We also develop a contrastive constraint module, which quantitatively maps the cross-modality associations through network training, and thereby helps to explore the "gold standard" pathological information from the corresponding CT scans. To evaluate the effectiveness, adaptability, and generalization ability of our model, we conducted extensive experiments on a large-scale multi-center dataset and compared our model with a series of state-of-the-art classification models. The experimental results demonstrated the superiority of our model for lung cancer subtype classification, showcasing significant improvements in accuracy metrics such as ACC, AUC, and F1-score.

- **Summary**: Recent video-text foundation models have demonstrated strong performance on a wide variety of downstream video understanding tasks. Can these video-text models genuinely understand the contents of natural videos? Standard video-text evaluations could be misleading as many questions can be inferred merely from the objects and contexts in a single frame or biases inherent in the datasets. In this paper, we aim to better assess the capabilities of current video-text models and understand their limitations. We propose a novel evaluation task for video-text understanding, namely retrieval from counterfactually augmented data (RCAD), and a new Feint6K dataset. To succeed on our new evaluation task, models must derive a comprehensive understanding of the video from cross-frame reasoning. Analyses show that previous video-text foundation models can be easily fooled by counterfactually augmented data and are far behind human-level performance. In order to narrow the gap between video-text models and human performance on RCAD, we identify a key limitation of current contrastive approaches on video-text data and introduce LLM-teacher, a more effective approach to learn action semantics by leveraging knowledge obtained from a pretrained large language model. Experiments and analyses show that our approach successfully learn more discriminative action embeddings and improves results on Feint6K when applied to multiple video-text models.

- **Summary**: Audio-visual generalized zero-shot learning is a rapidly advancing domain that seeks to understand the intricate relations between audio and visual cues within videos. The overarching goal is to leverage insights from seen classes to identify instances from previously unseen ones. Prior approaches primarily utilized synchronized auto-encoders to reconstruct audio-visual attributes, which were informed by cross-attention transformers and projected text embeddings. However, these methods fell short of effectively capturing the intricate relationship between cross-modal features and class-label embeddings inherent in pre-trained language-aligned embeddings. To circumvent these bottlenecks, we introduce a simple yet effective framework for Easy Audio-Visual Generalized Zero-shot Learning, named EZ-AVGZL, that aligns audio-visual embeddings with transformed text representations. It utilizes a single supervised text audio-visual contrastive loss to learn an alignment between audio-visual and textual modalities, moving away from the conventional approach of reconstructing cross-modal features and text embeddings. Our key insight is that while class name embeddings are well aligned with language-based audio-visual features, they don't provide sufficient class separation to be useful for zero-shot learning. To address this, our method leverages differential optimization to transform class embeddings into a more discriminative space while preserving the semantic structure of language representations. We conduct extensive experiments on VGGSound-GZSL, UCF-GZSL, and ActivityNet-GZSL benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that our EZ-AVGZL achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio-visual generalized zero-shot learning.

- **Summary**: Earth's forests play an important role in the fight against climate change, and are in turn negatively affected by it. Effective monitoring of different tree species is essential to understanding and improving the health and biodiversity of forests. In this work, we address the challenge of tree species identification by performing semantic segmentation of trees using an aerial image dataset spanning over a year. We compare models trained on single images versus those trained on time series to assess the impact of tree phenology on segmentation performances. We also introduce a simple convolutional block for extracting spatio-temporal features from image time series, enabling the use of popular pretrained backbones and methods. We leverage the hierarchical structure of tree species taxonomy by incorporating a custom loss function that refines predictions at three levels: species, genus, and higher-level taxa. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of our methodology in exploiting the time series modality and confirm that enriching labels using taxonomic information improves the semantic segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: Compressed Image Super-resolution (CSR) aims to simultaneously super-resolve the compressed images and tackle the challenging hybrid distortions caused by compression. However, existing works on CSR usually focuses on a single compression codec, i.e., JPEG, ignoring the diverse traditional or learning-based codecs in the practical application, e.g., HEVC, VVC, HIFIC, etc. In this work, we propose the first universal CSR framework, dubbed UCIP, with dynamic prompt learning, intending to jointly support the CSR distortions of any compression codecs/modes. Particularly, an efficient dynamic prompt strategy is proposed to mine the content/spatial-aware task-adaptive contextual information for the universal CSR task, using only a small amount of prompts with spatial size 1x1. To simplify contextual information mining, we introduce the novel MLP-like framework backbone for our UCIP by adapting the Active Token Mixer (ATM) to CSR tasks for the first time, where the global information modeling is only taken in horizontal and vertical directions with offset prediction. We also build an all-in-one benchmark dataset for the CSR task by collecting the datasets with the popular 6 diverse traditional and learning-based codecs, including JPEG, HEVC, VVC, HIFIC, etc., resulting in 23 common degradations. Extensive experiments have shown the consistent and excellent performance of our UCIP on universal CSR tasks. The project can be found in https://lixinustc.github.io/UCIP.github.io

  Adversarial Attacks on Vision Foundation Models
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Vision foundation models are increasingly employed in autonomous driving systems due to their advanced capabilities. However, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, posing significant risks to the reliability and safety of autonomous vehicles. Adversaries can exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate the vehicle's perception of its surroundings, leading to erroneous decisions and potentially catastrophic consequences. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Precision-Guided Adversarial Attack (PG-Attack) framework that combines two techniques: Precision Mask Perturbation Attack (PMP-Attack) and Deceptive Text Patch Attack (DTP-Attack). PMP-Attack precisely targets the attack region to minimize the overall perturbation while maximizing its impact on the target object's representation in the model's feature space. DTP-Attack introduces deceptive text patches that disrupt the model's understanding of the scene, further enhancing the attack's effectiveness. Our experiments demonstrate that PG-Attack successfully deceives a variety of advanced multi-modal large models, including GPT-4V, Qwen-VL, and imp-V1. Additionally, we won First-Place in the CVPR 2024 Workshop Challenge: Black-box Adversarial Attacks on Vision Foundation Models and codes are available at https://github.com/fuhaha824/PG-Attack.

- **Summary**: Preconditioned Proximal Point (PPP) algorithms provide a unified framework for splitting methods in image restoration. Recent advancements with RED (Regularization by Denoising) and PnP (Plug-and-Play) priors have achieved state-of-the-art performance in this domain, emphasizing the need for a meaningful particular solution. However, degenerate PPP algorithms typically exhibit weak convergence in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, leading to uncertain solutions. To address this issue, we propose the Halpern-type Preconditioned Proximal Point (HPPP) algorithm, which leverages the strong convergence properties of Halpern iteration to achieve a particular solution. Based on the implicit regularization defined by gradient RED, we further introduce the Gradient REgularization by Denoising via HPPP called GraRED-HP3 algorithm. The HPPP algorithm is shown to have the regularity converging to a particular solution by a toy example. Additionally, experiments in image deblurring and inpainting validate the effectiveness of GraRED-HP3, showing it surpasses classical methods such as Chambolle-Pock (CP), PPP, RED, and RED-PRO.

- **Summary**: Smoke generated by surgical instruments during laparoscopic surgery can obscure the visual field, impairing surgeons' ability to perform operations accurately and safely. Thus, smoke removal task for laparoscopic images is highly desirable. Despite laparoscopic image desmoking has attracted the attention of researchers in recent years and several algorithms have emerged, the lack of publicly available high-quality benchmark datasets is the main bottleneck to hamper the development progress of this task. To advance this field, we construct a new high-quality dataset for Laparoscopic Surgery image Desmoking, named LSD3K, consisting of 3,000 paired synthetic non-homogeneous smoke images. In this paper, we provide a dataset generation pipeline, which includes modeling smoke shape using Blender, collecting ground-truth images from the Cholec80 dataset, random sampling of smoke masks and etc. Based on the proposed benchmark, we further conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the existing representative desmoking algorithms. The proposed dataset is publicly available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v0U5_3S4nJpaUiP898Q0pc-MfEAtnbOq/view?usp=sharing

- **Summary**: Detecting objects seamlessly blended into their surroundings represents a complex task for both human cognitive capabilities and advanced artificial intelligence algorithms. Currently, the majority of methodologies for detecting camouflaged objects mainly focus on utilizing discriminative models with various unique designs. However, it has been observed that generative models, such as Stable Diffusion, possess stronger capabilities for understanding various objects in complex environments; Yet their potential for the cognition and detection of camouflaged objects has not been extensively explored. In this study, we present a novel denoising diffusion model, namely FocusDiffuser, to investigate how generative models can enhance the detection and interpretation of camouflaged objects. We believe that the secret to spotting camouflaged objects lies in catching the subtle nuances in details. Consequently, our FocusDiffuser innovatively integrates specialized enhancements, notably the Boundary-Driven LookUp (BDLU) module and Cyclic Positioning (CP) module, to elevate standard diffusion models, significantly boosting the detail-oriented analytical capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that FocusDiffuser, from a generative perspective, effectively addresses the challenge of camouflaged object detection, surpassing leading models on benchmarks like CAMO, COD10K and NC4K.



### OE-BevSeg: An Object Informed and Environment Aware Multimodal Framework for Bird's-eye-view Vehicle Semantic Segmentation

- **Summary**: Bird's-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation is becoming crucial in autonomous driving systems. It realizes ego-vehicle surrounding environment perception by projecting 2D multi-view images into 3D world space. Recently, BEV segmentation has made notable progress, attributed to better view transformation modules, larger image encoders, or more temporal information. However, there are still two issues: 1) a lack of effective understanding and enhancement of BEV space features, particularly in accurately capturing long-distance environmental features and 2) recognizing fine details of target objects. To address these issues, we propose OE-BevSeg, an end-to-end multimodal framework that enhances BEV segmentation performance through global environment-aware perception and local target object enhancement. OE-BevSeg employs an environment-aware BEV compressor. Based on prior knowledge about the main composition of the BEV surrounding environment varying with the increase of distance intervals, long-sequence global modeling is utilized to improve the model's understanding and perception of the environment. From the perspective of enriching target object information in segmentation results, we introduce the center-informed object enhancement module, using centerness information to supervise and guide the segmentation head, thereby enhancing segmentation performance from a local enhancement perspective. Additionally, we designed a multimodal fusion branch that integrates multi-view RGB image features with radar/LiDAR features, achieving significant performance improvements. Extensive experiments show that, whether in camera-only or multimodal fusion BEV segmentation tasks, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results by a large margin on the nuScenes dataset for vehicle segmentation, demonstrating superior applicability in the field of autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: This is the technique report for the winning solution of the CVPR2024 GenAI Media Generation Challenge Workshop's Instruction-guided Image Editing track. Instruction-guided image editing has been largely studied in recent years. The most advanced methods, such as SmartEdit and MGIE, usually combine large language models with diffusion models through joint training, where the former provides text understanding ability, and the latter provides image generation ability. However, in our experiments, we find that simply connecting large language models and image generation models through intermediary guidance such as masks instead of joint fine-tuning leads to a better editing performance and success rate. We use a 4-step process IIIE (Inpainting-based Instruction-guided Image Editing): editing category classification, main editing object identification, editing mask acquisition, and image inpainting. Results show that through proper combinations of language models and image inpainting models, our pipeline can reach a high success rate with satisfying visual quality.



### DFMSD: Dual Feature Masking Stage-wise Knowledge Distillation for Object Detection

- **Summary**: In recent years, current mainstream feature masking distillation methods mainly function by reconstructing selectively masked regions of a student network from the feature maps of a teacher network. In these methods, attention mechanisms can help to identify spatially important regions and crucial object-aware channel clues, such that the reconstructed features are encoded with sufficient discriminative and representational power similar to teacher features. However, previous feature-masking distillation methods mainly address homogeneous knowledge distillation without fully taking into account the heterogeneous knowledge distillation scenario. In particular, the huge discrepancy between the teacher and the student frameworks within the heterogeneous distillation paradigm is detrimental to feature masking, leading to deteriorating reconstructed student features. In this study, a novel dual feature-masking heterogeneous distillation framework termed DFMSD is proposed for object detection. More specifically, a stage-wise adaptation learning module is incorporated into the dual feature-masking framework, and thus the student model can be progressively adapted to the teacher models for bridging the gap between heterogeneous networks. Furthermore, a masking enhancement strategy is combined with stage-wise learning such that object-aware masking regions are adaptively strengthened to improve feature-masking reconstruction. In addition, semantic alignment is performed at each Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) layer between the teacher and the student networks for generating consistent feature distributions. Our experiments for the object detection task demonstrate the promise of our approach, suggesting that DFMSD outperforms both the state-of-the-art heterogeneous and homogeneous distillation methods.

- **Summary**: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image change detection is critical in remote sensing image analysis. Recently, the attention mechanism has been widely used in change detection tasks. However, existing attention mechanisms often employ down-sampling operations such as average pooling on the Key and Value components to enhance computational efficiency. These irreversible operations result in the loss of high-frequency components and other important information. To address this limitation, we develop Wavelet-based Bi-dimensional Aggregation Network (WBANet) for SAR image change detection. We design a wavelet-based self-attention block that includes discrete wavelet transform and inverse discrete wavelet transform operations on Key and Value components. Hence, the feature undergoes downsampling without any loss of information, while simultaneously enhancing local contextual awareness through an expanded receptive field. Additionally, we have incorporated a bi-dimensional aggregation module that boosts the non-linear representation capability by merging spatial and channel information via broadcast mechanism. Experimental results on three SAR datasets demonstrate that our WBANet significantly outperforms contemporary state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our WBANet achieves 98.33\%, 96.65\%, and 96.62\% of percentage of correct classification (PCC) on the respective datasets, highlighting its superior performance.

- **Summary**: Occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving (AD) due to the fine-grained geometric perception and general object recognition capabilities. However, existing methods often incur high computational costs, which contradicts the real-time demands of AD. To this end, we first evaluate the speed and memory usage of most public available methods, aiming to redirect the focus from solely prioritizing accuracy to also considering efficiency. We then identify a core challenge in achieving both fast and accurate performance: \textbf{the strong coupling between geometry and semantic}. To address this issue, 1) we propose a Geometric-Semantic Dual-Branch Network (GSDBN) with a hybrid BEV-Voxel representation. In the BEV branch, a BEV-level temporal fusion module and a U-Net encoder is introduced to extract dense semantic features. In the voxel branch, a large-kernel re-parameterized 3D convolution is proposed to refine sparse 3D geometry and reduce computation. Moreover, we propose a novel BEV-Voxel lifting module that projects BEV features into voxel space for feature fusion of the two branches. In addition to the network design, 2) we also propose a Geometric-Semantic Decoupled Learning (GSDL) strategy. This strategy initially learns semantics with accurate geometry using ground-truth depth, and then gradually mixes predicted depth to adapt the model to the predicted geometry. Extensive experiments on the widely-used Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method, which achieves a 39.4 mIoU with 20.0 FPS. This result is $\sim 3 \times$ faster and +1.9 mIoU higher compared to FB-OCC, the winner of CVPR2023 3D Occupancy Prediction Challenge. Our code will be made open-source.

- **Summary**: Existing Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) methods rely heavily on large-scale pixel-annotated training sets, which are both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although weakly supervised methods offer higher annotation efficiency, their performance is far behind due to the unclear visual demarcations between foreground and background in camouflaged images. In this paper, we explore the potential of using boxes as prompts in camouflaged scenes and introduce the first weakly semi-supervised COD method, aiming for budget-efficient and high-precision camouflaged object segmentation with an extremely limited number of fully labeled images. Critically, learning from such limited set inevitably generates pseudo labels with serious noisy pixels. To address this, we propose a noise correction loss that facilitates the model's learning of correct pixels in the early learning stage, and corrects the error risk gradients dominated by noisy pixels in the memorization stage, ultimately achieving accurate segmentation of camouflaged objects from noisy labels. When using only 20% of fully labeled data, our method shows superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the challenge of improving learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) in underwater environments by integrating principles of underwater optical imaging to manipulate optical flow estimation. Leveraging the inherent properties of underwater imaging, the novel wflow-TartanVO is introduced, enhancing the accuracy of VO systems for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The proposed method utilizes a normalized medium transmission map as a weight map to adjust the estimated optical flow for emphasizing regions with lower degradation and suppressing uncertain regions affected by underwater light scattering and absorption. wflow-TartanVO does not require fine-tuning of pre-trained VO models, thus promoting its adaptability to different environments and camera models. Evaluation of different real-world underwater datasets demonstrates the outperformance of wflow-TartanVO over baseline VO methods, as evidenced by the considerably reduced Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE). The implementation code is available at: https://github.com/bachzz/wflow-TartanVO

- **Summary**: Minimally invasive robotic surgery has gained significant attention over the past two decades. Telerobotic systems, combined with robot-mediated minimally invasive techniques, have enabled surgeons and clinicians to mitigate radiation exposure for medical staff and extend medical services to remote and hard-to-reach areas. To enhance these services, teleoperated robotic surgery systems incorporating master and follower devices should offer transparency, enabling surgeons and clinicians to remotely experience a force interaction similar to the one the follower device experiences with patients' bodies. This paper presents the design and development of a three-degree-of-freedom master-follower teleoperated system for robotic catheterization. To resemble manual intervention by clinicians, the follower device features a grip-insert-release mechanism to eliminate catheter buckling and torsion during operation. The bidirectionally navigable ablation catheter is statically characterized for force-interactive medical interventions. The system's performance is evaluated through approaching and open-loop path tracking over typical circular, infinity-like, and spiral paths. Path tracking errors are presented as mean Euclidean error (MEE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The MEE ranges from 0.64 cm (infinity-like path) to 1.53 cm (spiral path). The MAE also ranges from 0.81 cm (infinity-like path) to 1.92 cm (spiral path). The results indicate that while the system's precision and accuracy with an open-loop controller meet the design targets, closed-loop controllers are necessary to address the catheter's hysteresis and dead zone, and system nonlinearities.

- **Summary**: Despite recent strides made by AI in image processing, the issue of mixed exposure, pivotal in many real-world scenarios like surveillance and photography, remains inadequately addressed. Traditional image enhancement techniques and current transformer models are limited with primary focus on either overexposure or underexposure. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Unified-Exposure Guided Transformer (Unified-EGformer). Our proposed solution is built upon advanced transformer architectures, equipped with local pixel-level refinement and global refinement blocks for color correction and image-wide adjustments. We employ a guided attention mechanism to precisely identify exposure-compromised regions, ensuring its adaptability across various real-world conditions. U-EGformer, with a lightweight design featuring a memory footprint (peak memory) of only $\sim$1134 MB (0.1 Million parameters) and an inference time of 95 ms (9.61x faster than the average), is a viable choice for real-time applications such as surveillance and autonomous navigation. Additionally, our model is highly generalizable, requiring minimal fine-tuning to handle multiple tasks and datasets with a single architecture.

- **Summary**: The paper provides a mathematical view to the binary numbers presented in the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) feature extraction process. Symmetric finite difference is often applied in numerical analysis to enhance the accuracy of approximations. Then, the paper investigates utilization of the symmetric finite difference in the LBP formulation for face detection and facial expression recognition. It introduces a novel approach that extends the standard LBP, which typically employs eight directional derivatives, to incorporate only four directional derivatives. This approach is named symmetric LBP. The number of LBP features is reduced to 16 from 256 by the use of the symmetric LBP. The study underscores the significance of the number of directions considered in the new approach. Consequently, the results obtained emphasize the importance of the research topic.

- **Summary**: High dynamic range (HDR) capture and display have seen significant growth in popularity driven by the advancements in technology and increasing consumer demand for superior image quality. As a result, HDR image compression is crucial to fully realize the benefits of HDR imaging without suffering from large file sizes and inefficient data handling. Conventionally, this is achieved by introducing a residual/gain map as additional metadata to bridge the gap between HDR and low dynamic range (LDR) images, making the former compatible with LDR image codecs but offering suboptimal rate-distortion performance. In this work, we initiate efforts towards end-to-end optimized HDR image compression for perceptually optimal storage and display. Specifically, we learn to compress an HDR image into two bitstreams: one for generating an LDR image to ensure compatibility with legacy LDR displays, and another as side information to aid HDR image reconstruction from the output LDR image. To measure the perceptual quality of output HDR and LDR images, we use two recently proposed image distortion metrics, both validated against human perceptual data of image quality and with reference to the uncompressed HDR image. Through end-to-end optimization for rate-distortion performance, our method dramatically improves HDR and LDR image quality at all bit rates.

- **Summary**: Image restoration aims to reconstruct the latent clear images from their degraded versions. Despite the notable achievement, existing methods predominantly focus on handling specific degradation types and thus require specialized models, impeding real-world applications in dynamic degradation scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Large Model Driven Image Restoration framework (LMDIR), a novel multiple-in-one image restoration paradigm that leverages the generic priors from large multi-modal language models (MMLMs) and the pretrained diffusion models. In detail, LMDIR integrates three key prior knowledges: 1) global degradation knowledge from MMLMs, 2) scene-aware contextual descriptions generated by MMLMs, and 3) fine-grained high-quality reference images synthesized by diffusion models guided by MMLM descriptions. Standing on above priors, our architecture comprises a query-based prompt encoder, degradation-aware transformer block injecting global degradation knowledge, content-aware transformer block incorporating scene description, and reference-based transformer block incorporating fine-grained image priors. This design facilitates single-stage training paradigm to address various degradations while supporting both automatic and user-guided restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our designed method outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on multiple evaluation benchmarks.

- **Summary**: The diagnosis of bronchiectasis requires measuring abnormal bronchial dilation. It is confirmed using a chest CT scan, where the key feature is an increased broncho-arterial ratio (BAR) (>0.8 in children), often with bronchial wall thickening. Image processing methods facilitate quicker interpretation and detailed evaluations by lobes and segments. Challenges like inclined nature, oblique orientation, and partial volume effect make it difficult to obtain accurate measurements in the upper and middle lobes using the same algorithms. Therefore, accurate detection and measurement of airway and artery regions for BAR and wall thickness in each lobe require different image processing/machine learning methods. We propose methods for: 1. Separating the right lower lobe (RLL) region from full-length CT scans using the tracheal bifurcation (Carina) point as a central marker; 2. Locating the inner diameter of airways and outer diameter of arteries for BAR measurement; and 3. Measuring airway wall thickness (WT) by identifying the outer and inner diameters of airway boundaries. Analysis of 13 HRCT scans with varying thicknesses (0.67mm, 1mm, 2mm) shows the tracheal bifurcation frame can be detected accurately, with a deviation of +/- 2 frames in some cases. A Windows app was developed for measuring inner airway diameter, artery diameter, BAR, and wall thickness, allowing users to draw boundaries around visible BA pairs in the RLL region. Measurements of 10 BA pairs revealed accurate results comparable to those of a human reader, with deviations of +/- 0.10-0.15mm. Additional studies and validation are needed to consolidate inter- and intra-rater variability and enhance the methods.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we describe the results of the HSEmotion team in two tasks of the seventh Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) competition, namely, multi-task learning for simultaneous prediction of facial expression, valence, arousal, and detection of action units, and compound expression recognition. We propose an efficient pipeline based on frame-level facial feature extractors pre-trained in multi-task settings to estimate valence-arousal and basic facial expressions given a facial photo. We ensure the privacy-awareness of our techniques by using the lightweight architectures of neural networks, such as MT-EmotiDDAMFN, MT-EmotiEffNet, and MT-EmotiMobileFaceNet, that can run even on a mobile device without the need to send facial video to a remote server. It was demonstrated that a significant step in improving the overall accuracy is the smoothing of neural network output scores using Gaussian or box filters. It was experimentally demonstrated that such a simple post-processing of predictions from simple blending of two top visual models improves the F1-score of facial expression recognition up to 7%. At the same time, the mean Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of valence and arousal is increased by up to 1.25 times compared to each model's frame-level predictions. As a result, our final performance score on the validation set from the multi-task learning challenge is 4.5 times higher than the baseline (1.494 vs 0.32).

- **Summary**: We introduce KFD-NeRF, a novel dynamic neural radiance field integrated with an efficient and high-quality motion reconstruction framework based on Kalman filtering. Our key idea is to model the dynamic radiance field as a dynamic system whose temporally varying states are estimated based on two sources of knowledge: observations and predictions. We introduce a novel plug-in Kalman filter guided deformation field that enables accurate deformation estimation from scene observations and predictions. We use a shallow Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for observations and model the motion as locally linear to calculate predictions with motion equations. To further enhance the performance of the observation MLP, we introduce regularization in the canonical space to facilitate the network's ability to learn warping for different frames. Additionally, we employ an efficient tri-plane representation for encoding the canonical space, which has been experimentally demonstrated to converge quickly with high quality. This enables us to use a shallower observation MLP, consisting of just two layers in our implementation. We conduct experiments on synthetic and real data and compare with past dynamic NeRF methods. Our KFD-NeRF demonstrates similar or even superior rendering performance within comparable computational time and achieves state-of-the-art view synthesis performance with thorough training.

- **Summary**: Recently, stable diffusion (SD) models have typically flourished in the field of image synthesis and personalized editing, with a range of photorealistic and unprecedented images being successfully generated. As a result, widespread interest has been ignited to develop and use various SD-based tools for visual content creation. However, the exposure of AI-created content on public platforms could raise both legal and ethical risks. In this regard, the traditional methods of adding watermarks to the already generated images (i.e. post-processing) may face a dilemma (e.g., being erased or modified) in terms of copyright protection and content monitoring, since the powerful image inversion and text-to-image editing techniques have been widely explored in SD-based methods. In this work, we propose a Safe and high-traceable Stable Diffusion framework (namely Safe-SD) to adaptively implant the graphical watermarks (e.g., QR code) into the imperceptible structure-related pixels during the generative diffusion process for supporting text-driven invisible watermarking and detection. Different from the previous high-cost injection-then-detection training framework, we design a simple and unified architecture, which makes it possible to simultaneously train watermark injection and detection in a single network, greatly improving the efficiency and convenience of use. Moreover, to further support text-driven generative watermarking and deeply explore its robustness and high-traceability, we elaborately design lambda sampling and encryption algorithm to fine-tune a latent diffuser wrapped by a VAE for balancing high-fidelity image synthesis and high-traceable watermark detection. We present our quantitative and qualitative results on two representative datasets LSUN, COCO and FFHQ, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of Safe-SD and showing it significantly outperforms the previous approaches.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained large-scale models have exhibited remarkable efficacy in computer vision, particularly for 2D image analysis. However, when it comes to 3D point clouds, the constrained accessibility of data, in contrast to the vast repositories of images, poses a challenge for the development of 3D pre-trained models. This paper therefore attempts to directly leverage pre-trained models with 2D prior knowledge to accomplish the tasks for 3D point cloud analysis. Accordingly, we propose the Adaptive PointFormer (APF), which fine-tunes pre-trained 2D models with only a modest number of parameters to directly process point clouds, obviating the need for mapping to images. Specifically, we convert raw point clouds into point embeddings for aligning dimensions with image tokens. Given the inherent disorder in point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of images, we then sequence the point embeddings to optimize the utilization of 2D attention priors. To calibrate attention across 3D and 2D domains and reduce computational overhead, a trainable PointFormer with a limited number of parameters is subsequently concatenated to a frozen pre-trained image model. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed APF. The source code and more details are available at https://vcc.tech/research/2024/PointFormer.

- **Summary**: Esophageal varices (EV), a serious health concern resulting from portal hypertension, are traditionally diagnosed through invasive endoscopic procedures. Despite non-contrast computed tomography (NC-CT) imaging being a less expensive and non-invasive imaging modality, it has yet to gain full acceptance as a primary clinical diagnostic tool for EV evaluation. To overcome existing diagnostic challenges, we present the Multi-Organ-cOhesion-Network (MOON), a novel framework enhancing the analysis of critical organ features in NC-CT scans for effective assessment of EV. Drawing inspiration from the thorough assessment practices of radiologists, MOON establishes a cohesive multiorgan analysis model that unifies the imaging features of the related organs of EV, namely esophagus, liver, and spleen. This integration significantly increases the diagnostic accuracy for EV. We have compiled an extensive NC-CT dataset of 1,255 patients diagnosed with EV, spanning three grades of severity. Each case is corroborated by endoscopic diagnostic results. The efficacy of MOON has been substantiated through a validation process involving multi-fold cross-validation on 1,010 cases and an independent test on 245 cases, exhibiting superior diagnostic performance compared to methods focusing solely on the esophagus (for classifying severe grade: AUC of 0.864 versus 0.803, and for moderate to severe grades: AUC of 0.832 versus 0.793). To our knowledge, MOON is the first work to incorporate a synchronized multi-organ NC-CT analysis for EV assessment, providing a more acceptable and minimally invasive alternative for patients compared to traditional endoscopy.

- **Summary**: Super-resolution reconstruction techniques entail the utilization of software algorithms to transform one or more sets of low-resolution images captured from the same scene into high-resolution images. In recent years, considerable advancement has been observed in the domain of single-image super-resolution algorithms, particularly those based on deep learning techniques. Nevertheless, the extraction of image features and nonlinear mapping methods in the reconstruction process remain challenging for existing algorithms. These issues result in the network architecture being unable to effectively utilize the diverse range of information at different levels. The loss of high-frequency details is significant, and the final reconstructed image features are overly smooth, with a lack of fine texture details. This negatively impacts the subjective visual quality of the image. The objective is to recover high-quality, high-resolution images from low-resolution images. In this work, an enhanced deep convolutional neural network model is employed, comprising multiple convolutional layers, each of which is configured with specific filters and activation functions to effectively capture the diverse features of the image. Furthermore, a residual learning strategy is employed to accelerate training and enhance the convergence of the network, while sub-pixel convolutional layers are utilized to refine the high-frequency details and textures of the image. The experimental analysis demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed model on multiple public datasets when compared with the traditional bicubic interpolation method and several other learning-based super-resolution methods. Furthermore, it proves the model's efficacy in maintaining image edges and textures.

- **Summary**: In a recent study, we found that publicly BCCD and BCD datasets have significant issues such as labeling errors, insufficient sample size, and poor data quality. To address these problems, we performed sample deletion, re-labeling, and integration of these two datasets. Additionally, we introduced the PBC and Raabin-WBC datasets, and ultimately created a high-quality, sample-balanced new dataset, which we named TXL-PBC. The dataset contains 1008 training sets, 288 validation sets, and 144 test sets. Firstly, The dataset underwent strict manual annotation, automatic annotation with YOLOv8n model, and manual audit steps to ensure the accuracy and consistency of annotations. Secondly, we addresses the blood cell mislabeling problem of the original datasets. The distribution of label boundary box areas and the number of labels are better than the BCCD and BCD datasets. Moreover, we used the YOLOv8n model to train these three datasets, the performance of the TXL-PBC dataset surpass the original two datasets. Finally, we employed YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5l, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m detection models as the baseline models for TXL-PBC. This study not only enhances the quality of the blood cell dataset but also supports researchers in improving models for blood cell target detection.

For action recognition and anticipation, we propose a pre-processing strategy that samples and stitches multiple inputs into a single image and then incorporates momentum- and attention-based knowledge distillation to improve the performance of the two tasks. For training, we present an action dictionary-guided design, which consistently yields the most favorable results across our experiments. In the realm of VQA, we leverage object-level features and deploy co-attention networks to train both object and question features. Notably, we introduce a novel frame-question cross-attention mechanism at the network's core for enhanced performance. Our solutions achieve the $2^{nd}$ rank in action recognition and anticipation tasks and $1^{st}$ rank in the VQA task.

- **Summary**: The early detection and precise diagnosis of liver tumors are tasks of critical clinical value, yet they pose significant challenges due to the high heterogeneity and variability of liver tumors. In this work, a precise LIver tumor DIAgnosis network on multi-phase contrast-enhance CT, named LIDIA, is proposed for real-world scenario. To fully utilize all available phases in contrast-enhanced CT, LIDIA first employs the iterative fusion module to aggregate variable numbers of image phases, thereby capturing the features of lesions at different phases for better tumor diagnosis. To effectively mitigate the high heterogeneity problem of liver tumors, LIDIA incorporates asymmetric contrastive learning to enhance the discriminability between different classes. To evaluate our method, we constructed a large-scale dataset comprising 1,921 patients and 8,138 lesions. LIDIA has achieved an average AUC of 93.6% across eight different types of lesions, demonstrating its effectiveness. Besides, LIDIA also demonstrated strong generalizability with an average AUC of 89.3% when tested on an external cohort of 828 patients.

- **Summary**: Video generation has witnessed great success recently, but their application in generating long videos still remains challenging due to the difficulty in maintaining the temporal consistency of generated videos and the high memory cost during generation. To tackle the problems, in this paper, we propose a brave and new idea of Multi-sentence Video Grounding for Long Video Generation, connecting the massive video moment retrieval to the video generation task for the first time, providing a new paradigm for long video generation. The method of our work can be summarized as three steps: (i) We design sequential scene text prompts as the queries for video grounding, utilizing the massive video moment retrieval to search for video moment segments that meet the text requirements in the video database. (ii) Based on the source frames of retrieved video moment segments, we adopt video editing methods to create new video content while preserving the temporal consistency of the retrieved video. Since the editing can be conducted segment by segment, and even frame by frame, it largely reduces the memory cost. (iii) We also attempt video morphing and personalized generation methods to improve the subject consistency of long video generation, providing ablation experimental results for the subtasks of long video generation. Our approach seamlessly extends the development in image/video editing, video morphing and personalized generation, and video grounding to the long video generation, offering effective solutions for generating long videos at low memory cost.

- **Summary**: Conventional multi-label recognition methods often focus on label confidence, frequently overlooking the pivotal role of partial order relations consistent with human preference. To resolve these issues, we introduce a novel method for multimodal label relevance ranking, named Label Relevance Ranking with Proximal Policy Optimization (LR\textsuperscript{2}PPO), which effectively discerns partial order relations among labels. LR\textsuperscript{2}PPO first utilizes partial order pairs in the target domain to train a reward model, which aims to capture human preference intrinsic to the specific scenario. Furthermore, we meticulously design state representation and a policy loss tailored for ranking tasks, enabling LR\textsuperscript{2}PPO to boost the performance of label relevance ranking model and largely reduce the requirement of partial order annotation for transferring to new scenes. To assist in the evaluation of our approach and similar methods, we further propose a novel benchmark dataset, LRMovieNet, featuring multimodal labels and their corresponding partial order data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LR\textsuperscript{2}PPO algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance, proving its effectiveness in addressing the multimodal label relevance ranking problem. Codes and the proposed LRMovieNet dataset are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/ChazzyGordon/LR2PPO}.

- **Summary**: Regression on medical image sequences can capture temporal image pattern changes and predict images at missing or future time points. However, existing geodesic regression methods limit their regression performance by a strong underlying assumption of linear dynamics, while diffusion-based methods have high computational costs and lack constraints to preserve image topology. In this paper, we propose an optimization-based new framework called NODER, which leverages neural ordinary differential equations to capture complex underlying dynamics and reduces its high computational cost of handling high-dimensional image volumes by introducing the latent space. We compare our NODER with two recent regression methods, and the experimental results on ADNI and ACDC datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in 3D image regression. Our model needs only a couple of images in a sequence for prediction, which is practical, especially for clinical situations where extremely limited image time series are available for analysis.

- **Summary**: Computer-aided design (CAD) tools are increasingly popular in modern dental practice, particularly for treatment planning or comprehensive prognosis evaluation. In particular, the 2D panoramic X-ray image efficiently detects invisible caries, impacted teeth and supernumerary teeth in children, while the 3D dental cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely used in orthodontics and endodontics due to its low radiation dose. However, there is no open-access 2D public dataset for children's teeth and no open 3D dental CBCT dataset, which limits the development of automatic algorithms for segmenting teeth and analyzing diseases. The Semi-supervised Teeth Segmentation (STS) Challenge, a pioneering event in tooth segmentation, was held as a part of the MICCAI 2023 ToothFairy Workshop on the Alibaba Tianchi platform. This challenge aims to investigate effective semi-supervised tooth segmentation algorithms to advance the field of dentistry. In this challenge, we provide two modalities including the 2D panoramic X-ray images and the 3D CBCT tooth volumes. In Task 1, the goal was to segment tooth regions in panoramic X-ray images of both adult and pediatric teeth. Task 2 involved segmenting tooth sections using CBCT volumes. Limited labelled images with mostly unlabelled ones were provided in this challenge prompt using semi-supervised algorithms for training. In the preliminary round, the challenge received registration and result submission by 434 teams, with 64 advancing to the final round. This paper summarizes the diverse methods employed by the top-ranking teams in the STS MICCAI 2023 Challenge.

- **Summary**: With the rapid advancements of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, various practical applications have emerged, bringing significant convenience to society. However, model developers may misuse the unauthorized data to train diffusion models. These data are at risk of being memorized by the models, thus potentially violating citizens' privacy rights. Therefore, in order to judge whether a specific image is utilized as a member of a model's training set, Membership Inference Attack (MIA) is proposed to serve as a tool for privacy protection. Current MIA methods predominantly utilize pixel-wise comparisons as distinguishing clues, considering the pixel-level memorization characteristic of diffusion models. However, it is practically impossible for text-to-image models to memorize all the pixel-level information in massive training sets. Therefore, we move to the more advanced structure-level memorization. Observations on the diffusion process show that the structures of members are better preserved compared to those of nonmembers, indicating that diffusion models possess the capability to remember the structures of member images from training sets. Drawing on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective MIA method tailored for text-to-image diffusion models. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of our approach. Compared to current pixel-level baselines, our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also demonstrates remarkable robustness against various distortions.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a novel knowledge distillation approach for the semantic segmentation task. Unlike previous methods that rely on power-trained teachers or other modalities to provide additional knowledge, our approach does not require complex teacher models or information from extra sensors. Specifically, for the teacher model training, we propose to noise the label and then incorporate it into input to effectively boost the lightweight teacher performance. To ensure the robustness of the teacher model against the introduced noise, we propose a dual-path consistency training strategy featuring a distance loss between the outputs of two paths. For the student model training, we keep it consistent with the standard distillation for simplicity. Our approach not only boosts the efficacy of knowledge distillation but also increases the flexibility in selecting teacher and student models. To demonstrate the advantages of our Label Assisted Distillation (LAD) method, we conduct extensive experiments on five challenging datasets including Cityscapes, ADE20K, PASCAL-VOC, COCO-Stuff 10K, and COCO-Stuff 164K, five popular models: FCN, PSPNet, DeepLabV3, STDC, and OCRNet, and results show the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. We posit that incorporating labels into the input, as demonstrated in our work, will provide valuable insights into related fields.

- **Summary**: Diagnosing medical conditions from histopathology data requires a thorough analysis across the various resolutions of Whole Slide Images (WSI). However, existing generative methods fail to consistently represent the hierarchical structure of WSIs due to a focus on high-fidelity patches. To tackle this, we propose Ultra-Resolution Cascaded Diffusion Models (URCDMs) which are capable of synthesising entire histopathology images at high resolutions whilst authentically capturing the details of both the underlying anatomy and pathology at all magnification levels. We evaluate our method on three separate datasets, consisting of brain, breast and kidney tissue, and surpass existing state-of-the-art multi-resolution models. Furthermore, an expert evaluation study was conducted, demonstrating that URCDMs consistently generate outputs across various resolutions that trained evaluators cannot distinguish from real images. All code and additional examples can be found on GitHub.

- **Summary**: As the population is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050, our agricultural production system needs to double its productivity despite a decline of human workforce in the agricultural sector. Autonomous robotic systems are one promising pathway to increase productivity by taking over labor-intensive manual tasks like fruit picking. To be effective, such systems need to monitor and interact with plants and fruits precisely, which is challenging due to the cluttered nature of agricultural environments causing, for example, strong occlusions. Thus, being able to estimate the complete 3D shapes of objects in presence of occlusions is crucial for automating operations such as fruit harvesting. In this paper, we propose the first publicly available 3D shape completion dataset for agricultural vision systems. We provide an RGB-D dataset for estimating the 3D shape of fruits. Specifically, our dataset contains RGB-D frames of single sweet peppers in lab conditions but also in a commercial greenhouse. For each fruit, we additionally collected high-precision point clouds that we use as ground truth. For acquiring the ground truth shape, we developed a measuring process that allows us to record data of real sweet pepper plants, both in the lab and in the greenhouse with high precision, and determine the shape of the sensed fruits. We release our dataset, consisting of almost 7000 RGB-D frames belonging to more than 100 different fruits. We provide segmented RGB-D frames, with camera instrinsics to easily obtain colored point clouds, together with the corresponding high-precision, occlusion-free point clouds obtained with a high-precision laser scanner. We additionally enable evaluation ofshape completion approaches on a hidden test set through a public challenge on a benchmark server.

- **Summary**: Recent works have introduced methods to estimate segmentation performance without ground truth, relying solely on neural network softmax outputs. These techniques hold potential for intuitive output quality control. However, such performance estimates rely on calibrated softmax outputs, which is often not the case in modern neural networks. Moreover, the estimates do not take into account inherent uncertainty in segmentation tasks. These limitations may render precise performance predictions unattainable, restricting the practical applicability of performance estimation methods. To address these challenges, we develop a novel approach for predicting performance ranges with statistical guarantees of containing the ground truth with a user specified probability. Our method leverages sampling-based segmentation uncertainty estimation to derive heuristic performance ranges, and applies split conformal prediction to transform these estimates into rigorous prediction ranges that meet the desired guarantees. We demonstrate our approach on the FIVES retinal vessel segmentation dataset and compare five commonly used sampling-based uncertainty estimation techniques. Our results show that it is possible to achieve the desired coverage with small prediction ranges, highlighting the potential of performance range prediction as a valuable tool for output quality control.

- **Summary**: High dynamic range (HDR) video rendering from low dynamic range (LDR) videos where frames are of alternate exposure encounters significant challenges, due to the exposure change and absence at each time stamp. The exposure change and absence make existing methods generate flickering HDR results. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm to render HDR frames via completing the absent exposure information, hence the exposure information is complete and consistent. Our approach involves interpolating neighbor LDR frames in the time dimension to reconstruct LDR frames for the absent exposures. Combining the interpolated and given LDR frames, the complete set of exposure information is available at each time stamp. This benefits the fusing process for HDR results, reducing noise and ghosting artifacts therefore improving temporal consistency. Extensive experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the importance of absent exposure completing in HDR video rendering.

- **Summary**: General vision encoders like DINOv2 and SAM have recently transformed computer vision. Even though they are trained on natural images, such encoder models have excelled in medical imaging, e.g., in classification, segmentation, and registration. However, no in-depth comparison of different state-of-the-art general vision encoders for medical registration is available. In this work, we investigate how well general vision encoder features can be used in the dissimilarity metrics for medical image registration. We explore two encoders that were trained on natural images as well as one that was fine-tuned on medical data. We apply the features within the well-established B-spline FFD registration framework. In extensive experiments on cardiac cine MRI data, we find that using features as additional guidance for conventional metrics improves the registration quality.

- **Summary**: Many remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) estimation models have achieved promising performance on the training domain but often fail to measure the physiological signals or heart rates (HR) on test domains. Domain generalization (DG) or domain adaptation (DA) techniques are therefore adopted in the offline training stage to adapt the model to the unobserved or observed test domain by referring to all the available source domain data. However, in rPPG estimation problems, the adapted model usually confronts challenges of estimating target data with various domain information, such as different video capturing settings, individuals of different age ranges, or of different HR distributions. In contrast, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA), by online adapting to unlabeled target data without referring to any source data, enables the model to adaptively estimate rPPG signals of various unseen domains. In this paper, we first propose a novel TTA-rPPG benchmark, which encompasses various domain information and HR distributions, to simulate the challenges encountered in rPPG estimation. Next, we propose a novel synthetic signal-guided rPPG estimation framework with a two-fold purpose. First, we design an effective spectral-based entropy minimization to enforce the rPPG model to learn new target domain information. Second, we develop a synthetic signal-guided feature learning, by synthesizing pseudo rPPG signals as pseudo ground-truths to guide a conditional generator to generate latent rPPG features. The synthesized rPPG signals and the generated rPPG features are used to guide the rPPG model to broadly cover various HR distributions. Our extensive experiments on the TTA-rPPG benchmark show that the proposed method achieves superior performance and outperforms previous DG and DA methods across most protocols of the proposed TTA-rPPG benchmark.

- **Summary**: This paper focuses on two crucial issues in domain-adaptive lane detection, i.e., how to effectively learn discriminative features and transfer knowledge across domains. Existing lane detection methods usually exploit a pixel-wise cross-entropy loss to train detection models. However, the loss ignores the difference in feature representation among lanes, which leads to inefficient feature learning. On the other hand, cross-domain context dependency crucial for transferring knowledge across domains remains unexplored in existing lane detection methods. This paper proposes a method of Domain-Adaptive lane detection via Contextual Contrast and Aggregation (DACCA), consisting of two key components, i.e., cross-domain contrastive loss and domain-level feature aggregation, to realize domain-adaptive lane detection. The former can effectively differentiate feature representations among categories by taking domain-level features as positive samples. The latter fuses the domain-level and pixel-level features to strengthen cross-domain context dependency. Extensive experiments show that DACCA significantly improves the detection model's performance and outperforms existing unsupervised domain adaptive lane detection methods on six datasets, especially achieving the best performance when transferring from CULane to Tusimple (92.10% accuracy), Tusimple to CULane (41.9% F1 score), OpenLane to CULane (43.0% F1 score), and CULane to OpenLane (27.6% F1 score).

- **Summary**: Visual search is important in our daily life. The efficient allocation of visual attention is critical to effectively complete visual search tasks. Prior research has predominantly modelled the spatial allocation of visual attention in images at the pixel level, e.g. using a saliency map. However, emerging evidence shows that visual attention is guided by objects rather than pixel intensities. This paper introduces the Object-level Attention Transformer (OAT), which predicts human scanpaths as they search for a target object within a cluttered scene of distractors. OAT uses an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder captures information about the position and appearance of the objects within an image and about the target. The decoder predicts the gaze scanpath as a sequence of object fixations, by integrating output features from both the encoder and decoder. We also propose a new positional encoding that better reflects spatial relationships between objects. We evaluated OAT on the Amazon book cover dataset and a new dataset for visual search that we collected. OAT's predicted gaze scanpaths align more closely with human gaze patterns, compared to predictions by algorithms based on spatial attention on both established metrics and a novel behavioural-based metric. Our results demonstrate the generalization ability of OAT, as it accurately predicts human scanpaths for unseen layouts and target objects.

Deep learning approaches have recently been incorporated into long-term point tracking, but most prior work predominantly functions in 2D. Although these methods benefit from the well-established backbones and matching frameworks, the motions they produce do not always make sense in the 3D physical world. In this paper, we propose the first deep learning framework for long-term point tracking in 3D that generalizes to new points and videos without requiring test-time fine-tuning. Our model contains a cost volume fusion module that effectively integrates multiple past appearances and motion information via a transformer architecture, significantly enhancing overall tracking performance. In terms of 3D tracking performance, our model significantly outperforms simple scene flow chaining and previous 2D point tracking methods, even if one uses ground truth depth and camera pose to backproject 2D point tracks in a synthetic scenario.

- **Summary**: Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with implicit neural representations has received extensive attention due to the expressive representation power and the innovative paradigm of continual learning. However, deploying such a system within a dynamic environment has not been well-studied. Such challenges are intractable even for conventional algorithms since observations from different views with dynamic objects involved break the geometric and photometric consistency, whereas the consistency lays the foundation for joint optimizing the camera pose and the map parameters. In this paper, we best exploit the characteristics of continual learning and propose a novel SLAM framework for dynamic environments. While past efforts have been made to avoid catastrophic forgetting by exploiting an experience replay strategy, we view forgetting as a desirable characteristic. By adaptively controlling the replayed buffer, the ambiguity caused by moving objects can be easily alleviated through forgetting. We restrain the replay of the dynamic objects by introducing a continually-learned classifier for dynamic object identification. The iterative optimization of the neural map and the classifier notably improves the robustness of the SLAM system under a dynamic environment. Experiments on challenging datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

- **Summary**: Remote patient monitoring has emerged as a prominent non-invasive method, using digital technologies and computer vision (CV) to replace traditional invasive monitoring. While neonatal and pediatric departments embrace this approach, Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) face the challenge of occlusions hindering accurate image analysis and interpretation. \textit{Objective}: In this study, we propose a hybrid approach to effectively segment common occlusions encountered in remote monitoring applications within PICUs. Our approach centers on creating a deep-learning pipeline for limited training data scenarios. \textit{Methods}: First, a combination of the well-established Google DeepLabV3+ segmentation model with the transformer-based Segment Anything Model (SAM) is devised for occlusion segmentation mask proposal and refinement. We then train and validate this pipeline using a small dataset acquired from real-world PICU settings with a Microsoft Kinect camera, achieving an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) metric of 85\%. \textit{Results}: Both quantitative and qualitative analyses underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method. The proposed framework yields an overall classification performance with 92.5\% accuracy, 93.8\% recall, 90.3\% precision, and 92.0\% F1-score. Consequently, the proposed method consistently improves the predictions across all metrics, with an average of 2.75\% gain in performance compared to the baseline CNN-based framework. \textit{Conclusions}: Our proposed hybrid approach significantly enhances the segmentation of occlusions in remote patient monitoring within PICU settings. This advancement contributes to improving the quality of care for pediatric patients, addressing a critical need in clinical practice by ensuring more accurate and reliable remote monitoring.

- **Summary**: Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have shown powerful ability in fitting the shape geometry. However, inferring continuous signed distance fields from discrete unoriented point clouds still remains a challenge. The neural network typically fits the shape with a rough surface and omits fine-grained geometric details such as shape edges and corners. In this paper, we propose a novel non-linear implicit filter to smooth the implicit field while preserving high-frequency geometry details. Our novelty lies in that we can filter the surface (zero level set) by the neighbor input points with gradients of the signed distance field. By moving the input raw point clouds along the gradient, our proposed implicit filtering can be extended to non-zero level sets to keep the promise consistency between different level sets, which consequently results in a better regularization of the zero level set. We conduct comprehensive experiments in surface reconstruction from objects and complex scene point clouds, the numerical and visual comparisons demonstrate our improvements over the state-of-the-art methods under the widely used benchmarks.

- **Summary**: The scarcity of large-scale 3D-text paired data poses a great challenge on open vocabulary 3D scene understanding, and hence it is popular to leverage internet-scale 2D data and transfer their open vocabulary capabilities to 3D models through knowledge distillation. However, the existing distillation-based 3D scene understanding approaches rely on the representation capacity of 2D models, disregarding the exploration of geometric priors and inherent representational advantages offered by 3D data. In this paper, we propose an effective approach, namely Geometry Guided Self-Distillation (GGSD), to learn superior 3D representations from 2D pre-trained models. Specifically, we first design a geometry guided distillation module to distill knowledge from 2D models, and then leverage the 3D geometric priors to alleviate the inherent noise in 2D models and enhance the representation learning process. Due to the advantages of 3D representation, the performance of the distilled 3D student model can significantly surpass that of the 2D teacher model. This motivates us to further leverage the representation advantages of 3D data through self-distillation. As a result, our proposed GGSD approach outperforms the existing open vocabulary 3D scene understanding methods by a large margin, as demonstrated by our experiments on both indoor and outdoor benchmark datasets.



### Learning from the Web: Language Drives Weakly-Supervised Incremental Learning for Semantic Segmentation

- **Summary**: Current weakly-supervised incremental learning for semantic segmentation (WILSS) approaches only consider replacing pixel-level annotations with image-level labels, while the training images are still from well-designed datasets. In this work, we argue that widely available web images can also be considered for the learning of new classes. To achieve this, firstly we introduce a strategy to select web images which are similar to previously seen examples in the latent space using a Fourier-based domain discriminator. Then, an effective caption-driven reharsal strategy is proposed to preserve previously learnt classes. To our knowledge, this is the first work to rely solely on web images for both the learning of new concepts and the preservation of the already learned ones in WILSS. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can reach state-of-the-art performances without using manually selected and annotated data in the incremental steps.

- **Summary**: Mobile robot platforms will increasingly be tasked with activities that involve grasping and manipulating objects in open world environments. Affordance understanding provides a robot with means to realise its goals and execute its tasks, e.g. to achieve autonomous navigation in unknown buildings where it has to find doors and ways to open these. In order to get actionable suggestions, robots need to be able to distinguish subtle differences between objects, as they may result in different action sequences: doorknobs require grasp and twist, while handlebars require grasp and push. In this paper, we improve affordance perception for a robot in an open-world setting. Our contribution is threefold: (1) We provide an affordance representation with precise, actionable affordances; (2) We connect this knowledge base to a foundational vision-language models (VLM) and prompt the VLM for a wider variety of new and unseen objects; (3) We apply a human-in-the-loop for corrections on the output of the VLM. The mix of affordance representation, image detection and a human-in-the-loop is effective for a robot to search for objects to achieve its goals. We have demonstrated this in a scenario of finding various doors and the many different ways to open them.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: With the emergence of mobile devices, there is a growing demand for an efficient model to restore any degraded image for better perceptual quality. However, existing models often require specific learning modules tailored for each degradation, resulting in complex architectures and high computation costs. Different from previous work, in this paper, we propose a unified manner to achieve joint embedding by leveraging the inherent similarities across various degradations for efficient and comprehensive restoration. Specifically, we first dig into the sub-latent space of each input to analyze the key components and reweight their contributions in a gated manner. The intrinsic awareness is further integrated with contextualized attention in an X-shaped scheme, maximizing local-global intertwining. Extensive comparison on benchmarking all-in-one restoration setting validates our efficiency and effectiveness, i.e., our network sets new SOTA records while reducing model complexity by approximately -82% in trainable parameters and -85\% in FLOPs. Our code will be made publicly available at:https://github.com/Amazingren/AnyIR.

- **Summary**: The study and prediction of space weather entails the analysis of solar images showing structures of the Sun's atmosphere. When imaged from the Earth's ground, images may be polluted by terrestrial clouds which hinder the detection of solar structures. We propose a new method to remove cloud shadows, based on a U-Net architecture, and compare classical supervision with conditional GAN. We evaluate our method on two different imaging modalities, using both real images and a new dataset of synthetic clouds. Quantitative assessments are obtained through image quality indices (RMSE, PSNR, SSIM, and FID). We demonstrate improved results with regards to the traditional cloud removal technique and a sparse coding baseline, on different cloud types and textures.

- **Summary**: Remarkable advancements in the recolorization of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have simplified the process of modifying NeRF's color attributes. Yet, with the potential of NeRF to serve as shareable digital assets, there's a concern that malicious users might alter the color of NeRF models and falsely claim the recolorized version as their own. To safeguard against such breaches of ownership, enabling original NeRF creators to establish rights over recolorized NeRF is crucial. While approaches like CopyRNeRF have been introduced to embed binary messages into NeRF models as digital signatures for copyright protection, the process of recolorization can remove these binary messages. In our paper, we present GeometrySticker, a method for seamlessly integrating binary messages into the geometry components of radiance fields, akin to applying a sticker. GeometrySticker can embed binary messages into NeRF models while preserving the effectiveness of these messages against recolorization. Our comprehensive studies demonstrate that GeometrySticker is adaptable to prevalent NeRF architectures and maintains a commendable level of robustness against various distortions.

- **Summary**: For navigation of robots, image segmentation is an important component to determining a terrain's traversability. For safe and efficient navigation, it is key to assess the uncertainty of the predicted segments. Current uncertainty estimation methods are limited to a specific choice of model architecture, are costly in terms of training time, require large memory for inference (ensembles), or involve complex model architectures (energy-based, hyperbolic, masking). In this paper, we propose a simple, light-weight module that can be connected to any pretrained image segmentation model, regardless of its architecture, with marginal additional computation cost because it reuses the model's backbone. Our module is based on maximum separation of the segmentation classes by respective prototype vectors. This optimizes the probability that out-of-distribution segments are projected in between the prototype vectors. The uncertainty value in the classification label is obtained from the distance to the nearest prototype. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our module for terrain segmentation.

- **Summary**: We propose PICASSO, a novel framework CAD sketch parameterization from hand-drawn or precise sketch images via rendering self-supervision. Given a drawing of a CAD sketch, the proposed framework turns it into parametric primitives that can be imported into CAD software. Compared to existing methods, PICASSO enables the learning of parametric CAD sketches from either precise or hand-drawn sketch images, even in cases where annotations at the parameter level are scarce or unavailable. This is achieved by leveraging the geometric characteristics of sketches as a learning cue to pre-train a CAD parameterization network. Specifically, PICASSO comprises two primary components: (1) a Sketch Parameterization Network (SPN) that predicts a series of parametric primitives from CAD sketch images, and (2) a Sketch Rendering Network (SRN) that renders parametric CAD sketches in a differentiable manner. SRN facilitates the computation of a image-to-image loss, which can be utilized to pre-train SPN, thereby enabling zero- and few-shot learning scenarios for the parameterization of hand-drawn sketches. Extensive evaluation on the widely used SketchGraphs dataset validates the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

- **Summary**: Efficient and intelligent surface defect detection of photovoltaic modules is crucial for improving the quality of photovoltaic modules and ensuring the reliable operation of large-scale infrastructure. However, the scenario characteristics of data distribution deviation make the construction of defect detection models for open world scenarios such as photovoltaic manufacturing and power plant inspections a challenge. Therefore, we propose the Gather and Distribute Domain shift Suppression Network (GDDS). It adopts a single domain generalized method that is completely independent of the test samples to address the problem of distribution shift. Using a one-stage network as the baseline network breaks through the limitations of traditional domain generalization methods that typically use two-stage networks. It not only balances detection accuracy and speed but also simplifies the model deployment and application process. The GDDS includes two modules: DeepSpine Module and Gather and Distribute Module. Specifically, the DeepSpine Module applies a wider range of contextual information and suppresses background style shift by acquiring and concatenating multi-scale features. The Gather and Distribute Module collects and distributes global information to achieve cross layer interactive learning of multi-scale channel features and suppress defect instance shift. Furthermore, the GDDS utilizes normalized Wasserstein distance for similarity measurement, reducing measurement errors caused by bounding box position deviations. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of GDDS on the EL endogenous shift dataset and Photovoltaic inspection infrared image dataset. The experimental results showed that GDDS can adapt to defect detection in open world scenarios faster and better than other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: As deep learning-based systems have become an integral part of everyday life, limitations in their generalization ability have begun to emerge. Machine learning algorithms typically rely on the i.i.d. assumption, meaning that their training and validation data are expected to follow the same distribution, which does not necessarily hold in practice. In the case of image classification, one frequent reason that algorithms fail to generalize is that they rely on spurious correlations present in training data, such as associating image styles with target classes. These associations may not be present in the unseen test data, leading to significant degradation of their effectiveness. In this work, we attempt to mitigate this Domain Generalization (DG) problem by training a robust feature extractor which disregards features attributed to image-style but infers based on style-invariant image representations. To achieve this, we train CycleGAN models to learn the different styles present in the training data and randomly mix them together to create samples with novel style attributes to improve generalization. Experimental results on the PACS DG benchmark validate the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Deep image registration has demonstrated exceptional accuracy and fast inference. Recent advances have adopted either multiple cascades or pyramid architectures to estimate dense deformation fields in a coarse-to-fine manner. However, due to the cascaded nature and repeated composition/warping operations on feature maps, these methods negatively increase memory usage during training and testing. Moreover, such approaches lack explicit constraints on the learning process of small deformations at different scales, thus lacking explainability. In this study, we introduce a model-driven WiNet that incrementally estimates scale-wise wavelet coefficients for the displacement/velocity field across various scales, utilizing the wavelet coefficients derived from the original input image pair. By exploiting the properties of the wavelet transform, these estimated coefficients facilitate the seamless reconstruction of a full-resolution displacement/velocity field via our devised inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) layer. This approach avoids the complexities of cascading networks or composition operations, making our WiNet an explainable and efficient competitor with other coarse-to-fine methods. Extensive experimental results from two 3D datasets show that our WiNet is accurate and GPU efficient. The code is available at https://github.com/x-xc/WiNet .

- **Summary**: Robust semantic segmentation under adverse conditions is crucial in real-world applications. To address this challenging task in practical scenarios where labeled normal condition images are not accessible in training, we propose FREST, a novel feature restoration framework for source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) of semantic segmentation to adverse conditions. FREST alternates two steps: (1) learning the condition embedding space that only separates the condition information from the features and (2) restoring features of adverse condition images on the learned condition embedding space. By alternating these two steps, FREST gradually restores features where the effect of adverse conditions is reduced. FREST achieved a state of the art on two public benchmarks (i.e., ACDC and RobotCar) for SFDA to adverse conditions. Moreover, it shows superior generalization ability on unseen datasets.

- **Summary**: Vision language models (VLMs) perceive the world through a combination of a visual encoder and a large language model (LLM). The visual encoder, pre-trained on large-scale vision-text datasets, provides zero-shot generalization to visual data, and the LLM endows its high reasoning ability to VLMs. It leads VLMs to achieve high performance on wide benchmarks without fine-tuning, exhibiting zero or few-shot capability. However, recent studies show that VLMs are vulnerable to hallucination. This undesirable behavior degrades reliability and credibility, thereby making users unable to fully trust the output from VLMs. To enhance trustworthiness and better tackle the hallucination of VLMs, we curate a new evaluation dataset, called the BEfore-AFter hallucination dataset (BEAF), and introduce new metrics: True Understanding (TU), IGnorance (IG), StuBbornness (SB), and InDecision (ID). Unlike prior works that focus only on constructing questions and answers, the key idea of our benchmark is to manipulate visual scene information by image editing models and to design the metrics based on scene changes. This allows us to clearly assess whether VLMs correctly understand a given scene by observing the ability to perceive changes. We also visualize image-wise object relationship by virtue of our two-axis view: vision and text. Upon evaluating VLMs with our dataset, we observed that our metrics reveal different aspects of VLM hallucination that have not been reported before.

- **Summary**: Existing zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition methods utilize projection networks to learn a shared latent space of skeleton features and semantic embeddings. The inherent imbalance in action recognition datasets, characterized by variable skeleton sequences yet constant class labels, presents significant challenges for alignment. To address the imbalance, we propose SA-DVAE -- Semantic Alignment via Disentangled Variational Autoencoders, a method that first adopts feature disentanglement to separate skeleton features into two independent parts -- one is semantic-related and another is irrelevant -- to better align skeleton and semantic features. We implement this idea via a pair of modality-specific variational autoencoders coupled with a total correction penalty. We conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets: NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD, and our experimental results show that SA-DAVE produces improved performance over existing methods.

- **Summary**: Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) aims to localize keypoints on an object of any category given few exemplars in an in-context manner. Prior arts involve sophisticated designs, e.g., sundry modules for similarity calculation and a two-stage framework, or takes in extra heatmap generation and supervision. We notice that CAPE is essentially a task about feature matching, which can be solved within the attention process. Therefore we first streamline the architecture into a simple baseline consisting of several pure self-attention layers and an MLP regression head -- this simplification means that one only needs to consider the attention quality to boost the performance of CAPE. Towards an effective attention process for CAPE, we further introduce two key modules: i) a global keypoint feature perceptor to inject global semantic information into support keypoints, and ii) a keypoint attention refiner to enhance inter-node correlation between keypoints. They jointly form a Simple and strong Category-Agnostic Pose Estimator (SCAPE). Experimental results show that SCAPE outperforms prior arts by 2.2 and 1.3 PCK under 1-shot and 5-shot settings with faster inference speed and lighter model capacity, excelling in both accuracy and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Out-of-context (OOC) misinformation poses a significant challenge in multimodal fact-checking, where images are paired with texts that misrepresent their original context to support false narratives. Recent research in evidence-based OOC detection has seen a trend towards increasingly complex architectures, incorporating Transformers, foundation models, and large language models. In this study, we introduce a simple yet robust baseline, which assesses MUltimodal SimilaritiEs (MUSE), specifically the similarity between image-text pairs and external image and text evidence. Our results demonstrate that MUSE, when used with conventional classifiers like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron, can compete with and even surpass the state-of-the-art on the NewsCLIPpings and VERITE datasets. Furthermore, integrating MUSE in our proposed "Attentive Intermediate Transformer Representations" (AITR) significantly improved performance, by 3.3% and 7.5% on NewsCLIPpings and VERITE, respectively. Nevertheless, the success of MUSE, relying on surface-level patterns and shortcuts, without examining factuality and logical inconsistencies, raises critical questions about how we define the task, construct datasets, collect external evidence and overall, how we assess progress in the field.

- **Summary**: The goal of this work is to develop a task-agnostic feature upsampling operator for dense prediction where the operator is required to facilitate not only region-sensitive tasks like semantic segmentation but also detail-sensitive tasks such as image matting. Prior upsampling operators often can work well in either type of the tasks, but not both. We argue that task-agnostic upsampling should dynamically trade off between semantic preservation and detail delineation, instead of having a bias between the two properties. In this paper, we present FADE, a novel, plug-and-play, lightweight, and task-agnostic upsampling operator by fusing the assets of decoder and encoder features at three levels: i) considering both the encoder and decoder feature in upsampling kernel generation; ii) controlling the per-point contribution of the encoder/decoder feature in upsampling kernels with an efficient semi-shift convolutional operator; and iii) enabling the selective pass of encoder features with a decoder-dependent gating mechanism for compensating details. To improve the practicality of FADE, we additionally study parameter- and memory-efficient implementations of semi-shift convolution. We analyze the upsampling behavior of FADE on toy data and show through large-scale experiments that FADE is task-agnostic with consistent performance improvement on a number of dense prediction tasks with little extra cost. For the first time, we demonstrate robust feature upsampling on both region- and detail-sensitive tasks successfully. Code is made available at: https://github.com/poppinace/fade

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce Mask2Map, a novel end-to-end online HD map construction method designed for autonomous driving applications. Our approach focuses on predicting the class and ordered point set of map instances within a scene, represented in the bird's eye view (BEV). Mask2Map consists of two primary components: the Instance-Level Mask Prediction Network (IMPNet) and the Mask-Driven Map Prediction Network (MMPNet). IMPNet generates Mask-Aware Queries and BEV Segmentation Masks to capture comprehensive semantic information globally. Subsequently, MMPNet enhances these query features using local contextual information through two submodules: the Positional Query Generator (PQG) and the Geometric Feature Extractor (GFE). PQG extracts instance-level positional queries by embedding BEV positional information into Mask-Aware Queries, while GFE utilizes BEV Segmentation Masks to generate point-level geometric features. However, we observed limited performance in Mask2Map due to inter-network inconsistency stemming from different predictions to Ground Truth (GT) matching between IMPNet and MMPNet. To tackle this challenge, we propose the Inter-network Denoising Training method, which guides the model to denoise the output affected by both noisy GT queries and perturbed GT Segmentation Masks. Our evaluation conducted on nuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks demonstrates that Mask2Map achieves remarkable performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods, with gains of 10.1% mAP and 4.1 mAP, respectively.

- **Summary**: Despite the significant advancements in pre-training methods for point cloud understanding, directly capturing intricate shape information from irregular point clouds without reliance on external data remains a formidable challenge. To address this problem, we propose GPSFormer, an innovative Global Perception and Local Structure Fitting-based Transformer, which learns detailed shape information from point clouds with remarkable precision. The core of GPSFormer is the Global Perception Module (GPM) and the Local Structure Fitting Convolution (LSFConv). Specifically, GPM utilizes Adaptive Deformable Graph Convolution (ADGConv) to identify short-range dependencies among similar features in the feature space and employs Multi-Head Attention (MHA) to learn long-range dependencies across all positions within the feature space, ultimately enabling flexible learning of contextual representations. Inspired by Taylor series, we design LSFConv, which learns both low-order fundamental and high-order refinement information from explicitly encoded local geometric structures. Integrating the GPM and LSFConv as fundamental components, we construct GPSFormer, a cutting-edge Transformer that effectively captures global and local structures of point clouds. Extensive experiments validate GPSFormer's effectiveness in three point cloud tasks: shape classification, part segmentation, and few-shot learning.

- **Summary**: 3D deblurring reconstruction techniques have recently seen significant advancements with the development of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Although these techniques can recover relatively clear 3D reconstructions from blurry image inputs, they still face limitations in handling severe blurring and complex camera motion. To address these issues, we propose Event-assisted 3D Deblur Reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting (EaDeblur-GS), which integrates event camera data to enhance the robustness of 3DGS against motion blur. By employing an Adaptive Deviation Estimator (ADE) network to estimate Gaussian center deviations and using novel loss functions, EaDeblur-GS achieves sharp 3D reconstructions in real-time, demonstrating performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Source-Free domain adaptive Object Detection (SFOD) is a promising strategy for deploying trained detectors to new, unlabeled domains without accessing source data, addressing significant concerns around data privacy and efficiency. Most SFOD methods leverage a Mean-Teacher (MT) self-training paradigm relying heavily on High-confidence Pseudo Labels (HPL). However, these HPL often overlook small instances that undergo significant appearance changes with domain shifts. Additionally, HPL ignore instances with low confidence due to the scarcity of training samples, resulting in biased adaptation toward familiar instances from the source domain. To address this limitation, we introduce the Low-confidence Pseudo Label Distillation (LPLD) loss within the Mean-Teacher based SFOD framework. This novel approach is designed to leverage the proposals from Region Proposal Network (RPN), which potentially encompasses hard-to-detect objects in unfamiliar domains. Initially, we extract HPL using a standard pseudo-labeling technique and mine a set of Low-confidence Pseudo Labels (LPL) from proposals generated by RPN, leaving those that do not overlap significantly with HPL. These LPL are further refined by leveraging class-relation information and reducing the effect of inherent noise for the LPLD loss calculation. Furthermore, we use feature distance to adaptively weight the LPLD loss to focus on LPL containing a larger foreground area. Our method outperforms previous SFOD methods on four cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LPLD loss leads to effective adaptation by reducing false negatives and facilitating the use of domain-invariant knowledge from the source model.

- **Summary**: Plane adjustment (PA) is crucial for many 3D applications, involving simultaneous pose estimation and plane recovery. Despite recent advancements, it remains a challenging problem in the realm of multi-view point cloud registration. Current state-of-the-art methods can achieve globally optimal convergence only with good initialization. Furthermore, their high time complexity renders them impractical for large-scale problems. To address these challenges, we first exploit a novel optimization strategy termed \textit{Bi-Convex Relaxation}, which decouples the original problem into two simpler sub-problems, reformulates each sub-problem using a convex relaxation technique, and alternately solves each one until the original problem converges. Building on this strategy, we propose two algorithmic variants for solving the plane adjustment problem, namely \textit{GlobalPointer} and \textit{GlobalPointer++}, based on point-to-plane and plane-to-plane errors, respectively. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method can perform large-scale plane adjustment with linear time complexity, larger convergence region, and robustness to poor initialization, while achieving similar accuracy as prior methods.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently achieved significant success in downstream visual tasks. However, a notable gap still exists between SSL and supervised learning (SL), especially in complex downstream tasks. In this paper, we show that the features learned by SSL methods suffer from the crowding problem, where features of different classes are not distinctly separated, and features within the same class exhibit large intra-class variance. In contrast, SL ensures a clear separation between classes. We analyze this phenomenon and conclude that SSL objectives do not constrain the relationships between different samples and their augmentations. Our theoretical analysis delves into how SSL objectives fail to enforce the necessary constraints between samples and their augmentations, leading to poor performance in complex tasks. We provide a theoretical framework showing that the performance gap between SSL and SL mainly stems from the inability of SSL methods to capture the aggregation of similar augmentations and the separation of dissimilar augmentations. To address this issue, we propose a learnable regulator called Dynamic Semantic Adjuster (DSA). DSA aggregates and separates samples in the feature space while being robust to outliers. Through extensive empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of DSA in enhancing feature aggregation and separation, ultimately closing the performance gap between SSL and SL.

- **Summary**: Computed tomography (CT) is widely utilized in clinical settings because it delivers detailed 3D images of the human body. However, performing CT scans is not always feasible due to radiation exposure and limitations in certain surgical environments. As an alternative, reconstructing CT images from ultra-sparse X-rays offers a valuable solution and has gained significant interest in scientific research and medical applications. However, it presents great challenges as it is inherently an ill-posed problem, often compromised by artifacts resulting from overlapping structures in X-ray images. In this paper, we propose DiffuX2CT, which models CT reconstruction from orthogonal biplanar X-rays as a conditional diffusion process. DiffuX2CT is established with a 3D global coherence denoising model with a new, implicit conditioning mechanism. We realize the conditioning mechanism by a newly designed tri-plane decoupling generator and an implicit neural decoder. By doing so, DiffuX2CT achieves structure-controllable reconstruction, which enables 3D structural information to be recovered from 2D X-rays, therefore producing faithful textures in CT images. As an extra contribution, we collect a real-world lumbar CT dataset, called LumbarV, as a new benchmark to verify the clinical significance and performance of CT reconstruction from X-rays. Extensive experiments on this dataset and three more publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.

- **Summary**: Automated nodule segmentation is essential for computer-assisted diagnosis in ultrasound images. Nevertheless, most existing methods depend on precise pixel-level annotations by medical professionals, a process that is both costly and labor-intensive. Recently, segmentation foundation models like SAM have shown impressive generalizability on natural images, suggesting their potential as pseudo-labelers. However, accurate prompts remain crucial for their success in medical images. In this work, we devise a novel weakly supervised framework that effectively utilizes the segmentation foundation model to generate pseudo-labels from aspect ration annotations for automatic nodule segmentation. Specifically, we develop three types of bounding box prompts based on scalable shape priors, followed by an adaptive pseudo-label selection module to fully exploit the prediction capabilities of the foundation model for nodules. We also present a SAM-driven uncertainty-aware cross-teaching strategy. This approach integrates SAM-based uncertainty estimation and label-space perturbations into cross-teaching to mitigate the impact of pseudo-label inaccuracies on model training. Extensive experiments on two clinically collected ultrasound datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: Automated animal face identification plays a crucial role in the monitoring of behaviors, conducting of surveys, and finding of lost animals. Despite the advancements in human face identification, the lack of datasets and benchmarks in the animal domain has impeded progress. In this paper, we introduce the PetFace dataset, a comprehensive resource for animal face identification encompassing 257,484 unique individuals across 13 animal families and 319 breed categories, including both experimental and pet animals. This large-scale collection of individuals facilitates the investigation of unseen animal face verification, an area that has not been sufficiently explored in existing datasets due to the limited number of individuals. Moreover, PetFace also has fine-grained annotations such as sex, breed, color, and pattern. We provide multiple benchmarks including re-identification for seen individuals and verification for unseen individuals. The models trained on our dataset outperform those trained on prior datasets, even for detailed breed variations and unseen animal families. Our result also indicates that there is some room to improve the performance of integrated identification on multiple animal families. We hope the PetFace dataset will facilitate animal face identification and encourage the development of non-invasive animal automatic identification methods.

- **Summary**: Arabic Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Handwriting Recognition (HWR) pose unique challenges due to the cursive and context-sensitive nature of the Arabic script. This study introduces Qalam, a novel foundation model designed for Arabic OCR and HWR, built on a SwinV2 encoder and RoBERTa decoder architecture. Our model significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a Word Error Rate (WER) of just 0.80% in HWR tasks and 1.18% in OCR tasks. We train Qalam on a diverse dataset, including over 4.5 million images from Arabic manuscripts and a synthetic dataset comprising 60k image-text pairs. Notably, Qalam demonstrates exceptional handling of Arabic diacritics, a critical feature in Arabic scripts. Furthermore, it shows a remarkable ability to process high-resolution inputs, addressing a common limitation in current OCR systems. These advancements underscore Qalam's potential as a leading solution for Arabic script recognition, offering a significant leap in accuracy and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Autonomous robots are increasingly becoming a strong fixture in social environments. Effective crowd navigation requires not only safe yet fast planning, but should also enable interpretability and computational efficiency for working in real-time on embedded devices. In this work, we advocate for hyperbolic learning to enable crowd navigation and we introduce Hyp2Nav. Different from conventional reinforcement learning-based crowd navigation methods, Hyp2Nav leverages the intrinsic properties of hyperbolic geometry to better encode the hierarchical nature of decision-making processes in navigation tasks. We propose a hyperbolic policy model and a hyperbolic curiosity module that results in effective social navigation, best success rates, and returns across multiple simulation settings, using up to 6 times fewer parameters than competitor state-of-the-art models. With our approach, it becomes even possible to obtain policies that work in 2-dimensional embedding spaces, opening up new possibilities for low-resource crowd navigation and model interpretability. Insightfully, the internal hyperbolic representation of Hyp2Nav correlates with how much attention the robot pays to the surrounding crowds, e.g. due to multiple people occluding its pathway or to a few of them showing colliding plans, rather than to its own planned route.



### New Capability to Look Up an ASL Sign from a Video Example

- **Summary**: Looking up an unknown sign in an ASL dictionary can be difficult. Most ASL dictionaries are organized based on English glosses, despite the fact that (1) there is no convention for assigning English-based glosses to ASL signs; and (2) there is no 1-1 correspondence between ASL signs and English words. Furthermore, what if the user does not know either the meaning of the target sign or its possible English translation(s)? Some ASL dictionaries enable searching through specification of articulatory properties, such as handshapes, locations, movement properties, etc. However, this is a cumbersome process and does not always result in successful lookup. Here we describe a new system, publicly shared on the Web, to enable lookup of a video of an ASL sign (e.g., a webcam recording or a clip from a continuous signing video). The user submits a video for analysis and is presented with the five most likely sign matches, in decreasing order of likelihood, so that the user can confirm the selection and then be taken to our ASLLRP Sign Bank entry for that sign. Furthermore, this video lookup is also integrated into our newest version of SignStream(R) software to facilitate linguistic annotation of ASL video data, enabling the user to directly look up a sign in the video being annotated, and, upon confirmation of the match, to directly enter into the annotation the gloss and features of that sign, greatly increasing the efficiency and consistency of linguistic annotations of ASL video data.

- **Summary**: Although recent advancements in text-to-3D generation have significantly improved generation quality, issues like limited level of detail and low fidelity still persist, which requires further improvement. To understand the essence of those issues, we thoroughly analyze current score distillation methods by connecting theories of consistency distillation to score distillation. Based on the insights acquired through analysis, we propose an optimization framework, Guided Consistency Sampling (GCS), integrated with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to alleviate those issues. Additionally, we have observed the persistent oversaturation in the rendered views of generated 3D assets. From experiments, we find that it is caused by unwanted accumulated brightness in 3DGS during optimization. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a Brightness-Equalized Generation (BEG) scheme in 3DGS rendering. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach generates 3D assets with more details and higher fidelity than state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the critical issue of miscalibration in CLIP-based model adaptation, particularly in the challenging scenario of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, which has been overlooked in the existing literature on CLIP adaptation. We empirically demonstrate that popular CLIP adaptation approaches, such as Adapters, Prompt Learning, and Test-Time Adaptation, substantially degrade the calibration capabilities of the zero-shot baseline in the presence of distributional drift. We identify the increase in logit ranges as the underlying cause of miscalibration of CLIP adaptation methods, contrasting with previous work on calibrating fully-supervised models. Motivated by these observations, we present a simple and model-agnostic solution to mitigate miscalibration, by scaling the logit range of each sample to its zero-shot prediction logits. We explore three different alternatives to achieve this, which can be either integrated during adaptation or directly used at inference time. Comprehensive experiments on popular OOD classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in mitigating miscalibration while maintaining discriminative performance, whose improvements are consistent across the three families of these increasingly popular approaches.

- **Summary**: Parametric feature grid encodings have gained significant attention as an encoding approach for neural fields since they allow for much smaller MLPs, which significantly decreases the inference time of the models. In this work, we propose MeshFeat, a parametric feature encoding tailored to meshes, for which we adapt the idea of multi-resolution feature grids from Euclidean space. We start from the structure provided by the given vertex topology and use a mesh simplification algorithm to construct a multi-resolution feature representation directly on the mesh. The approach allows the usage of small MLPs for neural fields on meshes, and we show a significant speed-up compared to previous representations while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality for texture reconstruction and BRDF representation. Given its intrinsic coupling to the vertices, the method is particularly well-suited for representations on deforming meshes, making it a good fit for object animation.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in visual prompting in the natural image area have allowed users to interact with artificial intelligence (AI) tools through various visual marks such as box, point, and free-form shapes. However, due to the significant difference between the natural and remote sensing (RS) images, existing visual prompting models face challenges in RS scenarios. Moreover, RS MLLMs mainly focus on interpreting image-level RS data and only support interaction with language instruction, restricting flexibility applications in the real world. To address those limitations, a novel visual prompting model named EarthMarker is proposed, which excels in image-level, region-level, and point-level RS imagery interpretation. Specifically, the visual prompts alongside images and text instruction input into the large language model (LLM), adapt models toward specific predictions and tasks. Subsequently, a sharing visual encoding method is introduced to refine multi-scale image features and visual prompt information uniformly. Furthermore, to endow the EarthMarker with versatile multi-granularity visual perception abilities, the cross-domain phased learning strategy is developed, and the disjoint parameters are optimized in a lightweight manner by leveraging both the natural and RS domain-specific knowledge. In addition, to tackle the lack of RS visual prompting data, a dataset named RSVP featuring multi-modal fine-grained visual prompting instruction is constructed. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the proposed EarthMarker's competitive performance, representing a significant advance in multi-granularity RS imagery interpretation under the visual prompting learning framework.

- **Summary**: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly advanced the generation of high-fidelity, photo-realistic images from textual descriptions. Yet, these models often struggle with interpreting spatial arrangements from text, hindering their ability to produce images with precise spatial configurations. To bridge this gap, layout-to-image generation has emerged as a promising direction. However, training-based approaches are limited by the need for extensively annotated datasets, leading to high data acquisition costs and a constrained conceptual scope. Conversely, training-free methods face challenges in accurately locating and generating semantically similar objects within complex compositions. This paper introduces a novel training-free approach designed to overcome adversarial semantic intersections during the diffusion conditioning phase. By refining intra-token loss with selective sampling and enhancing the diffusion process with attention redistribution, we propose two innovative constraints: 1) an inter-token constraint that resolves token conflicts to ensure accurate concept synthesis; and 2) a self-attention constraint that improves pixel-to-pixel relationships. Our evaluations confirm the effectiveness of leveraging layout information for guiding the diffusion process, generating content-rich images with enhanced fidelity and complexity.

- **Summary**: Deploying deep learning-based imaging tools across various clinical sites poses significant challenges due to inherent domain shifts and regulatory hurdles associated with site-specific fine-tuning. For histopathology, stain normalization techniques can mitigate discrepancies, but they often fall short of eliminating inter-site variations. Therefore, we present Data Alchemy, an explainable stain normalization method combined with test time data calibration via a template learning framework to overcome barriers in cross-site analysis. Data Alchemy handles shifts inherent to multi-site data and minimizes them without needing to change the weights of the normalization or classifier networks. Our approach extends to unseen sites in various clinical settings where data domain discrepancies are unknown. Extensive experiments highlight the efficacy of our framework in tumor classification in hematoxylin and eosin-stained patches. Our explainable normalization method boosts classification tasks' area under the precision-recall curve(AUPR) by 0.165, 0.545 to 0.710. Additionally, Data Alchemy further reduces the multisite classification domain gap, by improving the 0.710 AUPR an additional 0.142, elevating classification performance further to 0.852, from 0.545. Our Data Alchemy framework can popularize precision medicine with minimal operational overhead by allowing for the seamless integration of pre-trained deep learning-based clinical tools across multiple sites.

- **Summary**: Person Re-identification (re-ID) in computer vision aims to recognize and track individuals across different cameras. While previous research has mainly focused on challenges like pose variations and lighting changes, the impact of extreme capture conditions is often not adequately addressed. These extreme conditions, including varied lighting, camera styles, angles, and image distortions, can significantly affect data distribution and re-ID accuracy.   Current research typically improves model generalization under normal shooting conditions through data augmentation techniques such as adjusting brightness and contrast. However, these methods pay less attention to the robustness of models under extreme shooting conditions. To tackle this, we propose a multi-mode synchronization learning (MMSL) strategy . This approach involves dividing images into grids, randomly selecting grid blocks, and applying data augmentation methods like contrast and brightness adjustments. This process introduces diverse transformations without altering the original image structure, helping the model adapt to extreme variations. This method improves the model's generalization under extreme conditions and enables learning diverse features, thus better addressing the challenges in re-ID. Extensive experiments on a simulated test set under extreme conditions have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. This approach is crucial for enhancing model robustness and adaptability in real-world scenarios, supporting the future development of person re-identification technology.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we investigate the use of diffusion models which are pre-trained on large-scale image-caption pairs for open-vocabulary 3D semantic understanding. We propose a novel method, namely Diff2Scene, which leverages frozen representations from text-image generative models, along with salient-aware and geometric-aware masks, for open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation and visual grounding tasks. Diff2Scene gets rid of any labeled 3D data and effectively identifies objects, appearances, materials, locations and their compositions in 3D scenes. We show that it outperforms competitive baselines and achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. In particular, Diff2Scene improves the state-of-the-art method on ScanNet200 by 12%.

- **Summary**: In the contemporary of deep learning, where models often grapple with the challenge of simultaneously achieving robustness against adversarial attacks and strong generalization capabilities, this study introduces an innovative Local Feature Masking (LFM) strategy aimed at fortifying the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on both fronts. During the training phase, we strategically incorporate random feature masking in the shallow layers of CNNs, effectively alleviating overfitting issues, thereby enhancing the model's generalization ability and bolstering its resilience to adversarial attacks. LFM compels the network to adapt by leveraging remaining features to compensate for the absence of certain semantic features, nurturing a more elastic feature learning mechanism. The efficacy of LFM is substantiated through a series of quantitative and qualitative assessments, collectively showcasing a consistent and significant improvement in CNN's generalization ability and resistance against adversarial attacks--a phenomenon not observed in current and prior methodologies. The seamless integration of LFM into established CNN frameworks underscores its potential to advance both generalization and adversarial robustness within the deep learning paradigm. Through comprehensive experiments, including robust person re-identification baseline generalization experiments and adversarial attack experiments, we demonstrate the substantial enhancements offered by LFM in addressing the aforementioned challenges. This contribution represents a noteworthy stride in advancing robust neural network architectures.

- **Summary**: We present MeshSegmenter, a simple yet effective framework designed for zero-shot 3D semantic segmentation. This model successfully extends the powerful capabilities of 2D segmentation models to 3D meshes, delivering accurate 3D segmentation across diverse meshes and segment descriptions. Specifically, our model leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) model to segment the target regions from images rendered from the 3D shape. In light of the importance of the texture for segmentation, we also leverage the pretrained stable diffusion model to generate images with textures from 3D shape, and leverage SAM to segment the target regions from images with textures. Textures supplement the shape for segmentation and facilitate accurate 3D segmentation even in geometrically non-prominent areas, such as segmenting a car door within a car mesh. To achieve the 3D segments, we render 2D images from different views and conduct segmentation for both textured and untextured images. Lastly, we develop a multi-view revoting scheme that integrates 2D segmentation results and confidence scores from various views onto the 3D mesh, ensuring the 3D consistency of segmentation results and eliminating inaccuracies from specific perspectives. Through these innovations, MeshSegmenter offers stable and reliable 3D segmentation results both quantitatively and qualitatively, highlighting its potential as a transformative tool in the field of 3D zero-shot segmentation.

- **Summary**: Recent studies on learning-based sound source localization have mainly focused on the localization performance perspective. However, prior work and existing benchmarks overlook a crucial aspect: cross-modal interaction, which is essential for interactive sound source localization. Cross-modal interaction is vital for understanding semantically matched or mismatched audio-visual events, such as silent objects or off-screen sounds. In this paper, we first comprehensively examine the cross-modal interaction of existing methods, benchmarks, evaluation metrics, and cross-modal understanding tasks. Then, we identify the limitations of previous studies and make several contributions to overcome the limitations. First, we introduce a new synthetic benchmark for interactive sound source localization. Second, we introduce new evaluation metrics to rigorously assess sound source localization methods, focusing on accurately evaluating both localization performance and cross-modal interaction ability. Third, we propose a learning framework with a cross-modal alignment strategy to enhance cross-modal interaction. Lastly, we evaluate both interactive sound source localization and auxiliary cross-modal retrieval tasks together to thoroughly assess cross-modal interaction capabilities and benchmark competing methods. Our new benchmarks and evaluation metrics reveal previously overlooked issues in sound source localization studies. Our proposed novel method, with enhanced cross-modal alignment, shows superior sound source localization performance. This work provides the most comprehensive analysis of sound source localization to date, with extensive validation of competing methods on both existing and new benchmarks using new and standard evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: The increased demand for tools that automate the 3D content creation process led to tremendous progress in deep generative models that can generate diverse 3D objects of high fidelity. In this paper, we present PASTA, an autoregressive transformer architecture for generating high quality 3D shapes. PASTA comprises two main components: An autoregressive transformer that generates objects as a sequence of cuboidal primitives and a blending network, implemented with a transformer decoder that composes the sequences of cuboids and synthesizes high quality meshes for each object. Our model is trained in two stages: First we train our autoregressive generative model using only annotated cuboidal parts as supervision and next, we train our blending network using explicit 3D supervision, in the form of watertight meshes. Evaluations on various ShapeNet objects showcase the ability of our model to perform shape generation from diverse inputs \eg from scratch, from a partial object, from text and images, as well size-guided generation, by explicitly conditioning on a bounding box that defines the object's boundaries. Moreover, as our model considers the underlying part-based structure of a 3D object, we are able to select a specific part and produce shapes with meaningful variations of this part. As evidenced by our experiments, our model generates 3D shapes that are both more realistic and diverse than existing part-based and non part-based methods, while at the same time is simpler to implement and train.

- **Summary**: Vector maps find widespread utility across diverse domains due to their capacity to not only store but also represent discrete data boundaries such as building footprints, disaster impact analysis, digitization, urban planning, location points, transport links, and more. Although extensive research exists on identifying building footprints and road types from satellite imagery, the generation of vector maps from such imagery remains an area with limited exploration. Furthermore, conventional map generation techniques rely on labor-intensive manual feature extraction or rule-based approaches, which impose inherent limitations. To surmount these limitations, we propose a novel method called HPix, which utilizes modified Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate vector tile map from satellite images. HPix incorporates two hierarchical frameworks: one operating at the global level and the other at the local level, resulting in a comprehensive model. Through empirical evaluations, our proposed approach showcases its effectiveness in producing highly accurate and visually captivating vector tile maps derived from satellite images. We further extend our study's application to include mapping of road intersections and building footprints cluster based on their area.

- **Summary**: Heatwaves pose significant health risks, particularly due to prolonged exposure to high summer temperatures. Vulnerable groups, especially pedestrians and cyclists on sun-exposed sidewalks, motivate the development of a route planning method that incorporates somatosensory temperature effects through shade ratio consideration. This paper is the first to introduce a pipeline that utilizes segmentation foundation models to extract shaded areas from high-resolution satellite images. These areas are then integrated into a multi-layered road map, enabling users to customize routes based on a balance between distance and shade exposure, thereby enhancing comfort and health during outdoor activities. Specifically, we construct a graph-based representation of the road map, where links indicate connectivity and are updated with shade ratio data for dynamic route planning. This system is already implemented online, with a video demonstration, and will be specifically adapted to assist travelers during the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.

- **Summary**: Studying adversarial attacks on artificial intelligence (AI) systems helps discover model shortcomings, enabling the construction of a more robust system. Most existing adversarial attack methods only concentrate on single-task single-model or single-task cross-model scenarios, overlooking the multi-task characteristic of artificial intelligence systems. As a result, most of the existing attacks do not pose a practical threat to a comprehensive and collaborative AI system. However, implementing cross-task attacks is highly demanding and challenging due to the difficulty in obtaining the real labels of different tasks for the same picture and harmonizing the loss functions across different tasks. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised Cross-Task Attack framework (CTA), which utilizes co-attention and anti-attention maps to generate cross-task adversarial perturbation. Specifically, the co-attention map reflects the area to which different visual task models pay attention, while the anti-attention map reflects the area that different visual task models neglect. CTA generates cross-task perturbations by shifting the attention area of samples away from the co-attention map and closer to the anti-attention map. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple vision tasks and the experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed design for adversarial attacks.

Recently, substantial insight and methods on OOD detection were presented by the ML community, but how do they fare in DP applications? To this end, we establish a benchmark study, our highlights being: 1) the adoption of proper evaluation protocols, 2) the comparison of diverse detectors in both a single and multi-model setting, and 3) the exploration into advanced ML settings like transfer learning (ImageNet vs. DP pre-training) and choice of architecture (CNNs vs. transformers). Through our comprehensive experiments, we contribute new insights and guidelines, paving the way for future research and discussion.

- **Summary**: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to predict unknown compositions made up of attribute and object pairs. Predicting compositions unseen during training is a challenging task. We are exploring Open World Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (OW-CZSL) in this study, where our test space encompasses all potential combinations of attributes and objects. Our approach involves utilizing the self-attention mechanism between attributes and objects to achieve better generalization from seen to unseen compositions. Utilizing a self-attention mechanism facilitates the model's ability to identify relationships between attribute and objects. The similarity between the self-attended textual and visual features is subsequently calculated to generate predictions during the inference phase. The potential test space may encompass implausible object-attribute combinations arising from unrestricted attribute-object pairings. To mitigate this issue, we leverage external knowledge from ConceptNet to restrict the test space to realistic compositions. Our proposed model, Attention-based Simple Primitives (ASP), demonstrates competitive performance, achieving results comparable to the state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Existing methods have achieved remarkable performance in single image dehazing, particularly on synthetic datasets. However, they often struggle with real-world hazy images due to domain shift, limiting their practical applicability. This paper introduces HazeCLIP, a language-guided adaptation framework designed to enhance the real-world performance of pre-trained dehazing networks. Inspired by the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model's ability to distinguish between hazy and clean images, we utilize it to evaluate dehazing results. Combined with a region-specific dehazing technique and tailored prompt sets, CLIP model accurately identifies hazy areas, providing a high-quality, human-like prior that guides the fine-tuning process of pre-trained networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HazeCLIP achieves the state-of-the-art performance in real-word image dehazing, evaluated through both visual quality and no-reference quality assessments.

- **Summary**: Rendering realistic images from 3D reconstruction is an essential task of many Computer Vision and Robotics pipelines, notably for mixed-reality applications as well as training autonomous agents in simulated environments. However, the quality of novel views heavily depends of the source reconstruction which is often imperfect due to noisy or missing geometry and appearance. Inspired by the recent success of reference-based super-resolution networks, we propose MaRINeR, a refinement method that leverages information of a nearby mapping image to improve the rendering of a target viewpoint. We first establish matches between the raw rendered image of the scene geometry from the target viewpoint and the nearby reference based on deep features, followed by hierarchical detail transfer. We show improved renderings in quantitative metrics and qualitative examples from both explicit and implicit scene representations. We further employ our method on the downstream tasks of pseudo-ground-truth validation, synthetic data enhancement and detail recovery for renderings of reduced 3D reconstructions.

- **Summary**: 3D object detection is an indispensable component for scene understanding. However, the annotation of large-scale 3D datasets requires significant human effort. To tackle this problem, many methods adopt weakly supervised 3D object detection that estimates 3D boxes by leveraging 2D boxes and scene/class-specific priors. However, these approaches generally depend on sophisticated manual priors, which is hard to generalize to novel categories and scenes. In this paper, we are motivated to propose a general approach, which can be easily adapted to new scenes and/or classes. A unified framework is developed for learning 3D object detectors from RGB images and associated 2D boxes. In specific, we propose three general components: prior injection module to obtain general object geometric priors from LLM model, 2D space projection constraint to minimize the discrepancy between the boundaries of projected 3D boxes and their corresponding 2D boxes on the image plane, and 3D space geometry constraint to build a Point-to-Box alignment loss to further refine the pose of estimated 3D boxes. Experiments on KITTI and SUN-RGBD datasets demonstrate that our method yields surprisingly high-quality 3D bounding boxes with only 2D annotation.

- **Summary**: We investigate the task of identifying situations of distracted driving through analysis of in-car videos. To tackle this challenge we introduce a multi-task video transformer that predicts both distracted actions and driver pose. Leveraging VideoMAEv2, a large pre-trained architecture, our approach incorporates semantic information from human keypoint locations to enhance action recognition and decrease computational overhead by minimizing the number of spatio-temporal tokens. By guiding token selection with pose and class information, we notably reduce the model's computational requirements while preserving the baseline accuracy. Our model surpasses existing state-of-the art results in driver action recognition while exhibiting superior efficiency compared to current video transformer-based approaches.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in text-to-image model customization have underscored the importance of integrating new concepts with a few examples. Yet, these progresses are largely confined to widely recognized subjects, which can be learned with relative ease through models' adequate shared prior knowledge. In contrast, logos, characterized by unique patterns and textual elements, are hard to establish shared knowledge within diffusion models, thus presenting a unique challenge. To bridge this gap, we introduce the task of logo insertion. Our goal is to insert logo identities into diffusion models and enable their seamless synthesis in varied contexts. We present a novel two-phase pipeline LogoSticker to tackle this task. First, we propose the actor-critic relation pre-training algorithm, which addresses the nontrivial gaps in models' understanding of the potential spatial positioning of logos and interactions with other objects. Second, we propose a decoupled identity learning algorithm, which enables precise localization and identity extraction of logos. LogoSticker can generate logos accurately and harmoniously in diverse contexts. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness of LogoSticker over customization methods and large models such as DALLE~3. \href{https://mingkangz.github.io/logosticker}{Project page}.

- **Summary**: Depression is characterized by persistent sadness and loss of interest, significantly impairing daily functioning and now a widespread mental disorder. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on subjective assessments, necessitating objective approaches for accurate diagnosis. Our study investigates the use of facial action units (AUs) and emotions as biomarkers for depression. We analyzed facial expressions from video data of participants classified with or without depression. Our methodology involved detailed feature extraction, mean intensity comparisons of key AUs, and the application of time series classification models. Furthermore, we employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and various clustering algorithms to explore the variability in emotional expression patterns. Results indicate significant differences in the intensities of AUs associated with sadness and happiness between the groups, highlighting the potential of facial analysis in depression assessment.

- **Summary**: We present a method for generating Streetscapes-long sequences of views through an on-the-fly synthesized city-scale scene. Our generation is conditioned by language input (e.g., city name, weather), as well as an underlying map/layout hosting the desired trajectory. Compared to recent models for video generation or 3D view synthesis, our method can scale to much longer-range camera trajectories, spanning several city blocks, while maintaining visual quality and consistency. To achieve this goal, we build on recent work on video diffusion, used within an autoregressive framework that can easily scale to long sequences. In particular, we introduce a new temporal imputation method that prevents our autoregressive approach from drifting from the distribution of realistic city imagery. We train our Streetscapes system on a compelling source of data-posed imagery from Google Street View, along with contextual map data-which allows users to generate city views conditioned on any desired city layout, with controllable camera poses.

- **Summary**: Despite significant progress in 3D point cloud segmentation, existing methods primarily address specific tasks and depend on explicit instructions to identify targets, lacking the capability to infer and understand implicit user intentions in a unified framework. In this work, we propose a model, called SegPoint, that leverages the reasoning capabilities of a multi-modal Large Language Model (LLM) to produce point-wise segmentation masks across a diverse range of tasks: 1) 3D instruction segmentation, 2) 3D referring segmentation, 3) 3D semantic segmentation, and 4) 3D open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. To advance 3D instruction research, we introduce a new benchmark, Instruct3D, designed to evaluate segmentation performance from complex and implicit instructional texts, featuring 2,565 point cloud-instruction pairs. Our experimental results demonstrate that SegPoint achieves competitive performance on established benchmarks such as ScanRefer for referring segmentation and ScanNet for semantic segmentation, while delivering outstanding outcomes on the Instruct3D dataset. To our knowledge, SegPoint is the first model to address these varied segmentation tasks within a single framework, achieving satisfactory performance.

- **Summary**: Monocular dynamic reconstruction is a challenging and long-standing vision problem due to the highly ill-posed nature of the task. Existing approaches are limited in that they either depend on templates, are effective only in quasi-static scenes, or fail to model 3D motion explicitly. In this work, we introduce a method capable of reconstructing generic dynamic scenes, featuring explicit, full-sequence-long 3D motion, from casually captured monocular videos. We tackle the under-constrained nature of the problem with two key insights: First, we exploit the low-dimensional structure of 3D motion by representing scene motion with a compact set of SE3 motion bases. Each point's motion is expressed as a linear combination of these bases, facilitating soft decomposition of the scene into multiple rigidly-moving groups. Second, we utilize a comprehensive set of data-driven priors, including monocular depth maps and long-range 2D tracks, and devise a method to effectively consolidate these noisy supervisory signals, resulting in a globally consistent representation of the dynamic scene. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for both long-range 3D/2D motion estimation and novel view synthesis on dynamic scenes.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made significant progress in the field of single-image visual question answering. However, these models face substantial challenges when tasked with queries that span extensive collections of images, similar to real-world scenarios like searching through large photo albums, finding specific information across the internet, or monitoring environmental changes through satellite imagery. This paper explores the task of Multi-Image Visual Question Answering (MIQA): given a large set of images and a natural language query, the task is to generate a relevant and grounded response. We propose a new public benchmark, dubbed "Visual Haystacks (VHs)," specifically designed to evaluate LMMs' capabilities in visual retrieval and reasoning over sets of unrelated images, where we perform comprehensive evaluations demonstrating that even robust closed-source models struggle significantly. Towards addressing these shortcomings, we introduce MIRAGE (Multi-Image Retrieval Augmented Generation), a novel retrieval/QA framework tailored for LMMs that confronts the challenges of MIQA with marked efficiency and accuracy improvements over baseline methods. Our evaluation shows that MIRAGE surpasses closed-source GPT-4o models by up to 11% on the VHs benchmark and offers up to 3.4x improvements in efficiency over text-focused multi-stage approaches.

- **Summary**: Deep convolutional neural networks have made significant breakthroughs in medical image classification, under the assumption that training samples from all classes are simultaneously available. However, in real-world medical scenarios, there's a common need to continuously learn about new diseases, leading to the emerging field of class incremental learning (CIL) in the medical domain. Typically, CIL suffers from catastrophic forgetting when trained on new classes. This phenomenon is mainly caused by the imbalance between old and new classes, and it becomes even more challenging with imbalanced medical datasets. In this work, we introduce two simple yet effective plug-in methods to mitigate the adverse effects of the imbalance. First, we propose a CIL-balanced classification loss to mitigate the classifier bias toward majority classes via logit adjustment. Second, we propose a distribution margin loss that not only alleviates the inter-class overlap in embedding space but also enforces the intra-class compactness. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method with extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (CCH5000, HAM10000, and EyePACS). The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we study multi-target domain adaptation of scene understanding models. While previous methods achieved commendable results through inter-domain consistency losses, they often assumed unrealistic simultaneous access to images from all target domains, overlooking constraints such as data transfer bandwidth limitations and data privacy concerns. Given these challenges, we pose the question: How to merge models adapted independently on distinct domains while bypassing the need for direct access to training data? Our solution to this problem involves two components, merging model parameters and merging model buffers (i.e., normalization layer statistics). For merging model parameters, empirical analyses of mode connectivity surprisingly reveal that linear merging suffices when employing the same pretrained backbone weights for adapting separate models. For merging model buffers, we model the real-world distribution with a Gaussian prior and estimate new statistics from the buffers of separately trained models. Our method is simple yet effective, achieving comparable performance with data combination training baselines, while eliminating the need for accessing training data.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in state-space models (SSMs) have showcased effective performance in modeling long-range dependencies with subquadratic complexity. However, pure SSM-based models still face challenges related to stability and achieving optimal performance on computer vision tasks. Our paper addresses the challenges of scaling SSM-based models for computer vision, particularly the instability and inefficiency of large model sizes. To address this, we introduce a Modulated Group Mamba layer which divides the input channels into four groups and applies our proposed SSM-based efficient Visual Single Selective Scanning (VSSS) block independently to each group, with each VSSS block scanning in one of the four spatial directions. The Modulated Group Mamba layer also wraps the four VSSS blocks into a channel modulation operator to improve cross-channel communication. Furthermore, we introduce a distillation-based training objective to stabilize the training of large models, leading to consistent performance gains. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the merits of the proposed contributions, leading to superior performance over existing methods for image classification on ImageNet-1K, object detection, instance segmentation on MS-COCO, and semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our tiny variant with 23M parameters achieves state-of-the-art performance with a classification top-1 accuracy of 83.3% on ImageNet-1K, while being 26% efficient in terms of parameters, compared to the best existing Mamba design of same model size.
