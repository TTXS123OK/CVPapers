- **Summary**: Plant stress phenotyping traditionally relies on expert assessments and specialized models, limiting scalability in agriculture. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) offer potential solutions to this challenge. We present AgEval, a benchmark comprising 12 diverse plant stress phenotyping tasks, to evaluate these models' capabilities. Our study assesses zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning performance of state-of-the-art models, including Claude, GPT, Gemini, and LLaVA. Results show significant performance improvements with few-shot learning, with F1 scores increasing from 46.24% to 73.37% in 8-shot identification for the best-performing model. Few-shot examples from other classes in the dataset have negligible or negative impacts, although having the exact category example helps to increase performance by 15.38%. We also quantify the consistency of model performance across different classes within each task, finding that the coefficient of variance (CV) ranges from 26.02% to 58.03% across models, implying that subject matter expertise is needed - of 'difficult' classes - to achieve reliability in performance. AgEval establishes baseline metrics for multimodal LLMs in agricultural applications, offering insights into their promise for enhancing plant stress phenotyping at scale.

- **Summary**: The complex traffic environment and various weather conditions make the collection of LiDAR data expensive and challenging. Achieving high-quality and controllable LiDAR data generation is urgently needed, controlling with text is a common practice, but there is little research in this field. To this end, we propose Text2LiDAR, the first efficient, diverse, and text-controllable LiDAR data generation model. Specifically, we design an equirectangular transformer architecture, utilizing the designed equirectangular attention to capture LiDAR features in a manner with data characteristics. Then, we design a control-signal embedding injector to efficiently integrate control signals through the global-to-focused attention mechanism. Additionally, we devise a frequency modulator to assist the model in recovering high-frequency details, ensuring the clarity of the generated point cloud. To foster development in the field and optimize text-controlled generation performance, we construct nuLiDARtext which offers diverse text descriptors for 34,149 LiDAR point clouds from 850 scenes. Experiments on uncontrolled and text-controlled generation in various forms on KITTI-360 and nuScenes datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

- **Summary**: Deep anomaly detection (AD) is perhaps the most controversial of data analytic tasks as it identifies entities that are then specifically targeted for further investigation or exclusion. Also controversial is the application of AI to facial imaging data. This work explores the intersection of these two areas to understand two core questions: "Who" these algorithms are being unfair to and equally important "Why". Recent work has shown that deep AD can be unfair to different groups despite being unsupervised with a recent study showing that for portraits of people: men of color are far more likely to be chosen to be outliers. We study the two main categories of AD algorithms: autoencoder-based and single-class-based which effectively try to compress all the instances with those that can not be easily compressed being deemed to be outliers. We experimentally verify sources of unfairness such as the under-representation of a group (e.g. people of color are relatively rare), spurious group features (e.g. men are often photographed with hats), and group labeling noise (e.g. race is subjective). We conjecture that lack of compressibility is the main foundation and the others cause it but experimental results show otherwise and we present a natural hierarchy amongst them.

- **Summary**: Compared with still image object detection, video object detection (VOD) needs to particularly concern the high across-frame variation in object appearance, and the diverse deterioration in some frames. In principle, the detection in a certain frame of a video can benefit from information in other frames. Thus, how to effectively aggregate features across different frames is key to the target problem. Most of contemporary aggregation methods are tailored for two-stage detectors, suffering from high computational costs due to the dual-stage nature. On the other hand, although one-stage detectors have made continuous progress in handling static images, their applicability to VOD lacks sufficient exploration. To tackle the above issues, this study invents a very simple yet potent strategy of feature selection and aggregation, gaining significant accuracy at marginal computational expense. Concretely, for cutting the massive computation and memory consumption from the dense prediction characteristic of one-stage object detectors, we first condense candidate features from dense prediction maps. Then, the relationship between a target frame and its reference frames is evaluated to guide the aggregation. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted to validate the efficacy of our design, and showcase its advantage over other cutting-edge VOD methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, our model reaches \emph{a new record performance, i.e., 92.9\% AP50 at over 30 FPS on the ImageNet VID dataset on a single 3090 GPU}, making it a compelling option for large-scale or real-time applications. The implementation is simple, and accessible at \url{https://github.com/YuHengsss/YOLOV}.

- **Summary**: This paper presents the first-ever study of adapting compressed image latents to suit the needs of downstream vision tasks that adopt Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MLLMs have extended the success of large language models to modalities (e.g. images) beyond text, but their billion scale hinders deployment on resource-constrained end devices. While cloud-hosted MLLMs could be available, transmitting raw, uncompressed images captured by end devices to the cloud requires an efficient image compression system. To address this, we focus on emerging neural image compression and propose a novel framework with a lightweight transform-neck and a surrogate loss to adapt compressed image latents for MLLM-based vision tasks. The proposed framework is generic and applicable to multiple application scenarios, where the neural image codec can be (1) pre-trained for human perception without updating, (2) fully updated for joint human and machine perception, or (3) fully updated for only machine perception. The transform-neck trained with the surrogate loss is universal, for it can serve various downstream vision tasks enabled by a variety of MLLMs that share the same visual encoder. Our framework has the striking feature of excluding the downstream MLLMs from training the transform-neck, and potentially the neural image codec as well. This stands out from most existing coding for machine approaches that involve downstream networks in training and thus could be impractical when the networks are MLLMs. Extensive experiments on different neural image codecs and various MLLM-based vision tasks show that our method achieves great rate-accuracy performance with much less complexity, demonstrating its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Managing chronic wounds is a global challenge that can be alleviated by the adoption of automatic systems for clinical wound assessment from consumer-grade videos. While 2D image analysis approaches are insufficient for handling the 3D features of wounds, existing approaches utilizing 3D reconstruction methods have not been thoroughly evaluated. To address this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study on 3D wound reconstruction from consumer-grade videos. Specifically, we introduce the SALVE dataset, comprising video recordings of realistic wound phantoms captured with different cameras. Using this dataset, we assess the accuracy and precision of state-of-the-art methods for 3D reconstruction, ranging from traditional photogrammetry pipelines to advanced neural rendering approaches. In our experiments, we observe that photogrammetry approaches do not provide smooth surfaces suitable for precise clinical measurements of wounds. Neural rendering approaches show promise in addressing this issue, advancing the use of this technology in wound care practices.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there is increased interest in foundation models for geoscience due to vast amount of earth observing satellite imagery. Existing remote sensing foundation models make use of the various sources of spectral imagery to create large models pretrained on masked reconstruction task. The embeddings from these foundation models are then used for various downstream remote sensing applications. In this paper we propose a foundational modeling framework for remote sensing geoscience applications, that goes beyond these traditional single modality masked autoencoder family of foundation models. This framework leverages the knowledge guided principles that the spectral imagery captures the impact of the physical drivers on the environmental system, and that the relationship between them is governed by the characteristics of the system. Specifically, our method, called MultiModal Variable Step Forecasting (MM-VSF), uses mutlimodal data (spectral imagery and weather) as its input and a variable step forecasting task as its pretraining objective. In our evaluation we show forecasting of satellite imagery using weather can be used as an effective pretraining task for foundation models. We further show the effectiveness of the embeddings from MM-VSF on the downstream task of pixel wise crop mapping, when compared with a model trained in the traditional setting of single modality input and masked reconstruction based pretraining.

- **Summary**: Visual reasoning, as a prominent research area, plays a crucial role in AI by facilitating concept formation and interaction with the world. However, current works are usually carried out separately on small datasets thus lacking generalization ability. Through rigorous evaluation of diverse benchmarks, we demonstrate the shortcomings of existing ad-hoc methods in achieving cross-domain reasoning and their tendency to data bias fitting. In this paper, we revisit visual reasoning with a two-stage perspective: (1) symbolization and (2) logical reasoning given symbols or their representations. We find that the reasoning stage is better at generalization than symbolization. Thus, it is more efficient to implement symbolization via separated encoders for different data domains while using a shared reasoner. Given our findings, we establish design principles for visual reasoning frameworks following the separated symbolization and shared reasoning. The proposed two-stage framework achieves impressive generalization ability on various visual reasoning tasks, including puzzles, physical prediction, and visual question answering (VQA), encompassing both 2D and 3D modalities. We believe our insights will pave the way for generalizable visual reasoning.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel approach to illumination manipulation in diffusion models, addressing the gap in conditional image generation with a focus on lighting conditions. We conceptualize the diffusion model as a black-box image render and strategically decompose its energy function in alignment with the image formation model. Our method effectively separates and controls illumination-related properties during the generative process. It generates images with realistic illumination effects, including cast shadow, soft shadow, and inter-reflections. Remarkably, it achieves this without the necessity for learning intrinsic decomposition, finding directions in latent space, or undergoing additional training with new datasets.

- **Summary**: Prompt learning represents a promising method for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks by learning a set of text embeddings. One challenge inherent to these methods is the poor generalization performance due to the invalidity of the learned text embeddings for unseen tasks. A straightforward approach to bridge this gap is to freeze the text embeddings in prompts, which results in a lack of capacity to adapt VLMs for downstream tasks. To address this dilemma, we propose a paradigm called EnPrompt with a novel External Layer (EnLa). Specifically, we propose a textual external layer and learnable visual embeddings for adapting VLMs to downstream tasks. The learnable external layer is built upon valid embeddings of pre-trained CLIP. This design considers the balance of learning capabilities between the two branches. To align the textual and visual features, we propose a novel two-pronged approach: i) we introduce the optimal transport as the discrepancy metric to align the vision and text modalities, and ii) we introduce a novel strengthening feature to enhance the interaction between these two modalities. Four representative experiments (i.e., base-to-novel generalization, few-shot learning, cross-dataset generalization, domain shifts generalization) across 15 datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing prompt learning method.

- **Summary**: Existing action quality assessment (AQA) methods often require a large number of label annotations for fully supervised learning, which are laborious and expensive. In practice, the labeled data are difficult to obtain because the AQA annotation process requires domain-specific expertise. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised method, which can be utilized for better assessment of the AQA task by exploiting a large amount of unlabeled data and a small portion of labeled data. Differing from the traditional teacher-student network, we propose a teacher-reference-student architecture to learn both unlabeled and labeled data, where the teacher network and the reference network are used to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data to supervise the student network. Specifically, the teacher predicts pseudo-labels by capturing high-level features of unlabeled data. The reference network provides adequate supervision of the student network by referring to additional action information. Moreover, we introduce confidence memory to improve the reliability of pseudo-labels by storing the most accurate ever output of the teacher network and reference network. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on three AQA benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our method achieves significant improvements and outperforms existing semi-supervised AQA methods.

- **Summary**: Large models can play important roles in many domains. Agriculture is another key factor affecting the lives of people around the world. It provides food, fabric, and coal for humanity. However, facing many challenges such as pests and diseases, soil degradation, global warming, and food security, how to steadily increase the yield in the agricultural sector is a problem that humans still need to solve. Large models can help farmers improve production efficiency and harvest by detecting a series of agricultural production tasks such as pests and diseases, soil quality, and seed quality. It can also help farmers make wise decisions through a variety of information, such as images, text, etc. Herein, we delve into the potential applications of large models in agriculture, from large language model (LLM) and large vision model (LVM) to large vision-language models (LVLM). After gaining a deeper understanding of multimodal large language models (MLLM), it can be recognized that problems such as agricultural image processing, agricultural question answering systems, and agricultural machine automation can all be solved by large models. Large models have great potential in the field of agriculture. We outline the current applications of agricultural large models, and aims to emphasize the importance of large models in the domain of agriculture. In the end, we envisage a future in which famers use MLLM to accomplish many tasks in agriculture, which can greatly improve agricultural production efficiency and yield.

- **Summary**: Image environments and noisy labels hinder deep learning-based inference models in structural damage detection. Post-detection, there is the challenge of reliance on manual assessments of detected damages. As a result, Guided-DetNet, characterized by Generative Attention Module (GAM), Hierarchical Elimination Algorithm (HEA), and Volumetric Contour Visual Assessment (VCVA), is proposed to mitigate complex image environments, noisy labeling, and post-detection manual assessment of structural damages. GAM leverages cross-horizontal and cross-vertical patch merging and cross foreground-background feature fusion to generate varied features to mitigate complex image environments. HEA addresses noisy labeling using hierarchical relationships among classes to refine instances given an image by eliminating unlikely class categories. VCVA assesses the severity of detected damages via volumetric representation and quantification leveraging the Dirac delta distribution. A comprehensive quantitative study, two robustness tests, and an application scenario based on the PEER Hub Image-Net dataset substantiate Guided-DetNet's promising performances. Guided-DetNet outperformed the best-compared models in a triple classification task by a difference of not less than 3% and not less than 2% in a dual detection task under varying metrics.

- **Summary**: Object detection in aerial images has always been a challenging task due to the generally small size of the objects. Most current detectors prioritize novel detection frameworks, often overlooking research on fundamental components such as feature pyramid networks. In this paper, we introduce the Cross-Layer Feature Pyramid Transformer (CFPT), a novel upsampler-free feature pyramid network designed specifically for small object detection in aerial images. CFPT incorporates two meticulously designed attention blocks with linear computational complexity: the Cross-Layer Channel-Wise Attention (CCA) and the Cross-Layer Spatial-Wise Attention (CSA). CCA achieves cross-layer interaction by dividing channel-wise token groups to perceive cross-layer global information along the spatial dimension, while CSA completes cross-layer interaction by dividing spatial-wise token groups to perceive cross-layer global information along the channel dimension. By integrating these modules, CFPT enables cross-layer interaction in one step, thereby avoiding the semantic gap and information loss associated with element-wise summation and layer-by-layer transmission. Furthermore, CFPT incorporates global contextual information, which enhances detection performance for small objects. To further enhance location awareness during cross-layer interaction, we propose the Cross-Layer Consistent Relative Positional Encoding (CCPE) based on inter-layer mutual receptive fields. We evaluate the effectiveness of CFPT on two challenging object detection datasets in aerial images, namely VisDrone2019-DET and TinyPerson. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CFPT, which outperforms state-of-the-art feature pyramid networks while incurring lower computational costs. The code will be released at https://github.com/duzw9311/CFPT.

- **Summary**: Video action detection (VAD) aims to detect actors and classify their actions in a video. We figure that VAD suffers more from classification rather than localization of actors. Hence, we analyze how prevailing methods form features for classification and find that they prioritize actor regions, yet often overlooking the essential contextual information necessary for accurate classification. Accordingly, we propose to reduce the bias toward actor and encourage paying attention to the context that is relevant to each action class. By assigning a class-dedicated query to each action class, our model can dynamically determine where to focus for effective classification. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance on three challenging benchmarks with significantly fewer parameters and less computation.

- **Summary**: Low-light image enhancement is an important task in computer vision, essential for improving the visibility and quality of images captured in non-optimal lighting conditions. Inadequate illumination can lead to significant information loss and poor image quality, impacting various applications such as surveillance. photography, or even autonomous driving. In this regard, automated methods have been developed to automatically adjust illumination in the image for a better visual perception. Current enhancement techniques often use specific datasets to enhance low-light images, but still present challenges when adapting to diverse real-world conditions, where illumination degradation may be localized to specific regions. To address this challenge, the Adaptive Light Enhancement Network (ALEN) is introduced, whose main approach is the use of a classification mechanism to determine whether local or global illumination enhancement is required. Subsequently, estimator networks adjust illumination based on this classification and simultaneously enhance color fidelity. ALEN integrates the Light Classification Network (LCNet) for illuminance categorization, complemented by the Single-Channel Network (SCNet), and Multi-Channel Network (MCNet) for precise estimation of illumination and color, respectively. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets for low-light conditions were carried out to underscore ALEN's robust generalization capabilities, demonstrating superior performance in both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments when compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. The ALEN not only enhances image quality in terms of visual perception but also represents an advancement in high-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, as presented in this work. The code of this method is available at https://github.com/xingyumex/ALEN.

- **Summary**: Surgical scene understanding is a key technical component for enabling intelligent and context aware systems that can transform various aspects of surgical interventions. In this work, we focus on the semantic segmentation task, propose a simple yet effective multi-modal (RGB and depth) training framework called SurgDepth, and show state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on all publicly available datasets applicable for this task. Unlike previous approaches, which either fine-tune SOTA segmentation models trained on natural images, or encode RGB or RGB-D information using RGB only pre-trained backbones, SurgDepth, which is built on top of Vision Transformers (ViTs), is designed to encode both RGB and depth information through a simple fusion mechanism. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including EndoVis2022, AutoLapro, LapI2I and EndoVis2017 to verify the efficacy of SurgDepth. Specifically, SurgDepth achieves a new SOTA IoU of 0.86 on EndoVis 2022 SAR-RARP50 challenge and outperforms the current best method by at least 4%, using a shallow and compute efficient decoder consisting of ConvNeXt blocks.

- **Summary**: Measuring urban safety perception is an important and complex task that traditionally relies heavily on human resources. This process often involves extensive field surveys, manual data collection, and subjective assessments, which can be time-consuming, costly, and sometimes inconsistent. Street View Images (SVIs), along with deep learning methods, provide a way to realize large-scale urban safety detection. However, achieving this goal often requires extensive human annotation to train safety ranking models, and the architectural differences between cities hinder the transferability of these models. Thus, a fully automated method for conducting safety evaluations is essential. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated powerful reasoning and analytical capabilities. Cutting-edge models, e.g., GPT-4 have shown surprising performance in many tasks. We employed these models for urban safety ranking on a human-annotated anchor set and validated that the results from MLLMs align closely with human perceptions. Additionally, we proposed a method based on the pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) feature and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) retrieval to quickly assess the safety index of the entire city. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing training needed deep learning approaches, achieving efficient and accurate urban safety evaluations. The proposed automation for urban safety perception assessment is a valuable tool for city planners, policymakers, and researchers aiming to improve urban environments.

- **Summary**: Despite the rapid advancement of object detection algorithms, processing high-resolution images on embedded devices remains a significant challenge. Theoretically, the fully convolutional network architecture used in current real-time object detectors can handle all input resolutions. However, the substantial computational demands required to process high-resolution images render them impractical for real-time applications. To address this issue, real-time object detection models typically downsample the input image for inference, leading to a loss of detail and decreased accuracy. In response, we developed Octave-YOLO, designed to process high-resolution images in real-time within the constraints of embedded systems. We achieved this through the introduction of the cross frequency partial network (CFPNet), which divides the input feature map into low-resolution, low-frequency, and high-resolution, high-frequency sections. This configuration enables complex operations such as convolution bottlenecks and self-attention to be conducted exclusively on low-resolution feature maps while simultaneously preserving the details in high-resolution maps. Notably, this approach not only dramatically reduces the computational demands of convolution tasks but also allows for the integration of attention modules, which are typically challenging to implement in real-time applications, with minimal additional cost. Additionally, we have incorporated depthwise separable convolution into the core building blocks and downsampling layers to further decrease latency. Experimental results have shown that Octave-YOLO matches the performance of YOLOv8 while significantly reducing computational demands. For example, in 1080x1080 resolution, Octave-YOLO-N is 1.56 times faster than YOLOv8, achieving nearly the same accuracy on the COCO dataset with approximately 40 percent fewer parameters and FLOPs.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel approach to Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) by leveraging the concept of contextuality to enhance the identification and classification of categories in unlabeled datasets. Drawing inspiration from human cognition's ability to recognize objects within their context, we propose a dual-context based method.   Our model integrates two levels of contextuality: instance-level, where nearest-neighbor contexts are utilized for contrastive learning, and cluster-level, employing prototypical contrastive learning based on category prototypes. The integration of the contextual information effectively improves the feature learning and thereby the classification accuracy of all categories, which better deals with the real-world datasets. Different from the traditional semi-supervised and novel category discovery techniques, our model focuses on a more realistic and challenging scenario where both known and novel categories are present in the unlabeled data. Extensive experimental results on several benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Gesture recognition based on surface electromyography (sEMG) has achieved significant progress in human-machine interaction (HMI). However, accurately recognizing predefined gestures within a closed set is still inadequate in practice; a robust open-set system needs to effectively reject unknown gestures while correctly classifying known ones. To handle this challenge, we first report prediction inconsistency discovered for unknown classes due to ensemble diversity, which can significantly facilitate the detection of unknown classes. Based on this insight, we propose an ensemble learning approach, PredIN, to explicitly magnify the prediction inconsistency by enhancing ensemble diversity. Specifically, PredIN maximizes the class feature distribution inconsistency among ensemble members to enhance diversity. Meanwhile, it optimizes inter-class separability within an individual ensemble member to maintain individual performance. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that the PredIN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin.Our proposed method simultaneously achieves accurate closed-set classification for predefined gestures and effective rejection for unknown gestures, exhibiting its efficacy and superiority in open-set gesture recognition based on sEMG.

- **Summary**: The advent of telemedicine represents a transformative development in leveraging technology to extend the reach of specialized medical expertise to remote surgeries, a field where the immediacy of expert guidance is paramount. However, the intricate dynamics of Operating Room (OR) scene pose unique challenges for telemedicine, particularly in achieving high-fidelity, real-time scene reconstruction and transmission amidst obstructions and bandwidth limitations. This paper introduces TeleOR, a pioneering system designed to address these challenges through real-time OR scene reconstruction for Tele-intervention. TeleOR distinguishes itself with three innovative approaches: dynamic self-calibration, which leverages inherent scene features for calibration without the need for preset markers, allowing for obstacle avoidance and real-time camera adjustment; selective OR reconstruction, focusing on dynamically changing scene segments to reduce reconstruction complexity; and viewport-adaptive transmission, optimizing data transmission based on real-time client feedback to efficiently deliver high-quality 3D reconstructions within bandwidth constraints. Comprehensive experiments on the 4D-OR surgical scene dataset demostrate the superiority and applicability of TeleOR, illuminating the potential to revolutionize tele-interventions by overcoming the spatial and technical barriers inherent in remote surgical guidance.

- **Summary**: Face super-resolution aims to reconstruct a high-resolution face image from a low-resolution face image. Previous methods typically employ an encoder-decoder structure to extract facial structural features, where the direct downsampling inevitably introduces distortions, especially to high-frequency features such as edges. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet-based feature enhancement network, which mitigates feature distortion by losslessly decomposing the input feature into high and low-frequency components using the wavelet transform and processing them separately. To improve the efficiency of facial feature extraction, a full domain Transformer is further proposed to enhance local, regional, and global facial features. Such designs allow our method to perform better without stacking many modules as previous methods did. Experiments show that our method effectively balances performance, model size, and speed.

- **Summary**: Predicting traits from images lacking visual cues is challenging, as algorithms are designed to capture visually correlated ground truth. This problem is critical in biomedical sciences, and their solution can improve the efficacy of non-invasive methods. For example, a recent challenge of predicting MGMT methylation status from MRI images is critical for treatment decisions of glioma patients. Using less robust models poses a significant risk in these critical scenarios and underscores the urgency of addressing this issue. Despite numerous efforts, contemporary models exhibit suboptimal performance, and underlying reasons for this limitation remain elusive. In this study, we demystify the complexity of MGMT status prediction through a comprehensive exploration by performing benchmarks of existing models adjoining transfer learning. Their architectures were further dissected by observing gradient flow across layers. Additionally, a feature selection strategy was applied to improve model interpretability. Our finding highlighted that current models are unlearnable and may require new architectures to explore applications in the real world. We believe our study will draw immediate attention and catalyse advancements in predictive modelling with non-visible cues.

- **Summary**: Generating high-fidelity garment animations through traditional workflows, from modeling to rendering, is both tedious and expensive. These workflows often require repetitive steps in response to updates in character motion, rendering viewpoint changes, or appearance edits. Although recent neural rendering offers an efficient solution for computationally intensive processes, it struggles with rendering complex garment animations containing fine wrinkle details and realistic garment-and-body occlusions, while maintaining structural consistency across frames and dense view rendering. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to directly synthesize garment animations from body motion sequences without the need for an explicit garment proxy. Our approach infers garment dynamic features from body motion, providing a preliminary overview of garment structure. Simultaneously, we capture detailed features from synthesized reference images of the garment's front and back, generated by a pre-trained image model. These features are then used to construct a neural radiance field that renders the garment animation video. Additionally, our technique enables garment recoloring by decomposing its visual elements. We demonstrate the generalizability of our method across unseen body motions and camera views, ensuring detailed structural consistency. Furthermore, we showcase its applicability to color editing on both real and synthetic garment data. Compared to existing neural rendering techniques, our method exhibits qualitative and quantitative improvements in garment dynamics and wrinkle detail modeling.

- **Summary**: Scientific posters are used to present the contributions of scientific papers effectively in a graphical format. However, creating a well-designed poster that efficiently summarizes the core of a paper is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. A system that can automatically generate well-designed posters from scientific papers would reduce the workload of authors and help readers understand the outline of the paper visually. Despite the demand for poster generation systems, only a limited research has been conduced due to the lack of publicly available datasets. Thus, in this study, we built the SciPostLayout dataset, which consists of 7,855 scientific posters and manual layout annotations for layout analysis and generation. SciPostLayout also contains 100 scientific papers paired with the posters. All of the posters and papers in our dataset are under the CC-BY license and are publicly available. As benchmark tests for the collected dataset, we conducted experiments for layout analysis and generation utilizing existing computer vision models and found that both layout analysis and generation of posters using SciPostLayout are more challenging than with scientific papers. We also conducted experiments on generating layouts from scientific papers to demonstrate the potential of utilizing LLM as a scientific poster generation system. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/omron-sinicx/scipostlayout_v2. The code is also publicly available at https://github.com/omron-sinicx/scipostlayout.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks have significantly improved the performance of low-level vision tasks but also increased the difficulty of interpretability. A deep understanding of deep models is beneficial for both network design and practical reliability. To take up this challenge, we introduce causality theory to interpret low-level vision models and propose a model-/task-agnostic method called Causal Effect Map (CEM). With CEM, we can visualize and quantify the input-output relationships on either positive or negative effects. After analyzing various low-level vision tasks with CEM, we have reached several interesting insights, such as: (1) Using more information of input images (e.g., larger receptive field) does NOT always yield positive outcomes. (2) Attempting to incorporate mechanisms with a global receptive field (e.g., channel attention) into image denoising may prove futile. (3) Integrating multiple tasks to train a general model could encourage the network to prioritize local information over global context. Based on the causal effect theory, the proposed diagnostic tool can refresh our common knowledge and bring a deeper understanding of low-level vision models.

- **Summary**: Domain generalizability is a crucial aspect of a deep learning model since it determines the capability of the model to perform well on data from unseen domains. However, research on the domain generalizability of deep learning models for vision-language tasks remains limited, primarily because of the lack of required datasets. To address these challenges, we propose VolDoGer: Vision-Language Dataset for Domain Generalization, a dedicated dataset designed for domain generalization that addresses three vision-language tasks: image captioning, visual question answering, and visual entailment. We constructed VolDoGer by extending LLM-based data annotation techniques to vision-language tasks, thereby alleviating the burden of recruiting human annotators. We evaluated the domain generalizability of various models, ranging from fine-tuned models to a recent multimodal large language model, through VolDoGer.

- **Summary**: We address the problem of detecting and mapping all books in a collection of images to entries in a given book catalogue. Instead of performing independent retrieval for each book detected, we treat the image-text mapping problem as a many-to-many matching process, looking for the best overall match between the two sets. We combine a state-of-the-art segmentation method (SAM) to detect book spines and extract book information using a commercial OCR. We then propose a two-stage approach for text-image matching, where CLIP embeddings are used first for fast matching, followed by a second slower stage to refine the matching, employing either the Hungarian Algorithm or a BERT-based model trained to cope with noisy OCR input and partial text matches. To evaluate our approach, we publish a new dataset of annotated bookshelf images that covers the whole book collection of a public library in Spain. In addition, we provide two target lists of book metadata, a closed-set of 15k book titles that corresponds to the known library inventory, and an open-set of 2.3M book titles to simulate an open-world scenario. We report results on two settings, on one hand on a matching-only task, where the book segments and OCR is given and the objective is to perform many-to-many matching against the target lists, and a combined detection and matching task, where books must be first detected and recognised before they are matched to the target list entries. We show that both the Hungarian Matching and the proposed BERT-based model outperform a fuzzy string matching baseline, and we highlight inherent limitations of the matching algorithms as the target increases in size, and when either of the two sets (detected books or target book list) is incomplete. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/llabres/library-dataset

- **Summary**: Previous methods usually only extract the image modality's information to recognize group activity. However, mining image information is approaching saturation, making it difficult to extract richer information. Therefore, extracting complementary information from other modalities to supplement image information has become increasingly important. In fact, action labels provide clear text information to express the action's semantics, which existing methods often overlook. Thus, we propose ActivityCLIP, a plug-and-play method for mining the text information contained in the action labels to supplement the image information for enhancing group activity recognition. ActivityCLIP consists of text and image branches, where the text branch is plugged into the image branch (The off-the-shelf image-based method). The text branch includes Image2Text and relation modeling modules. Specifically, we propose the knowledge transfer module, Image2Text, which adapts image information into text information extracted by CLIP via knowledge distillation. Further, to keep our method convenient, we add fewer trainable parameters based on the relation module of the image branch to model interaction relation in the text branch. To show our method's generality, we replicate three representative methods by ActivityCLIP, which adds only limited trainable parameters, achieving favorable performance improvements for each method. We also conduct extensive ablation studies and compare our method with state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of ActivityCLIP.

- **Summary**: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has garnered widespread attention in the field of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification as it replaces pixel-level manual annotation with diagnostic reports as labels, significantly reducing labor costs. Recent research has shown that bag-level MIL methods often yield better results because they can consider all patches of the WSI as a whole. However, a drawback of such methods is the incorporation of more redundant patches, leading to interference. To extract patches with high diagnostic value while excluding interfering patches to address this issue, we developed an attention-based feature distillation multi-instance learning (AFD-MIL) approach. This approach proposed the exclusion of redundant patches as a preprocessing operation in weakly supervised learning, directly mitigating interference from extensive noise. It also pioneers the use of attention mechanisms to distill features with high diagnostic value, as opposed to the traditional practice of indiscriminately and forcibly integrating all patches. Additionally, we introduced global loss optimization to finely control the feature distillation module. AFD-MIL is orthogonal to many existing MIL methods, leading to consistent performance improvements. This approach has surpassed the current state-of-the-art method, achieving 91.47% ACC (accuracy) and 94.29% AUC (area under the curve) on the Camelyon16 (Camelyon Challenge 2016, breast cancer), while 93.33% ACC and 98.17% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC (The Cancer Genome Atlas Program: non-small cell lung cancer). Different feature distillation methods were used for the two datasets, tailored to the specific diseases, thereby improving performance and interpretability.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have attracted much attention due to their multifunctionality. However, traditional Transformer architectures incur significant overhead due to their secondary computational complexity. To address this issue, we introduce ML-Mamba, a multimodal language model that utilizes the latest and efficient Mamba-2 model for inference. Mamba-2 is known for its linear extension and fast processing of long sequences. We replace the Transformer based backbone with a pre-trained Mamba-2 model and explore methods for integrating 2D visual selective scanning mechanisms into multimodal learning. We also try various visual encoders and Mamba-2 model variants. Our extensive experiments conducted in various multimodal benchmark tests have demonstrated the competitive performance of ML-Mamba and highlighted the potential of state space models in multimodal tasks. The experimental results show that: (1) ML-Mamba achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods such as TinyLaVA and MobileVLM v2 through its linear sequential modeling, while also having faster inference speed; (2) ML-Mamba performs well in visual hallucinations and spatial relationship judgment in closed set benchmark tests; (3) ML-Mamba achieves performance comparable to LLaVA while reducing the number of parameters by 40\%.(4) Compared to the multimodal model using the original Mamba model, the Mamba-2 based large-scale multimodal language model has stronger inference performance and effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Volumetric shape representations have become ubiquitous in multi-view reconstruction tasks. They often build on regular voxel grids as discrete representations of 3D shape functions, such as SDF or radiance fields, either as the full shape model or as sampled instantiations of continuous representations, as with neural networks. Despite their proven efficiency, voxel representations come with the precision versus complexity trade-off. This inherent limitation can significantly impact performance when moving away from simple and uncluttered scenes. In this paper we investigate an alternative discretization strategy with the Centroidal Voronoi Tesselation (CVT). CVTs allow to better partition the observation space with respect to shape occupancy and to focus the discretization around shape surfaces. To leverage this discretization strategy for multi-view reconstruction, we introduce a volumetric optimization framework that combines explicit SDF fields with a shallow color network, in order to estimate 3D shape properties over tetrahedral grids. Experimental results with Chamfer statistics validate this approach with unprecedented reconstruction quality on various scenarios such as objects, open scenes or human.

- **Summary**: The task of image anomaly detection (IAD) aims to identify deviations from normality in image data. These anomalies are patterns that deviate significantly from what the IAD model has learned from the data during training. However, in real-world scenarios, the criteria for what constitutes normality often change, necessitating the reclassification of previously anomalous instances as normal. To address this challenge, we propose a new scenario termed "normality addition," involving the post-training adjustment of decision boundaries to incorporate new normalities. To address this challenge, we propose a method called Normality Addition via Normality Detection (NAND), leveraging a vision-language model. NAND performs normality detection which detect patterns related to the intended normality within images based on textual descriptions. We then modify the results of a pre-trained IAD model to implement this normality addition. Using the benchmark dataset in IAD, MVTec AD, we establish an evaluation protocol for the normality addition task and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the NAND method.

- **Summary**: This paper presents Team Xaiofei's innovative approach to exploring Face-Voice Association in Multilingual Environments (FAME) at ACM Multimedia 2024. We focus on the impact of different languages in face-voice matching by building upon Fusion and Orthogonal Projection (FOP), introducing four key components: a dual-branch structure, dynamic sample pair weighting, robust data augmentation, and score polarization strategy. Our dual-branch structure serves as an auxiliary mechanism to better integrate and provide more comprehensive information. We also introduce a dynamic weighting mechanism for various sample pairs to optimize learning. Data augmentation techniques are employed to enhance the model's generalization across diverse conditions. Additionally, score polarization strategy based on age and gender matching confidence clarifies and accentuates the final results. Our methods demonstrate significant effectiveness, achieving an equal error rate (EER) of 20.07 on the V2-EH dataset and 21.76 on the V1-EU dataset.

- **Summary**: Grasp detection is an essential task in robotics with various industrial applications. However, traditional methods often struggle with occlusions and do not utilize language for grasping. Incorporating natural language into grasp detection remains a challenging task and largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a new method for language-driven grasp detection with mask-guided attention by utilizing the transformer attention mechanism with semantic segmentation features. Our approach integrates visual data, segmentation mask features, and natural language instructions, significantly improving grasp detection accuracy. Our work introduces a new framework for language-driven grasp detection, paving the way for language-driven robotic applications. Intensive experiments show that our method outperforms other recent baselines by a clear margin, with a 10.0% success score improvement. We further validate our method in real-world robotic experiments, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: Text Recognition (TR) refers to the research area that focuses on retrieving textual information from images, a topic that has seen significant advancements in the last decade due to the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNN). However, these solutions often necessitate vast amounts of manually labeled or synthetic data. Addressing this challenge, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has gained attention by utilizing large datasets of unlabeled data to train DNN, thereby generating meaningful and robust representations. Although SSL was initially overlooked in TR because of its unique characteristics, recent years have witnessed a surge in the development of SSL methods specifically for this field. This rapid development, however, has led to many methods being explored independently, without taking previous efforts in methodology or comparison into account, thereby hindering progress in the field of research. This paper, therefore, seeks to consolidate the use of SSL in the field of TR, offering a critical and comprehensive overview of the current state of the art. We will review and analyze the existing methods, compare their results, and highlight inconsistencies in the current literature. This thorough analysis aims to provide general insights into the field, propose standardizations, identify new research directions, and foster its proper development.

- **Summary**: The SYNTAX score has become a widely used measure of coronary disease severity , crucial in selecting the optimal mode of revascularization. This paper introduces a new medical regression and classification problem - automatically estimating SYNTAX score from coronary angiography. Our study presents a comprehensive dataset of 1,844 patients, featuring a balanced distribution of individuals with zero and non-zero scores. This dataset includes a first-of-its-kind, complete coronary angiography samples captured through a multi-view X-ray video, allowing one to observe coronary arteries from multiple perspectives. Furthermore, we present a novel, fully automatic end-to-end method for estimating the SYNTAX. For such a difficult task, we have achieved a solid coefficient of determination R2 of 0.51 in score predictions.

- **Summary**: In regenerative medicine research, we experimentally design the composition of chemical medium. We add different components to 384-well plates and culture the biological cells. We monitor the condition of the cells and take time-lapse bioimages for morphological assay. In particular, precipitation can appear as artefacts in the image and contaminate the noise in the imaging assay. Inspecting precipitates is a tedious task for the observer, and differences in experience can lead to variations in judgement from person to person. The machine learning approach will remove the burden of human inspection and provide consistent inspection. In addition, precipitation features are as small as 10-20 {\mu}m. A 1200 pixel square well image resized under a resolution of 2.82 {\mu}m/pixel will result in a reduction in precipitation features. Dividing the well images into 240-pixel squares and learning without resizing preserves the resolution of the original image. In this study, we developed an application to automatically detect precipitation on 384-well plates utilising optical microscope images. We apply MN-pair contrastive clustering to extract precipitation classes from approximately 20,000 patch images. To detect precipitation features, we compare deeper FCDDs detectors with optional backbones and build a machine learning pipeline to detect precipitation from the maximum score of quadruplet well images using isolation Forest algorithm, where the anomaly score is ranged from zero to one. Furthermore, using this application we can visualise precipitation situ heatmap on a 384-well plate.

- **Summary**: Video diffusion models have made substantial progress in various video generation applications. However, training models for long video generation tasks require significant computational and data resources, posing a challenge to developing long video diffusion models. This paper investigates a straightforward and training-free approach to extend an existing short video diffusion model (e.g. pre-trained on 16-frame videos) for consistent long video generation (e.g. 128 frames). Our preliminary observation has found that directly applying the short video diffusion model to generate long videos can lead to severe video quality degradation. Further investigation reveals that this degradation is primarily due to the distortion of high-frequency components in long videos, characterized by a decrease in spatial high-frequency components and an increase in temporal high-frequency components. Motivated by this, we propose a novel solution named FreeLong to balance the frequency distribution of long video features during the denoising process. FreeLong blends the low-frequency components of global video features, which encapsulate the entire video sequence, with the high-frequency components of local video features that focus on shorter subsequences of frames. This approach maintains global consistency while incorporating diverse and high-quality spatiotemporal details from local videos, enhancing both the consistency and fidelity of long video generation. We evaluated FreeLong on multiple base video diffusion models and observed significant improvements. Additionally, our method supports coherent multi-prompt generation, ensuring both visual coherence and seamless transitions between scenes.

- **Summary**: Volumetry is one of the principal downstream applications of 3D medical image segmentation, for example, to detect abnormal tissue growth or for surgery planning. Conformal Prediction is a promising framework for uncertainty quantification, providing calibrated predictive intervals associated with automatic volume measurements. However, this methodology is based on the hypothesis that calibration and test samples are exchangeable, an assumption that is in practice often violated in medical image applications. A weighted formulation of Conformal Prediction can be framed to mitigate this issue, but its empirical investigation in the medical domain is still lacking. A potential reason is that it relies on the estimation of the density ratio between the calibration and test distributions, which is likely to be intractable in scenarios involving high-dimensional data. To circumvent this, we propose an efficient approach for density ratio estimation relying on the compressed latent representations generated by the segmentation model. Our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to reduce the coverage error in the presence of covariate shifts, in both synthetic and real-world settings. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/benolmbrt/wcp_miccai

- **Summary**: In recent years, the attention towards One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) has been driven by its capacity to minimize communication. With the development of the diffusion model (DM), several methods employ the DM for OSFL, utilizing model parameters, image features, or textual prompts as mediums to transfer the local client knowledge to the server. However, these mediums often require public datasets or the uniform feature extractor, significantly limiting their practicality. In this paper, we propose FedDEO, a Description-Enhanced One-Shot Federated Learning Method with DMs, offering a novel exploration of utilizing the DM in OSFL. The core idea of our method involves training local descriptions on the clients, serving as the medium to transfer the knowledge of the distributed clients to the server. Firstly, we train local descriptions on the client data to capture the characteristics of client distributions, which are then uploaded to the server. On the server, the descriptions are used as conditions to guide the DM in generating synthetic datasets that comply with the distributions of various clients, enabling the training of the aggregated model. Theoretical analyses and sufficient quantitation and visualization experiments on three large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that through the training of local descriptions, the server is capable of generating synthetic datasets with high quality and diversity. Consequently, with advantages in communication and privacy protection, the aggregated model outperforms compared FL or diffusion-based OSFL methods and, on some clients, outperforms the performance ceiling of centralized training.

- **Summary**: In the field of architecture, the conversion of single images into 2 and 1/2D and 3D meshes is a promising technology that enhances design visualization and efficiency. This paper evaluates four innovative methods: "One-2-3-45," "CRM: Single Image to 3D Textured Mesh with Convolutional Reconstruction Model," "Instant Mesh," and "Image-to-Mesh." These methods are at the forefront of this technology, focusing on their applicability in architectural design and visualization. They streamline the creation of 3D architectural models, enabling rapid prototyping and detailed visualization from minimal initial inputs, such as photographs or simple sketches.One-2-3-45 leverages a diffusion-based approach to generate multi-view reconstructions, ensuring high geometric fidelity and texture quality. CRM utilizes a convolutional network to integrate geometric priors into its architecture, producing detailed and textured meshes quickly and efficiently. Instant Mesh combines the strengths of multi-view diffusion and sparse-view models to offer speed and scalability, suitable for diverse architectural projects. Image-to-Mesh leverages a generative adversarial network (GAN) to produce 3D meshes from single images, focusing on maintaining high texture fidelity and geometric accuracy by incorporating image and depth map data into its training process. It uses a hybrid approach that combines voxel-based representations with surface reconstruction techniques to ensure detailed and realistic 3D models.This comparative study highlights each method's contribution to reducing design cycle times, improving accuracy, and enabling flexible adaptations to various architectural styles and requirements. By providing architects with powerful tools for rapid visualization and iteration, these advancements in 3D mesh generation are set to revolutionize architectural practices.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been applied in many computer vision tasks and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. However, misclassification will occur when DNNs predict adversarial examples which are created by adding human-imperceptible adversarial noise to natural examples. This limits the application of DNN in security-critical fields. In order to enhance the robustness of models, previous research has primarily focused on the unimodal domain, such as image recognition and video understanding. Although multi-modal learning has achieved advanced performance in various tasks, such as action recognition, research on the robustness of RGB-skeleton action recognition models is scarce. In this paper, we systematically investigate how to improve the robustness of RGB-skeleton action recognition models. We initially conducted empirical analysis on the robustness of different modalities and observed that the skeleton modality is more robust than the RGB modality. Motivated by this observation, we propose the \formatword{A}ttention-based \formatword{M}odality \formatword{R}eweighter (\formatword{AMR}), which utilizes an attention layer to re-weight the two modalities, enabling the model to learn more robust features. Our AMR is plug-and-play, allowing easy integration with multimodal models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of AMR, we conducted extensive experiments on various datasets. For example, compared to the SOTA methods, AMR exhibits a 43.77\% improvement against PGD20 attacks on the NTU-RGB+D 60 dataset. Furthermore, it effectively balances the differences in robustness between different modalities.

- **Summary**: The visual medium (images and videos) naturally contains a large amount of information redundancy, thereby providing a great opportunity for leveraging efficiency in processing. While Vision Transformer (ViT) based models scale effectively to large data regimes, they fail to capitalize on this inherent redundancy, leading to higher computational costs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) networks demonstrate scalability while maintaining same inference-time costs, but they come with a larger parameter footprint. We present Mixture of Nested Experts (MoNE), which utilizes a nested structure for experts, wherein individual experts fall on an increasing compute-accuracy curve. Given a compute budget, MoNE learns to dynamically choose tokens in a priority order, and thus redundant tokens are processed through cheaper nested experts. Using this framework, we achieve equivalent performance as the baseline models, while reducing inference time compute by over two-fold. We validate our approach on standard image and video datasets - ImageNet-21K, Kinetics400, and Something-Something-v2. We further highlight MoNE$'$s adaptability by showcasing its ability to maintain strong performance across different inference-time compute budgets on videos, using only a single trained model.

- **Summary**: Image Edge detection (ED) is a base task in computer vision. While the performance of the ED algorithm has been improved greatly by introducing CNN-based models, current models still suffer from unsatisfactory precision rates especially when only a low error toleration distance is allowed. Therefore, model architecture for more precise predictions still needs an investigation. On the other hand, the unavoidable noise training data provided by humans would lead to unsatisfactory model predictions even when inputs are edge maps themselves, which also needs improvement. In this paper, more precise ED models are presented with cascaded skipping density blocks (CSDB). Our models obtain state-of-the-art(SOTA) predictions in several datasets, especially in average precision rate (AP), which is confirmed by extensive experiments. Moreover, our models do not include down-sample operations, demonstrating those widely believed operations are not necessary. Also, a novel modification on data augmentation for training is employed, which allows noiseless data to be employed in model training and thus improves the performance of models predicting on edge maps themselves.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image generative models often present issues regarding fairness with respect to certain sensitive attributes, such as gender or skin tone. This study aims to reproduce the results presented in "ITI-GEN: Inclusive Text-to-Image Generation" by Zhang et al. (2023a), which introduces a model to improve inclusiveness in these kinds of models. We show that most of the claims made by the authors about ITI-GEN hold: it improves the diversity and quality of generated images, it is scalable to different domains, it has plug-and-play capabilities, and it is efficient from a computational point of view. However, ITI-GEN sometimes uses undesired attributes as proxy features and it is unable to disentangle some pairs of (correlated) attributes such as gender and baldness. In addition, when the number of considered attributes increases, the training time grows exponentially and ITI-GEN struggles to generate inclusive images for all elements in the joint distribution. To solve these issues, we propose using Hard Prompt Search with negative prompting, a method that does not require training and that handles negation better than vanilla Hard Prompt Search. Nonetheless, Hard Prompt Search (with or without negative prompting) cannot be used for continuous attributes that are hard to express in natural language, an area where ITI-GEN excels as it is guided by images during training. Finally, we propose combining ITI-GEN and Hard Prompt Search with negative prompting.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present our first proposal of a machine learning system for the classification of freshwater snails of the genus Radomaniola. We elaborate on the specific challenges encountered during system design, and how we tackled them; namely a small, very imbalanced dataset with a high number of classes and high visual similarity between classes. We then show how we employed triplet networks and the multiple input modalities of images, measurements, and genetic information to overcome these challenges and reach a performance comparable to that of a trained domain expert.

- **Summary**: Generative models, such as diffusion models (DMs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs), produce images with a level of authenticity that makes them nearly indistinguishable from real photos and artwork. While this capability is beneficial for many industries, the difficulty of identifying synthetic images leaves online media platforms vulnerable to impersonation and misinformation attempts. To support the development of defensive methods, we introduce ImagiNet, a high-resolution and balanced dataset for synthetic image detection, designed to mitigate potential biases in existing resources. It contains 200K examples, spanning four content categories: photos, paintings, faces, and uncategorized. Synthetic images are produced with open-source and proprietary generators, whereas real counterparts of the same content type are collected from public datasets. The structure of ImagiNet allows for a two-track evaluation system: i) classification as real or synthetic and ii) identification of the generative model. To establish a baseline, we train a ResNet-50 model using a self-supervised contrastive objective (SelfCon) for each track. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and high inference speed across established benchmarks, achieving an AUC of up to 0.99 and balanced accuracy ranging from 86% to 95%, even under social network conditions that involve compression and resizing. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/delyan-boychev/imaginet.

- **Summary**: Data-free quantization (DFQ) is a technique that creates a lightweight network from its full-precision counterpart without the original training data, often through a synthetic dataset. Although several DFQ methods have been proposed for vision transformer (ViT) architectures, they fail to achieve efficacy in low-bit settings. Examining the existing methods, we identify that their synthetic data produce misaligned attention maps, while those of the real samples are highly aligned. From the observation of aligned attention, we find that aligning attention maps of synthetic data helps to improve the overall performance of quantized ViTs. Motivated by this finding, we devise \aname, a novel DFQ method designed for ViTs that focuses on inter-head attention similarity. First, we generate synthetic data by aligning head-wise attention responses in relation to spatial query patches. Then, we apply head-wise structural attention distillation to align the attention maps of the quantized network to those of the full-precision teacher. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art performance for data-free ViT quantization.

- **Summary**: Vision-language foundation models such as CLIP have achieved tremendous results in global vision-language alignment, but still show some limitations in creating representations for specific image regions. % To address this problem, we propose MaskInversion, a method that leverages the feature representations of pre-trained foundation models, such as CLIP, to generate a context-aware embedding for a query image region specified by a mask at test time. MaskInversion starts with initializing an embedding token and compares its explainability map, derived from the foundation model, to the query mask. The embedding token is then subsequently refined to approximate the query region by minimizing the discrepancy between its explainability map and the query mask. During this process, only the embedding vector is updated, while the underlying foundation model is kept frozen allowing to use MaskInversion with any pre-trained model. As deriving the explainability map involves computing its gradient, which can be expensive, we propose a gradient decomposition strategy that simplifies this computation. The learned region representation can be used for a broad range of tasks, including open-vocabulary class retrieval, referring expression comprehension, as well as for localized captioning and image generation. We evaluate the proposed method on all those tasks on several datasets such as PascalVOC, MSCOCO, RefCOCO, and OpenImagesV7 and show its capabilities compared to other SOTA approaches.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in deep convolutional neural networks have significantly improved the performance of saliency prediction. However, the manual configuration of the neural network architectures requires domain knowledge expertise and can still be time-consuming and error-prone. To solve this, we propose a new Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework for saliency prediction with two contributions. Firstly, a supernet for saliency prediction is built with a weight-sharing network containing all candidate architectures, by integrating a dynamic convolution into the encoder-decoder in the supernet, termed SalNAS. Secondly, despite the fact that SalNAS is highly efficient (20.98 million parameters), it can suffer from the lack of generalization. To solve this, we propose a self-knowledge distillation approach, termed Self-KD, that trains the student SalNAS with the weighted average information between the ground truth and the prediction from the teacher model. The teacher model, while sharing the same architecture, contains the best-performing weights chosen by cross-validation. Self-KD can generalize well without the need to compute the gradient in the teacher model, enabling an efficient training system. By utilizing Self-KD, SalNAS outperforms other state-of-the-art saliency prediction models in most evaluation rubrics across seven benchmark datasets while being a lightweight model.

- **Summary**: Infrared small target detection poses unique challenges due to the scarcity of intrinsic target features and the abundance of similar background distractors. We argue that background semantics play a pivotal role in distinguishing visually similar objects for this task. To address this, we introduce a new task -- clustered infrared small target detection, and present DenseSIRST, a novel benchmark dataset that provides per-pixel semantic annotations for background regions, enabling the transition from sparse to dense target detection. Leveraging this dataset, we propose the Background-Aware Feature Exchange Network (BAFE-Net), which transforms the detection paradigm from a single task focused on the foreground to a multi-task architecture that jointly performs target detection and background semantic segmentation. BAFE-Net introduces a cross-task feature hard-exchange mechanism to embed target and background semantics between the two tasks. Furthermore, we propose the Background-Aware Gaussian Copy-Paste (BAG-CP) method, which selectively pastes small targets into sky regions during training, avoiding the creation of false alarm targets in complex non-sky backgrounds. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BAG-CP and BAFE-Net in improving target detection accuracy while reducing false alarms. The DenseSIRST dataset, code, and trained models are available at https://github.com/GrokCV/BAFE-Net.

- **Summary**: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt pre-trained models to the target domain during testing. In reality, this adaptability can be influenced by multiple factors. Researchers have identified various challenging scenarios and developed diverse methods to address these challenges, such as dealing with continual domain shifts, mixed domains, and temporally correlated or imbalanced class distributions. Despite these efforts, a unified and comprehensive benchmark has yet to be established. To this end, we propose a Unified Test-Time Adaptation (UniTTA) benchmark, which is comprehensive and widely applicable. Each scenario within the benchmark is fully described by a Markov state transition matrix for sampling from the original dataset. The UniTTA benchmark considers both domain and class as two independent dimensions of data and addresses various combinations of imbalance/balance and i.i.d./non-i.i.d./continual conditions, covering a total of \( (2 \times 3)^2 = 36 \) scenarios. It establishes a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for realistic TTA and provides a guideline for practitioners to select the most suitable TTA method. Alongside this benchmark, we propose a versatile UniTTA framework, which includes a Balanced Domain Normalization (BDN) layer and a COrrelated Feature Adaptation (COFA) method--designed to mitigate distribution gaps in domain and class, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our UniTTA framework excels within the UniTTA benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art performance on average.

- **Summary**: Accurate measurement of fetal head circumference is crucial for estimating fetal growth during routine prenatal screening. Prior to measurement, it is necessary to accurately identify and segment the region of interest, specifically the fetal head, in ultrasound images. Recent advancements in deep learning techniques have shown significant progress in segmenting the fetal head using encoder-decoder models. Among these models, U-Net has become a standard approach for accurate segmentation. However, training an encoder-decoder model can be a time-consuming process that demands substantial computational resources. Moreover, fine-tuning these models is particularly challenging when there is a limited amount of data available. There are still no "best-practice" guidelines for optimal fine-tuning of U-net for fetal ultrasound image segmentation. This work summarizes existing fine-tuning strategies with various backbone architectures, model components, and fine-tuning strategies across ultrasound data from Netherlands, Spain, Malawi, Egypt and Algeria. Our study shows that (1) fine-tuning U-Net leads to better performance than training from scratch, (2) fine-tuning strategies in decoder are superior to other strategies, (3) network architecture with less number of parameters can achieve similar or better performance. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of fine-tuning strategies in low-resource settings and further expand our experiments into few-shot learning. Lastly, we publicly released our code and specific fine-tuned weights.

- **Summary**: Recently, deep learning-based single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection technology has made significant progress. However, existing infrared small target detection methods are often optimized for a fixed image resolution, a single wavelength, or a specific imaging system, limiting their breadth and flexibility in practical applications. Therefore, we propose a refined infrared small target detection scheme based on an adjustable sensitivity (AS) strategy and multi-scale fusion. Specifically, a multi-scale model fusion framework based on multi-scale direction-aware network (MSDA-Net) is constructed, which uses input images of multiple scales to train multiple models and fuses them. Multi-scale fusion helps characterize the shape, edge, and texture features of the target from different scales, making the model more accurate and reliable in locating the target. At the same time, we fully consider the characteristics of the infrared small target detection task and construct an edge enhancement difficulty mining (EEDM) loss. The EEDM loss helps alleviate the problem of category imbalance and guides the network to pay more attention to difficult target areas and edge features during training. In addition, we propose an adjustable sensitivity strategy for post-processing. This strategy significantly improves the detection rate of infrared small targets while ensuring segmentation accuracy. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves the best performance. Notably, this scheme won the first prize in the PRCV 2024 wide-area infrared small target detection competition.

- **Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention due to their unique neuronal dynamics and low-power nature. Previous research empirically shows that SNNs with Poisson coding are more robust than Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) on small-scale datasets. However, it is still unclear in theory how the adversarial robustness of SNNs is derived, and whether SNNs can still maintain its adversarial robustness advantage on large-scale dataset tasks. This work theoretically demonstrates that SNN's inherent adversarial robustness stems from its Poisson coding. We reveal the conceptual equivalence of Poisson coding and randomized smoothing in defense strategies, and analyze in depth the trade-off between accuracy and adversarial robustness in SNNs via the proposed Randomized Smoothing Coding (RSC) method. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed RSC-SNNs show remarkable adversarial robustness, surpassing ANNs and achieving state-of-the-art robustness results on large-scale dataset ImageNet.

- **Summary**: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR) is the gold standard for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. Clinical diagnoses predominantly rely on magnitude-only Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images, omitting crucial phase information that might provide additional diagnostic benefits. In contrast, k-space is complex-valued and encompasses both magnitude and phase information, while humans cannot directly perceive. In this work, we propose KMAE, a Transformer-based model specifically designed to process k-space data directly, eliminating conventional intermediary conversion steps to the image domain. KMAE can handle critical cardiac disease classification, relevant phenotype regression, and cardiac morphology segmentation tasks. We utilize this model to investigate the potential of k-space-based diagnosis in cardiac MRI. Notably, this model achieves competitive classification and regression performance compared to image-domain methods e.g. Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) and delivers satisfactory segmentation performance with a myocardium dice score of 0.884. Last but not least, our model exhibits robust performance with consistent results even when the k-space is 8* undersampled. We encourage the MR community to explore the untapped potential of k-space and pursue end-to-end, automated diagnosis with reduced human intervention.

- **Summary**: In the field of Image-Text Retrieval (ITR), recent advancements have leveraged large-scale Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) for Fine-Grained (FG) instance-level retrieval, achieving high accuracy at the cost of increased computational complexity. For Coarse-Grained (CG) category-level retrieval, prominent approaches employ Cross-Modal Hashing (CMH) to prioritise efficiency, albeit at the cost of retrieval performance. Due to differences in methodologies, FG and CG models are rarely compared directly within evaluations in the literature, resulting in a lack of empirical data quantifying the retrieval performance-efficiency tradeoffs between the two. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the \texttt{FiCo-ITR} library, which standardises evaluation methodologies for both FG and CG models, facilitating direct comparisons. We conduct empirical evaluations of representative models from both subfields, analysing precision, recall, and computational complexity across varying data scales. Our findings offer new insights into the performance-efficiency trade-offs between recent representative FG and CG models, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations. These findings provide the foundation necessary to make more informed decisions regarding model selection for specific retrieval tasks and highlight avenues for future research into hybrid systems that leverage the strengths of both FG and CG approaches.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based personalized visual content generation technologies have achieved significant breakthroughs, allowing for the creation of specific objects by just learning from a few reference photos. However, when misused to fabricate fake news or unsettling content targeting individuals, these technologies could cause considerable societal harm. To address this problem, current methods generate adversarial samples by adversarially maximizing the training loss, thereby disrupting the output of any personalized generation model trained with these samples. However, the existing methods fail to achieve effective defense and maintain stealthiness, as they overlook the intrinsic properties of diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce a novel Dual-Domain Anti-Personalization framework (DDAP). Specifically, we have developed Spatial Perturbation Learning (SPL) by exploiting the fixed and perturbation-sensitive nature of the image encoder in personalized generation. Subsequently, we have designed a Frequency Perturbation Learning (FPL) method that utilizes the characteristics of diffusion models in the frequency domain. The SPL disrupts the overall texture of the generated images, while the FPL focuses on image details. By alternating between these two methods, we construct the DDAP framework, effectively harnessing the strengths of both domains. To further enhance the visual quality of the adversarial samples, we design a localization module to accurately capture attentive areas while ensuring the effectiveness of the attack and avoiding unnecessary disturbances in the background. Extensive experiments on facial benchmarks have shown that the proposed DDAP enhances the disruption of personalized generation models while also maintaining high quality in adversarial samples, making it more effective in protecting privacy in practical applications.

- **Summary**: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), which excels at abstracting open-world representations across domains and modalities, has become a foundation for a variety of vision and multimodal tasks. However, recent studies reveal that CLIP has severe visual shortcomings, such as which can hardly distinguish orientation, quantity, color, structure, etc. These visual shortcomings also limit the perception capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) built on CLIP. The main reason could be that the image-text pairs used to train CLIP are inherently biased, due to the lack of the distinctiveness of the text and the diversity of images. In this work, we present a simple post-training approach for CLIP models, which largely overcomes its visual shortcomings via a self-supervised diffusion process. We introduce DIVA, which uses the DIffusion model as a Visual Assistant for CLIP. Specifically, DIVA leverages generative feedback from text-to-image diffusion models to optimize CLIP representations, with only images (without corresponding text). We demonstrate that DIVA improves CLIP's performance on the challenging MMVP-VLM benchmark which assesses fine-grained visual abilities to a large extent (e.g., 3-7%), and enhances the performance of MLLMs and vision models on multimodal understanding and segmentation tasks. Extensive evaluation on 29 image classification and retrieval benchmarks confirms that our framework preserves CLIP's strong zero-shot capabilities.

- **Summary**: Histological artifacts pose challenges for both pathologists and Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems, leading to errors in analysis. Current approaches for histological artifact restoration, based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and pixel-level Diffusion Models, suffer from performance limitations and computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, LatentArtiFusion, which leverages the latent diffusion model (LDM) to reconstruct histological artifacts with high performance and computational efficiency. Unlike traditional pixel-level diffusion frameworks, LatentArtiFusion executes the restoration process in a lower-dimensional latent space, significantly improving computational efficiency. Moreover, we introduce a novel regional artifact reconstruction algorithm in latent space to prevent mistransfer in non-artifact regions, distinguishing our approach from GAN-based methods. Through extensive experiments on real-world histology datasets, LatentArtiFusion demonstrates remarkable speed, outperforming state-of-the-art pixel-level diffusion frameworks by more than 30X. It also consistently surpasses GAN-based methods by at least 5% across multiple evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in downstream tissue classification tasks, showcasing its practical utility.

- **Summary**: Emerging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit great potential for chart question answering (CQA). Recent efforts primarily focus on scaling up training datasets (i.e., charts, data tables, and question-answer (QA) pairs) through data collection and synthesis. However, our empirical study on existing MLLMs and CQA datasets reveals notable gaps. First, current data collection and synthesis focus on data volume and lack consideration of fine-grained visual encodings and QA tasks, resulting in unbalanced data distribution divergent from practical CQA scenarios. Second, existing work follows the training recipe of the base MLLMs initially designed for natural images, under-exploring the adaptation to unique chart characteristics, such as rich text elements. To fill the gap, we propose a visualization-referenced instruction tuning approach to guide the training dataset enhancement and model development. Specifically, we propose a novel data engine to effectively filter diverse and high-quality data from existing datasets and subsequently refine and augment the data using LLM-based generation techniques to better align with practical QA tasks and visual encodings. Then, to facilitate the adaptation to chart characteristics, we utilize the enriched data to train an MLLM by unfreezing the vision encoder and incorporating a mixture-of-resolution adaptation strategy for enhanced fine-grained recognition. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. Even with fewer training examples, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CQA models on established benchmarks. We also contribute a dataset split as a benchmark for future research. Source codes and datasets of this paper are available at https://github.com/zengxingchen/ChartQA-MLLM.

- **Summary**: Vision-based robot policy learning, which maps visual inputs to actions, necessitates a holistic understanding of diverse visual tasks beyond single-task needs like classification or segmentation. Inspired by this, we introduce Theia, a vision foundation model for robot learning that distills multiple off-the-shelf vision foundation models trained on varied vision tasks. Theia's rich visual representations encode diverse visual knowledge, enhancing downstream robot learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Theia outperforms its teacher models and prior robot learning models using less training data and smaller model sizes. Additionally, we quantify the quality of pre-trained visual representations and hypothesize that higher entropy in feature norm distributions leads to improved robot learning performance.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce SpaER, a pioneering method for fetal motion tracking that leverages equivariant filters and self-attention mechanisms to effectively learn spatio-temporal representations. Different from conventional approaches that statically estimate fetal brain motions from pairs of images, our method dynamically tracks the rigid movement patterns of the fetal head across temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we first develop an equivariant neural network that efficiently learns rigid motion sequences through low-dimensional spatial representations of images. Subsequently, we learn spatio-temporal representations by incorporating time encoding and self-attention neural network layers. This approach allows for the capture of long-term dependencies of fetal brain motion and addresses alignment errors due to contrast changes and severe motion artifacts. Our model also provides a geometric deformation estimation that properly addresses image distortions among all time frames. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to learn spatial-temporal representations via deep neural networks for fetal motion tracking without data augmentation. We validated our model using real fetal echo-planar images with simulated and real motions. Our method carries significant potential value in accurately measuring, tracking, and correcting fetal motion in fetal MRI sequences.

Although 4D neural reconstruction is popular, registration for such representations remains a challenging task, especially for dynamic scene registration in surgical planning and simulation. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for dynamic surgical neural scene registration. We first utilize 4D Gaussian Splatting to represent the surgical scene and capture both static and dynamic scenes effectively. Then, a spatial aware feature aggregation method, Spatially Weight Cluttering (SWC) is proposed to accurately align the feature between surgical scenes, enabling precise and realistic surgical simulations. Lastly, we present a novel strategy of deformable scene registration to register two dynamic scenes. By incorporating both spatial and temporal information for correspondence matching, our approach achieves superior performance compared to existing registration methods for implicit neural representation. The proposed method has the potential to improve surgical planning and training, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.

- **Summary**: Graph-based holistic scene representations facilitate surgical workflow understanding and have recently demonstrated significant success. However, this task is often hindered by the limited availability of densely annotated surgical scene data. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end framework for the generation and optimization of surgical scene graphs on a downstream task. Our approach leverages the flexibility of graph-based spectral clustering and the generalization capability of foundation models to generate unsupervised scene graphs with learnable properties. We reinforce the initial spatial graph with sparse temporal connections using local matches between consecutive frames to predict temporally consistent clusters across a temporal neighborhood. By jointly optimizing the spatiotemporal relations and node features of the dynamic scene graph with the downstream task of phase segmentation, we address the costly and annotation-burdensome task of semantic scene comprehension and scene graph generation in surgical videos using only weak surgical phase labels. Further, by incorporating effective intermediate scene representation disentanglement steps within the pipeline, our solution outperforms the SOTA on the CATARACTS dataset by 8% accuracy and 10% F1 score in surgical workflow recognition

- **Summary**: Recovering 3D structure and camera motion from images has been a long-standing focus of computer vision research and is known as Structure-from-Motion (SfM). Solutions to this problem are categorized into incremental and global approaches. Until now, the most popular systems follow the incremental paradigm due to its superior accuracy and robustness, while global approaches are drastically more scalable and efficient. With this work, we revisit the problem of global SfM and propose GLOMAP as a new general-purpose system that outperforms the state of the art in global SfM. In terms of accuracy and robustness, we achieve results on-par or superior to COLMAP, the most widely used incremental SfM, while being orders of magnitude faster. We share our system as an open-source implementation at {https://github.com/colmap/glomap}.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a robust unsupervised SE(3) point cloud registration method that operates without requiring point correspondences. The method frames point clouds as functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), leveraging SE(3)-equivariant features for direct feature space registration. A novel RKHS distance metric is proposed, offering reliable performance amidst noise, outliers, and asymmetrical data. An unsupervised training approach is introduced to effectively handle limited ground truth data, facilitating adaptation to real datasets. The proposed method outperforms classical and supervised methods in terms of registration accuracy on both synthetic (ModelNet40) and real-world (ETH3D) noisy, outlier-rich datasets. To our best knowledge, this marks the first instance of successful real RGB-D odometry data registration using an equivariant method.

- **Summary**: Current high-resolution vision-language models encode images as high-resolution image tokens and exhaustively take all these tokens to compute attention, which significantly increases the computational cost. To address this problem, we propose FlexAttention, a flexible attention mechanism for efficient high-resolution vision-language models. Specifically, a high-resolution image is encoded both as high-resolution tokens and low-resolution tokens, where only the low-resolution tokens and a few selected high-resolution tokens are utilized to calculate the attention map, which greatly shrinks the computational cost. The high-resolution tokens are selected via a high-resolution selection module which could retrieve tokens of relevant regions based on an input attention map. The selected high-resolution tokens are then concatenated to the low-resolution tokens and text tokens, and input to a hierarchical self-attention layer which produces an attention map that could be used for the next-step high-resolution token selection. The hierarchical self-attention process and high-resolution token selection process are performed iteratively for each attention layer. Experiments on multimodal benchmarks prove that our FlexAttention outperforms existing high-resolution VLMs (e.g., relatively ~9% in V* Bench, ~7% in TextVQA), while also significantly reducing the computational cost by nearly 40%.

- **Summary**: Current visual foundation models are trained purely on unstructured 2D data, limiting their understanding of 3D structure of objects and scenes. In this work, we show that fine-tuning on 3D-aware data improves the quality of emerging semantic features. We design a method to lift semantic 2D features into an efficient 3D Gaussian representation, which allows us to re-render them for arbitrary views. Using the rendered 3D-aware features, we design a fine-tuning strategy to transfer such 3D awareness into a 2D foundation model. We demonstrate that models fine-tuned in that way produce features that readily improve downstream task performance in semantic segmentation and depth estimation through simple linear probing. Notably, though fined-tuned on a single indoor dataset, the improvement is transferable to a variety of indoor datasets and out-of-domain datasets. We hope our study encourages the community to consider injecting 3D awareness when training 2D foundation models. Project page: https://ywyue.github.io/FiT3D.

- **Summary**: Despite extreme sample inefficiency, on-policy reinforcement learning, aka policy gradients, has become a fundamental tool in decision-making problems. With the recent advances in GPU-driven simulation, the ability to collect large amounts of data for RL training has scaled exponentially. However, we show that current RL methods, e.g. PPO, fail to ingest the benefit of parallelized environments beyond a certain point and their performance saturates. To address this, we propose a new on-policy RL algorithm that can effectively leverage large-scale environments by splitting them into chunks and fusing them back together via importance sampling. Our algorithm, termed SAPG, shows significantly higher performance across a variety of challenging environments where vanilla PPO and other strong baselines fail to achieve high performance.

- **Summary**: Text-based editing diffusion models exhibit limited performance when the user's input instruction is ambiguous. To solve this problem, we propose $\textit{Specify ANd Edit}$ (SANE), a zero-shot inference pipeline for diffusion-based editing systems. We use a large language model (LLM) to decompose the input instruction into specific instructions, i.e. well-defined interventions to apply to the input image to satisfy the user's request. We benefit from the LLM-derived instructions along the original one, thanks to a novel denoising guidance strategy specifically designed for the task. Our experiments with three baselines and on two datasets demonstrate the benefits of SANE in all setups. Moreover, our pipeline improves the interpretability of editing models, and boosts the output diversity. We also demonstrate that our approach can be applied to any edit, whether ambiguous or not. Our code is public at https://github.com/fabvio/SANE.

- **Summary**: Nighttime scenes are hard to semantically perceive with learned models and annotate for humans. Thus, realistic synthetic nighttime data become all the more important for learning robust semantic perception at night, thanks to their accurate and cheap semantic annotations. However, existing data-driven or hand-crafted techniques for generating nighttime images from daytime counterparts suffer from poor realism. The reason is the complex interaction of highly spatially varying nighttime illumination, which differs drastically from its daytime counterpart, with objects of spatially varying materials in the scene, happening in 3D and being very hard to capture with such 2D approaches. The above 3D interaction and illumination shift have proven equally hard to model in the literature, as opposed to other conditions such as fog or rain. Our method, named Sun Off, Lights On (SOLO), is the first to perform nighttime simulation on single images in a photorealistic fashion by operating in 3D. It first explicitly estimates the 3D geometry, the materials and the locations of light sources of the scene from the input daytime image and relights the scene by probabilistically instantiating light sources in a way that accounts for their semantics and then running standard ray tracing. Not only is the visual quality and photorealism of our nighttime images superior to competing approaches including diffusion models, but the former images are also proven more beneficial for semantic nighttime segmentation in day-to-night adaptation. Code and data will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Discerning between authentic content and that generated by advanced AI methods has become increasingly challenging. While previous research primarily addresses the detection of fake faces, the identification of generated natural images has only recently surfaced. This prompted the recent exploration of solutions that employ foundation vision-and-language models, like CLIP. However, the CLIP embedding space is optimized for global image-to-text alignment and is not inherently designed for deepfake detection, neglecting the potential benefits of tailored training and local image features. In this study, we propose CoDE (Contrastive Deepfake Embeddings), a novel embedding space specifically designed for deepfake detection. CoDE is trained via contrastive learning by additionally enforcing global-local similarities. To sustain the training of our model, we generate a comprehensive dataset that focuses on images generated by diffusion models and encompasses a collection of 9.2 million images produced by using four different generators. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the newly collected dataset, while also showing excellent generalization capabilities to unseen image generators. Our source code, trained models, and collected dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/CoDE.

- **Summary**: Effectively aligning with human judgment when evaluating machine-generated image captions represents a complex yet intriguing challenge. Existing evaluation metrics like CIDEr or CLIP-Score fall short in this regard as they do not take into account the corresponding image or lack the capability of encoding fine-grained details and penalizing hallucinations. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we propose BRIDGE, a new learnable and reference-free image captioning metric that employs a novel module to map visual features into dense vectors and integrates them into multi-modal pseudo-captions which are built during the evaluation process. This approach results in a multimodal metric that properly incorporates information from the input image without relying on reference captions, bridging the gap between human judgment and machine-generated image captions. Experiments spanning several datasets demonstrate that our proposal achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing reference-free evaluation scores.

- **Summary**: Precision livestock farming (PLF) increasingly relies on advanced object localization techniques to monitor livestock health and optimize resource management. This study investigates the generalization capabilities of YOLOv8 and YOLOv9 models for cow detection in indoor free-stall barn settings, focusing on varying training data characteristics such as view angles and lighting, and model complexities. Leveraging the newly released public dataset, COws LOcalization (COLO) dataset, we explore three key hypotheses: (1) Model generalization is equally influenced by changes in lighting conditions and camera angles; (2) Higher model complexity guarantees better generalization performance; (3) Fine-tuning with custom initial weights trained on relevant tasks always brings advantages to detection tasks. Our findings reveal considerable challenges in detecting cows in images taken from side views and underscore the importance of including diverse camera angles in building a detection model. Furthermore, our results emphasize that higher model complexity does not necessarily lead to better performance. The optimal model configuration heavily depends on the specific task and dataset. Lastly, while fine-tuning with custom initial weights trained on relevant tasks offers advantages to detection tasks, simpler models do not benefit similarly from this approach. It is more efficient to train a simple model with pre-trained weights without relying on prior relevant information, which can require intensive labor efforts. Future work should focus on adaptive methods and advanced data augmentation to improve generalization and robustness. This study provides practical guidelines for PLF researchers on deploying computer vision models from existing studies, highlights generalization issues, and contributes the COLO dataset containing 1254 images and 11818 cow instances for further research.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of the Left Ventricle (LV) holds substantial importance due to its implications in disease detection, regional analysis, and the development of complex models for cardiac surgical planning. CMR is a golden standard for diagnosis of serveral cardiac diseases. LV in CMR comprises of three distinct sections: Basal, Mid-Ventricle, and Apical. This research focuses on the precise segmentation of the LV from Cardiac MRI (CMR) scans, joining with the capabilities of Machine Learning (ML). The central challenge in this research revolves around the absence of a set of parameters applicable to all three types of LV slices. Parameters optimized for basal slices often fall short when applied to mid-ventricular and apical slices, and vice versa. To handle this issue, a new method is proposed to enhance LV segmentation. The proposed method involves using distinct sets of parameters for each type of slice, resulting in a two-phase segmentation approach. The initial phase categorizes images into three groups based on the type of LV slice, while the second phase aims to segment CMR images using parameters derived from the preceding phase. A publicly available dataset (Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC)) is used. 10-Fold Cross Validation is used and it achieved a mean score of 0.9228. Comprehensive testing indicates that the best parameter set for a particular type of slice does not perform adequately for the other slice types. All results show that the proposed approach fills a critical void in parameter standardization through a two-phase segmentation model for the LV, aiming to not only improve the accuracy of cardiac image analysis but also contribute advancements to the field of LV segmentation.

- **Summary**: We propose three novel metrics for evaluating the accuracy of a set of estimated camera poses given the ground truth: Translation Alignment Score (TAS), Rotation Alignment Score (RAS), and Pose Alignment Score (PAS). The TAS evaluates the translation accuracy independently of the rotations, and the RAS evaluates the rotation accuracy independently of the translations. The PAS is the average of the two scores, evaluating the combined accuracy of both translations and rotations. The TAS is computed in four steps: (1) Find the upper quartile of the closest-pair-distances, $d$. (2) Align the estimated trajectory to the ground truth using a robust registration method. (3) Collect all distance errors and obtain the cumulative frequencies for multiple thresholds ranging from $0.01d$ to $d$ with a resolution $0.01d$. (4) Add up these cumulative frequencies and normalize them such that the theoretical maximum is 1. The TAS has practical advantages over the existing metrics in that (1) it is robust to outliers and collinear motion, and (2) there is no need to adjust parameters on different datasets. The RAS is computed in a similar manner to the TAS and is also shown to be more robust against outliers than the existing rotation metrics. We verify our claims through extensive simulations and provide in-depth discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed metrics.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has revolutionized medical image segmentation, but it relies heavily on high-quality annotations. The time, cost and expertise required to label images at the pixel-level for each new task has slowed down widespread adoption of the paradigm. We propose Pix2Rep, a self-supervised learning (SSL) approach for few-shot segmentation, that reduces the manual annotation burden by learning powerful pixel-level representations directly from unlabeled images. Pix2Rep is a novel pixel-level loss and pre-training paradigm for contrastive SSL on whole images. It is applied to generic encoder-decoder deep learning backbones (e.g., U-Net). Whereas most SSL methods enforce invariance of the learned image-level representations under intensity and spatial image augmentations, Pix2Rep enforces equivariance of the pixel-level representations. We demonstrate the framework on a task of cardiac MRI segmentation. Results show improved performance compared to existing semi- and self-supervised approaches; and a 5-fold reduction in the annotation burden for equivalent performance versus a fully supervised U-Net baseline. This includes a 30% (resp. 31%) DICE improvement for one-shot segmentation under linear-probing (resp. fine-tuning). Finally, we also integrate the novel Pix2Rep concept with the Barlow Twins non-contrastive SSL, which leads to even better segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: Depth estimation using a single-photon LiDAR is often solved by a matched filter. It is, however, error-prone in the presence of background noise. A commonly used technique to reject background noise is the rank-ordered mean (ROM) filter previously reported by Shin \textit{et al.} (2015). ROM rejects noisy photon arrival timestamps by selecting only a small range of them around the median statistics within its local neighborhood. Despite the promising performance of ROM, its theoretical performance limit is unknown. In this paper, we theoretically characterize the ROM performance by showing that ROM fails when the reflectivity drops below a threshold predetermined by the depth and signal-to-background ratio, and its accuracy undergoes a phase transition at the cutoff. Based on our theory, we propose an improved signal extraction technique by selecting tight timestamp clusters. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves depth estimation performance over ROM by 3 orders of magnitude at the same signal intensities, and achieves high image fidelity at noise levels as high as 17 times that of signal.

- **Summary**: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) for event-based optical flow are claimed to be computationally more efficient than their artificial neural networks (ANNs) counterparts, but a fair comparison is missing in the literature. In this work, we propose an event-based optical flow solution based on activation sparsification and a neuromorphic processor, SENECA. SENECA has an event-driven processing mechanism that can exploit the sparsity in ANN activations and SNN spikes to accelerate the inference of both types of neural networks. The ANN and the SNN for comparison have similar low activation/spike density (~5%) thanks to our novel sparsification-aware training. In the hardware-in-loop experiments designed to deduce the average time and energy consumption, the SNN consumes 44.9ms and 927.0 microjoules, which are 62.5% and 75.2% of the ANN's consumption, respectively. We find that SNN's higher efficiency attributes to its lower pixel-wise spike density (43.5% vs. 66.5%) that requires fewer memory access operations for neuron states.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates the use of Mean Opinion Score (MOS), a common image quality metric, as a user-centric evaluation metric for XAI post-hoc explainers. To measure the MOS, a user experiment is proposed, which has been conducted with explanation maps of intentionally distorted images. Three methods from the family of feature attribution methods - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), Multi-Layered Feature Explanation Method (MLFEM), and Feature Explanation Method (FEM) - are compared with this metric. Additionally, the correlation of this new user-centric metric with automatic metrics is studied via Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. MOS of MLFEM shows the highest correlation with automatic metrics of Insertion Area Under Curve (IAUC) and Deletion Area Under Curve (DAUC). However, the overall correlations are limited, which highlights the lack of consensus between automatic and user-centric metrics.

- **Summary**: In the domain of multi-baseline stereo, the conventional understanding is that, in general, increasing baseline separation substantially enhances the accuracy of depth estimation. However, prevailing self-supervised depth estimation architectures primarily use minimal frame separation and a constrained stereo baseline. Larger frame separations can be employed; however, we show this to result in diminished depth quality due to various factors, including significant changes in brightness, and increased areas of occlusion. In response to these challenges, our proposed method, BaseBoostDepth, incorporates a curriculum learning-inspired optimization strategy to effectively leverage larger frame separations. However, we show that our curriculum learning-inspired strategy alone does not suffice, as larger baselines still cause pose estimation drifts. Therefore, we introduce incremental pose estimation to enhance the accuracy of pose estimations, resulting in significant improvements across all depth metrics. Additionally, to improve the robustness of the model, we introduce error-induced reconstructions, which optimize reconstructions with added error to the pose estimations. Ultimately, our final depth network achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI and SYNS-patches datasets across image-based, edge-based, and point cloud-based metrics without increasing computational complexity at test time.

- **Summary**: In this data article, we introduce the Multi-Modal Event-based Vehicle Detection and Tracking (MEVDT) dataset. This dataset provides a synchronized stream of event data and grayscale images of traffic scenes, captured using the Dynamic and Active-Pixel Vision Sensor (DAVIS) 240c hybrid event-based camera. MEVDT comprises 63 multi-modal sequences with approximately 13k images, 5M events, 10k object labels, and 85 unique object tracking trajectories. Additionally, MEVDT includes manually annotated ground truth labels $\unicode{x2014}$ consisting of object classifications, pixel-precise bounding boxes, and unique object IDs $\unicode{x2014}$ which are provided at a labeling frequency of 24 Hz. Designed to advance the research in the domain of event-based vision, MEVDT aims to address the critical need for high-quality, real-world annotated datasets that enable the development and evaluation of object detection and tracking algorithms in automotive environments.

- **Summary**: Portrait editing is challenging for existing techniques due to difficulties in preserving subject features like identity. In this paper, we propose a training-based method leveraging auto-generated paired data to learn desired editing while ensuring the preservation of unchanged subject features. Specifically, we design a data generation process to create reasonably good training pairs for desired editing at low cost. Based on these pairs, we introduce a Multi-Conditioned Diffusion Model to effectively learn the editing direction and preserve subject features. During inference, our model produces accurate editing mask that can guide the inference process to further preserve detailed subject features. Experiments on costume editing and cartoon expression editing show that our method achieves state-of-the-art quality, quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a life-threatening condition that requires rapid and accurate diagnosis to improve treatment outcomes and patient survival rates. Recent advancements in supervised deep learning have greatly improved the analysis of medical images, but often rely on extensive datasets with high-quality annotations, which are costly, time-consuming, and require medical expertise to prepare. To mitigate the need for large amounts of expert-prepared segmentation data, we have developed a novel weakly supervised ICH segmentation method that utilizes the YOLO object detection model and an uncertainty-rectified Segment Anything Model (SAM). In addition, we have proposed a novel point prompt generator for this model to further improve segmentation results with YOLO-predicted bounding box prompts. Our approach achieved a high accuracy of 0.933 and an AUC of 0.796 in ICH detection, along with a mean Dice score of 0.629 for ICH segmentation, outperforming existing weakly supervised and popular supervised (UNet and Swin-UNETR) approaches. Overall, the proposed method provides a robust and accurate alternative to the more commonly used supervised techniques for ICH quantification without requiring refined segmentation ground truths during model training.
