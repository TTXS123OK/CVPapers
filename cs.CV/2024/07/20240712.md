- **Summary**: Illustration is a fundamental mode of human expression and communication. Certain types of motion that accompany speech can provide this illustrative mode of communication. While Augmented and Virtual Reality technologies (AR/VR) have introduced tools for producing drawings with hand motions (air drawing), they typically require costly hardware and additional digital markers, thereby limiting their accessibility and portability. Furthermore, air drawing demands considerable skill to achieve aesthetic results. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of AirSketch, aimed at generating faithful and visually coherent sketches directly from hand motions, eliminating the need for complicated headsets or markers. We devise a simple augmentation-based self-supervised training procedure, enabling a controllable image diffusion model to learn to translate from highly noisy hand tracking images to clean, aesthetically pleasing sketches, while preserving the essential visual cues from the original tracking data. We present two air drawing datasets to study this problem. Our findings demonstrate that beyond producing photo-realistic images from precise spatial inputs, controllable image diffusion can effectively produce a refined, clear sketch from a noisy input. Our work serves as an initial step towards marker-less air drawing and reveals distinct applications of controllable diffusion models to AirSketch and AR/VR in general.

- **Summary**: Image retrieval plays a pivotal role in applications from wildlife conservation to healthcare, for finding individual animals or relevant images to aid diagnosis. Although deep learning techniques for image retrieval have advanced significantly, their imperfect real-world performance often necessitates including human expertise. Human-in-the-loop approaches typically rely on humans completing the task independently and then combining their opinions with an AI model in various ways, as these models offer very little interpretability or \textit{correctability}. To allow humans to intervene in the AI model instead, thereby saving human time and effort, we adapt the Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) and propose \texttt{CHAIR}. \texttt{CHAIR} (a) enables humans to correct intermediate concepts, which helps \textit{improve} embeddings generated, and (b) allows for flexible levels of intervention that accommodate varying levels of human expertise for better retrieval. To show the efficacy of \texttt{CHAIR}, we demonstrate that our method performs better than similar models on image retrieval metrics without any external intervention. Furthermore, we also showcase how human intervention helps further improve retrieval performance, thereby achieving human-AI complementarity.

- **Summary**: This letter presents KGpose, a novel end-to-end framework for 6D pose estimation of multiple objects. Our approach combines keypoint-based method with learnable pose regression through `keypoint-graph', which is a graph representation of the keypoints. KGpose first estimates 3D keypoints for each object using an attentional multi-modal feature fusion of RGB and point cloud features. These keypoints are estimated from each point of point cloud and converted into a graph representation. The network directly regresses 6D pose parameters for each point through a sequence of keypoint-graph embedding and local graph embedding which are designed with graph convolutions, followed by rotation and translation heads. The final pose for each object is selected from the candidates of point-wise predictions. The method achieves competitive results on the benchmark dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. KGpose enables multi-object pose estimation without requiring an extra localization step, offering a unified and efficient solution for understanding geometric contexts in complex scenes for robotic applications.

- **Summary**: Conventional anomaly detection techniques based on reconstruction via denoising diffusion model are widely used due to their ability to identify anomaly locations and shapes with high performance. However, there is a limitation in determining appropriate noise parameters that can degrade anomalies while preserving normal characteristics. Also, due to the volatility of the diffusion model, normal regions can fluctuate considerably during reconstruction, resulting in false detection. In this paper, we propose a method to detect anomalies by analysis of reconstruction trend depending on the degree of degradation, effectively solving the both problems of existing methods. The proposed method is validated on an open dataset for industrial anomaly detection, improving the performance of existing methods on a number of evaluation criteria. With the ease of combination with existing anomaly detection methods, it provides a tradeoff between computational cost and performance, allowing it high application potential in manufacturing industry.

- **Summary**: Open-Vocabulary Detection (OVD) is the task of detecting all interesting objects in a given scene without predefined object classes. Extensive work has been done to deal with the OVD for 2D RGB images, but the exploration of 3D OVD is still limited. Intuitively, lidar point clouds provide 3D information, both object level and scene level, to generate trustful detection results. However, previous lidar-based OVD methods only focus on the usage of object-level features, ignoring the essence of scene-level information. In this paper, we propose a Global-Local Collaborative Scheme (GLIS) for the lidar-based OVD task, which contains a local branch to generate object-level detection result and a global branch to obtain scene-level global feature. With the global-local information, a Large Language Model (LLM) is applied for chain-of-thought inference, and the detection result can be refined accordingly. We further propose Reflected Pseudo Labels Generation (RPLG) to generate high-quality pseudo labels for supervision and Background-Aware Object Localization (BAOL) to select precise object proposals. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and SUN RGB-D demonstrate the superiority of our methods. Code is released at https://github.com/GradiusTwinbee/GLIS.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based unsupervised framework that incorporates physically explainable Retinex theory with diffusion models for low-light image enhancement, named LightenDiffusion. Specifically, we present a content-transfer decomposition network that performs Retinex decomposition within the latent space instead of image space as in previous approaches, enabling the encoded features of unpaired low-light and normal-light images to be decomposed into content-rich reflectance maps and content-free illumination maps. Subsequently, the reflectance map of the low-light image and the illumination map of the normal-light image are taken as input to the diffusion model for unsupervised restoration with the guidance of the low-light feature, where a self-constrained consistency loss is further proposed to eliminate the interference of normal-light content on the restored results to improve overall visual quality. Extensive experiments on publicly available real-world benchmarks show that the proposed LightenDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised competitors and is comparable to supervised methods while being more generalizable to various scenes.

- **Summary**: Generative models hold promise for revolutionizing medical education, robot-assisted surgery, and data augmentation for medical AI development. Diffusion models can now generate realistic images from text prompts, while recent advancements have demonstrated their ability to create diverse, high-quality videos. However, these models often struggle with generating accurate representations of medical procedures and detailed anatomical structures. This paper introduces Bora, the first spatio-temporal diffusion probabilistic model designed for text-guided biomedical video generation. Bora leverages Transformer architecture and is pre-trained on general-purpose video generation tasks. It is fine-tuned through model alignment and instruction tuning using a newly established medical video corpus, which includes paired text-video data from various biomedical fields. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to establish such a comprehensive annotated biomedical video dataset. Bora is capable of generating high-quality video data across four distinct biomedical domains, adhering to medical expert standards and demonstrating consistency and diversity. This generalist video generative model holds significant potential for enhancing medical consultation and decision-making, particularly in resource-limited settings. Additionally, Bora could pave the way for immersive medical training and procedure planning. Extensive experiments on distinct medical modalities such as endoscopy, ultrasound, MRI, and cell tracking validate the effectiveness of our model in understanding biomedical instructions and its superior performance across subjects compared to state-of-the-art generation models.

- **Summary**: Enhancing model interpretability can address spurious correlations by revealing how models draw their predictions. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) can provide a principled way of disclosing and guiding model behaviors through human-understandable concepts, albeit at a high cost of human efforts in data annotation. In this paper, we leverage a synergy of multiple foundation models to construct CBMs with nearly no human effort. We discover undesirable biases in CBMs built on pre-trained models and propose a novel framework designed to exploit pre-trained models while being immune to these biases, thereby reducing vulnerability to spurious correlations. Specifically, our method offers a seamless pipeline that adopts foundation models for assessing potential spurious correlations in datasets, annotating concepts for images, and refining the annotations for improved robustness. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple datasets, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing model reliance on spurious correlations while preserving its interpretability.

- **Summary**: The heterogeneity of neurological conditions, ranging from structural anomalies to functional impairments, presents a significant challenge in medical imaging analysis tasks. Moreover, the limited availability of well-annotated datasets constrains the development of robust analysis models. Against this backdrop, this study introduces a novel approach leveraging the inherent anatomical symmetrical features of the human brain to enhance the subsequent detection and segmentation analysis for brain diseases. A novel Symmetry-Aware Cross-Attention (SACA) module is proposed to encode symmetrical features of left and right hemispheres, and a proxy task to detect symmetrical features as the Symmetry-Aware Head (SAH) is proposed, which guides the pretraining of the whole network on a vast 3D brain imaging dataset comprising both healthy and diseased brain images across various MRI and CT. Through meticulous experimentation on downstream tasks, including both classification and segmentation for brain diseases, our model demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methodologies, particularly highlighting the significance of symmetry-aware learning. Our findings advocate for the effectiveness of incorporating symmetry awareness into pretraining and set a new benchmark for medical imaging analysis, promising significant strides toward accurate and efficient diagnostic processes.

- **Summary**: The objective of face animation is to generate dynamic and expressive talking head videos from a single reference face, utilizing driving conditions derived from either video or audio inputs. Current approaches often require fine-tuning for specific identities and frequently fail to produce expressive videos due to the limited effectiveness of Wav2Pose modules. To facilitate the generation of one-shot and more consecutive talking head videos, we refine an existing Image2Video model by integrating a Face Locator and Motion Frame mechanism. We subsequently optimize the model using extensive human face video datasets, significantly enhancing its ability to produce high-quality and expressive talking head videos. Additionally, we develop a demo platform using the Gradio framework, which streamlines the process, enabling users to quickly create customized talking head videos.

- **Summary**: Image restoration aims to recover high-quality images from their corrupted counterparts. Many existing methods primarily focus on the spatial domain, neglecting the understanding of frequency variations and ignoring the impact of implicit noise in skip connections. In this paper, we introduce a multi-scale frequency selection network (MSFSNet) that seamlessly integrates spatial and frequency domain knowledge, selectively recovering richer and more accurate information. Specifically, we initially capture spatial features and input them into dynamic filter selection modules (DFS) at different scales to integrate frequency knowledge. DFS utilizes learnable filters to generate high and low-frequency information and employs a frequency cross-attention mechanism (FCAM) to determine the most information to recover. To learn a multi-scale and accurate set of hybrid features, we develop a skip feature fusion block (SFF) that leverages contextual features to discriminatively determine which information should be propagated in skip-connections. It is worth noting that our DFS and SFF are generic plug-in modules that can be directly employed in existing networks without any adjustments, leading to performance improvements. Extensive experiments across various image restoration tasks demonstrate that our MSFSNet achieves performance that is either superior or comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms.

- **Summary**: Existing Masked Image Modeling (MIM) depends on a spatial patch-based masking-reconstruction strategy to perceive objects'features from unlabeled images, which may face two limitations when applied to chest CT: 1) inefficient feature learning due to complex anatomical details presented in CT images, and 2) suboptimal knowledge transfer owing to input disparity between upstream and downstream models. To address these issues, we propose a new MIM method named Tissue-Contrastive Semi-Masked Autoencoder (TCS-MAE) for modeling chest CT images. Our method has two novel designs: 1) a tissue-based masking-reconstruction strategy to capture more fine-grained anatomical features, and 2) a dual-AE architecture with contrastive learning between the masked and original image views to bridge the gap of the upstream and downstream models. To validate our method, we systematically investigate representative contrastive, generative, and hybrid self-supervised learning methods on top of tasks involving segmenting pneumonia, mediastinal tumors, and various organs. The results demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, our TCS-MAE more effectively learns tissue-aware representations, thereby significantly enhancing segmentation performance across all tasks.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces Lite-SAM, an efficient end-to-end solution for the SegEvery task designed to reduce computational costs and redundancy. Lite-SAM is composed of four main components: a streamlined CNN-Transformer hybrid encoder (LiteViT), an automated prompt proposal network (AutoPPN), a traditional prompt encoder, and a mask decoder. All these components are integrated within the SAM framework. Our LiteViT, a high-performance lightweight backbone network, has only 1.16M parameters, which is a 23% reduction compared to the lightest existing backbone network Shufflenet. We also introduce AutoPPN, an innovative end-to-end method for prompt boxes and points generation. This is an improvement over traditional grid search sampling methods, and its unique design allows for easy integration into any SAM series algorithm, extending its usability. we have thoroughly benchmarked Lite-SAM across a plethora of both public and private datasets. The evaluation encompassed a broad spectrum of universal metrics, including the number of parameters, SegEvery execution time, and accuracy. The findings reveal that Lite-SAM, operating with a lean 4.2M parameters, significantly outpaces its counterparts, demonstrating performance improvements of 43x, 31x, 20x, 21x, and 1.6x over SAM, MobileSAM, Edge-SAM, EfficientViT-SAM, and MobileSAM-v2 respectively, all the while maintaining competitive accuracy. This underscores Lite-SAM's prowess in achieving an optimal equilibrium between performance and precision, thereby setting a new state-of-the-art(SOTA) benchmark in the domain.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for model reliability, as it identifies samples from unknown classes and reduces errors due to unexpected inputs. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP are emerging as powerful tools for OOD detection by integrating multi-modal information. However, the practical application of such systems is challenged by manual prompt engineering, which demands domain expertise and is sensitive to linguistic nuances. In this paper, we introduce Label-driven Automated Prompt Tuning (LAPT), a novel approach to OOD detection that reduces the need for manual prompt engineering. We develop distribution-aware prompts with in-distribution (ID) class names and negative labels mined automatically. Training samples linked to these class labels are collected autonomously via image synthesis and retrieval methods, allowing for prompt learning without manual effort. We utilize a simple cross-entropy loss for prompt optimization, with cross-modal and cross-distribution mixing strategies to reduce image noise and explore the intermediate space between distributions, respectively. The LAPT framework operates autonomously, requiring only ID class names as input and eliminating the need for manual intervention. With extensive experiments, LAPT consistently outperforms manually crafted prompts, setting a new standard for OOD detection. Moreover, LAPT not only enhances the distinction between ID and OOD samples, but also improves the ID classification accuracy and strengthens the generalization robustness to covariate shifts, resulting in outstanding performance in challenging full-spectrum OOD detection tasks.

- **Summary**: Existing WSI analysis methods lie on the consensus that histopathological characteristics of tumors are significant guidance for cancer diagnostics. Particularly, as the evolution of cancers is a continuous process, the correlations and differences across various stages, anatomical locations and patients should be taken into account. However, recent research mainly focuses on the inner-contextual information in a single WSI, ignoring the correlations between slides. To verify whether introducing the slide inter-correlations can bring improvements to WSI representation learning, we propose a generic WSI analysis pipeline SlideGCD that considers the existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods as the backbone and forge the WSI classification task as a node classification problem. More specifically, SlideGCD declares a node buffer that stores previous slide embeddings for subsequent extensive slide-based graph construction and conducts graph learning to explore the inter-correlations implied in the slide-based graph. Moreover, we frame the MIL classifier and graph learning into two parallel workflows and deploy the knowledge distillation to transfer the differentiable information to the graph neural network. The consistent performance boosting, brought by SlideGCD, of four previous state-of-the-art MIL methods is observed on two TCGA benchmark datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/HFUT-miaLab/SlideGCD.



### Full-Stage Pseudo Label Quality Enhancement for Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization

- **Summary**: Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WSTAL) aims to localize actions in untrimmed videos using only video-level supervision. Latest WSTAL methods introduce pseudo label learning framework to bridge the gap between classification-based training and inferencing targets at localization, and achieve cutting-edge results. In these frameworks, a classification-based model is used to generate pseudo labels for a regression-based student model to learn from. However, the quality of pseudo labels in the framework, which is a key factor to the final result, is not carefully studied. In this paper, we propose a set of simple yet efficient pseudo label quality enhancement mechanisms to build our FuSTAL framework. FuSTAL enhances pseudo label quality at three stages: cross-video contrastive learning at proposal Generation-Stage, prior-based filtering at proposal Selection-Stage and EMA-based distillation at Training-Stage. These designs enhance pseudo label quality at different stages in the framework, and help produce more informative, less false and smoother action proposals. With the help of these comprehensive designs at all stages, FuSTAL achieves an average mAP of 50.8% on THUMOS'14, outperforming the previous best method by 1.2%, and becomes the first method to reach the milestone of 50%.

- **Summary**: Robustness is a vital aspect to consider when deploying deep learning models into the wild. Numerous studies have been dedicated to the study of the robustness of vision transformers (ViTs), which have dominated as the mainstream backbone choice for vision tasks since the dawn of 2020s. Recently, some large kernel convnets make a comeback with impressive performance and efficiency. However, it still remains unclear whether large kernel networks are robust and the attribution of their robustness. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of large kernel convnets' robustness and their differences from typical small kernel counterparts and ViTs on six diverse robustness benchmark datasets. Then to analyze the underlying factors behind their strong robustness, we design experiments from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives to reveal large kernel convnets' intriguing properties that are completely different from typical convnets. Our experiments demonstrate for the first time that pure CNNs can achieve exceptional robustness comparable or even superior to that of ViTs. Our analysis on occlusion invariance, kernel attention patterns and frequency characteristics provide novel insights into the source of robustness.

Moreover, we significantly generalize the family of super-expressive activation functions, whose existence has been demonstrated in several recent works by showing that any continuous function can be approximated to any desired accuracy by a fixed-size network with a specific super-expressive activation function. Specifically, our work addresses two major bottlenecks in impeding the development of super-expressive activation functions: the limited identification of super-expressive functions, which raises doubts about their broad applicability, and their often peculiar forms, which lead to skepticism regarding their scalability and practicality in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Super-resolution reconstruction is aimed at generating images of high spatial resolution from low-resolution observations. State-of-the-art super-resolution techniques underpinned with deep learning allow for obtaining results of outstanding visual quality, but it is seldom verified whether they constitute a valuable source for specific computer vision applications. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of employing super-resolution as a preprocessing step to improve optical character recognition from document scans. To achieve that, we propose to train deep networks for single-image super-resolution in a task-driven way to make them better adapted for the purpose of text detection. As problems limited to a specific task are heavily ill-posed, we introduce a multi-task loss function that embraces components related with text detection coupled with those guided by image similarity. The obtained results reported in this paper are encouraging and they constitute an important step towards real-world super-resolution of document images.

- **Summary**: Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of point-based neural models on the point cloud analysis task. However, there remains a crucial issue on producing the efficient input embedding for raw point coordinates. Moreover, another issue lies in the limited efficiency of neighboring aggregations, which is a critical component in the network stem. In this paper, we propose a Global Attention-guided Dual-domain Feature Learning network (GAD) to address the above-mentioned issues. We first devise the Contextual Position-enhanced Transformer (CPT) module, which is armed with an improved global attention mechanism, to produce a global-aware input embedding that serves as the guidance to subsequent aggregations. Then, the Dual-domain K-nearest neighbor Feature Fusion (DKFF) is cascaded to conduct effective feature aggregation through novel dual-domain feature learning which appreciates both local geometric relations and long-distance semantic connections. Extensive experiments on multiple point cloud analysis tasks (e.g., classification, part segmentation, and scene semantic segmentation) demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method and the efficacy of the devised modules.

- **Summary**: The maritime shipping industry is undergoing rapid evolution driven by advancements in computer vision artificial intelligence (AI). Consequently, research on AI-based object recognition models for maritime transportation is steadily growing, leveraging advancements in sensor technology and computing performance. However, object recognition in maritime environments faces challenges such as light reflection, interference, intense lighting, and various weather conditions. To address these challenges, high-performance deep learning algorithms tailored to maritime imagery and high-quality datasets specialized for maritime scenes are essential. Existing AI recognition models and datasets have limited suitability for composing autonomous navigation systems. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Vertical and Detail Attention (VaDA) model for maritime object segmentation and a new model evaluation method, the Integrated Figure of Calculation Performance (IFCP), to verify its suitability for the system in real-time. Additionally, we introduce a benchmark maritime dataset, OASIs (Ocean AI Segmentation Initiatives) to standardize model performance evaluation across diverse maritime environments.

- **Summary**: Pose-driven human-image animation diffusion models have shown remarkable capabilities in realistic human video synthesis. Despite the promising results achieved by previous approaches, challenges persist in achieving temporally consistent animation and ensuring robustness with off-the-shelf pose detectors. In this paper, we present TCAN, a pose-driven human image animation method that is robust to erroneous poses and consistent over time. In contrast to previous methods, we utilize the pre-trained ControlNet without fine-tuning to leverage its extensive pre-acquired knowledge from numerous pose-image-caption pairs. To keep the ControlNet frozen, we adapt LoRA to the UNet layers, enabling the network to align the latent space between the pose and appearance features. Additionally, by introducing an additional temporal layer to the ControlNet, we enhance robustness against outliers of the pose detector. Through the analysis of attention maps over the temporal axis, we also designed a novel temperature map leveraging pose information, allowing for a more static background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve promising results in video synthesis tasks encompassing various poses, like chibi.

- **Summary**: Volumetric video based on Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) holds vast potential for various 3D applications, but its substantial data volume poses significant challenges for compression and transmission. Current NeRF compression lacks the flexibility to adjust video quality and bitrate within a single model for various network and device capacities. To address these issues, we propose HPC, a novel hierarchical progressive volumetric video coding framework achieving variable bitrate using a single model. Specifically, HPC introduces a hierarchical representation with a multi-resolution residual radiance field to reduce temporal redundancy in long-duration sequences while simultaneously generating various levels of detail. Then, we propose an end-to-end progressive learning approach with a multi-rate-distortion loss function to jointly optimize both hierarchical representation and compression. Our HPC trained only once can realize multiple compression levels, while the current methods need to train multiple fixed-bitrate models for different rate-distortion (RD) tradeoffs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HPC achieves flexible quality levels with variable bitrate by a single model and exhibits competitive RD performance, even outperforming fixed-bitrate models across various datasets.

- **Summary**: Multimodal emotion recognition systems rely heavily on the full availability of modalities, suffering significant performance declines when modal data is incomplete. To tackle this issue, we present the Cross-Modal Alignment, Reconstruction, and Refinement (CM-ARR) framework, an innovative approach that sequentially engages in cross-modal alignment, reconstruction, and refinement phases to handle missing modalities and enhance emotion recognition. This framework utilizes unsupervised distribution-based contrastive learning to align heterogeneous modal distributions, reducing discrepancies and modeling semantic uncertainty effectively. The reconstruction phase applies normalizing flow models to transform these aligned distributions and recover missing modalities. The refinement phase employs supervised point-based contrastive learning to disrupt semantic correlations and accentuate emotional traits, thereby enriching the affective content of the reconstructed representations. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV datasets confirm the superior performance of CM-ARR under conditions of both missing and complete modalities. Notably, averaged across six scenarios of missing modalities, CM-ARR achieves absolute improvements of 2.11% in WAR and 2.12% in UAR on the IEMOCAP dataset, and 1.71% and 1.96% in WAR and UAR, respectively, on the MSP-IMPROV dataset.

- **Summary**: There exist numerous diagnostic tasks in pathology. Conventional computational pathology formulates and tackles them as independent and individual image classification problems, thereby resulting in computational inefficiency and high costs. To address the challenges, we propose a generic, unified, and universal framework, called a continuous and adaptive learning model in pathology (CAMP), for pathology image classification. CAMP is a generative, efficient, and adaptive classification model that can continuously adapt to any classification task by leveraging pathology-specific prior knowledge and learning taskspecific knowledge with minimal computational cost and without forgetting the knowledge from the existing tasks. We evaluated CAMP on 22 datasets, including 1,171,526 patches and 11,811 pathology slides, across 17 classification tasks. CAMP achieves state-of-theart classification performance on a wide range of datasets and tasks at both patch- and slide-levels and reduces up to 94% of computation time and 85% of storage memory in comparison to the conventional classification models. Our results demonstrate that CAMP can offer a fundamental transformation in pathology image classification, paving the way for the fully digitized and computerized pathology practice.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a method to tackle Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) by utilizing domain-invariant semantic knowledge from text embeddings of vision-language models. We employ the text embeddings as object queries within a transformer-based segmentation framework (textual object queries). These queries are regarded as a domain-invariant basis for pixel grouping in DGSS. To leverage the power of textual object queries, we introduce a novel framework named the textual query-driven mask transformer (tqdm). Our tqdm aims to (1) generate textual object queries that maximally encode domain-invariant semantics and (2) enhance the semantic clarity of dense visual features. Additionally, we suggest three regularization losses to improve the efficacy of tqdm by aligning between visual and textual features. By utilizing our method, the model can comprehend inherent semantic information for classes of interest, enabling it to generalize to extreme domains (e.g., sketch style). Our tqdm achieves 68.9 mIoU on GTA5$\rightarrow$Cityscapes, outperforming the prior state-of-the-art method by 2.5 mIoU. The project page is available at https://byeonghyunpak.github.io/tqdm.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has been increasingly incorporated into various computational pathology applications to improve its efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. Although successful, most previous approaches for image classification have crucial drawbacks. There exist numerous tasks in pathology, but one needs to build a model per task, i.e., a task-specific model, thereby increasing the number of models, training resources, and cost. Moreover, transferring arbitrary task-specific model to another task is still a challenging problem. Herein, we propose a task-agnostic generative and general pathology image classifier, so called GPC, that aims at learning from diverse kinds of pathology images and conducting numerous classification tasks in a unified model. GPC, equipped with a convolutional neural network and a Transformer-based language model, maps pathology images into a high-dimensional feature space and generates pertinent class labels as texts via the image-to-text classification mechanism. We evaluate GPC on six datasets for four different pathology image classification tasks. Experimental results show that GPC holds considerable potential for developing an effective and efficient universal model for pathology image analysis.

- **Summary**: Incremental semantic segmentation endeavors to segment newly encountered classes while maintaining knowledge of old classes. However, existing methods either 1) lack guidance from class-specific knowledge (i.e., old class prototypes), leading to a bias towards new classes, or 2) constrain class-shared knowledge (i.e., old model weights) excessively without discrimination, resulting in a preference for old classes. In this paper, to trade off model performance, we propose the Class-specific and Class-shared Knowledge (Cs2K) guidance for incremental semantic segmentation. Specifically, from the class-specific knowledge aspect, we design a prototype-guided pseudo labeling that exploits feature proximity from prototypes to correct pseudo labels, thereby overcoming catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, we develop a prototype-guided class adaptation that aligns class distribution across datasets via learning old augmented prototypes. Moreover, from the class-shared knowledge aspect, we propose a weight-guided selective consolidation to strengthen old memory while maintaining new memory by integrating old and new model weights based on weight importance relative to old classes. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our proposed Cs2K significantly improves segmentation performance and is plug-and-play.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have become the cornerstone of today's generative AI ecosystem, sparking intense competition among tech giants and startups. In particular, an MLLM generates a text response given a prompt consisting of an image and a question. While state-of-the-art MLLMs use safety filters and alignment techniques to refuse unsafe prompts, in this work, we introduce MLLM-Refusal, the first method that induces refusals for safe prompts. In particular, our MLLM-Refusal optimizes a nearly-imperceptible refusal perturbation and adds it to an image, causing target MLLMs to likely refuse a safe prompt containing the perturbed image and a safe question. Specifically, we formulate MLLM-Refusal as a constrained optimization problem and propose an algorithm to solve it. Our method offers competitive advantages for MLLM model providers by potentially disrupting user experiences of competing MLLMs, since competing MLLM's users will receive unexpected refusals when they unwittingly use these perturbed images in their prompts. We evaluate MLLM-Refusal on four MLLMs across four datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in causing competing MLLMs to refuse safe prompts while not affecting non-competing MLLMs. Furthermore, we explore three potential countermeasures -- adding Gaussian noise, DiffPure, and adversarial training. Our results show that they are insufficient: though they can mitigate MLLM-Refusal's effectiveness, they also sacrifice the accuracy and/or efficiency of the competing MLLM.

- **Summary**: Multi-object tracking (MOT) on static platforms, such as by surveillance cameras, has achieved significant progress, with various paradigms providing attractive performances. However, the effectiveness of traditional MOT methods is significantly reduced when it comes to dynamic platforms like drones. This decrease is attributed to the distinctive challenges in the MOT-on-drone scenario: (1) objects are generally small in the image plane, blurred, and frequently occluded, making them challenging to detect and recognize; (2) drones move and see objects from different angles, causing the unreliability of the predicted positions and feature embeddings of the objects. This paper proposes DroneMOT, which firstly proposes a Dual-domain Integrated Attention (DIA) module that considers the fast movements of drones to enhance the drone-based object detection and feature embedding for small-sized, blurred, and occluded objects. Then, an innovative Motion-Driven Association (MDA) scheme is introduced, considering the concurrent movements of both the drone and the objects. Within MDA, an Adaptive Feature Synchronization (AFS) technique is presented to update the object features seen from different angles. Additionally, a Dual Motion-based Prediction (DMP) method is employed to forecast the object positions. Finally, both the refined feature embeddings and the predicted positions are integrated to enhance the object association. Comprehensive evaluations on VisDrone2019-MOT and UAVDT datasets show that DroneMOT provides substantial performance improvements over the state-of-the-art in the domain of MOT on drones.

- **Summary**: Recently customized generation has significant potential, which uses as few as 3-5 user-provided images to train a model to synthesize new images of a specified subject. Though subsequent applications enhance the flexibility and diversity of customized generation, fine-grained control over the given subject acting like the person's pose is still lack of study. In this paper, we propose a PersonificationNet, which can control the specified subject such as a cartoon character or plush toy to act the same pose as a given referenced person's image. It contains a customized branch, a pose condition branch and a structure alignment module. Specifically, first, the customized branch mimics specified subject appearance. Second, the pose condition branch transfers the body structure information from the human to variant instances. Last, the structure alignment module bridges the structure gap between human and specified subject in the inference stage. Experimental results show our proposed PersonificationNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Dynamic scene video deblurring aims to remove undesirable blurry artifacts captured during the exposure process. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved impressive results, they suffer from significant performance drops due to the domain gap between training and testing videos, especially for those captured in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a domain adaptation scheme based on a blurring model to achieve test-time fine-tuning for deblurring models in unseen domains. Since blurred and sharp pairs are unavailable for fine-tuning during inference, our scheme can generate domain-adaptive training pairs to calibrate a deblurring model for the target domain. First, a Relative Sharpness Detection Module is proposed to identify relatively sharp regions from the blurry input images and regard them as pseudo-sharp images. Next, we utilize a blurring model to produce blurred images based on the pseudo-sharp images extracted during testing. To synthesize blurred images in compliance with the target data distribution, we propose a Domain-adaptive Blur Condition Generation Module to create domain-specific blur conditions for the blurring model. Finally, the generated pseudo-sharp and blurred pairs are used to fine-tune a deblurring model for better performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve state-of-the-art video deblurring methods, providing performance gains of up to 7.54dB on various real-world video deblurring datasets.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled significant progress in open vocabulary computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection and image segmentation. Some recent works have focused on extending VLMs to open vocabulary single label action classification in videos. However, previous methods fall short in holistic video understanding which requires the ability to simultaneously recognize multiple actions and entities e.g., objects in the video in an open vocabulary setting. We formulate this problem as open vocabulary multilabel video classification and propose a method to adapt a pre-trained VLM such as CLIP to solve this task. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide semantic guidance to the VLM about class labels to improve its open vocabulary performance with two key contributions. First, we propose an end-to-end trainable architecture that learns to prompt an LLM to generate soft attributes for the CLIP text-encoder to enable it to recognize novel classes. Second, we integrate a temporal modeling module into CLIP's vision encoder to effectively model the spatio-temporal dynamics of video concepts as well as propose a novel regularized finetuning technique to ensure strong open vocabulary classification performance in the video domain. Our extensive experimentation showcases the efficacy of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: In the realm of self-supervised learning (SSL), masked image modeling (MIM) has gained popularity alongside contrastive learning methods. MIM involves reconstructing masked regions of input images using their unmasked portions. A notable subset of MIM methodologies employs discrete tokens as the reconstruction target, but the theoretical underpinnings of this choice remain underexplored. In this paper, we explore the role of these discrete tokens, aiming to unravel their benefits and limitations. Building upon the connection between MIM and contrastive learning, we provide a comprehensive theoretical understanding on how discrete tokenization affects the model's generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel metric named TCAS, which is specifically designed to assess the effectiveness of discrete tokens within the MIM framework. Inspired by this metric, we contribute an innovative tokenizer design and propose a corresponding MIM method named ClusterMIM. It demonstrates superior performance on a variety of benchmark datasets and ViT backbones. Code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/ClusterMIM.

- **Summary**: Accurate detection of bone fenestration and dehiscence (FD) is crucial for effective treatment planning in dentistry. While cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is the gold standard for evaluating FD, it comes with limitations such as radiation exposure, limited accessibility, and higher cost compared to intraoral images. In intraoral images, dentists face challenges in the differential diagnosis of FD. This paper presents a novel and clinically significant application of FD detection solely from intraoral images. To achieve this, we propose FD-SOS, a novel open-set object detector for FD detection from intraoral images. FD-SOS has two novel components: conditional contrastive denoising (CCDN) and teeth-specific matching assignment (TMA). These modules enable FD-SOS to effectively leverage external dental semantics. Experimental results showed that our method outperformed existing detection methods and surpassed dental professionals by 35% recall under the same level of precision.

- **Summary**: Existing learning-based denoising methods typically train models to generalize the image prior from large-scale datasets, suffering from the variability in noise distributions encountered in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a new perspective on the denoising challenge by highlighting the distinct separation between noise and image priors. This insight forms the basis for our development of conditional optimization framework, designed to overcome the constraints of traditional denoising framework. To this end, we introduce a Locally Noise Prior Estimation (LoNPE) algorithm, which accurately estimates the noise prior directly from a single raw noisy image. This estimation acts as an explicit prior representation of the camera sensor's imaging environment, distinct from the image prior of scenes. Additionally, we design an auxiliary learnable LoNPE network tailored for practical application to sRGB noisy images. Leveraging the estimated noise prior, we present a novel Conditional Denoising Transformer (Condformer), by incorporating the noise prior into a conditional self-attention mechanism. This integration allows the Condformer to segment the optimization process into multiple explicit subspaces, significantly enhancing the model's generalization and flexibility. Extensive experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The transparent formulation of explanation methods is essential for elucidating the predictions of neural networks, which are typically black-box models. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) is a well-established method that transparently traces the flow of a model's prediction backward through its architecture by backpropagating relevance scores. However, the conventional LRP does not fully consider the existence of skip connections, and thus its application to the widely used ResNet architecture has not been thoroughly explored. In this study, we extend LRP to ResNet models by introducing Relevance Splitting at points where the output from a skip connection converges with that from a residual block. Our formulation guarantees the conservation property throughout the process, thereby preserving the integrity of the generated explanations. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on ImageNet and the Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset. Our method achieves superior performance to that of baseline methods on standard evaluation metrics such as the Insertion-Deletion score while maintaining its conservation property. We will release our code for further research at https://5ei74r0.github.io/lrp-for-resnet.page/

- **Summary**: Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) aims to cluster multi-view data that are only partially available. This poses two main challenges: effectively leveraging multi-view information and mitigating the impact of missing views. Prevailing solutions employ cross-view contrastive learning and missing view recovery techniques. However, they either neglect valuable complementary information by focusing only on consensus between views or provide unreliable recovered views due to the absence of supervision. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Unified and Robust Representation Learning for Incomplete Multi-View Clustering (URRL-IMVC). URRL-IMVC directly learns a unified embedding that is robust to view missing conditions by integrating information from multiple views and neighboring samples. Firstly, to overcome the limitations of cross-view contrastive learning, URRL-IMVC incorporates an attention-based auto-encoder framework to fuse multi-view information and generate unified embeddings. Secondly, URRL-IMVC directly enhances the robustness of the unified embedding against view-missing conditions through KNN imputation and data augmentation techniques, eliminating the need for explicit missing view recovery. Finally, incremental improvements are introduced to further enhance the overall performance, such as the Clustering Module and the customization of the Encoder. We extensively evaluate the proposed URRL-IMVC framework on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of our design.

- **Summary**: Machine learning models are vulnerable to tiny adversarial input perturbations optimized to cause a very large output error. To measure this vulnerability, we need reliable methods that can find such adversarial perturbations. For image classification models, evaluation methodologies have emerged that have stood the test of time. However, we argue that in the area of semantic segmentation, a good approximation of the sensitivity to adversarial perturbations requires significantly more effort than what is currently considered satisfactory. To support this claim, we re-evaluate a number of well-known robust segmentation models in an extensive empirical study. We propose new attacks and combine them with the strongest attacks available in the literature. We also analyze the sensitivity of the models in fine detail. The results indicate that most of the state-of-the-art models have a dramatically larger sensitivity to adversarial perturbations than previously reported. We also demonstrate a size-bias: small objects are often more easily attacked, even if the large objects are robust, a phenomenon not revealed by current evaluation metrics. Our results also demonstrate that a diverse set of strong attacks is necessary, because different models are often vulnerable to different attacks.

- **Summary**: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a diverse collection of neurobiological conditions marked by challenges in social communication and reciprocal interactions, as well as repetitive and stereotypical behaviors. Atypical behavior patterns in a long, untrimmed video can serve as biomarkers for children with ASD. In this paper, we propose a video-based weakly-supervised method that takes spatio-temporal features of long videos to learn typical and atypical behaviors for autism detection. On top of that, we propose a shallow TCN-MLP network, which is designed to further categorize the severity score. We evaluate our method on actual evaluation videos of children with autism collected and annotated (for severity score) by clinical professionals. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of behavioral biomarkers that could help clinicians in autism spectrum analysis.

- **Summary**: This study investigates the application of generative artificial intelligence in architectural design. We present a novel methodology that combines multiple neural networks to create an unsupervised and unmoderated stream of unique architectural images. Our approach is grounded in the conceptual framework called machine apophenia. We hypothesize that neural networks, trained on diverse human-generated data, internalize aesthetic preferences and tend to produce coherent designs even from random inputs. The methodology involves an iterative process of image generation, description, and refinement, resulting in captioned architectural postcards automatically shared on several social media platforms. Evaluation and ablation studies show the improvement both in technical and aesthetic metrics of resulting images on each step.

- **Summary**: Swift and accurate detection of specified objects is crucial for many industrial applications, such as safety monitoring on construction sites. However, traditional approaches rely heavily on arduous manual annotation and data collection, which struggle to adapt to ever-changing environments and novel target objects. To address these limitations, this paper presents DART, an automated end-to-end pipeline designed to streamline the entire workflow of an object detection application from data collection to model deployment. DART eliminates the need for human labeling and extensive data collection while excelling in diverse scenarios. It employs a subject-driven image generation module (DreamBooth with SDXL) for data diversification, followed by an annotation stage where open-vocabulary object detection (Grounding DINO) generates bounding box annotations for both generated and original images. These pseudo-labels are then reviewed by a large multimodal model (GPT-4o) to guarantee credibility before serving as ground truth to train real-time object detectors (YOLO). We apply DART to a self-collected dataset of construction machines named Liebherr Product, which contains over 15K high-quality images across 23 categories. The current implementation of DART significantly increases average precision (AP) from 0.064 to 0.832. Furthermore, we adopt a modular design for DART to ensure easy exchangeability and extensibility. This allows for a smooth transition to more advanced algorithms in the future, seamless integration of new object categories without manual labeling, and adaptability to customized environments without extra data collection.

- **Summary**: While computer vision has proven valuable for medical image segmentation, its application faces challenges such as limited dataset sizes and the complexity of effectively leveraging unlabeled images. To address these challenges, we present a novel semi-supervised, consistency-based approach termed the data-efficient medical segmenter (DEMS). The DEMS features an encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates the developed online automatic augmenter (OAA) and residual robustness enhancement (RRE) blocks. The OAA augments input data with various image transformations, thereby diversifying the dataset to improve the generalization ability. The RRE enriches feature diversity and introduces perturbations to create varied inputs for different decoders, thereby providing enhanced variability. Moreover, we introduce a sensitive loss to further enhance consistency across different decoders and stabilize the training process. Extensive experimental results on both our own and three public datasets affirm the effectiveness of DEMS. Under extreme data shortage scenarios, our DEMS achieves 16.85\% and 10.37\% improvement in dice score compared with the U-Net and top-performed state-of-the-art method, respectively. Given its superior data efficiency, DEMS could present significant advancements in medical segmentation under small data regimes.

- **Summary**: Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) aims to generate a comprehensive graph-structure representation based on panoptic segmentation masks. Despite remarkable progress in PSG, almost all existing methods neglect the importance of shape-aware features, which inherently focus on the contours and boundaries of objects. To bridge this gap, we propose a model-agnostic Curricular shApe-aware FEature (CAFE) learning strategy for PSG. Specifically, we incorporate shape-aware features (i.e., mask features and boundary features) into PSG, moving beyond reliance solely on bbox features. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from human cognition, we propose to integrate shape-aware features in an easy-to-hard manner. To achieve this, we categorize the predicates into three groups based on cognition learning difficulty and correspondingly divide the training process into three stages. Each stage utilizes a specialized relation classifier to distinguish specific groups of predicates. As the learning difficulty of predicates increases, these classifiers are equipped with features of ascending complexity. We also incorporate knowledge distillation to retain knowledge acquired in earlier stages. Due to its model-agnostic nature, CAFE can be seamlessly incorporated into any PSG model. Extensive experiments and ablations on two PSG tasks under both robust and zero-shot PSG have attested to the superiority and robustness of our proposed CAFE, which outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Anatomical Landmark Detection is the process of identifying key areas of an image for clinical measurements. Each landmark is a single ground truth point labelled by a clinician. A machine learning model predicts the locus of a landmark as a probability region represented by a heatmap. Diffusion models have increased in popularity for generative modelling due to their high quality sampling and mode coverage, leading to their adoption in medical image processing for semantic segmentation. Diffusion modelling can be further adapted to learn a distribution over landmarks. The stochastic nature of diffusion models captures fluctuations in the landmark prediction, which we leverage by blurring into meaningful probability regions. In this paper, we reformulate automatic Anatomical Landmark Detection as a precise generative modelling task, producing a few-hot pixel heatmap. Our method achieves state-of-the-art MRE and comparable SDR performance with existing work.

- **Summary**: We present HUP-3D, a 3D multi-view multi-modal synthetic dataset for hand-ultrasound (US) probe pose estimation in the context of obstetric ultrasound. Egocentric markerless 3D joint pose estimation has potential applications in mixed reality based medical education. The ability to understand hand and probe movements programmatically opens the door to tailored guidance and mentoring applications. Our dataset consists of over 31k sets of RGB, depth and segmentation mask frames, including pose related ground truth data, with a strong emphasis on image diversity and complexity. Adopting a camera viewpoint-based sphere concept allows us to capture a variety of views and generate multiple hand grasp poses using a pre-trained network. Additionally, our approach includes a software-based image rendering concept, enhancing diversity with various hand and arm textures, lighting conditions, and background images. Furthermore, we validated our proposed dataset with state-of-the-art learning models and we obtained the lowest hand-object keypoint errors. The dataset and other details are provided with the supplementary material. The source code of our grasp generation and rendering pipeline will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: In panoptic scene graph generation (PSGG), models retrieve interactions between objects in an image which are grounded by panoptic segmentation masks. Previous evaluations on panoptic scene graphs have been subject to an erroneous evaluation protocol where multiple masks for the same object can lead to multiple relation distributions per mask-mask pair. This can be exploited to increase the final score. We correct this flaw and provide a fair ranking over a wide range of existing PSGG models. The observed scores for existing methods increase by up to 7.4 mR@50 for all two-stage methods, while dropping by up to 19.3 mR@50 for all one-stage methods, highlighting the importance of a correct evaluation. Contrary to recent publications, we show that existing two-stage methods are competitive to one-stage methods. Building on this, we introduce the Decoupled SceneFormer (DSFormer), a novel two-stage model that outperforms all existing scene graph models by a large margin of +11 mR@50 and +10 mNgR@50 on the corrected evaluation, thus setting a new SOTA. As a core design principle, DSFormer encodes subject and object masks directly into feature space.

- **Summary**: Acquiring surgical data for research and development is significantly hindered by high annotation costs and practical and ethical constraints. Utilizing synthetically generated images could offer a valuable alternative. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis on adapting text-to-image generative models for the surgical domain, leveraging the CholecT50 dataset, which provides surgical images annotated with surgical action triplets (instrument, verb, target). We investigate various language models and find T5 to offer more distinct features for differentiating surgical actions based on triplet-based textual inputs. Our analysis demonstrates strong alignment between long and triplet-based captions, supporting the use of triplet-based labels. We address the challenges in training text-to-image models on triplet-based captions without additional input signals by uncovering that triplet text embeddings are instrument-centric in the latent space and then, by designing an instrument-based class balancing technique to counteract the imbalance and skewness in the surgical data, improving training convergence. Extending Imagen, a diffusion-based generative model, we develop Surgical Imagen to generate photorealistic and activity-aligned surgical images from triplet-based textual prompts. We evaluate our model using diverse metrics, including human expert surveys and automated methods like FID and CLIP scores. We assess the model performance on key aspects: quality, alignment, reasoning, knowledge, and robustness, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in providing a realistic alternative to real data collection.

- **Summary**: In this study, we attempt to model intuition and incorporate this formalism to improve the performance of the Convolutional Neural Networks. Despite decades of research, ambiguities persist on principles of intuition. Experimental psychology reveals many types of intuition, which depend on state of the human mind. We focus on visual intuition, useful for completing missing information during visual cognitive tasks. First, we set up a scenario to gradually decrease the amount of visual information in the images of a dataset to examine its impact on CNN accuracy. Then, we represent a model for visual intuition using Gestalt theory. The theory claims that humans derive a set of templates according to their subconscious experiences. When the brain decides that there is missing information in a scene, such as occlusion, it instantaneously completes the information by replacing the missing parts with the most similar ones. Based upon Gestalt theory, we model the visual intuition, in two layers. Details of these layers are provided throughout the paper. We use the MNIST data set to test the suggested intuition model for completing the missing information. Experiments show that the augmented CNN architecture provides higher performances compared to the classic models when using incomplete images.

- **Summary**: This work aims to improve texture inpainting after clutter removal in scanned indoor meshes. This is achieved with a new UV mapping pre-processing step which leverages semantic information of indoor scenes to more accurately match the UV islands with the 3D representation of distinct structural elements like walls and floors. Semantic UV Mapping enriches classic UV unwrapping algorithms by not only relying on geometric features but also visual features originating from the present texture. The segmentation improves the UV mapping and simultaneously simplifies the 3D geometric reconstruction of the scene after the removal of loose objects. Each segmented element can be reconstructed separately using the boundary conditions of the adjacent elements. Because this is performed as a pre-processing step, other specialized methods for geometric and texture reconstruction can be used in the future to improve the results even further.

- **Summary**: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated impressive results in medical image restoration, attributed to the multi-head self-attention (MSA) mechanism in the spatial dimension. However, the majority of existing Transformers conduct attention within fixed and coarsely partitioned regions (\text{e.g.} the entire image or fixed patches), resulting in interference from irrelevant regions and fragmentation of continuous image content. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel Region Attention Transformer (RAT) that utilizes a region-based multi-head self-attention mechanism (R-MSA). The R-MSA dynamically partitions the input image into non-overlapping semantic regions using the robust Segment Anything Model (SAM) and then performs self-attention within these regions. This region partitioning is more flexible and interpretable, ensuring that only pixels from similar semantic regions complement each other, thereby eliminating interference from irrelevant regions. Moreover, we introduce a focal region loss to guide our model to adaptively focus on recovering high-difficulty regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RAT in various medical image restoration tasks, including PET image synthesis, CT image denoising, and pathological image super-resolution. Code is available at \href{https://github.com/Yaziwel/Region-Attention-Transformer-for-Medical-Image-Restoration.git}{https://github.com/RAT}.

- **Summary**: Different from human nature, it is still common practice today for vision tasks to train deep learning models only initially and on fixed datasets. A variety of approaches have recently addressed handling continual data streams. However, extending these methods to manage out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios has not effectively been investigated. On the other hand, it has recently been shown that non-continual neural mesh models exhibit strong performance in generalizing to such OOD scenarios. To leverage this decisive property in a continual learning setting, we propose incremental neural mesh models that can be extended with new meshes over time. In addition, we present a latent space initialization strategy that enables us to allocate feature space for future unseen classes in advance and a positional regularization term that forces the features of the different classes to consistently stay in respective latent space regions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on the Pascal3D and ObjectNet3D datasets and show that our approach outperforms the baselines for classification by $2-6\%$ in the in-domain and by $6-50\%$ in the OOD setting. Our work also presents the first incremental learning approach for pose estimation. Our code and model can be found at https://github.com/Fischer-Tom/iNeMo.

- **Summary**: The increasing interest in computer vision applications for nutrition and dietary monitoring has led to the development of advanced 3D reconstruction techniques for food items. However, the scarcity of high-quality data and limited collaboration between industry and academia have constrained progress in this field. Building on recent advancements in 3D reconstruction, we host the MetaFood Workshop and its challenge for Physically Informed 3D Food Reconstruction. This challenge focuses on reconstructing volume-accurate 3D models of food items from 2D images, using a visible checkerboard as a size reference. Participants were tasked with reconstructing 3D models for 20 selected food items of varying difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. The easy level provides 200 images, the medium level provides 30 images, and the hard level provides only 1 image for reconstruction. In total, 16 teams submitted results in the final testing phase. The solutions developed in this challenge achieved promising results in 3D food reconstruction, with significant potential for improving portion estimation for dietary assessment and nutritional monitoring.

- **Summary**: In this paper we introduce a new dataset containing instance segmentation masks for ten different categories of winter sports equipment, called WSESeg (Winter Sports Equipment Segmentation). Furthermore, we carry out interactive segmentation experiments on said dataset to explore possibilities for efficient further labeling. The SAM and HQ-SAM models are conceptualized as foundation models for performing user guided segmentation. In order to measure their claimed generalization capability we evaluate them on WSESeg. Since interactive segmentation offers the benefit of creating easily exploitable ground truth data during test-time, we are going to test various online adaptation methods for the purpose of exploring potentials for improvements without having to fine-tune the models explicitly. Our experiments show that our adaptation methods drastically reduce the Failure Rate (FR) and Number of Clicks (NoC) metrics, which generally leads faster to better interactive segmentation results.

- **Summary**: We present a novel inverse rendering-based framework to estimate the 3D shape (per-pixel surface normals and depth) of objects and scenes from single-view polarization images, the problem popularly known as Shape from Polarization (SfP). The existing physics-based and learning-based methods for SfP perform under certain restrictions, i.e., (a) purely diffuse or purely specular reflections, which are seldom in the real surfaces, (b) availability of the ground truth surface normals for direct supervision that are hard to acquire and are limited by the scanner's resolution, and (c) known refractive index. To overcome these restrictions, we start by learning to separate the partially-polarized diffuse and specular reflection components, which we call reflectance cues, based on a modified polarization reflection model and then estimate shape under mixed polarization through an inverse-rendering based self-supervised deep learning framework called SS-SfP, guided by the polarization data and estimated reflectance cues. Furthermore, we also obtain the refractive index as a non-linear least squares solution. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we establish the efficacy of the proposed framework over simple single-object scenes from DeepSfP dataset and complex in-the-wild scenes from SPW dataset in an entirely self-supervised setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first learning-based approach to address SfP under mixed polarization in a completely self-supervised framework.

- **Summary**: Infrared imaging technology has gained significant attention for its reliable sensing ability in low visibility conditions, prompting many studies to convert the abundant RGB images to infrared images. However, most existing image translation methods treat infrared images as a stylistic variation, neglecting the underlying physical laws, which limits their practical application. To address these issues, we propose a Physics-Informed Diffusion (PID) model for translating RGB images to infrared images that adhere to physical laws. Our method leverages the iterative optimization of the diffusion model and incorporates strong physical constraints based on prior knowledge of infrared laws during training. This approach enhances the similarity between translated infrared images and the real infrared domain without increasing extra training parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that PID significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/fangyuanmao/PID.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised multi-frame monocular depth estimation relies on the geometric consistency between successive frames under the assumption of a static scene. However, the presence of moving objects in dynamic scenes introduces inevitable inconsistencies, causing misaligned multi-frame feature matching and misleading self-supervision during training. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called ProDepth, which effectively addresses the mismatch problem caused by dynamic objects using a probabilistic approach. We initially deduce the uncertainty associated with static scene assumption by adopting an auxiliary decoder. This decoder analyzes inconsistencies embedded in the cost volume, inferring the probability of areas being dynamic. We then directly rectify the erroneous cost volume for dynamic areas through a Probabilistic Cost Volume Modulation (PCVM) module. Specifically, we derive probability distributions of depth candidates from both single-frame and multi-frame cues, modulating the cost volume by adaptively fusing those distributions based on the inferred uncertainty. Additionally, we present a self-supervision loss reweighting strategy that not only masks out incorrect supervision with high uncertainty but also mitigates the risks in remaining possible dynamic areas in accordance with the probability. Our proposed method excels over state-of-the-art approaches in all metrics on both Cityscapes and KITTI datasets, and demonstrates superior generalization ability on the Waymo Open dataset.

- **Summary**: The pre-trained point cloud model based on Masked Point Modeling (MPM) has exhibited substantial improvements across various tasks. However, two drawbacks hinder their practical application. Firstly, the positional embedding of masked patches in the decoder results in the leakage of their central coordinates, leading to limited 3D representations. Secondly, the excessive model size of existing MPM methods results in higher demands for devices. To address these, we propose to pre-train Point cloud Compact Model with Partial-aware \textbf{R}econstruction, named Point-CPR. Specifically, in the decoder, we couple the vanilla masked tokens with their positional embeddings as randomly masked queries and introduce a partial-aware prediction module before each decoder layer to predict them from the unmasked partial. It prevents the decoder from creating a shortcut between the central coordinates of masked patches and their reconstructed coordinates, enhancing the robustness of models. We also devise a compact encoder composed of local aggregation and MLPs, reducing the parameters and computational requirements compared to existing Transformer-based encoders. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model exhibits strong performance across various tasks, especially surpassing the leading MPM-based model PointGPT-B with only 2% of its parameters.

- **Summary**: Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) have gained wide applications in computational imaging. By solving EISP, the internal relative permittivity of the scatterer can be non-invasively determined based on the scattered electromagnetic fields. Despite previous efforts to address EISP, achieving better solutions to this problem has remained elusive, due to the challenges posed by inversion and discretization. This paper tackles those challenges in EISP via an implicit approach. By representing the scatterer's relative permittivity as a continuous implicit representation, our method is able to address the low-resolution problems arising from discretization. Further, optimizing this implicit representation within a forward framework allows us to conveniently circumvent the challenges posed by inverse estimation. Our approach outperforms existing methods on standard benchmark datasets. Project page: https://luo-ziyuan.github.io/Imaging-Interiors

- **Summary**: Anomaly synthesis strategies can effectively enhance unsupervised anomaly detection. However, existing strategies have limitations in the coverage and controllability of anomaly synthesis, particularly for weak defects that are very similar to normal regions. In this paper, we propose Global and Local Anomaly co-Synthesis Strategy (GLASS), a novel unified framework designed to synthesize a broader coverage of anomalies under the manifold and hypersphere distribution constraints of Global Anomaly Synthesis (GAS) at the feature level and Local Anomaly Synthesis (LAS) at the image level. Our method synthesizes near-in-distribution anomalies in a controllable way using Gaussian noise guided by gradient ascent and truncated projection. GLASS achieves state-of-the-art results on the MVTec AD (detection AUROC of 99.9\%), VisA, and MPDD datasets and excels in weak defect detection. The effectiveness and efficiency have been further validated in industrial applications for woven fabric defect detection.

- **Summary**: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) involves adapting a pre-trained source model to continually changing unsupervised target domains. In this paper, we systematically analyze the challenges of this task: online environment, unsupervised nature, and the risks of error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting under continual domain shifts. To address these challenges, we reshape the online data buffering and organizing mechanism for CTTA. We propose an {uncertainty-aware buffering approach} to identify {and aggregate} significant samples with high certainty from the unsupervised, single-pass data stream. {Based on this}, we propose a graph-based class relation preservation constraint to overcome catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, a pseudo-target replay objective is used to mitigate error accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in both segmentation and classification CTTA tasks. Code is available at \href{https://github.com/z1358/OBAO}{this https URL}.

- **Summary**: The construction industry has been traditionally slow in adopting digital technologies. However, these are becoming increasingly necessary due to a plentitude of challenges, such as a shortage of skilled labor and decreasing productivity levels compared to other industries. Autonomous robotic systems can alleviate this problem, but the software development process for these systems is heavily driven by data, a resource usually challenging to find in the construction domain due to the lack of public availability. In our work, we therefore provide a dataset of 14,805 RGB images with segmentation labels for reinforced concrete construction and make it publicly available. We conduct a detailed analysis of our dataset and discuss how to deal with labeling inconsistencies. Furthermore, we establish baselines for the YOLOv8L-seg, DeepLabV3, and U-Net segmentation models and investigate the influence of data availability and label inconsistencies on the performance of these models. Our study showed that the models are precise in their predictions but would benefit from more data to increase the number of recalled instances. Label inconsistencies had a negligible effect on model performance, and we, therefore, advocate for a crowd-sourced dataset to boost the development of autonomous robotic systems in the construction industry.

- **Summary**: Existing deep learning approaches leave out the semantic cues that are crucial in semantic segmentation present in complex scenarios including cluttered backgrounds and translucent objects, etc. To handle these challenges, we propose a feature amplification network (FANet) as a backbone network that incorporates semantic information using a novel feature enhancement module at multi-stages. To achieve this, we propose an adaptive feature enhancement (AFE) block that benefits from both a spatial context module (SCM) and a feature refinement module (FRM) in a parallel fashion. SCM aims to exploit larger kernel leverages for the increased receptive field to handle scale variations in the scene. Whereas our novel FRM is responsible for generating semantic cues that can capture both low-frequency and high-frequency regions for better segmentation tasks. We perform experiments over challenging real-world ZeroWaste-f dataset which contains background-cluttered and translucent objects. Our experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

- **Summary**: Neural radiance fields, or NeRFs, have become the de facto approach for high-quality view synthesis from a collection of images captured from multiple viewpoints. However, many issues remain when capturing images in-the-wild under challenging conditions, such as low light, high dynamic range, or rapid motion leading to smeared reconstructions with noticeable artifacts. In this work, we introduce quanta radiance fields, a novel class of neural radiance fields that are trained at the granularity of individual photons using single-photon cameras (SPCs). We develop theory and practical computational techniques for building radiance fields and estimating dense camera poses from unconventional, stochastic, and high-speed binary frame sequences captured by SPCs. We demonstrate, both via simulations and a SPC hardware prototype, high-fidelity reconstructions under high-speed motion, in low light, and for extreme dynamic range settings.

- **Summary**: Estimating canopy height and canopy height change at meter resolution from satellite imagery has numerous applications, such as monitoring forest health, logging activities, wood resources, and carbon stocks. However, many existing forest datasets are based on commercial or closed data sources, restricting the reproducibility and evaluation of new approaches. To address this gap, we introduce Open-Canopy, the first open-access and country-scale benchmark for very high resolution (1.5 m) canopy height estimation. Covering more than 87,000 km$^2$ across France, Open-Canopy combines SPOT satellite imagery with high resolution aerial LiDAR data. We also propose Open-Canopy-$\Delta$, the first benchmark for canopy height change detection between two images taken at different years, a particularly challenging task even for recent models. To establish a robust foundation for these benchmarks, we evaluate a comprehensive list of state-of-the-art computer vision models for canopy height estimation. The dataset and associated codes can be accessed at https://github.com/fajwel/Open-Canopy.

- **Summary**: Seeking answers to questions within long scientific research articles is a crucial area of study that aids readers in quickly addressing their inquiries. However, existing question-answering (QA) datasets based on scientific papers are limited in scale and focus solely on textual content. To address this limitation, we introduce SPIQA (Scientific Paper Image Question Answering), the first large-scale QA dataset specifically designed to interpret complex figures and tables within the context of scientific research articles across various domains of computer science. Leveraging the breadth of expertise and ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to understand figures, we employ automatic and manual curation to create the dataset. We craft an information-seeking task involving multiple images that cover a wide variety of plots, charts, tables, schematic diagrams, and result visualizations. SPIQA comprises 270K questions divided into training, validation, and three different evaluation splits. Through extensive experiments with 12 prominent foundational models, we evaluate the ability of current multimodal systems to comprehend the nuanced aspects of research articles. Additionally, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation strategy with in-context retrieval that allows fine-grained, step-by-step assessment and improves model performance. We further explore the upper bounds of performance enhancement with additional textual information, highlighting its promising potential for future research and the dataset's impact on revolutionizing how we interact with scientific literature.

- **Summary**: Counting repetitive actions in long untrimmed videos is a challenging task that has many applications such as rehabilitation. State-of-the-art methods predict action counts by first generating a temporal self-similarity matrix (TSM) from the sampled frames and then feeding the matrix to a predictor network. The self-similarity matrix, however, is not an optimal input to a network since it discards too much information from the frame-wise embeddings. We thus rethink how a TSM can be utilized for counting repetitive actions and propose a framework that learns embeddings and predicts action start probabilities at full temporal resolution. The number of repeated actions is then inferred from the action start probabilities. In contrast to current approaches that have the TSM as an intermediate representation, we propose a novel loss based on a generated reference TSM, which enforces that the self-similarity of the learned frame-wise embeddings is consistent with the self-similarity of repeated actions. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on three datasets, i.e., RepCount, UCFRep, and Countix.

- **Summary**: Training deep neural networks for 3D segmentation tasks can be challenging, often requiring efficient and effective strategies to improve model performance. In this study, we introduce a novel approach, DeCode, that utilizes label-derived features for model conditioning to support the decoder in the reconstruction process dynamically, aiming to enhance the efficiency of the training process. DeCode focuses on improving 3D segmentation performance through the incorporation of conditioning embedding with learned numerical representation of 3D-label shape features. Specifically, we develop an approach, where conditioning is applied during the training phase to guide the network toward robust segmentation. When labels are not available during inference, our model infers the necessary conditioning embedding directly from the input data, thanks to a feed-forward network learned during the training phase. This approach is tested using synthetic data and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images of teeth. For CBCT, three datasets are used: one publicly available and two in-house. Our results show that DeCode significantly outperforms traditional, unconditioned models in terms of generalization to unseen data, achieving higher accuracy at a reduced computational cost. This work represents the first of its kind to explore conditioning strategies in 3D data segmentation, offering a novel and more efficient method for leveraging annotated data. Our code, pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/SanoScience/DeCode .

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in radiance fields have opened new avenues for creating high-quality 3D assets and scenes. Style transfer can enhance these 3D assets with diverse artistic styles, transforming creative expression. However, existing techniques are often slow or unable to localize style transfer to specific objects. We introduce StyleSplat, a lightweight method for stylizing 3D objects in scenes represented by 3D Gaussians from reference style images. Our approach first learns a photorealistic representation of the scene using 3D Gaussian splatting while jointly segmenting individual 3D objects. We then use a nearest-neighbor feature matching loss to finetune the Gaussians of the selected objects, aligning their spherical harmonic coefficients with the style image to ensure consistency and visual appeal. StyleSplat allows for quick, customizable style transfer and localized stylization of multiple objects within a scene, each with a different style. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various 3D scenes and styles, showcasing enhanced control and customization in 3D creation.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models for autonomous driving often struggle with generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, sometimes performing worse than simple rule-based models. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, Adaptive Prediction Ensemble (APE), which integrates deep learning and rule-based prediction experts. A learned routing function, trained concurrently with the deep learning model, dynamically selects the most reliable prediction based on the input scenario. Our experiments on large-scale datasets, including Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and Argoverse, demonstrate improvement in zero-shot generalization across datasets. We show that our method outperforms individual prediction models and other variants, particularly in long-horizon prediction and scenarios with a high proportion of OOD data. This work highlights the potential of hybrid approaches for robust and generalizable motion prediction in autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: 3D Hand reconstruction from a single RGB image is challenging due to the articulated motion, self-occlusion, and interaction with objects. Existing SOTA methods employ attention-based transformers to learn the 3D hand pose and shape, but they fail to achieve robust and accurate performance due to insufficient modeling of joint spatial relations. To address this problem, we propose a novel graph-guided Mamba framework, named Hamba, which bridges graph learning and state space modeling. Our core idea is to reformulate Mamba's scanning into graph-guided bidirectional scanning for 3D reconstruction using a few effective tokens. This enables us to learn the joint relations and spatial sequences for enhancing the reconstruction performance. Specifically, we design a novel Graph-guided State Space (GSS) block that learns the graph-structured relations and spatial sequences of joints and uses 88.5% fewer tokens than attention-based methods. Additionally, we integrate the state space features and the global features using a fusion module. By utilizing the GSS block and the fusion module, Hamba effectively leverages the graph-guided state space modeling features and jointly considers global and local features to improve performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks and in-the-wild tests demonstrate that Hamba significantly outperforms existing SOTAs, achieving the PA-MPVPE of 5.3mm and F@15mm of 0.992 on FreiHAND. Hamba is currently Rank 1 in two challenging competition leaderboards on 3D hand reconstruction. The code will be available upon acceptance. [Website](https://humansensinglab.github.io/Hamba/).

- **Summary**: 3D object part segmentation is essential in computer vision applications. While substantial progress has been made in 2D object part segmentation, the 3D counterpart has received less attention, in part due to the scarcity of annotated 3D datasets, which are expensive to collect. In this work, we propose to leverage a few annotated 3D shapes or richly annotated 2D datasets to perform 3D object part segmentation. We present our novel approach, termed 3-By-2 that achieves SOTA performance on different benchmarks with various granularity levels. By using features from pretrained foundation models and exploiting semantic and geometric correspondences, we are able to overcome the challenges of limited 3D annotations. Our approach leverages available 2D labels, enabling effective 3D object part segmentation. Our method 3-By-2 can accommodate various part taxonomies and granularities, demonstrating interesting part label transfer ability across different object categories.

- **Summary**: We introduce the task of mixed-view panorama synthesis, where the goal is to synthesize a novel panorama given a small set of input panoramas and a satellite image of the area. This contrasts with previous work which only uses input panoramas (same-view synthesis), or an input satellite image (cross-view synthesis). We argue that the mixed-view setting is the most natural to support panorama synthesis for arbitrary locations worldwide. A critical challenge is that the spatial coverage of panoramas is uneven, with few panoramas available in many regions of the world. We introduce an approach that utilizes diffusion-based modeling and an attention-based architecture for extracting information from all available input imagery. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. In particular, our model can handle scenarios when the available panoramas are sparse or far from the location of the panorama we are attempting to synthesize.

- **Summary**: We delve into the physics-informed neural reconstruction of smoke and obstacles through sparse-view RGB videos, tackling challenges arising from limited observation of complex dynamics. Existing physics-informed neural networks often emphasize short-term physics constraints, leaving the proper preservation of long-term conservation less explored. We introduce Neural Characteristic Trajectory Fields, a novel representation utilizing Eulerian neural fields to implicitly model Lagrangian fluid trajectories. This topology-free, auto-differentiable representation facilitates efficient flow map calculations between arbitrary frames as well as efficient velocity extraction via auto-differentiation. Consequently, it enables end-to-end supervision covering long-term conservation and short-term physics priors. Building on the representation, we propose physics-informed trajectory learning and integration into NeRF-based scene reconstruction. We enable advanced obstacle handling through self-supervised scene decomposition and seamless integrated boundary constraints. Our results showcase the ability to overcome challenges like occlusion uncertainty, density-color ambiguity, and static-dynamic entanglements.

- **Summary**: Hierarchical segmentation entails creating segmentations at varying levels of granularity. We introduce the first hierarchical semantic segmentation dataset with subpart annotations for natural images, which we call SPIN (SubPartImageNet). We also introduce two novel evaluation metrics to evaluate how well algorithms capture spatial and semantic relationships across hierarchical levels. We benchmark modern models across three different tasks and analyze their strengths and weaknesses across objects, parts, and subparts. To facilitate community-wide progress, we publicly release our dataset at https://joshmyersdean.github.io/spin/index.html.

- **Summary**: Accurately recovering images from phaseless measurements is a challenging and long-standing problem. In this work, we present "deepECpr," which combines expectation-consistent (EC) approximation with deep denoising networks to surpass state-of-the-art phase-retrieval methods in both speed and accuracy. In addition to applying EC in a non-traditional manner, deepECpr includes a novel stochastic damping scheme that is inspired by recent diffusion methods. Like existing phase-retrieval methods based on plug-and-play priors, regularization by denoising, or diffusion, deepECpr iterates a denoising stage with a measurement-exploitation stage. But unlike existing methods, deepECpr requires far fewer denoiser calls. We compare deepECpr to the state-of-the-art prDeep (Metzler et al., 2018), Deep-ITA (Wang et al., 2020), and Diffusion Posterior Sampling (Chung et al., 2023) methods for noisy phase-retrieval of color, natural, and unnatural grayscale images on oversampled-Fourier and coded-diffraction-pattern measurements and find improvements in both PSNR and SSIM with 5x fewer denoiser calls.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel bottom-up approach for human body mesh reconstruction, specifically designed to address the challenges posed by partial visibility and occlusion in input images. Traditional top-down methods, relying on whole-body parametric models like SMPL, falter when only a small part of the human is visible, as they require visibility of most of the human body for accurate mesh reconstruction. To overcome this limitation, our method employs a "Divide and Fuse (D&F)" strategy, reconstructing human body parts independently before fusing them, thereby ensuring robustness against occlusions. We design Human Part Parametric Models (HPPM) that independently reconstruct the mesh from a few shape and global-location parameters, without inter-part dependency. A specially designed fusion module then seamlessly integrates the reconstructed parts, even when only a few are visible. We harness a large volume of ground-truth SMPL data to train our parametric mesh models. To facilitate the training and evaluation of our method, we have established benchmark datasets featuring images of partially visible humans with HPPM annotations. Our experiments, conducted on these benchmark datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our D&F method, particularly in scenarios with substantial invisibility, where traditional approaches struggle to maintain reconstruction quality.

- **Summary**: Range-View(RV)-based 3D point cloud segmentation is widely adopted due to its compact data form. However, RV-based methods fall short in providing robust segmentation for the occluded points and suffer from distortion of projected RGB images due to the sparse nature of 3D point clouds. To alleviate these problems, we propose a new LiDAR and Camera Range-view-based 3D point cloud semantic segmentation method (LaCRange). Specifically, a distortion-compensating knowledge distillation (DCKD) strategy is designed to remedy the adverse effect of RV projection of RGB images. Moreover, a context-based feature fusion module is introduced for robust and preservative sensor fusion. Finally, in order to address the limited resolution of RV and its insufficiency of 3D topology, a new point refinement scheme is devised for proper aggregation of features in 2D and augmentation of point features in 3D. We evaluated the proposed method on large-scale autonomous driving datasets \ie SemanticKITTI and nuScenes. In addition to being real-time, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on nuScenes benchmark

- **Summary**: To overcome the imbalanced multimodal learning problem, where models prefer the training of specific modalities, existing methods propose to control the training of uni-modal encoders from different perspectives, taking the inter-modal performance discrepancy as the basis. However, the intrinsic limitation of modality capacity is ignored. The scarcely informative modalities can be recognized as ``worse-learnt'' ones, which could force the model to memorize more noise, counterproductively affecting the multimodal model ability. Moreover, the current modality modulation methods narrowly concentrate on selected worse-learnt modalities, even suppressing the training of others. Hence, it is essential to consider the intrinsic limitation of modality capacity and take all modalities into account during balancing. To this end, we propose the Diagnosing \& Re-learning method. The learning state of each modality is firstly estimated based on the separability of its uni-modal representation space, and then used to softly re-initialize the corresponding uni-modal encoder. In this way, the over-emphasizing of scarcely informative modalities is avoided. In addition, encoders of worse-learnt modalities are enhanced, simultaneously avoiding the over-training of other modalities. Accordingly, multimodal learning is effectively balanced and enhanced. Experiments covering multiple types of modalities and multimodal frameworks demonstrate the superior performance of our simple-yet-effective method for balanced multimodal learning.

- **Summary**: In this work, we address the problem of eavesdropping on digital video displays by analyzing the electromagnetic waves that unintentionally emanate from the cables and connectors, particularly HDMI. This problem is known as TEMPEST. Compared to the analog case (VGA), the digital case is harder due to a 10-bit encoding that results in a much larger bandwidth and non-linear mapping between the observed signal and the pixel's intensity. As a result, eavesdropping systems designed for the analog case obtain unclear and difficult-to-read images when applied to digital video. The proposed solution is to recast the problem as an inverse problem and train a deep learning module to map the observed electromagnetic signal back to the displayed image. However, this approach still requires a detailed mathematical analysis of the signal, firstly to determine the frequency at which to tune but also to produce training samples without actually needing a real TEMPEST setup. This saves time and avoids the need to obtain these samples, especially if several configurations are being considered. Our focus is on improving the average Character Error Rate in text, and our system improves this rate by over 60 percentage points compared to previous available implementations. The proposed system is based on widely available Software Defined Radio and is fully open-source, seamlessly integrated into the popular GNU Radio framework. We also share the dataset we generated for training, which comprises both simulated and over 1000 real captures. Finally, we discuss some countermeasures to minimize the potential risk of being eavesdropped by systems designed based on similar principles.

- **Summary**: In many applications, robots can benefit from object-level understanding of their environments, including the ability to distinguish object instances and re-identify previously seen instances. Object re-identification is challenging across different viewpoints and in scenes with significant appearance variation arising from weather or lighting changes. Most works on object re-identification focus on specific classes; approaches that address general object re-identification require foreground segmentation and have limited consideration of challenges such as occlusions, outdoor scenes, and illumination changes. To address this problem, we introduce CODa Re-ID: an in-the-wild object re-identification dataset containing 1,037,814 observations of 557 objects of 8 classes under diverse lighting conditions and viewpoints. Further, we propose CLOVER, a representation learning method for object observations that can distinguish between static object instances. Our results show that CLOVER achieves superior performance in static object re-identification under varying lighting conditions and viewpoint changes, and can generalize to unseen instances and classes.
