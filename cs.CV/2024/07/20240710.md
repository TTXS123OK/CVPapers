- **Summary**: We introduce MIGS (Multi-Identity Gaussian Splatting), a novel method that learns a single neural representation for multiple identities, using only monocular videos. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) approaches for human avatars require per-identity optimization. However, learning a multi-identity representation presents advantages in robustly animating humans under arbitrary poses. We propose to construct a high-order tensor that combines all the learnable 3DGS parameters for all the training identities. By assuming a low-rank structure and factorizing the tensor, we model the complex rigid and non-rigid deformations of multiple subjects in a unified network, significantly reducing the total number of parameters. Our proposed approach leverages information from all the training identities, enabling robust animation under challenging unseen poses, outperforming existing approaches. We also demonstrate how it can be extended to learn unseen identities.

- **Summary**: The detection of moving infrared dim-small targets has been a challenging and prevalent research topic. The current state-of-the-art methods are mainly based on ConvLSTM to aggregate information from adjacent frames to facilitate the detection of the current frame. However, these methods implicitly utilize motion information only in the training stage and fail to explicitly explore motion compensation, resulting in poor performance in the case of a video sequence including large motion. In this paper, we propose a Deformable Feature Alignment and Refinement (DFAR) method based on deformable convolution to explicitly use motion context in both the training and inference stages. Specifically, a Temporal Deformable Alignment (TDA) module based on the designed Dilated Convolution Attention Fusion (DCAF) block is developed to explicitly align the adjacent frames with the current frame at the feature level. Then, the feature refinement module adaptively fuses the aligned features and further aggregates useful spatio-temporal information by means of the proposed Attention-guided Deformable Fusion (AGDF) block. In addition, to improve the alignment of adjacent frames with the current frame, we extend the traditional loss function by introducing a new motion compensation loss. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DFAR method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets including DAUB and IRDST.

- **Summary**: In medical imaging, the diffusion models have shown great potential in synthetic image generation tasks. However, these models often struggle with the interpretable connections between the generated and existing images and could create illusions. To address these challenges, our research proposes a novel diffusion-based generative model based on deformation diffusion and recovery. This model, named Deformation-Recovery Diffusion Model (DRDM), diverges from traditional score/intensity and latent feature-based approaches, emphasizing morphological changes through deformation fields rather than direct image synthesis. This is achieved by introducing a topological-preserving deformation field generation method, which randomly samples and integrates a set of multi-scale Deformation Vector Fields (DVF). DRDM is trained to learn to recover unreasonable deformation components, thereby restoring each randomly deformed image to a realistic distribution. These innovations facilitate the generation of diverse and anatomically plausible deformations, enhancing data augmentation and synthesis for further analysis in downstream tasks, such as few-shot learning and image registration. Experimental results in cardiac MRI and pulmonary CT show DRDM is capable of creating diverse, large (over 10% image size deformation scale), and high-quality (negative ratio of folding rate is lower than 1%) deformation fields. The further experimental results in downstream tasks, 2D image segmentation and 3D image registration, indicate significant improvements resulting from DRDM, showcasing the potential of our model to advance image manipulation and synthesis in medical imaging and beyond.   Our implementation will be available at https://github.com/jianqingzheng/def_diff_rec.

- **Summary**: Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the most effective treatments for cancer, and its success relies on the accurate delineation of targets. However, target delineation is a comprehensive medical decision that currently relies purely on manual processes by human experts. Manual delineation is time-consuming, laborious, and subject to interobserver variations. Although the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have significantly enhanced the auto-contouring of normal tissues, accurate delineation of RT target volumes remains a challenge. In this study, we propose a visual language model-based RT target volume auto-delineation network termed Radformer. The Radformer utilizes a hierarichal vision transformer as the backbone and incorporates large language models to extract text-rich features from clinical data. We introduce a visual language attention module (VLAM) for integrating visual and linguistic features for language-aware visual encoding (LAVE). The Radformer has been evaluated on a dataset comprising 2985 patients with head-and-neck cancer who underwent RT. Metrics, including the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), intersection over union (IOU), and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95), were used to evaluate the performance of the model quantitatively. Our results demonstrate that the Radformer has superior segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art models, validating its potential for adoption in RT practice.

- **Summary**: Standard single-image super-resolution creates paired training data from high-resolution images through fixed downsampling kernels. However, real-world super-resolution (RWSR) faces unknown degradations in the low-resolution inputs, all the while lacking paired training data. Existing methods approach this problem by learning blind general models through complex synthetic augmentations on training inputs; they sacrifice the performance on specific degradation for broader generalization to many possible ones. We address the unsupervised RWSR for a targeted real-world degradation. We study from a distillation perspective and introduce a novel pairwise distance distillation framework. Through our framework, a model specialized in synthetic degradation adapts to target real-world degradations by distilling intra- and inter-model distances across the specialized model and an auxiliary generalized model. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances fidelity and perceptual quality, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches in RWSR.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral image classification, a task that assigns pre-defined classes to each pixel in a hyperspectral image of remote sensing scenes, often faces challenges due to the neglect of correlations between spectrally similar pixels. This oversight can lead to inaccurate edge definitions and difficulties in managing minor spectral variations in contiguous areas. To address these issues, we introduce the novel Dual-stage Spectral Supertoken Classifier (DSTC), inspired by superpixel concepts. DSTC employs spectrum-derivative-based pixel clustering to group pixels with similar spectral characteristics into spectral supertokens. By projecting the classification of these tokens onto the image space, we achieve pixel-level results that maintain regional classification consistency and precise boundary. Moreover, recognizing the diversity within tokens, we propose a class-proportion-based soft label. This label adaptively assigns weights to different categories based on their prevalence, effectively managing data distribution imbalances and enhancing classification performance. Comprehensive experiments on WHU-OHS, IP, KSC, and UP datasets corroborate the robust classification capabilities of DSTC and the effectiveness of its individual components. Code will be publicly available at https://github.com/laprf/DSTC.

- **Summary**: The success of large pretrained models in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) has opened new avenues for constructing foundation models for time series forecasting (TSF). Traditional TSF foundation models rely heavily on numerical data fitting. In contrast, the human brain is inherently skilled at processing visual information, prefer predicting future trends by observing visualized sequences. From a biomimetic perspective, utilizing models to directly process numerical sequences might not be the most effective route to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This paper proposes ViTime, a novel Visual Intelligence-based foundation model for TSF. ViTime overcomes the limitations of numerical time series data fitting by utilizing visual data processing paradigms and employs a innovative data synthesis method during training, called Real Time Series (RealTS). Experiments on a diverse set of previously unseen forecasting datasets demonstrate that ViTime achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, even surpassing the best individually trained supervised models in some situations. These findings suggest that visual intelligence can significantly enhance time series analysis and forecasting, paving the way for more advanced and versatile models in the field. The code for our framework is accessible at https://github.com/IkeYang/ViTime.

- **Summary**: Existing vision-text contrastive learning models enhance representation transferability and support zero-shot prediction by matching paired image and caption embeddings while pushing unrelated pairs apart. However, astronomical image-label datasets are significantly smaller compared to general image and label datasets available from the internet. We introduce CosmoCLIP, an astronomical image-text contrastive learning framework precisely fine-tuned on the pre-trained CLIP model using SpaceNet and BLIP-based captions. SpaceNet, attained via FLARE, constitutes ~13k optimally distributed images, while BLIP acts as a rich knowledge extractor. The rich semantics derived from this SpaceNet and BLIP descriptions, when learned contrastively, enable CosmoCLIP to achieve superior generalization across various in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Our results demonstrate that CosmoCLIP is a straightforward yet powerful framework, significantly outperforming CLIP in zero-shot classification and image-text retrieval tasks.

- **Summary**: Predicting a potential collision with leading vehicles is an essential functionality of any autonomous/assisted driving system. One bottleneck of existing vision-based solutions is that their updating rate is limited to the frame rate of standard cameras used. In this paper, we present a novel method that estimates the time to collision using a neuromorphic event-based camera, a biologically inspired visual sensor that can sense at exactly the same rate as scene dynamics. The core of the proposed algorithm consists of a two-step approach for efficient and accurate geometric model fitting on event data in a coarse-to-fine manner. The first step is a robust linear solver based on a novel geometric measurement that overcomes the partial observability of event-based normal flow. The second step further refines the resulting model via a spatio-temporal registration process formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem. Experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming other alternative methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

- **Summary**: Learning from noisy-labeled data is crucial for real-world applications. Traditional Noisy-Label Learning (NLL) methods categorize training data into clean and noisy sets based on the loss distribution of training samples. However, they often neglect that clean samples, especially those with intricate visual patterns, may also yield substantial losses. This oversight is particularly significant in datasets with Instance-Dependent Noise (IDN), where mislabeling probabilities correlate with visual appearance. Our approach explicitly distinguishes between clean vs.noisy and easy vs. hard samples. We identify training samples with small losses, assuming they have simple patterns and correct labels. Utilizing these easy samples, we hallucinate multiple anchors to select hard samples for label correction. Corrected hard samples, along with the easy samples, are used as labeled data in subsequent semi-supervised training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world IDN datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method over other state-of-the-art NLL methods.

- **Summary**: Slide-level classification for whole-slide images (WSIs) has been widely recognized as a crucial problem in digital and computational pathology. Current approaches commonly consider WSIs as a bag of cropped patches and process them via multiple instance learning due to the large number of patches, which cannot fully explore the relationship among patches; in other words, the global information cannot be fully incorporated into decision making. Herein, we propose an efficient and effective slide-level classification model, named as FALFormer, that can process a WSI as a whole so as to fully exploit the relationship among the entire patches and to improve the classification performance. FALFormer is built based upon Transformers and self-attention mechanism. To lessen the computational burden of the original self-attention mechanism and to process the entire patches together in a WSI, FALFormer employs Nystr\"om self-attention which approximates the computation by using a smaller number of tokens or landmarks. For effective learning, FALFormer introduces feature-aware landmarks to enhance the representation power of the landmarks and the quality of the approximation. We systematically evaluate the performance of FALFormer using two public datasets, including CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA. The experimental results demonstrate that FALFormer achieves superior performance on both datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods for the slide-level classification. This suggests that FALFormer can facilitate an accurate and precise analysis of WSIs, potentially leading to improved diagnosis and prognosis on WSIs.

- **Summary**: Micro-expressions (MEs) are spontaneous, unconscious facial expressions that have promising applications in various fields such as psychotherapy and national security. Thus, micro-expression recognition (MER) has attracted more and more attention from researchers. Although various MER methods have emerged especially with the development of deep learning techniques, the task still faces several challenges, e.g. subtle motion and limited training data. To address these problems, we propose a novel motion extraction strategy (MoExt) for the MER task and use additional macro-expression data in the pre-training process. We primarily pretrain the feature separator and motion extractor using the contrastive loss, thus enabling them to extract representative motion features. In MoExt, shape features and texture features are first extracted separately from onset and apex frames, and then motion features related to MEs are extracted based on the shape features of both frames. To enable the model to more effectively separate features, we utilize the extracted motion features and the texture features from the onset frame to reconstruct the apex frame. Through pre-training, the module is enabled to extract inter-frame motion features of facial expressions while excluding irrelevant information. The feature separator and motion extractor are ultimately integrated into the MER network, which is then fine-tuned using the target ME data. The effectiveness of proposed method is validated on three commonly used datasets, i.e., CASME II, SMIC, SAMM, and CAS(ME)3 dataset. The results show that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: As a novel video representation method, Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV) has shown great potential in the fields of video compression, video restoration, and video interpolation. In the process of representing videos using NeRV, each frame corresponds to an embedding, which is then reconstructed into a video frame sequence after passing through a small number of decoding layers (E-NeRV, HNeRV, etc.). However, this small number of decoding layers can easily lead to the problem of redundant model parameters due to the large proportion of parameters in a single decoding layer, which greatly restricts the video regression ability of neural network models. In this paper, we propose a multilayer neural representation for videos (MNeRV) and design a new decoder M-Decoder and its matching encoder M-Encoder. MNeRV has more encoding and decoding layers, which effectively alleviates the problem of redundant model parameters caused by too few layers. In addition, we design MNeRV blocks to perform more uniform and effective parameter allocation between decoding layers. In the field of video regression reconstruction, we achieve better reconstruction quality (+4.06 PSNR) with fewer parameters. Finally, we showcase MNeRV performance in downstream tasks such as video restoration and video interpolation. The source code of MNeRV is available at https://github.com/Aaronbtb/MNeRV.

- **Summary**: Generalizable vehicle re-identification (ReID) aims to enable the well-trained model in diverse source domains to broadly adapt to unknown target domains without additional fine-tuning or retraining. However, it still faces the challenges of domain shift problem and has difficulty accurately generalizing to unknown target domains. This limitation occurs because the model relies heavily on primary domain-invariant features in the training data and pays less attention to potentially valuable secondary features. To solve this complex and common problem, this paper proposes the two-stage Multi-expert Knowledge Confrontation and Collaboration (MiKeCoCo) method, which incorporates multiple experts with unique perspectives into Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) and fully leverages high-level semantic knowledge for comprehensive feature representation. Specifically, we propose to construct the learnable prompt set of all specific-perspective experts by adversarial learning in the latent space of visual features during the first stage of training. The learned prompt set with high-level semantics is then utilized to guide representation learning of the multi-level features for final knowledge fusion in the next stage. In this process of knowledge fusion, although multiple experts employ different assessment ways to examine the same vehicle, their common goal is to confirm the vehicle's true identity. Their collective decision can ensure the accuracy and consistency of the evaluation results. Furthermore, we design different image inputs for two-stage training, which include image component separation and diversity enhancement in order to extract the ID-related prompt representation and to obtain feature representation highlighted by all experts, respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition performance.

- **Summary**: In-context learning for vision data has been underexplored compared with that in natural language. Previous works studied image in-context learning, urging models to generate a single image guided by demonstrations. In this paper, we propose and study video in-context learning, where the model starts from an existing video clip and generates diverse potential future sequences, each semantically guided by the prompted video demonstrations. To achieve this, we provide a clear definition of the task, and train an autoregressive Transformer on video datasets. We thoroughly analyze the effect of different datasets and represent frames as discrete tokens, and then model them by next token predictions. We design various evaluation metrics, including both objective and subjective measures, to demonstrate the visual quality and semantic accuracy of generation results. Our model follows the scaling law and generates high-quality video clips that accurately align with the semantic guidance provided by in-context examples.

- **Summary**: Recently, vision-language pre-trained models have emerged in computational pathology. Previous works generally focused on the alignment of image-text pairs via the contrastive pre-training paradigm. Such pre-trained models have been applied to pathology image classification in zero-shot learning or transfer learning fashion. Herein, we hypothesize that the pre-trained vision-language models can be utilized for quantitative histopathology image analysis through a simple image-to-text retrieval. To this end, we propose a Text-based Quantitative and Explainable histopathology image analysis, which we call TQx. Given a set of histopathology images, we adopt a pre-trained vision-language model to retrieve a word-of-interest pool. The retrieved words are then used to quantify the histopathology images and generate understandable feature embeddings due to the direct mapping to the text description. To evaluate the proposed method, the text-based embeddings of four histopathology image datasets are utilized to perform clustering and classification tasks. The results demonstrate that TQx is able to quantify and analyze histopathology images that are comparable to the prevalent visual models in computational pathology.

This paper introduces the High-Resolution Cloud Detection Network (HR-cloud-Net), which utilizes a hierarchical high-resolution integration approach. HR-cloud-Net integrates a high-resolution representation module, layer-wise cascaded feature fusion module, and multi-resolution pyramid pooling module to effectively capture complex cloud features. This architecture preserves detailed cloud texture information while facilitating feature exchange across different resolutions, thereby enhancing overall performance in cloud detection. Additionally, a novel approach is introduced wherein a student view, trained on noisy augmented images, is supervised by a teacher view processing normal images. This setup enables the student to learn from cleaner supervisions provided by the teacher, leading to improved performance. Extensive evaluations on three optical satellite image cloud detection datasets validate the superior performance of HR-cloud-Net compared to existing methods.The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/kunzhan/HR-cloud-Net}.

- **Summary**: Contrast-enhanced brain MRI (CE-MRI) is a valuable diagnostic technique but may pose health risks and incur high costs. To create safer alternatives, multi-modality medical image translation aims to synthesize CE-MRI images from other available modalities. Although existing methods can generate promising predictions, they still face two challenges, i.e., exhibiting over-confidence and lacking interpretability on predictions. To address the above challenges, this paper introduces TrustI2I, a novel trustworthy method that reformulates multi-to-one medical image translation problem as a multimodal regression problem, aiming to build an uncertainty-aware and reliable system. Specifically, our method leverages deep evidential regression to estimate prediction uncertainties and employs an explicit intermediate and late fusion strategy based on the Mixture of Normal Inverse Gamma (MoNIG) distribution, enhancing both synthesis quality and interpretability. Additionally, we incorporate uncertainty calibration to improve the reliability of uncertainty. Validation on the BraTS2018 dataset demonstrates that our approach surpasses current methods, producing higher-quality images with rational uncertainty estimation.

- **Summary**: To further promote the development of multimodal point cloud completion, we contribute a large-scale multimodal point cloud completion benchmark ModelNet-MPC with richer shape categories and more diverse test data, which contains nearly 400,000 pairs of high-quality point clouds and rendered images of 40 categories. Besides the fully supervised point cloud completion task, two additional tasks including denoising completion and zero-shot learning completion are proposed in ModelNet-MPC, to simulate real-world scenarios and verify the robustness to noise and the transfer ability across categories of current methods. Meanwhile, considering that existing multimodal completion pipelines usually adopt a unidirectional fusion mechanism and ignore the shape prior contained in the image modality, we propose a Dual-Modality Feature Interaction Network (DuInNet) in this paper. DuInNet iteratively interacts features between point clouds and images to learn both geometric and texture characteristics of shapes with the dual feature interactor. To adapt to specific tasks such as fully supervised, denoising, and zero-shot learning point cloud completions, an adaptive point generator is proposed to generate complete point clouds in blocks with different weights for these two modalities. Extensive experiments on the ShapeNet-ViPC and ModelNet-MPC benchmarks demonstrate that DuInNet exhibits superiority, robustness and transfer ability in all completion tasks over state-of-the-art methods. The code and dataset will be available soon.

- **Summary**: As multi-scale features are necessary for human pose estimation tasks, high-resolution networks are widely applied.   To improve efficiency, lightweight modules are proposed to replace costly point-wise convolutions in high-resolution networks, including channel weighting and spatial weighting methods.   However, they fail to maintain the consistency of weights and capture global spatial information.   To address these problems, we present a Grouped lightweight High-Resolution Network (Greit-HRNet), in which we propose a Greit block including a group method Grouped Channel Weighting (GCW) and a spatial weighting method Global Spatial Weighting (GSW).   GCW modules group conditional channel weighting to make weights stable and maintain the high-resolution features with the deepening of the network, while GSW modules effectively extract global spatial information and exchange information across channels.   In addition, we apply the Large Kernel Attention (LKA) method to improve the whole efficiency of our Greit-HRNet.   Our experiments on both MS-COCO and MPII human pose estimation datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our Greit-HRNet, outperforming other state-of-the-art lightweight networks.

- **Summary**: Building on the unprecedented capabilities of large language models for command understanding and zero-shot recognition of multi-modal vision-language transformers, visual language navigation (VLN) has emerged as an effective way to address multiple fundamental challenges toward a natural language interface to robot navigation. However, such vision-language models are inherently vulnerable due to the lack of semantic meaning of the underlying embedding space. Using a recently developed gradient based optimization procedure, we demonstrate that images can be modified imperceptibly to match the representation of totally different images and unrelated texts for a vision-language model. Building on this, we develop algorithms that can adversarially modify a minimal number of images so that the robot will follow a route of choice for commands that require a number of landmarks. We demonstrate that experimentally using a recently proposed VLN system; for a given navigation command, a robot can be made to follow drastically different routes. We also develop an efficient algorithm to detect such malicious modifications reliably based on the fact that the adversarially modified images have much higher sensitivity to added Gaussian noise than the original images.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of high resolution videos posts great storage and bandwidth pressure on cloud video services, driving the development of next-generation video codecs. Despite great progress made in neural video coding, existing approaches are still far from economical deployment considering the complexity and rate-distortion performance tradeoff. To clear the roadblocks for neural video coding, in this paper we propose a new framework featuring standard compatibility, high performance, and low decoding complexity. We employ a set of jointly optimized neural pre- and post-processors, wrapping a standard video codec, to encode videos at different resolutions. The rate-distorion optimal downsampling ratio is signaled to the decoder at the per-sequence level for each target rate. We design a low complexity neural post-processor architecture that can handle different upsampling ratios. The change of resolution exploits the spatial redundancy in high-resolution videos, while the neural wrapper further achieves rate-distortion performance improvement through end-to-end optimization with a codec proxy. Our light-weight post-processor architecture has a complexity of 516 MACs / pixel, and achieves 9.3% BD-Rate reduction over VVC on the UVG dataset, and 6.4% on AOM CTC Class A1. Our approach has the potential to further advance the performance of the latest video coding standards using neural processing with minimal added complexity.

- **Summary**: Delving into the realm of egocentric vision, the advancement of referring video object segmentation (RVOS) stands as pivotal in understanding human activities. However, existing RVOS task primarily relies on static attributes such as object names to segment target objects, posing challenges in distinguishing target objects from background objects and in identifying objects undergoing state changes. To address these problems, this work proposes a novel action-aware RVOS setting called ActionVOS, aiming at segmenting only active objects in egocentric videos using human actions as a key language prompt. This is because human actions precisely describe the behavior of humans, thereby helping to identify the objects truly involved in the interaction and to understand possible state changes. We also build a method tailored to work under this specific setting. Specifically, we develop an action-aware labeling module with an efficient action-guided focal loss. Such designs enable ActionVOS model to prioritize active objects with existing readily-available annotations. Experimental results on VISOR dataset reveal that ActionVOS significantly reduces the mis-segmentation of inactive objects, confirming that actions help the ActionVOS model understand objects' involvement. Further evaluations on VOST and VSCOS datasets show that the novel ActionVOS setting enhances segmentation performance when encountering challenging circumstances involving object state changes. We will make our implementation available at https://github.com/ut-vision/ActionVOS.

- **Summary**: With the significant development of large models in recent years, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal understanding and reasoning tasks. Compared to traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), LVLMs present great potential and challenges due to its closer proximity to the multi-resource real-world applications and the complexity of multi-modal processing. However, the vulnerability of LVLMs is relatively underexplored, posing potential security risks in daily usage. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the various forms of existing LVLM attacks. Specifically, we first introduce the background of attacks targeting LVLMs, including the attack preliminary, attack challenges, and attack resources. Then, we systematically review the development of LVLM attack methods, such as adversarial attacks that manipulate model outputs, jailbreak attacks that exploit model vulnerabilities for unauthorized actions, prompt injection attacks that engineer the prompt type and pattern, and data poisoning that affects model training. Finally, we discuss promising research directions in the future. We believe that our survey provides insights into the current landscape of LVLM vulnerabilities, inspiring more researchers to explore and mitigate potential safety issues in LVLM developments. The latest papers on LVLM attacks are continuously collected in https://github.com/liudaizong/Awesome-LVLM-Attack.

- **Summary**: Eye gaze that reveals human observational patterns has increasingly been incorporated into solutions for vision tasks. Despite recent explorations on leveraging gaze to aid deep networks, few studies exploit gaze as an efficient annotation approach for medical image segmentation which typically entails heavy annotating costs. In this paper, we propose to collect dense weak supervision for medical image segmentation with a gaze annotation scheme. To train with gaze, we propose a multi-level framework that trains multiple networks from discriminative human attention, simulated with a set of pseudo-masks derived by applying hierarchical thresholds on gaze heatmaps. Furthermore, to mitigate gaze noise, a cross-level consistency is exploited to regularize overfitting noisy labels, steering models toward clean patterns learned by peer networks. The proposed method is validated on two public medical datasets of polyp and prostate segmentation tasks. We contribute a high-quality gaze dataset entitled GazeMedSeg as an extension to the popular medical segmentation datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first gaze dataset for medical image segmentation. Our experiments demonstrate that gaze annotation outperforms previous label-efficient annotation schemes in terms of both performance and annotation time. Our collected gaze data and code are available at: https://github.com/med-air/GazeMedSeg.

- **Summary**: Mutual information has many applications in image alignment and matching, mainly due to its ability to measure the statistical dependence between two images, even if the two images are from different modalities (e.g., CT and MRI). It considers not only the pixel intensities of the images but also the spatial relationships between the pixels. In this project, we apply the mutual information formula to image matching, where image A is the moving object and image B is the target object and calculate the mutual information between them to evaluate the similarity between the images. For comparison, we also used entropy and information-gain methods to test the dependency of the images. We also investigated the effect of different environments on the mutual information of the same image and used experiments and plots to demonstrate.



### Pseudo-RIS: Distinctive Pseudo-supervision Generation for Referring Image Segmentation

- **Summary**: We propose a new framework that automatically generates high-quality segmentation masks with their referring expressions as pseudo supervisions for referring image segmentation (RIS). These pseudo supervisions allow the training of any supervised RIS methods without the cost of manual labeling. To achieve this, we incorporate existing segmentation and image captioning foundation models, leveraging their broad generalization capabilities. However, the naive incorporation of these models may generate non-distinctive expressions that do not distinctively refer to the target masks. To address this challenge, we propose two-fold strategies that generate distinctive captions: 1) 'distinctive caption sampling', a new decoding method for the captioning model, to generate multiple expression candidates with detailed words focusing on the target. 2) 'distinctiveness-based text filtering' to further validate the candidates and filter out those with a low level of distinctiveness. These two strategies ensure that the generated text supervisions can distinguish the target from other objects, making them appropriate for the RIS annotations. Our method significantly outperforms both weakly and zero-shot SoTA methods on the RIS benchmark datasets. It also surpasses fully supervised methods in unseen domains, proving its capability to tackle the open-world challenge within RIS. Furthermore, integrating our method with human annotations yields further improvements, highlighting its potential in semi-supervised learning applications.

- **Summary**: Open-Vocabulary Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) is attracting increasing attention due to its ability to segment and track arbitrary objects. However, the recent Open-Vocabulary VIS attempts obtained unsatisfactory results, especially in terms of generalization ability of novel categories. We discover that the domain gap between the VLM features (e.g., CLIP) and the instance queries and the underutilization of temporal consistency are two central causes. To mitigate these issues, we design and train a novel Open-Vocabulary VIS baseline called OVFormer. OVFormer utilizes a lightweight module for unified embedding alignment between query embeddings and CLIP image embeddings to remedy the domain gap. Unlike previous image-based training methods, we conduct video-based model training and deploy a semi-online inference scheme to fully mine the temporal consistency in the video. Without bells and whistles, OVFormer achieves 21.9 mAP with a ResNet-50 backbone on LV-VIS, exceeding the previous state-of-the-art performance by 7.7. Extensive experiments on some Close-Vocabulary VIS datasets also demonstrate the strong zero-shot generalization ability of OVFormer (+ 7.6 mAP on YouTube-VIS 2019, + 3.9 mAP on OVIS). Code is available at https://github.com/fanghaook/OVFormer.

- **Summary**: Instruction generation is a vital and multidisciplinary research area with broad applications. Existing instruction generation models are limited to generating instructions in a single style from a particular dataset, and the style and content of generated instructions cannot be controlled. Moreover, most existing instruction generation methods also disregard the spatial modeling of the navigation environment. Leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose C-Instructor, which utilizes the chain-of-thought-style prompt for style-controllable and content-controllable instruction generation. Firstly, we propose a Chain of Thought with Landmarks (CoTL) mechanism, which guides the LLM to identify key landmarks and then generate complete instructions. CoTL renders generated instructions more accessible to follow and offers greater controllability over the manipulation of landmark objects. Furthermore, we present a Spatial Topology Modeling Task to facilitate the understanding of the spatial structure of the environment. Finally, we introduce a Style-Mixed Training policy, harnessing the prior knowledge of LLMs to enable style control for instruction generation based on different prompts within a single model instance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that instructions generated by C-Instructor outperform those generated by previous methods in text metrics, navigation guidance evaluation, and user studies.

- **Summary**: Both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have shown great success in semantic segmentation tasks. Efforts have been made to integrate CNNs with Transformer models to capture both local and global context interactions. However, there is still room for enhancement, particularly when considering constraints on computational resources. In this paper, we introduce HAFormer, a model that combines the hierarchical features extraction ability of CNNs with the global dependency modeling capability of Transformers to tackle lightweight semantic segmentation challenges. Specifically, we design a Hierarchy-Aware Pixel-Excitation (HAPE) module for adaptive multi-scale local feature extraction. During the global perception modeling, we devise an Efficient Transformer (ET) module streamlining the quadratic calculations associated with traditional Transformers. Moreover, a correlation-weighted Fusion (cwF) module selectively merges diverse feature representations, significantly enhancing predictive accuracy. HAFormer achieves high performance with minimal computational overhead and compact model size, achieving 74.2% mIoU on Cityscapes and 71.1% mIoU on CamVid test datasets, with frame rates of 105FPS and 118FPS on a single 2080Ti GPU.

- **Summary**: Aliasing artifacts in renderings produced by Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a long-standing but complex issue in the field of 3D implicit representation, which arises from a multitude of intricate causes and was mitigated by designing more advanced but complex scene parameterization methods before. In this paper, we present a Diffusion-based restoration method for anti-aliasing Neural Radiance Field (Drantal-NeRF). We consider the anti-aliasing issue from a low-level restoration perspective by viewing aliasing artifacts as a kind of degradation model added to clean ground truths. By leveraging the powerful prior knowledge encapsulated in diffusion model, we could restore the high-realism anti-aliasing renderings conditioned on aliased low-quality counterparts. We further employ a feature-wrapping operation to ensure multi-view restoration consistency and finetune the VAE decoder to better adapt to the scene-specific data distribution. Our proposed method is easy to implement and agnostic to various NeRF backbones. We conduct extensive experiments on challenging large-scale urban scenes as well as unbounded 360-degree scenes and achieve substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements.

- **Summary**: Autonomous trucking is a promising technology that can greatly impact modern logistics and the environment. Ensuring its safety on public roads is one of the main duties that requires an accurate perception of the environment. To achieve this, machine learning methods rely on large datasets, but to this day, no such datasets are available for autonomous trucks. In this work, we present MAN TruckScenes, the first multimodal dataset for autonomous trucking. MAN TruckScenes allows the research community to come into contact with truck-specific challenges, such as trailer occlusions, novel sensor perspectives, and terminal environments for the first time. It comprises more than 740 scenes of 20 s each within a multitude of different environmental conditions. The sensor set includes 4 cameras, 6 lidar, 6 radar sensors, 2 IMUs, and a high-precision GNSS. The dataset's 3D bounding boxes were manually annotated and carefully reviewed to achieve a high quality standard. Bounding boxes are available for 27 object classes, 15 attributes, and a range of more than 230 m. The scenes are tagged according to 34 distinct scene tags, and all objects are tracked throughout the scene to promote a wide range of applications. Additionally, MAN TruckScenes is the first dataset to provide 4D radar data with 360{\deg} coverage and is thereby the largest radar dataset with annotated 3D bounding boxes. Finally, we provide extensive dataset analysis and baseline results. The dataset, development kit and more are available online.

- **Summary**: Generating semantically and temporally aligned audio content in accordance with video input has become a focal point for researchers, particularly following the remarkable breakthrough in text-to-video generation. In this work, we aim to offer insights into the video-to-audio generation paradigm, focusing on three crucial aspects: vision encoders, auxiliary embeddings, and data augmentation techniques. Beginning with a foundational model VTA-LDM built on a simple yet surprisingly effective intuition, we explore various vision encoders and auxiliary embeddings through ablation studies. Employing a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that emphasizes generation quality and video-audio synchronization alignment, we demonstrate that our model exhibits state-of-the-art video-to-audio generation capabilities. Furthermore, we provide critical insights into the impact of different data augmentation methods on enhancing the generation framework's overall capacity. We showcase possibilities to advance the challenge of generating synchronized audio from semantic and temporal perspectives. We hope these insights will serve as a stepping stone toward developing more realistic and accurate audio-visual generation models.

For example, in nuScenes, a substantial quantity of unpaired LiDAR and camera frames remain unutilized, limiting the representation capabilities of the pretrained network. 2) The contrastive loss erroneously distances points and image regions with identical semantics but from different frames, disturbing the semantic consistency of the learned presentations. In this paper, we propose a novel Vision-Foundation-Model-driven sample exploring module to meticulously select LiDAR-Image pairs from unexplored frames, enriching the original training set. We utilized timestamps and the semantic priors from VFMs to identify well-synchronized training pairs and to discover samples with diverse content. Moreover, we design a cross- and intra-modal conflict-aware contrastive loss using the semantic mask labels of VFMs to avoid contrasting semantically similar points and image regions. Our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art pretraining frameworks across three major public autonomous driving datasets: nuScenes, SemanticKITTI, and Waymo on 3D semantic segmentation by +3.0\%, +3.0\%, and +3.3\% in mIoU, respectively. Furthermore, our approach exhibits adaptable generalization to different 3D backbones and typical semantic masks generated by non-VFM models.

- **Summary**: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to learn sequential classes with limited samples in a few-shot fashion. Inherited from the classical class-incremental learning setting, the popular benchmark of FSCIL uses averaged accuracy (aAcc) and last-task averaged accuracy (lAcc) as the evaluation metrics. However, we reveal that such evaluation metrics may not provide adequate emphasis on the novel class performance, and the continual learning ability of FSCIL methods could be ignored under this benchmark. In this work, as a complement to existing metrics, we offer a new metric called generalized average accuracy (gAcc) which is designed to provide an extra equitable evaluation by incorporating different perspectives of the performance under the guidance of a parameter $\alpha$. We also present an overall metric in the form of the area under the curve (AUC) along the $\alpha$. Under the guidance of gAcc, we release the potential of intermediate features of the vision transformers to boost the novel-class performance. Taking information from intermediate layers which are less class-specific and more generalizable, we manage to rectify the final features, leading to a more generalizable transformer-based FSCIL framework. Without complex network designs or cumbersome training procedures, our method outperforms existing FSCIL methods at aAcc and gAcc on three datasets.

- **Summary**: Understanding the content of events occurring in the video and their inherent temporal logic is crucial for video-text retrieval. However, web-crawled pre-training datasets often lack sufficient event information, and the widely adopted video-level cross-modal contrastive learning also struggles to capture detailed and complex video-text event alignment. To address these challenges, we make improvements from both data and model perspectives. In terms of pre-training data, we focus on supplementing the missing specific event content and event temporal transitions with the proposed event augmentation strategies. Based on the event-augmented data, we construct a novel Event-Aware Video-Text Retrieval model, ie, EA-VTR, which achieves powerful video-text retrieval ability through superior video event awareness. EA-VTR can efficiently encode frame-level and video-level visual representations simultaneously, enabling detailed event content and complex event temporal cross-modal alignment, ultimately enhancing the comprehensive understanding of video events. Our method not only significantly outperforms existing approaches on multiple datasets for Text-to-Video Retrieval and Video Action Recognition tasks, but also demonstrates superior event content perceive ability on Multi-event Video-Text Retrieval and Video Moment Retrieval tasks, as well as outstanding event temporal logic understanding ability on Test of Time task.

- **Summary**: Dominant dual-encoder models enable efficient image-text retrieval but suffer from limited accuracy while the cross-encoder models offer higher accuracy at the expense of efficiency. Distilling cross-modality matching knowledge from cross-encoder to dual-encoder provides a natural approach to harness their strengths. Thus we investigate the following valuable question: how to make cross-encoder a good teacher for dual-encoder? Our findings are threefold:(1) Cross-modal similarity score distribution of cross-encoder is more concentrated while the result of dual-encoder is nearly normal making vanilla logit distillation less effective. However ranking distillation remains practical as it is not affected by the score distribution.(2) Only the relative order between hard negatives conveys valid knowledge while the order information between easy negatives has little significance.(3) Maintaining the coordination between distillation loss and dual-encoder training loss is beneficial for knowledge transfer. Based on these findings we propose a novel Contrastive Partial Ranking Distillation (CPRD) method which implements the objective of mimicking relative order between hard negative samples with contrastive learning. This approach coordinates with the training of the dual-encoder effectively transferring valid knowledge from the cross-encoder to the dual-encoder. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval and ranking tasks show that our method surpasses other distillation methods and significantly improves the accuracy of dual-encoder.

- **Summary**: Machine unlearning is a crucial area of research. It is driven by the need to remove sensitive information from models to safeguard individuals' right to be forgotten under rigorous regulations such as GDPR. In this work, we focus on unlearning within CLIP, a dual vision-language encoder model trained on a massive dataset of image-text pairs using contrastive loss. To achieve forgetting we expand the application of Lipschitz regularization to the multimodal context of CLIP. Specifically, we ensure the smoothing of both visual and textual embeddings associated with the class intended to be forgotten relative to the perturbation introduced to the samples from that class. Additionally, importantly, we remove the necessity for real forgetting data by generating synthetic samples through gradient ascent maximizing the target class. Our forgetting procedure is iterative, where we track accuracy on a synthetic forget set and stop when accuracy falls below a chosen threshold. We employ a selective layers update strategy based on their average absolute gradient value to mitigate over-forgetting. We validate our approach on several standard datasets and provide thorough ablation analysis and comparisons with previous work.

- **Summary**: Federated learning is one popular paradigm to train a joint model in a distributed, privacy-preserving environment. But partial annotations pose an obstacle meaning that categories of labels are heterogeneous over clients. We propose to learn a joint backbone in a federated manner, while each site receives its own multi-label segmentation head. By using Bayesian techniques we observe that the different segmentation heads although only trained on the individual client's labels also learn information about the other labels not present at the respective site. This information is encoded in their predictive uncertainty. To obtain a final prediction we leverage this uncertainty and perform a weighted averaging of the ensemble of distributed segmentation heads, which allows us to segment "locally unknown" structures. With our method, which we refer to as FUNAvg, we are even on-par with the models trained and tested on the same dataset on average. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Cardio-AI/FUNAvg.

- **Summary**: FungiCLEF 2024 addresses the fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) of fungi species, with a focus on identifying poisonous species. This task is challenging due to the size and class imbalance of the dataset, subtle inter-class variations, and significant intra-class variability amongst samples. In this paper, we document our approach in tackling this challenge through the use of ensemble classifier heads on pre-computed image embeddings. Our team (DS@GT) demonstrate that state-of-the-art self-supervised vision models can be utilized as robust feature extractors for downstream application of computer vision tasks without the need for task-specific fine-tuning on the vision backbone. Our approach achieved the best Track 3 score (0.345), accuracy (78.4%) and macro-F1 (0.577) on the private test set in post competition evaluation.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation of road elements in 2D images is a crucial task in the recognition of some static objects such as lane lines and free space. In this paper, we propose DHSNet,which extracts the objects features with a end-to-end architecture along with a heatmap proposal. Deformable convolutions are also utilized in the proposed network. The DHSNet finely combines low-level feature maps with high-level ones by using upsampling operators as well as downsampling operators in a U-shape manner. Besides, DHSNet also aims to capture static objects of various shapes and scales. We also predict a proposal heatmap to detect the proposal points for more accurate target aiming in the network.

- **Summary**: We explore the use of deep learning to localise galactic structures in low surface brightness (LSB) images. LSB imaging reveals many interesting structures, though these are frequently confused with galactic dust contamination, due to a strong local visual similarity. We propose a novel unified approach to multi-class segmentation of galactic structures and of extended amorphous image contaminants. Our panoptic segmentation model combines Mask R-CNN with a contaminant specialised network and utilises an adaptive preprocessing layer to better capture the subtle features of LSB images. Further, a human-in-the-loop training scheme is employed to augment ground truth labels. These different approaches are evaluated in turn, and together greatly improve the detection of both galactic structures and contaminants in LSB images.

- **Summary**: Shortwave-infrared(SWIR) spectral information,ranging from 1 {\mu}m to 2.5{\mu}m, breaks the limitations of traditional color cameras in acquiring scene information and has been used in many fields. However, conventional SWIR hyperspectral imaging systems face challenges due to their bulky setups and low acquisition speed. In this work, we introduce a snapshot SWIR hyperspectral imaging system based on a metasurface filter and a corresponding filter selection method to achieve the lowest correlation coefficient among these filters.This systemhas the advantages of small size and snapshot imaging. We propose a novel inter and intra prior learning unfolding framework proposed to achieve high-quality SWIR hyperspectral image reconstruction, which bridges the gap between prior learning and cross-stage information interaction. We also design an adaptive feature transfer mechanism to adaptively the transfer contextual correlation of multi-scale encoder features to prevent detailed information loss in the decoder. Experiment results demonstrate that our method can reconstruct HSI with high speed and superior performance over existing methods.

- **Summary**: Large-scale pre-training models have promoted the development of histopathology image analysis. However, existing self-supervised methods for histopathology images focus on learning patch features, while there is still a lack of available pre-training models for WSI-level feature learning. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework for pan-cancer WSI-level representation pre-training with the designed position-aware masked autoencoder (PAMA). Meanwhile, we propose the position-aware cross-attention (PACA) module with a kernel reorientation (KRO) strategy and an anchor dropout (AD) mechanism. The KRO strategy can capture the complete semantic structure and eliminate ambiguity in WSIs, and the AD contributes to enhancing the robustness and generalization of the model. We evaluated our method on 6 large-scale datasets from multiple organs for pan-cancer classification tasks. The results have demonstrated the effectiveness of PAMA in generalized and discriminative WSI representation learning and pan-cancer WSI pre-training. The proposed method was also compared with \R{7} WSI analysis methods. The experimental results have indicated that our proposed PAMA is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.The code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/WkEEn/PAMA.

- **Summary**: Camera-based computer vision is essential to autonomous vehicle's perception. This paper presents an attack that uses light-emitting diodes and exploits the camera's rolling shutter effect to create adversarial stripes in the captured images to mislead traffic sign recognition. The attack is stealthy because the stripes on the traffic sign are invisible to human. For the attack to be threatening, the recognition results need to be stable over consecutive image frames. To achieve this, we design and implement GhostStripe, an attack system that controls the timing of the modulated light emission to adapt to camera operations and victim vehicle movements. Evaluated on real testbeds, GhostStripe can stably spoof the traffic sign recognition results for up to 94\% of frames to a wrong class when the victim vehicle passes the road section. In reality, such attack effect may fool victim vehicles into life-threatening incidents. We discuss the countermeasures at the levels of camera sensor, perception model, and autonomous driving system.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly enhanced medical image segmentation by facilitating the learning of global relationships. However, these methods face a notable challenge in capturing diverse local and global long-range sequential feature representations, particularly evident in whole-body CT (WBCT) scans. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Swin Soft Mixture Transformer (Swin SMT), a novel architecture based on Swin UNETR. This model incorporates a Soft Mixture-of-Experts (Soft MoE) to effectively handle complex and diverse long-range dependencies. The use of Soft MoE allows for scaling up model parameters maintaining a balance between computational complexity and segmentation performance in both training and inference modes. We evaluate Swin SMT on the publicly available TotalSegmentator-V2 dataset, which includes 117 major anatomical structures in WBCT images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that Swin SMT outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in 3D anatomical structure segmentation, achieving an average Dice Similarity Coefficient of 85.09%. The code and pre-trained weights of Swin SMT are publicly available at https://github.com/MI2DataLab/SwinSMT.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved significant advancement in computer vision tasks due to their powerful modeling capacity. However, their performance notably degrades when trained with insufficient data due to lack of inherent inductive biases. Distilling knowledge and inductive biases from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) teacher has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the generalization of ViTs on limited datasets. Previous approaches to Knowledge Distillation (KD) have pursued two primary paths: some focused solely on distilling the logit distribution from CNN teacher to ViT student, neglecting the rich semantic information present in intermediate features due to the structural differences between them. Others integrated feature distillation along with logit distillation, yet this introduced alignment operations that limits the amount of knowledge transferred due to mismatched architectures and increased the computational overhead. To this end, this paper presents Hybrid Data-efficient Knowledge Distillation (HDKD) paradigm which employs a CNN teacher and a hybrid student. The choice of hybrid student serves two main aspects. First, it leverages the strengths of both convolutions and transformers while sharing the convolutional structure with the teacher model. Second, this shared structure enables the direct application of feature distillation without any information loss or additional computational overhead. Additionally, we propose an efficient light-weight convolutional block named Mobile Channel-Spatial Attention (MBCSA), which serves as the primary convolutional block in both teacher and student models. Extensive experiments on two medical public datasets showcase the superiority of HDKD over other state-of-the-art models and its computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: Reducing scan time in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging while maintaining high-quality images is crucial for minimizing patient discomfort and radiation exposure. Due to the limited size of datasets and distribution discrepancy across scanners in medical imaging, fine-tuning in a parameter-efficient and effective manner is on the rise. Motivated by the potential of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), we aim to address these issues by effectively leveraging PEFT to improve limited data and GPU resource issues in multi-scanner setups. In this paper, we introduce PETITE, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for MultI-scanner PET to PET REconstruction that uses fewer than 1% of the parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to systematically explore the efficacy of diverse PEFT techniques in medical imaging reconstruction tasks via prevalent encoder-decoder-type deep models. This investigation, in particular, brings intriguing insights into PETITE as we show further improvements by treating encoder and decoder separately and mixing different PEFT methods, namely, Mix-PEFT. Using multi-scanner PET datasets comprised of five different scanners, we extensively test the cross-scanner PET scan time reduction performances (i.e., a model pre-trained on one scanner is fine-tuned on a different scanner) of 21 feasible Mix-PEFT combinations to derive optimal PETITE. We show that training with less than 1% parameters using PETITE performs on par with full fine-tuning (i.e., 100% parameter)

- **Summary**: Multi-modal crowd counting involves estimating crowd density from both visual and thermal/depth images. This task is challenging due to the significant gap between these distinct modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach by introducing an auxiliary broker modality and on this basis frame the task as a triple-modal learning problem. We devise a fusion-based method to generate this broker modality, leveraging a non-diffusion, lightweight counterpart of modern denoising diffusion-based fusion models. Additionally, we identify and address the ghosting effect caused by direct cross-modal image fusion in multi-modal crowd counting. Through extensive experimental evaluations on popular multi-modal crowd-counting datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which introduces only 4 million additional parameters, yet achieves promising results.

- **Summary**: The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a significant advancement in natural image segmentation, exhibiting potent zero-shot performance suitable for various downstream image segmentation tasks. However, directly utilizing the pretrained SAM for Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) task falls short in achieving satisfying performance due to a notable domain gap between natural and infrared images. Unlike a visible light camera, a thermal imager reveals an object's temperature distribution by capturing infrared radiation. Small targets often show a subtle temperature transition at the object's boundaries. To address this issue, we propose the IRSAM model for IRSTD, which improves SAM's encoder-decoder architecture to learn better feature representation of infrared small objects. Specifically, we design a Perona-Malik diffusion (PMD)-based block and incorporate it into multiple levels of SAM's encoder to help it capture essential structural features while suppressing noise. Additionally, we devise a Granularity-Aware Decoder (GAD) to fuse the multi-granularity feature from the encoder to capture structural information that may be lost in long-distance modeling. Extensive experiments on the public datasets, including NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K, validate the design choice of IRSAM and its significant superiority over representative state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) has emerged as a flourishing research field for adapting large pre-trained models to downstream tasks, greatly reducing trainable parameters while grappling with memory challenges during fine-tuning. To address it, memory-efficient series (METL) avoid backpropagating gradients through the large backbone. However, they compromise by exclusively relying on frozen intermediate outputs and limiting the exhaustive exploration of prior knowledge from pre-trained models. Moreover, the dependency and redundancy between cross-layer features are frequently overlooked, thereby submerging more discriminative representations and causing an inherent performance gap (vs. conventional PETL methods). Hence, we propose an innovative METL strategy called SHERL for resource-limited scenarios to decouple the entire adaptation into two successive and complementary processes. In the early route, intermediate outputs are consolidated via an anti-redundancy operation, enhancing their compatibility for subsequent interactions; thereby in the late route, utilizing minimal late pre-trained layers could alleviate the peak demand on memory overhead and regulate these fairly flexible features into more adaptive and powerful representations for new domains. Extensive ablations on vision-and-language and language-only tasks show that SHERL combines the strengths of both parameter and memory-efficient techniques, performing on-par or better across diverse architectures with lower memory during fine-tuning.

- **Summary**: Multiview point cloud registration serves as a cornerstone of various computer vision tasks. Previous approaches typically adhere to a global paradigm, where a pose graph is initially constructed followed by motion synchronization to determine the absolute pose. However, this separated approach may not fully leverage the characteristics of multiview registration and might struggle with low-overlap scenarios. In this paper, we propose an incremental multiview point cloud registration method that progressively registers all scans to a growing meta-shape. To determine the incremental ordering, we employ a two-stage coarse-to-fine strategy for point cloud candidate retrieval. The first stage involves the coarse selection of scans based on neighbor fusion-enhanced global aggregation features, while the second stage further reranks candidates through geometric-based matching. Additionally, we apply a transformation averaging technique to mitigate accumulated errors during the registration process. Finally, we utilize a Reservoir sampling-based technique to address density variance issues while reducing computational load. Comprehensive experimental results across various benchmarks validate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach.

- **Summary**: In recent years, various methods and benchmarks have been proposed to empirically evaluate the alignment of artificial neural networks to human neural and behavioral data. But how aligned are different alignment metrics? To answer this question, we analyze visual data from Brain-Score (Schrimpf et al., 2018), including metrics from the model-vs-human toolbox (Geirhos et al., 2021), together with human feature alignment (Linsley et al., 2018; Fel et al., 2022) and human similarity judgements (Muttenthaler et al., 2022). We find that pairwise correlations between neural scores and behavioral scores are quite low and sometimes even negative. For instance, the average correlation between those 80 models on Brain-Score that were fully evaluated on all 69 alignment metrics we considered is only 0.198. Assuming that all of the employed metrics are sound, this implies that alignment with human perception may best be thought of as a multidimensional concept, with different methods measuring fundamentally different aspects. Our results underline the importance of integrative benchmarking, but also raise questions about how to correctly combine and aggregate individual metrics. Aggregating by taking the arithmetic average, as done in Brain-Score, leads to the overall performance currently being dominated by behavior (95.25% explained variance) while the neural predictivity plays a less important role (only 33.33% explained variance). As a first step towards making sure that different alignment metrics all contribute fairly towards an integrative benchmark score, we therefore conclude by comparing three different aggregation options.

- **Summary**: With the explosive growth of available training data, single-image 3D human modeling is ahead of a transition to a data-centric paradigm. A key to successfully exploiting data scale is to design flexible models that can be supervised from various heterogeneous data sources produced by different researchers or vendors. To this end, we propose a simple yet powerful paradigm for seamlessly unifying different human pose and shape-related tasks and datasets. Our formulation is centered on the ability - both at training and test time - to query any arbitrary point of the human volume, and obtain its estimated location in 3D. We achieve this by learning a continuous neural field of body point localizer functions, each of which is a differently parameterized 3D heatmap-based convolutional point localizer (detector). For generating parametric output, we propose an efficient post-processing step for fitting SMPL-family body models to nonparametric joint and vertex predictions. With this approach, we can naturally exploit differently annotated data sources including mesh, 2D/3D skeleton and dense pose, without having to convert between them, and thereby train large-scale 3D human mesh and skeleton estimation models that outperform the state-of-the-art on several public benchmarks including 3DPW, EMDB and SSP-3D by a considerable margin.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a character-based approach for enhancing writer retrieval performance in the context of Greek papyri. Our contribution lies in introducing character-level annotations for frequently used characters, in our case the trigram kai and four additional letters (epsilon, kappa, mu, omega), in Greek texts. We use a state-of-the-art writer retrieval approach based on NetVLAD and compare a character-level-based feature aggregation method against the current default baseline of using small patches located at SIFT keypoint locations for building the page descriptors. We demonstrate that by using only about 15 characters per page, we are able to boost the performance up to 4% mAP (a relative improvement of 11%) on the GRK-120 dataset. Additionally, our qualitative analysis offers insights into the similarity scores of SIFT patches and specific characters. We publish the dataset with character-level annotations, including a quality label and our binarized images for further research.

- **Summary**: Machine unlearning is the process of removing the impact of a particular set of training samples from a pretrained model. It aims to fulfill the "right to be forgotten", which grants the individuals such as patients the right to reconsider their contribution in models including medical imaging models. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness (performance) and computational efficiency of different unlearning algorithms in medical imaging domain. Our evaluations demonstrate that the considered unlearning algorithms perform well on the retain set (samples whose influence on the model is allowed to be retained) and forget set (samples whose contribution to the model should be eliminated), and show no bias against male or female samples. They, however, adversely impact the generalization of the model, especially for larger forget set sizes. Moreover, they might be biased against easy or hard samples, and need additional computational overhead for hyper-parameter tuning. In conclusion, machine unlearning seems promising for medical imaging, but the existing unlearning algorithms still needs further improvements to become more practical for medical applications.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address a recent trend in robotic home appliances to include vision systems on personal devices, capable of personalizing the appliances on the fly. In particular, we formulate and address an important technical task of personal object search, which involves localization and identification of personal items of interest on images captured by robotic appliances, with each item referenced only by a few annotated images. The task is crucial for robotic home appliances and mobile systems, which need to process personal visual scenes or to operate with particular personal objects (e.g., for grasping or navigation). In practice, personal object search presents two main technical challenges. First, a robot vision system needs to be able to distinguish between many fine-grained classes, in the presence of occlusions and clutter. Second, the strict resource requirements for the on-device system restrict the usage of most state-of-the-art methods for few-shot learning and often prevent on-device adaptation. In this work, we propose Swiss DINO: a simple yet effective framework for one-shot personal object search based on the recent DINOv2 transformer model, which was shown to have strong zero-shot generalization properties. Swiss DINO handles challenging on-device personalized scene understanding requirements and does not require any adaptation training. We show significant improvement (up to 55%) in segmentation and recognition accuracy compared to the common lightweight solutions, and significant footprint reduction of backbone inference time (up to 100x) and GPU consumption (up to 10x) compared to the heavy transformer-based solutions.



### Disentangling Masked Autoencoders for Unsupervised Domain Generalization

- **Summary**: Domain Generalization (DG), designed to enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, is all about learning invariance against domain shifts utilizing sufficient supervision signals. Yet, the scarcity of such labeled data has led to the rise of unsupervised domain generalization (UDG) - a more important yet challenging task in that models are trained across diverse domains in an unsupervised manner and eventually tested on unseen domains. UDG is fast gaining attention but is still far from well-studied. To close the research gap, we propose a novel learning framework designed for UDG, termed the Disentangled Masked Auto Encoder (DisMAE), aiming to discover the disentangled representations that faithfully reveal the intrinsic features and superficial variations without access to the class label. At its core is the distillation of domain-invariant semantic features, which cannot be distinguished by domain classifier, while filtering out the domain-specific variations (for example, color schemes and texture patterns) that are unstable and redundant. Notably, DisMAE co-trains the asymmetric dual-branch architecture with semantic and lightweight variation encoders, offering dynamic data manipulation and representation level augmentation capabilities. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (i.e., DomainNet, PACS, VLCS, Colored MNIST) with both DG and UDG tasks demonstrate that DisMAE can achieve competitive OOD performance compared with the state-of-the-art DG and UDG baselines, which shed light on potential research line in improving the generalization ability with large-scale unlabeled data.

- **Summary**: Federated learning (FL) is a renowned technique for utilizing decentralized data while preserving privacy. However, real-world applications often involve inherent challenges such as partially labeled datasets, where not all clients possess expert annotations of all labels of interest, leaving large portions of unlabeled data unused. In this study, we conduct the largest federated cardiac CT imaging analysis to date, focusing on partially labeled datasets ($n=8,124$) of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) patients over eight hospital clients. Transformer architectures, which are the major building blocks of current foundation models, have shown superior performance when trained on larger cohorts than traditional CNNs. However, when trained on small task-specific labeled sample sizes, it is currently not feasible to exploit their underlying attention mechanism for improved performance. Therefore, we developed a two-stage semi-supervised learning strategy that distills knowledge from several task-specific CNNs (landmark detection and segmentation of calcification) into a single transformer model by utilizing large amounts of unlabeled data typically residing unused in hospitals to mitigate these issues. This method not only improves the predictive accuracy and generalizability of transformer-based architectures but also facilitates the simultaneous learning of all partial labels within a single transformer model across the federation. Additionally, we show that our transformer-based model extracts more meaningful features for further downstream tasks than the UNet-based one by only training the last layer to also solve segmentation of coronary arteries. We make the code and weights of the final model openly available, which can serve as a foundation model for further research in cardiac CT imaging.

- **Summary**: Nonlinear activation functions are pivotal to the success of deep neural nets, and choosing the appropriate activation function can significantly affect their performance. Most networks use fixed activation functions (e.g., ReLU, GELU, etc.), and this choice might limit their expressiveness. Furthermore, different layers may benefit from diverse activation functions. Consequently, there has been a growing interest in trainable activation functions. In this paper, we introduce DiTAC, a trainable highly-expressive activation function based on an efficient diffeomorphic transformation (called CPAB). Despite introducing only a negligible number of trainable parameters, DiTAC enhances model expressiveness and performance, often yielding substantial improvements. It also outperforms existing activation functions (regardless whether the latter are fixed or trainable) in tasks such as semantic segmentation, image generation, regression problems, and image classification.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of Large Vision-Language models (LVLMs) has demonstrated a spectrum of emergent capabilities. Nevertheless, current models only focus on the visual content of a single scenario, while their ability to associate instances across different scenes has not yet been explored, which is essential for understanding complex visual content, such as movies with multiple characters and intricate plots. Towards movie understanding, a critical initial step for LVLMs is to unleash the potential of character identities memory and recognition across multiple visual scenarios. To achieve the goal, we propose visual instruction tuning with ID reference and develop an ID-Aware Large Vision-Language Model, IDA-VLM. Furthermore, our research introduces a novel benchmark MM-ID, to examine LVLMs on instance IDs memory and recognition across four dimensions: matching, location, question-answering, and captioning. Our findings highlight the limitations of existing LVLMs in recognizing and associating instance identities with ID reference. This paper paves the way for future artificial intelligence systems to possess multi-identity visual inputs, thereby facilitating the comprehension of complex visual narratives like movies.

- **Summary**: Comprehending natural language instructions is a charming property for both 2D and 3D layout synthesis systems. Existing methods implicitly model object joint distributions and express object relations, hindering generation's controllability. We introduce InstructLayout, a novel generative framework that integrates a semantic graph prior and a layout decoder to improve controllability and fidelity for 2D and 3D layout synthesis. The proposed semantic graph prior learns layout appearances and object distributions simultaneously, demonstrating versatility across various downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner. To facilitate the benchmarking for text-driven 2D and 3D scene synthesis, we respectively curate two high-quality datasets of layout-instruction pairs from public Internet resources with large language and multimodal models. Extensive experimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in both 2D and 3D layout synthesis tasks. Thorough ablation studies confirm the efficacy of crucial design components.

- **Summary**: Images and structured tables are essential parts of real-world databases. Though tabular-image representation learning is promising to create new insights, it remains a challenging task, as tabular data is typically heterogeneous and incomplete, presenting significant modality disparities with images. Earlier works have mainly focused on simple modality fusion strategies in complete data scenarios, without considering the missing data issue, and thus are limited in practice. In this paper, we propose TIP, a novel tabular-image pre-training framework for learning multimodal representations robust to incomplete tabular data. Specifically, TIP investigates a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy, including a masked tabular reconstruction task for tackling data missingness, and image-tabular matching and contrastive learning objectives to capture multimodal information. Moreover, TIP proposes a versatile tabular encoder tailored for incomplete, heterogeneous tabular data and a multimodal interaction module for inter-modality representation learning. Experiments are performed on downstream multimodal classification tasks using both natural and medical image datasets. The results show that TIP outperforms state-of-the-art supervised/SSL image/multimodal algorithms in both complete and incomplete data scenarios.

- **Summary**: This paper focuses on source-free domain adaptation for object detection in computer vision. This task is challenging and of great practical interest, due to the cost of obtaining annotated data sets for every new domain. Recent research has proposed various solutions for Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD), most being variations of teacher-student architectures with diverse feature alignment, regularization and pseudo-label selection strategies. Our work investigates simpler approaches and their performance compared to more complex SFOD methods in several adaptation scenarios. We highlight the importance of batch normalization layers in the detector backbone, and show that adapting only the batch statistics is a strong baseline for SFOD. We propose a simple extension of a Mean Teacher with strong-weak augmentation in the source-free setting, Source-Free Unbiased Teacher (SF-UT), and show that it actually outperforms most of the previous SFOD methods. Additionally, we showcase that an even simpler strategy consisting in training on a fixed set of pseudo-labels can achieve similar performance to the more complex teacher-student mutual learning, while being computationally efficient and mitigating the major issue of teacher-student collapse. We conduct experiments on several adaptation tasks using benchmark driving datasets including (Foggy)Cityscapes, Sim10k and KITTI, and achieve a notable improvement of 4.7\% AP50 on Cityscapes$\rightarrow$Foggy-Cityscapes compared with the latest state-of-the-art in SFOD.

This paper introduces Let Occ Flow, the first self-supervised work for joint 3D occupancy and occupancy flow prediction using only camera inputs, eliminating the need for 3D annotations. Utilizing TPV for unified scene representation and deformable attention layers for feature aggregation, our approach incorporates a backward-forward temporal attention module to capture dynamic object dependencies, followed by a 3D refine module for fine-gained volumetric representation. Besides, our method extends differentiable rendering to 3D volumetric flow fields, leveraging zero-shot 2D segmentation and optical flow cues for dynamic decomposition and motion optimization. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our approach over prior state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The recent emergence of hybrid models has introduced another transformative approach to solving computer vision tasks, slowly shifting away from conventional CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and ViT (Vision Transformer). However, not enough effort has been made to efficiently combine these two approaches to improve capturing long-range dependencies prevalent in complex images. In this paper, we introduce iiANET (Inception Inspired Attention Network), an efficient hybrid model designed to capture long-range dependencies in complex images. The fundamental building block, iiABlock, integrates global 2D-MHSA (Multi-Head Self-Attention) with Registers, MBConv2 (MobileNetV2-based convolution), and dilated convolution in parallel, enabling the model to adeptly leverage self-attention for capturing long-range dependencies while utilizing MBConv2 for effective local-detail extraction and dilated convolution for efficiently expanding the kernel receptive field to capture more contextual information. Lastly, we serially integrate an ECANET (Efficient Channel Attention Network) at the end of each iiABlock to calibrate channel-wise attention for enhanced model performance. Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparative evaluation on various benchmarks demonstrates improved performance over some state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: Occlusal contacts are the locations at which the occluding surfaces of the maxilla and the mandible posterior teeth meet. Occlusal contact detection is a vital tool for restoring the loss of masticatory function and is a mandatory assessment in the field of dentistry, with particular importance in prosthodontics and restorative dentistry. The most common method for occlusal contact detection is articulating paper. However, this method can indicate significant medically false positive and medically false negative contact areas, leaving the identification of true occlusal indications to clinicians. To address this, we propose a multiclass Vision Transformer and Fully Convolutional Network ensemble semantic segmentation model with a combination hierarchical loss function, which we name as Hierarchical Fully Convolutional Branch Transformer (H-FCBFormer). We also propose a method of generating medically true positive semantic segmentation masks derived from expert annotated articulating paper masks and gold standard masks. The proposed model outperforms other machine learning methods evaluated at detecting medically true positive contacts and performs better than dentists in terms of accurately identifying object-wise occlusal contact areas while taking significantly less time to identify them.

The current approach to wound assessment by therapists based on photographic documentation is subjective, highlighting the need for computer-aided wound recognition from smartphone photos. This offers objective and convenient therapy monitoring, while being accessible to patients from their home at any time. However, despite research in mobile image segmentation, there is a lack of focus on mobile wound segmentation. To address this gap, we conduct initial research on three lightweight architectures to investigate their suitability for smartphone-based wound segmentation. Using public datasets and UNet as a baseline, our results are promising, with both ENet and TopFormer, as well as the larger UNeXt variant, showing comparable performance to UNet. Furthermore, we deploy the models into a smartphone app for visual assessment of live segmentation, where results demonstrate the effectiveness of TopFormer in distinguishing wounds from wound-coloured objects. While our study highlights the potential of transformer models for mobile wound segmentation, future work should aim to further improve the mask contours.

- **Summary**: Auto-regressive models have made significant progress in the realm of language generation, yet they do not perform on par with diffusion models in the domain of image synthesis. In this work, we introduce MARS, a novel framework for T2I generation that incorporates a specially designed Semantic Vision-Language Integration Expert (SemVIE). This innovative component integrates pre-trained LLMs by independently processing linguistic and visual information, freezing the textual component while fine-tuning the visual component. This methodology preserves the NLP capabilities of LLMs while imbuing them with exceptional visual understanding. Building upon the powerful base of the pre-trained Qwen-7B, MARS stands out with its bilingual generative capabilities corresponding to both English and Chinese language prompts and the capacity for joint image and text generation. The flexibility of this framework lends itself to migration towards any-to-any task adaptability. Furthermore, MARS employs a multi-stage training strategy that first establishes robust image-text alignment through complementary bidirectional tasks and subsequently concentrates on refining the T2I generation process, significantly augmenting text-image synchrony and the granularity of image details. Notably, MARS requires only 9% of the GPU days needed by SD1.5, yet it achieves remarkable results across a variety of benchmarks, illustrating the training efficiency and the potential for swift deployment in various applications.

- **Summary**: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in monitoring changes happening on Earth's surface and aiding in climate analysis, ecosystem assessment, and disaster response. In this paper, we tackle semantic change detection with satellite image time series (SITS-SCD) which encompasses both change detection and semantic segmentation tasks. We propose a new architecture that improves over the state of the art, scales better with the number of parameters, and leverages long-term temporal information. However, for practical use cases, models need to adapt to spatial and temporal shifts, which remains a challenge. We investigate the impact of temporal and spatial shifts separately on global, multi-year SITS datasets using DynamicEarthNet and MUDS. We show that the spatial domain shift represents the most complex setting and that the impact of temporal shift on performance is more pronounced on change detection than on semantic segmentation, highlighting that it is a specific issue deserving further attention.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we investigate the potential of image-to-image translation (I2I) techniques for transferring realism to 3D-rendered facial images in the context of Face Recognition (FR) systems. The primary motivation for using 3D-rendered facial images lies in their ability to circumvent the challenges associated with collecting large real face datasets for training FR systems. These images are generated entirely by 3D rendering engines, facilitating the generation of synthetic identities. However, it has been observed that FR systems trained on such synthetic datasets underperform when compared to those trained on real datasets, on various FR benchmarks. In this work, we demonstrate that by transferring the realism to 3D-rendered images (i.e., making the 3D-rendered images look more real), we can boost the performance of FR systems trained on these more photorealistic images. This improvement is evident when these systems are evaluated against FR benchmarks utilizing real-world data, thereby paving new pathways for employing synthetic data in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: In recent years, numerous domain adaptive strategies have been proposed to help deep learning models overcome the challenges posed by domain shift. However, even unsupervised domain adaptive strategies still require a large amount of target data. Medical imaging datasets are often characterized by class imbalance and scarcity of labeled and unlabeled data. Few-shot domain adaptive object detection (FSDAOD) addresses the challenge of adapting object detectors to target domains with limited labeled data. Existing works struggle with randomly selected target domain images that may not accurately represent the real population, resulting in overfitting to small validation sets and poor generalization to larger test sets. Medical datasets exhibit high class imbalance and background similarity, leading to increased false positives and lower mean Average Precision (map) in target domains. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel FSDAOD strategy for microscopic imaging. Our contributions include a domain adaptive class balancing strategy for few-shot scenarios, multi-layer instance-level inter and intra-domain alignment to enhance similarity between class instances regardless of domain, and an instance-level classification loss applied in the middle layers of the object detector to enforce feature retention necessary for correct classification across domains. Extensive experimental results with competitive baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results on two public microscopic datasets.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) can learn high-quality representations from a large-scale training dataset of image-text pairs. Prompt learning is a popular approach to fine-tuning VLM to adapt them to downstream tasks. Despite the satisfying performance, a major limitation of prompt learning is the demand for labelled data. In real-world scenarios, we may only obtain candidate labels (where the true label is included) instead of the true labels due to data privacy or sensitivity issues. In this paper, we provide the first study on prompt learning with candidate labels for VLMs. We empirically demonstrate that prompt learning is more advantageous than other fine-tuning methods, for handling candidate labels. Nonetheless, its performance drops when the label ambiguity increases. In order to improve its robustness, we propose a simple yet effective framework that better leverages the prior knowledge of VLMs to guide the learning process with candidate labels. Specifically, our framework disambiguates candidate labels by aligning the model output with the mixed class posterior jointly predicted by both the learnable and the handcrafted prompt. Besides, our framework can be equipped with various off-the-shelf training objectives for learning with candidate labels to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

- **Summary**: Medical image synthesis remains challenging due to misalignment noise during training. Existing methods have attempted to address this challenge by incorporating a registration-guided module. However, these methods tend to overlook the task-specific constraints on the synthetic and registration modules, which may cause the synthetic module to still generate spatially aligned images with misaligned target images during training, regardless of the registration module's function. Therefore, this paper proposes registration-guided consistency and incorporates disentanglement learning for medical image synthesis. The proposed registration-guided consistency architecture fosters task-specificity within the synthetic and registration modules by applying identical deformation fields before and after synthesis, while enforcing output consistency through an alignment loss. Moreover, the synthetic module is designed to possess the capability of disentangling anatomical structures and specific styles across various modalities. An anatomy consistency loss is introduced to further compel the synthetic module to preserve geometrical integrity within latent spaces. Experiments conducted on both an in-house abdominal CECT-CT dataset and a publicly available pelvic MR-CT dataset have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Backdoor attacks compromise the integrity and reliability of machine learning models by embedding a hidden trigger during the training process, which can later be activated to cause unintended misbehavior. We propose a novel backdoor mitigation approach via machine unlearning to counter such backdoor attacks. The proposed method utilizes model activation of domain-equivalent unseen data to guide the editing of the model's weights. Unlike the previous unlearning-based mitigation methods, ours is computationally inexpensive and achieves state-of-the-art performance while only requiring a handful of unseen samples for unlearning. In addition, we also point out that unlearning the backdoor may cause the whole targeted class to be unlearned, thus introducing an additional repair step to preserve the model's utility after editing the model. Experiment results show that the proposed method is effective in unlearning the backdoor on different datasets and trigger patterns.

- **Summary**: Hyperspherical Prototypical Learning (HPL) is a supervised approach to representation learning that designs class prototypes on the unit hypersphere. The prototypes bias the representations to class separation in a scale invariant and known geometry. Previous approaches to HPL have either of the following shortcomings: (i) they follow an unprincipled optimisation procedure; or (ii) they are theoretically sound, but are constrained to only one possible latent dimension. In this paper, we address both shortcomings. To address (i), we present a principled optimisation procedure whose solution we show is optimal. To address (ii), we construct well-separated prototypes in a wide range of dimensions using linear block codes. Additionally, we give a full characterisation of the optimal prototype placement in terms of achievable and converse bounds, showing that our proposed methods are near-optimal.

- **Summary**: We present VEnhancer, a generative space-time enhancement framework that improves the existing text-to-video results by adding more details in spatial domain and synthetic detailed motion in temporal domain. Given a generated low-quality video, our approach can increase its spatial and temporal resolution simultaneously with arbitrary up-sampling space and time scales through a unified video diffusion model. Furthermore, VEnhancer effectively removes generated spatial artifacts and temporal flickering of generated videos. To achieve this, basing on a pretrained video diffusion model, we train a video ControlNet and inject it to the diffusion model as a condition on low frame-rate and low-resolution videos. To effectively train this video ControlNet, we design space-time data augmentation as well as video-aware conditioning. Benefiting from the above designs, VEnhancer yields to be stable during training and shares an elegant end-to-end training manner. Extensive experiments show that VEnhancer surpasses existing state-of-the-art video super-resolution and space-time super-resolution methods in enhancing AI-generated videos. Moreover, with VEnhancer, exisiting open-source state-of-the-art text-to-video method, VideoCrafter-2, reaches the top one in video generation benchmark -- VBench.

- **Summary**: Alleviating noisy pseudo labels remains a key challenge in Semi-Supervised Temporal Action Localization (SS-TAL). Existing methods often filter pseudo labels based on strict conditions, but they typically assess classification and localization quality separately, leading to suboptimal pseudo-label ranking and selection. In particular, there might be inaccurate pseudo labels within selected positives, alongside reliable counterparts erroneously assigned to negatives. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Adaptive Pseudo-label Learning (APL) framework to facilitate better pseudo-label selection. Specifically, to improve the ranking quality, Adaptive Label Quality Assessment (ALQA) is proposed to jointly learn classification confidence and localization reliability, followed by dynamically selecting pseudo labels based on the joint score. Additionally, we propose an Instance-level Consistency Discriminator (ICD) for eliminating ambiguous positives and mining potential positives simultaneously based on inter-instance intrinsic consistency, thereby leading to a more precise selection. We further introduce a general unsupervised Action-aware Contrastive Pre-training (ACP) to enhance the discrimination both within actions and between actions and backgrounds, which benefits SS-TAL. Extensive experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3 demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under various semi-supervised settings.

- **Summary**: Early detection and accurate diagnosis can predict the risk of malignant disease transformation, thereby increasing the probability of effective treatment. A mild syndrome with small infected regions is an ominous warning and is foremost in the early diagnosis of diseases. Deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been used to segment natural or medical objects, showing promising results. However, analyzing medical objects of small areas in images remains a challenge due to information losses and compression defects caused by convolution and pooling operations in CNNs. These losses and defects become increasingly significant as the network deepens, particularly for small medical objects. To address these challenges, we propose a novel scale-variant attention-based network (SvANet) for accurate small-scale object segmentation in medical images. The SvANet consists of Monte Carlo attention, scale-variant attention, and vision transformer, which incorporates cross-scale features and alleviates compression artifacts for enhancing the discrimination of small medical objects. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of SvANet, achieving 96.12%, 96.11%, 89.79%, 84.15%, 80.25%, 73.05%, and 72.58% in mean Dice coefficient for segmenting kidney tumors, skin lesions, hepatic tumors, polyps, surgical excision cells, retinal vasculatures, and sperms, which occupy less than 1% of the image areas in KiTS23, ISIC 2018, ATLAS, PolypGen, TissueNet, FIVES, and SpermHealth datasets, respectively.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have become a key method for 3D scene representation. With the rising prominence and influence of NeRF, safeguarding its intellectual property has become increasingly important. In this paper, we propose \textbf{NeRFProtector}, which adopts a plug-and-play strategy to protect NeRF's copyright during its creation. NeRFProtector utilizes a pre-trained watermarking base model, enabling NeRF creators to embed binary messages directly while creating their NeRF. Our plug-and-play property ensures NeRF creators can flexibly choose NeRF variants without excessive modifications. Leveraging our newly designed progressive distillation, we demonstrate performance on par with several leading-edge neural rendering methods.

- **Summary**: Comprehensive perception of the vehicle's environment and correct interpretation of the environment are crucial for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. The perception of surrounding objects is the main component for further tasks such as trajectory planning. However, safe trajectory planning requires not only object detection, but also the detection of drivable areas and lane corridors. While first approaches consider an advanced safety evaluation of object detection, the evaluation of lane detection still lacks sufficient safety metrics. Similar to the safety metrics for object detection, additional factors such as the semantics of the scene with road type and road width, the detection range as well as the potential causes of missing detections, incorporated by vehicle speed, should be considered for the evaluation of lane detection. Therefore, we propose the Lane Safety Metric (LSM), which takes these factors into account and allows to evaluate the safety of lane detection systems by determining an easily interpretable safety score. We evaluate our offline safety metric on various virtual scenarios using different lane detection approaches and compare it with state-of-the-art performance metrics.

- **Summary**: Neural surfaces (e.g., neural map encoding, deep implicits and neural radiance fields) have recently gained popularity because of their generic structure (e.g., multi-layer perceptron) and easy integration with modern learning-based setups. Traditionally, we have a rich toolbox of geometry processing algorithms designed for polygonal meshes to analyze and operate on surface geometry. However, neural representations are typically discretized and converted into a mesh, before applying any geometry processing algorithm. This is unsatisfactory and, as we demonstrate, unnecessary. In this work, we propose a spherical neural surface representation (a spherical parametrization) for genus-0 surfaces and demonstrate how to compute core geometric operators directly on this representation. Namely, we show how to construct the normals and the first and second fundamental forms of the surface, and how to compute the surface gradient, surface divergence and Laplace Beltrami operator on scalar/vector fields defined on the surface. These operators, in turn, enable us to create geometry processing tools that act directly on the neural representations without any unnecessary meshing. We demonstrate illustrative applications in (neural) spectral analysis, heat flow and mean curvature flow, and our method shows robustness to isometric shape variations. We both propose theoretical formulations and validate their numerical estimates. By systematically linking neural surface representations with classical geometry processing algorithms, we believe this work can become a key ingredient in enabling neural geometry processing.

- **Summary**: Tracking and segmenting multiple similar objects with complex or separate parts in long-term videos is inherently challenging due to the ambiguity of target parts and identity confusion caused by occlusion, background clutter, and long-term variations. In this paper, we propose a robust video object segmentation framework equipped with spatial-semantic features and discriminative object queries to address the above issues. Specifically, we construct a spatial-semantic network comprising a semantic embedding block and spatial dependencies modeling block to associate the pretrained ViT features with global semantic features and local spatial features, providing a comprehensive target representation. In addition, we develop a masked cross-attention module to generate object queries that focus on the most discriminative parts of target objects during query propagation, alleviating noise accumulation and ensuring effective long-term query propagation. The experimental results show that the proposed method set a new state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, including the DAVIS2017 test (89.1%), YoutubeVOS 2019 (88.5%), MOSE (75.1%), LVOS test (73.0%), and LVOS val (75.1%), which demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capacity of the proposed method. We will make all source code and trained models publicly available.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) has emerged as a promising solution to tackle the challenges of time-consuming manual labeling in the medical field. However, in practical scenarios, there are often domain variations within the datasets, leading to derivative scenarios like semi-supervised medical domain generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA). In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters all three tasks. We notice a critical shared challenge across three scenarios: the explicit semantic knowledge for segmentation performance and rich domain knowledge for generalizability exclusively exist in the labeled set and unlabeled set respectively. Such discrepancy hinders existing methods from effectively comprehending both types of knowledge under semi-supervised settings. To tackle this challenge, we develop a Semantic & Domain Knowledge Messenger (S&D Messenger) which facilitates direct knowledge delivery between the labeled and unlabeled set, and thus allowing the model to comprehend both of them in each individual learning flow. Equipped with our S&D Messenger, a naive pseudo-labeling method can achieve huge improvement on six benchmark datasets for SSMIS (+7.5%), UMDA (+5.6%), and Semi-MDG tasks (+1.14%), compared with state-of-the-art methods designed for specific tasks.

- **Summary**: Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) has wide applications in human-machine interaction scenarios, such as digitized education and automated offices. Recently, sequence-based models with encoder-decoder architectures have been commonly adopted to address this task by directly predicting LaTeX sequences of expression images. However, these methods only implicitly learn the syntax rules provided by LaTeX, which may fail to describe the position and hierarchical relationship between symbols due to complex structural relations and diverse handwriting styles. To overcome this challenge, we propose a position forest transformer (PosFormer) for HMER, which jointly optimizes two tasks: expression recognition and position recognition, to explicitly enable position-aware symbol feature representation learning. Specifically, we first design a position forest that models the mathematical expression as a forest structure and parses the relative position relationships between symbols. Without requiring extra annotations, each symbol is assigned a position identifier in the forest to denote its relative spatial position. Second, we propose an implicit attention correction module to accurately capture attention for HMER in the sequence-based decoder architecture. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of PosFormer, which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods 2.03%/1.22%/2.00%, 1.83%, and 4.62% gains on the single-line CROHME 2014/2016/2019, multi-line M2E, and complex MNE datasets, respectively, with no additional latency or computational cost.

- **Summary**: The rapid development of the Internet has profoundly changed human life. Humans are increasingly expressing themselves and interacting with others on social media platforms. However, although artificial intelligence technology has been widely used in many aspects of life, its application in social media content creation is still blank. To solve this problem, we propose a new prompt word generation framework based on multi-modal information fusion, which combines multiple tasks including topic classification, sentiment analysis, scene recognition and keyword extraction to generate more comprehensive prompt words. Subsequently, we use a template containing a set of prompt words to guide ChatGPT to generate high-quality tweets. Furthermore, in the absence of effective and objective evaluation criteria in the field of content generation, we use the ChatGPT tool to evaluate the results generated by the algorithm, making large-scale evaluation of content generation algorithms possible. Evaluation results on extensive content generation demonstrate that our cue word generation framework generates higher quality content compared to manual methods and other cueing techniques, while topic classification, sentiment analysis, and scene recognition significantly enhance content clarity and its consistency with the image.

- **Summary**: Cross domain object detection learns an object detector for an unlabeled target domain by transferring knowledge from an annotated source domain. Promising results have been achieved via Mean Teacher, however, pseudo labeling which is the bottleneck of mutual learning remains to be further explored. In this study, we find that confidence misalignment of the predictions, including category-level overconfidence, instance-level task confidence inconsistency, and image-level confidence misfocusing, leading to the injection of noisy pseudo label in the training process, will bring suboptimal performance on the target domain. To tackle this issue, we present a novel general framework termed Multi-Granularity Confidence Alignment Mean Teacher (MGCAMT) for cross domain object detection, which alleviates confidence misalignment across category-, instance-, and image-levels simultaneously to obtain high quality pseudo supervision for better teacher-student learning. Specifically, to align confidence with accuracy at category level, we propose Classification Confidence Alignment (CCA) to model category uncertainty based on Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) and filter out the category incorrect labels via an uncertainty-aware selection strategy. Furthermore, to mitigate the instance-level misalignment between classification and localization, we design Task Confidence Alignment (TCA) to enhance the interaction between the two task branches and allow each classification feature to adaptively locate the optimal feature for the regression. Finally, we develop imagery Focusing Confidence Alignment (FCA) adopting another way of pseudo label learning, i.e., we use the original outputs from the Mean Teacher network for supervised learning without label assignment to concentrate on holistic information in the target image. These three procedures benefit from each other from a cooperative learning perspective.

- **Summary**: Despite recent advances in improving the sample-efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, designing an RL algorithm that can be practically deployed in real-world environments remains a challenge. In this paper, we present Coarse-to-fine Reinforcement Learning (CRL), a framework that trains RL agents to zoom-into a continuous action space in a coarse-to-fine manner, enabling the use of stable, sample-efficient value-based RL algorithms for fine-grained continuous control tasks. Our key idea is to train agents that output actions by iterating the procedure of (i) discretizing the continuous action space into multiple intervals and (ii) selecting the interval with the highest Q-value to further discretize at the next level. We then introduce a concrete, value-based algorithm within the CRL framework called Coarse-to-fine Q-Network (CQN). Our experiments demonstrate that CQN significantly outperforms RL and behavior cloning baselines on 20 sparsely-rewarded RLBench manipulation tasks with a modest number of environment interactions and expert demonstrations. We also show that CQN robustly learns to solve real-world manipulation tasks within a few minutes of online training.

- **Summary**: Current feature matching methods prioritize improving modeling capabilities to better align outputs with ground-truth matches, which are the theoretical upper bound on matching results, metaphorically depicted as the "ceiling". However, these enhancements fail to address the underlying issues that directly hinder ground-truth matches, including the scarcity of matchable points in small scale images, matching conflicts in dense methods, and the keypoint-repeatability reliance in sparse methods. We propose a novel feature matching method named RCM, which Raises the Ceiling of Matching from three aspects. 1) RCM introduces a dynamic view switching mechanism to address the scarcity of matchable points in source images by strategically switching image pairs. 2) RCM proposes a conflict-free coarse matching module, addressing matching conflicts in the target image through a many-to-one matching strategy. 3) By integrating the semi-sparse paradigm and the coarse-to-fine architecture, RCM preserves the benefits of both high efficiency and global search, mitigating the reliance on keypoint repeatability. As a result, RCM enables more matchable points in the source image to be matched in an exhaustive and conflict-free manner in the target image, leading to a substantial 260% increase in ground-truth matches. Comprehensive experiments show that RCM exhibits remarkable performance and efficiency in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Mixup data augmentation approaches have been applied for various tasks of deep learning to improve the generalization ability of deep neural networks. Some existing approaches CutMix, SaliencyMix, etc. randomly replace a patch in one image with patches from another to generate the mixed image. Similarly, the corresponding labels are linearly combined by a fixed ratio $\lambda$ by l. The objects in two images may be overlapped during the mixing process, so some semantic information is corrupted in the mixed samples. In this case, the mixed image does not match the mixed label information. Besides, such a label may mislead the deep learning model training, which results in poor performance. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel approach named SUMix to learn the mixing ratio as well as the uncertainty for the mixed samples during the training process. First, we design a learnable similarity function to compute an accurate mix ratio. Second, an approach is investigated as a regularized term to model the uncertainty of the mixed samples. We conduct experiments on five image benchmarks, and extensive experimental results imply that our method is capable of improving the performance of classifiers with different cutting-based mixup approaches.

- **Summary**: Stereo matching is close to hitting a half-century of history, yet witnessed a rapid evolution in the last decade thanks to deep learning. While previous surveys in the late 2010s covered the first stage of this revolution, the last five years of research brought further ground-breaking advancements to the field. This paper aims to fill this gap in a two-fold manner: first, we offer an in-depth examination of the latest developments in deep stereo matching, focusing on the pioneering architectural designs and groundbreaking paradigms that have redefined the field in the 2020s; second, we present a thorough analysis of the critical challenges that have emerged alongside these advances, providing a comprehensive taxonomy of these issues and exploring the state-of-the-art techniques proposed to address them. By reviewing both the architectural innovations and the key challenges, we offer a holistic view of deep stereo matching and highlight the specific areas that require further investigation. To accompany this survey, we maintain a regularly updated project page that catalogs papers on deep stereo matching in our Awesome-Deep-Stereo-Matching (https://github.com/fabiotosi92/Awesome-Deep-Stereo-Matching) repository.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we aim to generate clean speech frame by frame from a live video stream and a noisy audio stream without relying on future inputs. To this end, we propose RT-LA-VocE, which completely re-designs every component of LA-VocE, a state-of-the-art non-causal audio-visual speech enhancement model, to perform causal real-time inference with a 40ms input frame. We do so by devising new visual and audio encoders that rely solely on past frames, replacing the Transformer encoder with the Emformer, and designing a new causal neural vocoder C-HiFi-GAN. On the popular AVSpeech dataset, we show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results in all real-time scenarios. More importantly, each component is carefully tuned to minimize the algorithm latency to the theoretical minimum (40ms) while maintaining a low end-to-end processing latency of 28.15ms per frame, enabling real-time frame-by-frame enhancement with minimal delay.

- **Summary**: Learning disentangled representations in an unsupervised manner is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Solving it may unlock other problems, such as generalization, interpretability, or fairness. While remarkably difficult to solve in general, recent works have shown that disentanglement is provably achievable under additional assumptions that can leverage geometrical constraints, such as local isometry. To use these insights, we propose a novel perspective on disentangled representation learning built on quadratic optimal transport. Specifically, we formulate the problem in the Gromov-Monge setting, which seeks isometric mappings between distributions supported on different spaces. We propose the Gromov-Monge-Gap (GMG), a regularizer that quantifies the geometry-preservation of an arbitrary push-forward map between two distributions supported on different spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GMG regularization for disentanglement on four standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show that geometry preservation can even encourage unsupervised disentanglement without the standard reconstruction objective - making the underlying model decoder-free, and promising a more practically viable and scalable perspective on unsupervised disentanglement.

- **Summary**: Automated 3D city generation, focusing on road networks and building layouts, is in high demand for applications in urban design, multimedia games and autonomous driving simulations. The surge of generative AI facilitates designing city layouts based on deep learning models. However, the lack of high-quality datasets and benchmarks hinders the progress of these data-driven methods in generating road networks and building layouts. Furthermore, few studies consider urban characteristics, which generally take graphics as analysis objects and are crucial for practical applications, to control the generative process. To alleviate these problems, we introduce a multimodal dataset with accompanying evaluation metrics for controllable generation of Road networks and Building layouts (RoBus), which is the first and largest open-source dataset in city generation so far. RoBus dataset is formatted as images, graphics and texts, with $72,400$ paired samples that cover around $80,000km^2$ globally. We analyze the RoBus dataset statistically and validate the effectiveness against existing road networks and building layouts generation methods. Additionally, we design new baselines that incorporate urban characteristics, such as road orientation and building density, in the process of generating road networks and building layouts using the RoBus dataset, enhancing the practicality of automated urban design. The RoBus dataset and related codes are published at https://github.com/tourlics/RoBus_Dataset.

- **Summary**: Despite tremendous advancements, current state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are still far from perfect. They tend to hallucinate and may generate biased responses. In such circumstances, having a way to assess the reliability of a given response generated by a VLM is quite useful. Existing methods, such as estimating uncertainty using answer likelihoods or prompt-based confidence generation, often suffer from overconfidence. Other methods use self-consistency comparison but are affected by confirmation biases. To alleviate these, we propose \textbf{De}compose and \textbf{C}ompare \textbf{C}onsistency (\texttt{DeCC}) for reliability measurement. By comparing the consistency between the direct answer generated using the VLM's internal reasoning process, and the indirect answers obtained by decomposing the question into sub-questions and reasoning over the sub-answers produced by the VLM, \texttt{DeCC} measures the reliability of VLM's direct answer. Experiments across six vision-language tasks with three VLMs show \texttt{DeCC}'s reliability estimation achieves better correlation with task accuracy compared to the existing methods.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), in particular self-supervised learning of foundation models (FMs), are revolutionizing medical imaging and computational pathology (CPath). A constant challenge in the analysis of digital Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is the problem of aggregating tens of thousands of tile-level image embeddings to a slide-level representation. Due to the prevalent use of datasets created for genomic research, such as TCGA, for method development, the performance of these techniques on diagnostic slides from clinical practice has been inadequately explored. This study conducts a thorough benchmarking analysis of ten slide-level aggregation techniques across nine clinically relevant tasks, including diagnostic assessment, biomarker classification, and outcome prediction. The results yield following key insights: (1) Embeddings derived from domain-specific (histological images) FMs outperform those from generic ImageNet-based models across aggregation methods. (2) Spatial-aware aggregators enhance the performance significantly when using ImageNet pre-trained models but not when using FMs. (3) No single model excels in all tasks and spatially-aware models do not show general superiority as it would be expected. These findings underscore the need for more adaptable and universally applicable aggregation techniques, guiding future research towards tools that better meet the evolving needs of clinical-AI in pathology.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have excelled in vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. However, non-square aspect ratios of image or video input might significantly affect the re-identification performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel ViT-based ReID framework in this paper, which fuses models trained on a variety of aspect ratios. Our main contributions are threefold: (i) We analyze aspect ratio performance on VeRi-776 and VehicleID datasets, guiding input settings based on aspect ratios of original images. (ii) We introduce patch-wise mixup intra-image during ViT patchification (guided by spatial attention scores) and implement uneven stride for better object aspect ratio matching. (iii) We propose a dynamic feature fusing ReID network, enhancing model robustness. Our ReID method achieves a significantly improved mean Average Precision (mAP) of 91.0\% compared to the the closest state-of-the-art (CAL) result of 80.9\% on VehicleID dataset.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary detection is a challenging task due to the requirement of detecting objects based on class names, including those not encountered during training. Existing methods have shown strong zero-shot detection capabilities through pre-training on diverse large-scale datasets. However, these approaches still face two primary challenges: (i) how to universally integrate diverse data sources for end-to-end training, and (ii) how to effectively leverage the language-aware capability for region-level cross-modality understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unified open-vocabulary detection method called OV-DINO, which pre-trains on diverse large-scale datasets with language-aware selective fusion in a unified framework. Specifically, we introduce a Unified Data Integration (UniDI) pipeline to enable end-to-end training and eliminate noise from pseudo-label generation by unifying different data sources into detection-centric data. In addition, we propose a Language-Aware Selective Fusion (LASF) module to enable the language-aware ability of the model through a language-aware query selection and fusion process. We evaluate the performance of the proposed OV-DINO on popular open-vocabulary detection benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results with an AP of 50.6\% on the COCO dataset and 40.0\% on the LVIS dataset in a zero-shot manner, demonstrating its strong generalization ability. Furthermore, the fine-tuned OV-DINO on COCO achieves 58.4\% AP, outperforming many existing methods with the same backbone. The code for OV-DINO will be available at \href{https://github.com/wanghao9610/OV-DINO}{https://github.com/wanghao9610/OV-DINO}.

- **Summary**: In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, a resource-efficient implicit curriculum learning approach for dense prediction tasks. Our curriculum approach is defined by growing the patch size during model training, which gradually increases the task's difficulty. We integrated our curriculum into the nnU-Net framework and evaluated the methodology on all 10 tasks of the Medical Segmentation Decathlon. With our approach, we are able to substantially reduce runtime, computational costs, and CO2 emissions of network training compared to classical constant patch size training. In our experiments, the curriculum approach resulted in improved convergence. We are able to outperform standard nnU-Net training, which is trained with constant patch size, in terms of Dice Score on 7 out of 10 MSD tasks while only spending roughly 50% of the original training runtime. To the best of our knowledge, our Progressive Growing of Patch Size is the first successful employment of a sample-length curriculum in the form of patch size in the field of computer vision. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/compai-lab/2024-miccai-fischer.

- **Summary**: We present 4DiM, a cascaded diffusion model for 4D novel view synthesis (NVS), conditioned on one or more images of a general scene, and a set of camera poses and timestamps. To overcome challenges due to limited availability of 4D training data, we advocate joint training on 3D (with camera pose), 4D (pose+time) and video (time but no pose) data and propose a new architecture that enables the same. We further advocate the calibration of SfM posed data using monocular metric depth estimators for metric scale camera control. For model evaluation, we introduce new metrics to enrich and overcome shortcomings of current evaluation schemes, demonstrating state-of-the-art results in both fidelity and pose control compared to existing diffusion models for 3D NVS, while at the same time adding the ability to handle temporal dynamics. 4DiM is also used for improved panorama stitching, pose-conditioned video to video translation, and several other tasks.

- **Summary**: Generalising vision-based manipulation policies to novel environments remains a challenging area with limited exploration. Current practices involve collecting data in one location, training imitation learning or reinforcement learning policies with this data, and deploying the policy in the same location. However, this approach lacks scalability as it necessitates data collection in multiple locations for each task. This paper proposes a novel approach where data is collected in a location predominantly featuring green screens. We introduce Green-screen Augmentation (GreenAug), employing a chroma key algorithm to overlay background textures onto a green screen. Through extensive real-world empirical studies with over 850 training demonstrations and 8.2k evaluation episodes, we demonstrate that GreenAug surpasses no augmentation, standard computer vision augmentation, and prior generative augmentation methods in performance. While no algorithmic novelties are claimed, our paper advocates for a fundamental shift in data collection practices. We propose that real-world demonstrations in future research should utilise green screens, followed by the application of GreenAug. We believe GreenAug unlocks policy generalisation to visually distinct novel locations, addressing the current scene generalisation limitations in robot learning.

- **Summary**: Image-generation diffusion models have been fine-tuned to unlock new capabilities such as image-editing and novel view synthesis. Can we similarly unlock image-generation models for visuomotor control? We present GENIMA, a behavior-cloning agent that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to 'draw joint-actions' as targets on RGB images. These images are fed into a controller that maps the visual targets into a sequence of joint-positions. We study GENIMA on 25 RLBench and 9 real-world manipulation tasks. We find that, by lifting actions into image-space, internet pre-trained diffusion models can generate policies that outperform state-of-the-art visuomotor approaches, especially in robustness to scene perturbations and generalizing to novel objects. Our method is also competitive with 3D agents, despite lacking priors such as depth, keypoints, or motion-planners.

- **Summary**: Predictive models are a crucial component of many robotic systems. Yet, constructing accurate predictive models for a variety of deformable objects, especially those with unknown physical properties, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces AdaptiGraph, a learning-based dynamics modeling approach that enables robots to predict, adapt to, and control a wide array of challenging deformable materials with unknown physical properties. AdaptiGraph leverages the highly flexible graph-based neural dynamics (GBND) framework, which represents material bits as particles and employs a graph neural network (GNN) to predict particle motion. Its key innovation is a unified physical property-conditioned GBND model capable of predicting the motions of diverse materials with varying physical properties without retraining. Upon encountering new materials during online deployment, AdaptiGraph utilizes a physical property optimization process for a few-shot adaptation of the model, enhancing its fit to the observed interaction data. The adapted models can precisely simulate the dynamics and predict the motion of various deformable materials, such as ropes, granular media, rigid boxes, and cloth, while adapting to different physical properties, including stiffness, granular size, and center of pressure. On prediction and manipulation tasks involving a diverse set of real-world deformable objects, our method exhibits superior prediction accuracy and task proficiency over non-material-conditioned and non-adaptive models.

- **Summary**: Visual instruction tuning has made considerable strides in enhancing the capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). However, existing open LMMs largely focus on single-image tasks, their applications to multi-image scenarios remains less explored. Additionally, prior LMM research separately tackles different scenarios, leaving it impossible to generalize cross scenarios with new emerging capabilities. To this end, we introduce LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave, which simultaneously tackles Multi-image, Multi-frame (video), Multi-view (3D), and Multi-patch (single-image) scenarios in LMMs. To enable these capabilities, we regard the interleaved data format as a general template and compile the M4-Instruct dataset with 1,177.6k samples, spanning 4 primary domains with 14 tasks and 41 datasets. We also curate the LLaVA-Interleave Bench to comprehensively evaluate the multi-image performance of LMMs. Through extensive experiments, LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave achieves leading results in multi-image, video, and 3D benchmarks, while maintaining the performance of single-image tasks. Besides, our model also exhibits several emerging capabilities, e.g., transferring tasks across different settings and modalities. Code is available at https://github.com/LLaVA-VL/LLaVA-NeXT
