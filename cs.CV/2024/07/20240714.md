- **Summary**: Various trending image generative techniques, such as diffusion models, have enabled visually appealing outcomes with just text-based descriptions. Unlike general images, where assessing the quality and alignment with text descriptions is trivial, establishing such a relation in a clinical setting proves challenging. This work investigates various strategies to evaluate the clinical significance of synthetic polyp images of different pathologies. We further explore if a relation could be established between qualitative results and their clinical relevance.

- **Summary**: Infrared and visible image fusion has been developed from vision perception oriented fusion methods to strategies which both consider the vision perception and high-level vision task. However, the existing task-driven methods fail to address the domain gap between semantic and geometric representation. To overcome these issues, we propose a high-level vision task-driven infrared and visible image fusion network via semantic and geometric domain transformation, terms as HSFusion. Specifically, to minimize the gap between semantic and geometric representation, we design two separate domain transformation branches by CycleGAN framework, and each includes two processes: the forward segmentation process and the reverse reconstruction process. CycleGAN is capable of learning domain transformation patterns, and the reconstruction process of CycleGAN is conducted under the constraint of these patterns. Thus, our method can significantly facilitate the integration of semantic and geometric information and further reduces the domain gap. In fusion stage, we integrate the infrared and visible features that extracted from the reconstruction process of two seperate CycleGANs to obtain the fused result. These features, containing varying proportions of semantic and geometric information, can significantly enhance the high level vision tasks. Additionally, we generate masks based on segmentation results to guide the fusion task. These masks can provide semantic priors, and we design adaptive weights for two distinct areas in the masks to facilitate image fusion. Finally, we conducted comparative experiments between our method and eleven other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that our approach surpasses others in both visual appeal and semantic segmentation task.

- **Summary**: Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to various backdoor attacks, where the behavior of DNNs can be compromised by utilizing certain types of triggers or poisoning mechanisms. State-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses employ too- sophisticated mechanisms that require either a computationally expensive adversarial search module for reverse-engineering the trigger distribution or an over-sensitive hyper-parameter selection module. Moreover, they offer sub-par performance in challenging scenarios, e.g., limited validation data and strong attacks. In this paper, we propose Neural mask Fine-Tuning (NFT) with an aim to optimally re-organize the neuron activities in a way that the effect of the backdoor is removed. Utilizing a simple data augmentation like MixUp, NFT relaxes the trigger synthesis process and eliminates the requirement of the adversarial search module. Our study further reveals that direct weight fine-tuning under limited validation data results in poor post-purification clean test accuracy, primarily due to overfitting issue. To overcome this, we propose to fine-tune neural masks instead of model weights. In addition, a mask regularizer has been devised to further mitigate the model drift during the purification process. The distinct characteristics of NFT render it highly efficient in both runtime and sample usage, as it can remove the backdoor even when a single sample is available from each class. We validate the effectiveness of NFT through extensive experiments covering the tasks of image classification, object detection, video action recognition, 3D point cloud, and natural language processing. We evaluate our method against 14 different attacks (LIRA, WaNet, etc.) on 11 benchmark data sets such as ImageNet, UCF101, Pascal VOC, ModelNet, OpenSubtitles2012, etc.

- **Summary**: Text-to-motion generation holds potential for film, gaming, and robotics, yet current methods often prioritize short motion generation, making it challenging to produce long motion sequences effectively: (1) Current methods struggle to handle long motion sequences as a single input due to prohibitively high computational cost; (2) Breaking down the generation of long motion sequences into shorter segments can result in inconsistent transitions and requires interpolation or inpainting, which lacks entire sequence modeling. To solve these challenges, we propose InfiniMotion, a method that generates continuous motion sequences of arbitrary length within an autoregressive framework. We highlight its groundbreaking capability by generating a continuous 1-hour human motion with around 80,000 frames. Specifically, we introduce the Motion Memory Transformer with Bidirectional Mamba Memory, enhancing the transformer's memory to process long motion sequences effectively without overwhelming computational resources. Notably our method achieves over 30% improvement in FID and 6 times longer demonstration compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, showcasing significant advancements in long motion generation.

- **Summary**: Novel View Synthesis plays a crucial role by generating new 2D renderings from multi-view images of 3D scenes. However, capturing high-speed scenes with conventional cameras often leads to motion blur, hindering the effectiveness of 3D reconstruction. To address this challenge, high-frame-rate dense 3D reconstruction emerges as a vital technique, enabling detailed and accurate modeling of real-world objects or scenes in various fields, including Virtual Reality or embodied AI. Spike cameras, a novel type of neuromorphic sensor, continuously record scenes with an ultra-high temporal resolution, showing potential for accurate 3D reconstruction. Despite their promise, existing approaches, such as applying Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to spike cameras, encounter challenges due to the time-consuming rendering process. To address this issue, we make the first attempt to introduce the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into spike cameras in high-speed capture, providing 3DGS as dense and continuous clues of views, then constructing SpikeGS. Specifically, to train SpikeGS, we establish computational equations between the rendering process of 3DGS and the processes of instantaneous imaging and exposing-like imaging of the continuous spike stream. Besides, we build a very lightweight but effective mapping process from spikes to instant images to support training. Furthermore, we introduced a new spike-based 3D rendering dataset for validation. Extensive experiments have demonstrated our method possesses the high quality of novel view rendering, proving the tremendous potential of spike cameras in modeling 3D scenes.

- **Summary**: Recent studies that incorporate geometric features and transformers into 3D point cloud feature learning have significantly improved the performance of 3D deep-learning models. However, their robustness against adversarial attacks has not been thoroughly explored. Existing attack methods primarily focus on white-box scenarios and struggle to transfer to recently proposed 3D deep-learning models. Even worse, these attacks introduce perturbations to 3D coordinates, generating unrealistic adversarial examples and resulting in poor performance against 3D adversarial defenses. In this paper, we generate high-quality adversarial point clouds using diffusion models. By using partial points as prior knowledge, we generate realistic adversarial examples through shape completion with adversarial guidance. The proposed adversarial shape completion allows for a more reliable generation of adversarial point clouds. To enhance attack transferability, we delve into the characteristics of 3D point clouds and employ model uncertainty for better inference of model classification through random down-sampling of point clouds. We adopt ensemble adversarial guidance for improved transferability across different network architectures. To maintain the generation quality, we limit our adversarial guidance solely to the critical points of the point clouds by calculating saliency scores. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed attacks outperform state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods against both black-box models and defenses. Our black-box attack establishes a new baseline for evaluating the robustness of various 3D point cloud classification models.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in large-scale foundational models have sparked widespread interest in training highly proficient large vision models. A common consensus revolves around the necessity of aggregating extensive, high-quality annotated data. However, given the inherent challenges in annotating dense tasks in computer vision, such as object detection and segmentation, a practical strategy is to combine and leverage all available data for training purposes. In this work, we propose Plain-Det, which offers flexibility to accommodate new datasets, robustness in performance across diverse datasets, training efficiency, and compatibility with various detection architectures. We utilize Def-DETR, with the assistance of Plain-Det, to achieve a mAP of 51.9 on COCO, matching the current state-of-the-art detectors. We conduct extensive experiments on 13 downstream datasets and Plain-Det demonstrates strong generalization capability. Code is release at https://github.com/ChengShiest/Plain-Det

- **Summary**: Unsupervised 3D instance segmentation aims to segment objects from a 3D point cloud without any annotations. Existing methods face the challenge of either too loose or too tight clustering, leading to under-segmentation or over-segmentation. To address this issue, we propose Part2Object, hierarchical clustering with object guidance. Part2Object employs multi-layer clustering from points to object parts and objects, allowing objects to manifest at any layer. Additionally, it extracts and utilizes 3D objectness priors from temporally consecutive 2D RGB frames to guide the clustering process. Moreover, we propose Hi-Mask3D to support hierarchical 3D object part and instance segmentation. By training Hi-Mask3D on the objects and object parts extracted from Part2Object, we achieve consistent and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models in various settings, including unsupervised instance segmentation, data-efficient fine-tuning, and cross-dataset generalization.

- **Summary**: The current methods of video-based 3D human pose estimation have achieved significant progress; however, they continue to confront the significant challenge of depth ambiguity. To address this limitation, this paper presents the spatio-temporal GraphFormer framework for 3D human pose estimation in video, which integrates body structure graph-based representations with spatio-temporal information. Specifically, we develop a spatio-temporal criss-cross graph (STG) attention mechanism. This approach is designed to learn the long-range dependencies in data across both time and space, integrating graph information directly into the respective attention layers. Furthermore, we introduce the dual-path modulated hop-wise regular GCN (MHR-GCN) module, which utilizes modulation to optimize parameter usage and employs spatio-temporal hop-wise skip connections to acquire higher-order information. Additionally, this module processes temporal and spatial dimensions independently to learn their respective features while avoiding mutual influence. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D human pose estimation on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We introduce 3DEgo to address a novel problem of directly synthesizing photorealistic 3D scenes from monocular videos guided by textual prompts. Conventional methods construct a text-conditioned 3D scene through a three-stage process, involving pose estimation using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) libraries like COLMAP, initializing the 3D model with unedited images, and iteratively updating the dataset with edited images to achieve a 3D scene with text fidelity. Our framework streamlines the conventional multi-stage 3D editing process into a single-stage workflow by overcoming the reliance on COLMAP and eliminating the cost of model initialization. We apply a diffusion model to edit video frames prior to 3D scene creation by incorporating our designed noise blender module for enhancing multi-view editing consistency, a step that does not require additional training or fine-tuning of T2I diffusion models. 3DEgo utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to create 3D scenes from the multi-view consistent edited frames, capitalizing on the inherent temporal continuity and explicit point cloud data. 3DEgo demonstrates remarkable editing precision, speed, and adaptability across a variety of video sources, as validated by extensive evaluations on six datasets, including our own prepared GS25 dataset.

- **Summary**: Published research highlights the presence of demographic bias in automated facial attribute classification. The proposed bias mitigation techniques are mostly based on supervised learning, which requires a large amount of labeled training data for generalizability and scalability. However, labeled data is limited, requires laborious annotation, poses privacy risks, and can perpetuate human bias. In contrast, self-supervised learning (SSL) capitalizes on freely available unlabeled data, rendering trained models more scalable and generalizable. However, these label-free SSL models may also introduce biases by sampling false negative pairs, especially at low-data regimes 200K images) under low compute settings. Further, SSL-based models may suffer from performance degradation due to a lack of quality assurance of the unlabeled data sourced from the web. This paper proposes a fully self-supervised pipeline for demographically fair facial attribute classifiers. Leveraging completely unlabeled data pseudolabeled via pre-trained encoders, diverse data curation techniques, and meta-learning-based weighted contrastive learning, our method significantly outperforms existing SSL approaches proposed for downstream image classification tasks. Extensive evaluations on the FairFace and CelebA datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our pipeline in obtaining fair performance over existing baselines. Thus, setting a new benchmark for SSL in the fairness of facial attribute classification.

- **Summary**: Long Document Classification (LDC) has gained significant attention recently. However, multi-modal data in long documents such as texts and images are not being effectively utilized. Prior studies in this area have attempted to integrate texts and images in document-related tasks, but they have only focused on short text sequences and images of pages. How to classify long documents with hierarchical structure texts and embedding images is a new problem and faces multi-modal representation difficulties. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Hierarchical Multi-modal Transformer (HMT) for cross-modal long document classification. The HMT conducts multi-modal feature interaction and fusion between images and texts in a hierarchical manner. Our approach uses a multi-modal transformer and a dynamic multi-scale multi-modal transformer to model the complex relationships between image features, and the section and sentence features. Furthermore, we introduce a new interaction strategy called the dynamic mask transfer module to integrate these two transformers by propagating features between them. To validate our approach, we conduct cross-modal LDC experiments on two newly created and two publicly available multi-modal long document datasets, and the results show that the proposed HMT outperforms state-of-the-art single-modality and multi-modality methods.

- **Summary**: Diverse and realistic floor plan data are essential for the development of useful computer-aided methods in architectural design. Today's large-scale floor plan datasets predominantly feature simple floor plan layouts, typically representing single-apartment dwellings only. To compensate for the mismatch between current datasets and the real world, we develop \textbf{Modified Swiss Dwellings} (MSD) -- the first large-scale floor plan dataset that contains a significant share of layouts of multi-apartment dwellings. MSD features over 5.3K floor plans of medium- to large-scale building complexes, covering over 18.9K distinct apartments. We validate that existing approaches for floor plan generation, while effective in simpler scenarios, cannot yet seamlessly address the challenges posed by MSD. Our benchmark calls for new research in floor plan machine understanding. Code and data are open.

- **Summary**: Recent years have witnessed increasing research attention towards pedestrian detection by taking the advantages of different sensor modalities (e.g. RGB, IR, Depth, LiDAR and Event). However, designing a unified generalist model that can effectively process diverse sensor modalities remains a challenge. This paper introduces MMPedestron, a novel generalist model for multimodal perception. Unlike previous specialist models that only process one or a pair of specific modality inputs, MMPedestron is able to process multiple modal inputs and their dynamic combinations. The proposed approach comprises a unified encoder for modal representation and fusion and a general head for pedestrian detection. We introduce two extra learnable tokens, i.e. MAA and MAF, for adaptive multi-modal feature fusion. In addition, we construct the MMPD dataset, the first large-scale benchmark for multi-modal pedestrian detection. This benchmark incorporates existing public datasets and a newly collected dataset called EventPed, covering a wide range of sensor modalities including RGB, IR, Depth, LiDAR, and Event data. With multi-modal joint training, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of pedestrian detection benchmarks, surpassing leading models tailored for specific sensor modality. For example, it achieves 71.1 AP on COCO-Persons and 72.6 AP on LLVIP. Notably, our model achieves comparable performance to the InternImage-H model on CrowdHuman with 30x smaller parameters.

- **Summary**: Segmenting and recognizing diverse object parts is crucial in computer vision and robotics. Despite significant progress in object segmentation, part-level segmentation remains underexplored due to complex boundaries and scarce annotated data. To address this, we propose a novel Weakly-supervised Part Segmentation (WPS) setting and an approach called WPS-SAM, built on the large-scale pre-trained vision foundation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM). WPS-SAM is an end-to-end framework designed to extract prompt tokens directly from images and perform pixel-level segmentation of part regions. During its training phase, it only uses weakly supervised labels in the form of bounding boxes or points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, through exploiting the rich knowledge embedded in pre-trained foundation models, WPS-SAM outperforms other segmentation models trained with pixel-level strong annotations. Specifically, WPS-SAM achieves 68.93% mIOU and 79.53% mACC on the PartImageNet dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art fully supervised methods by approximately 4% in terms of mIOU.

- **Summary**: Although multi-view 3D object detection based on the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) paradigm has garnered widespread attention as an economical and deployment-friendly perception solution for autonomous driving, there is still a performance gap compared to LiDAR-based methods. In recent years, several cross-modal distillation methods have been proposed to transfer beneficial information from teacher models to student models, with the aim of enhancing performance. However, these methods face challenges due to discrepancies in feature distribution originating from different data modalities and network structures, making knowledge transfer exceptionally challenging. In this paper, we propose a Foreground Self-Distillation (FSD) scheme that effectively avoids the issue of distribution discrepancies, maintaining remarkable distillation effects without the need for pre-trained teacher models or cumbersome distillation strategies. Additionally, we design two Point Cloud Intensification (PCI) strategies to compensate for the sparsity of point clouds by frame combination and pseudo point assignment. Finally, we develop a Multi-Scale Foreground Enhancement (MSFE) module to extract and fuse multi-scale foreground features by predicted elliptical Gaussian heatmap, further improving the model's performance. We integrate all the above innovations into a unified framework named FSD-BEV. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset exhibit that FSD-BEV achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: The fast growth of E-Commerce creates a global market worth USD 821 billion for online fashion shopping. What unique about fashion presentation is that, the same design can usually be offered with different cloths textures. However, only real video capturing or manual per-frame editing can be used for virtual showcase on the same design with different textures, both of which are heavily labor intensive. In this paper, we present a pattern-based approach for UV and shading recovery from a captured real video so that the garment's texture can be replaced automatically. The core of our approach is a per-pixel UV regression module via blended-weight multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) driven by the detected discrete correspondences from the cloth pattern. We propose a novel loss on the Jacobian of the UV mapping to create pleasant seams around the folding areas and the boundary of occluded regions while avoiding UV distortion. We also adopts the temporal constraint to ensure consistency and accuracy in UV prediction across adjacent frames. We show that our approach is robust to a variety type of clothes, in the wild illuminations and with challenging motions. We show plausible texture replacement results in our experiment, in which the folding and overlapping of the garment can be greatly preserved. We also show clear qualitative and quantitative improvement compared to the baselines as well. With the one-click setup, we look forward to our approach contributing to the growth of fashion E-commerce.

- **Summary**: Learning rotation-invariant distinctive features is a fundamental requirement for point cloud registration. Existing methods often use rotation-sensitive networks to extract features, while employing rotation augmentation to learn an approximate invariant mapping rudely. This makes networks fragile to rotations, overweight, and hinders the distinctiveness of features. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel position-aware rotation-equivariant network, for efficient, light-weighted, and robust registration. The network can provide a strong model inductive bias to learn rotation-equivariant/invariant features, thus addressing the aforementioned limitations. To further improve the distinctiveness of descriptors, we propose a position-aware convolution, which can better learn spatial information of local structures. Moreover, we also propose a feature-based hypothesis proposer. It leverages rotation-equivariant features that encode fine-grained structure orientations to generate reliable model hypotheses. Each correspondence can generate a hypothesis, thus it is more efficient than classic estimators that require multiple reliable correspondences. Accordingly, a contrastive rotation loss is presented to enhance the robustness of rotation-equivariant features against data degradation. Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the SOTA methods in terms of registration recall while being lightweight and keeping a fast speed. Moreover, experiments on rotated datasets demonstrate its robustness against rotation variations. Code is available at https://github.com/yaorz97/PARENet.

- **Summary**: Multi-object tracking (MOT) endeavors to precisely estimate the positions and identities of multiple objects over time. The prevailing approach, tracking-by-detection (TbD), first detects objects and then links detections, resulting in a simple yet effective method. However, contemporary detectors may occasionally miss some objects in certain frames, causing trackers to cease tracking prematurely. To tackle this issue, we propose BUSCA, meaning `to search', a versatile framework compatible with any online TbD system, enhancing its ability to persistently track those objects missed by the detector, primarily due to occlusions. Remarkably, this is accomplished without modifying past tracking results or accessing future frames, i.e., in a fully online manner. BUSCA generates proposals based on neighboring tracks, motion, and learned tokens. Utilizing a decision Transformer that integrates multimodal visual and spatiotemporal information, it addresses the object-proposal association as a multi-choice question-answering task. BUSCA is trained independently of the underlying tracker, solely on synthetic data, without requiring fine-tuning. Through BUSCA, we showcase consistent performance enhancements across five different trackers and establish a new state-of-the-art baseline across three different benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Multi-organ segmentation in medical image analysis is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. However, many factors complicate the task, including variability in different target categories and interference from complex backgrounds. In this paper, we utilize the knowledge of Deformable Convolution V3 (DCNv3) and multi-object segmentation to optimize our Spatially Adaptive Convolution Network (SACNet) in three aspects: feature extraction, model architecture, and loss constraint, simultaneously enhancing the perception of different segmentation targets. Firstly, we propose the Adaptive Receptive Field Module (ARFM), which combines DCNv3 with a series of customized block-level and architecture-level designs similar to transformers. This module can capture the unique features of different organs by adaptively adjusting the receptive field according to various targets. Secondly, we utilize ARFM as building blocks to construct the encoder-decoder of SACNet and partially share parameters between the encoder and decoder, making the network wider rather than deeper. This design achieves a shared lightweight decoder and a more parameter-efficient and effective framework. Lastly, we propose a novel continuity dynamic adjustment loss function, based on t-vMF dice loss and cross-entropy loss, to better balance easy and complex classes in segmentation. Experiments on 3D slice datasets from ACDC and Synapse demonstrate that SACNet delivers superior segmentation performance in multi-organ segmentation tasks compared to several existing methods.

- **Summary**: 3D point clouds play a pivotal role in outdoor scene perception, especially in the context of autonomous driving. Recent advancements in 3D LiDAR segmentation often focus intensely on the spatial positioning and distribution of points for accurate segmentation. However, these methods, while robust in variable conditions, encounter challenges due to sole reliance on coordinates and point intensity, leading to poor isometric invariance and suboptimal segmentation. To tackle this challenge, our work introduces Range-Aware Pointwise Distance Distribution (RAPiD) features and the associated RAPiD-Seg architecture. Our RAPiD features exhibit rigid transformation invariance and effectively adapt to variations in point density, with a design focus on capturing the localized geometry of neighboring structures. They utilize inherent LiDAR isotropic radiation and semantic categorization for enhanced local representation and computational efficiency, while incorporating a 4D distance metric that integrates geometric and surface material reflectivity for improved semantic segmentation. To effectively embed high-dimensional RAPiD features, we propose a double-nested autoencoder structure with a novel class-aware embedding objective to encode high-dimensional features into manageable voxel-wise embeddings. Additionally, we propose RAPiD-Seg which incorporates a channel-wise attention fusion and two effective RAPiD-Seg variants, further optimizing the embedding for enhanced performance and generalization. Our method outperforms contemporary LiDAR segmentation work in terms of mIoU on SemanticKITTI (76.1) and nuScenes (83.6) datasets.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in camera-based 3D object detection have introduced cross-modal knowledge distillation to bridge the performance gap with LiDAR 3D detectors, leveraging the precise geometric information in LiDAR point clouds. However, existing cross-modal knowledge distillation methods tend to overlook the inherent imperfections of LiDAR, such as the ambiguity of measurements on distant or occluded objects, which should not be transferred to the image detector. To mitigate these imperfections in LiDAR teacher, we propose a novel method that leverages aleatoric uncertainty-free features from ground truth labels. In contrast to conventional label guidance approaches, we approximate the inverse function of the teacher's head to effectively embed label inputs into feature space. This approach provides additional accurate guidance alongside LiDAR teacher, thereby boosting the performance of the image detector. Additionally, we introduce feature partitioning, which effectively transfers knowledge from the teacher modality while preserving the distinctive features of the student, thereby maximizing the potential of both modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves mAP and NDS by 5.1 points and 4.9 points compared to the baseline model, proving the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: Transformer-based image restoration methods in adverse weather have achieved significant progress. Most of them use self-attention along the channel dimension or within spatially fixed-range blocks to reduce computational load. However, such a compromise results in limitations in capturing long-range spatial features. Inspired by the observation that the weather-induced degradation factors mainly cause similar occlusion and brightness, in this work, we propose an efficient Histogram Transformer (Histoformer) for restoring images affected by adverse weather. It is powered by a mechanism dubbed histogram self-attention, which sorts and segments spatial features into intensity-based bins. Self-attention is then applied across bins or within each bin to selectively focus on spatial features of dynamic range and process similar degraded pixels of the long range together. To boost histogram self-attention, we present a dynamic-range convolution enabling conventional convolution to conduct operation over similar pixels rather than neighbor pixels. We also observe that the common pixel-wise losses neglect linear association and correlation between output and ground-truth. Thus, we propose to leverage the Pearson correlation coefficient as a loss function to enforce the recovered pixels following the identical order as ground-truth. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of our proposed method. We have released the codes in Github.

- **Summary**: Transferable targeted adversarial attacks aim to mislead models into outputting adversary-specified predictions in black-box scenarios. Recent studies have introduced \textit{single-target} generative attacks that train a generator for each target class to generate highly transferable perturbations, resulting in substantial computational overhead when handling multiple classes. \textit{Multi-target} attacks address this by training only one class-conditional generator for multiple classes. However, the generator simply uses class labels as conditions, failing to leverage the rich semantic information of the target class. To this end, we design a \textbf{C}LIP-guided \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{N}etwork with \textbf{C}ross-attention modules (CGNC) to enhance multi-target attacks by incorporating textual knowledge of CLIP into the generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGNC yields significant improvements over previous multi-target generative attacks, e.g., a 21.46\% improvement in success rate from ResNet-152 to DenseNet-121. Moreover, we propose a masked fine-tuning mechanism to further strengthen our method in attacking a single class, which surpasses existing single-target methods.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable performance with a small fraction of labeled data by leveraging vast amounts of unlabeled data from the Internet. However, this large pool of untrusted data is extremely vulnerable to data poisoning, leading to potential backdoor attacks. Current backdoor defenses are not yet effective against such a vulnerability in SSL. In this study, we propose a novel method, Unlabeled Data Purification (UPure), to disrupt the association between trigger patterns and target classes by introducing perturbations in the frequency domain. By leveraging the Rate- Distortion-Perception (RDP) trade-off, we further identify the frequency band, where the perturbations are added, and justify this selection. Notably, UPure purifies poisoned unlabeled data without the need of extra clean labeled data. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and five SSL algorithms demonstrate that UPure effectively reduces the attack success rate from 99.78% to 0% while maintaining model accuracy

- **Summary**: Contemporary color difference (CD) measures for photographic images typically operate by comparing co-located pixels, patches in a ``perceptually uniform'' color space, or features in a learned latent space. Consequently, these measures inadequately capture the human color perception of misaligned image pairs, which are prevalent in digital photography (e.g., the same scene captured by different smartphones). In this paper, we describe a perceptual CD measure based on the multiscale sliced Wasserstein distance, which facilitates efficient comparisons between non-local patches of similar color and structure. This aligns with the modern understanding of color perception, where color and structure are inextricably interdependent as a unitary process of perceptual organization. Meanwhile, our method is easy to implement and training-free. Experimental results indicate that our CD measure performs favorably in assessing CDs in photographic images, and consistently surpasses competing models in the presence of image misalignment. Additionally, we empirically verify that our measure functions as a metric in the mathematical sense, and show its promise as a loss function for image and video color transfer tasks.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based multi-view facial capture methods have shown impressive accuracy while being several orders of magnitude faster than a traditional mesh registration pipeline. However, the existing systems (e.g. TEMPEH) are strictly restricted to inference on the data captured by the same camera array used to capture their training data. In this study, we aim to improve the generalization ability so that a trained model can be readily used for inference (i.e. capture new data) on a different camera array. To this end, we propose a more generalizable initialization module to extract the camera array-agnostic 3D feature, including a visual hull-based head localization and a visibility-aware 3D feature aggregation module enabled by the visual hull. In addition, we propose an ``update-by-disagreement'' learning strategy to better handle data noise (e.g. inaccurate registration, scan noise) by discarding potentially inaccurate supervision signals during training. The resultant generalizable and robust topologically consistent multi-view facial capture system (GRAPE) can be readily used to capture data on a different camera array, reducing great effort on data collection and processing. Experiments on the FaMoS and FaceScape datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Cooperative vehicle and infrastructure LiDAR systems hold great potential, yet their implementation faces numerous challenges. Calibration of LiDAR systems across heterogeneous vehicle and infrastructure endpoints is a critical step to ensure the accuracy and consistency of perception system data, necessitating calibration methods that are real-time and stable. To this end, this paper introduces a novel calibration method for cooperative vehicle and road infrastructure LiDAR systems, which exploits spatial association information between detection boxes. The method centers around a novel Overall IoU metric that reflects the correlation of targets between vehicle and infrastructure, enabling real-time monitoring of calibration results. We search for common matching boxes between vehicle and infrastructure nodes by constructing an affinity matrix. Subsequently, these matching boxes undergo extrinsic parameter computation and optimization. Comparative and ablation experiments on the DAIR-V2X dataset confirm the superiority of our method. To better reflect the differences in calibration results, we have categorized the calibration tasks on the DAIR-V2X dataset based on their level of difficulty, enriching the dataset's utility for future research.

- **Summary**: Roads are an essential mode of transportation, and maintaining them is critical to economic growth and citizen well-being. With the continued advancement of AI, road surface inspection based on camera images has recently been extensively researched and can be performed automatically. However, because almost all of the deep learning methods for detecting road surface defects were optimized for a specific dataset, they are difficult to apply to a new, previously unseen dataset. Furthermore, there is a lack of research on training an efficient model using multiple data sources. In this paper, we propose a method for classifying road surface defects using camera images. In our method, we propose a scheme for dealing with the invariance of multiple data sources while training a model on multiple data sources. Furthermore, we present a domain generalization training algorithm for developing a generalized model that can work with new, completely unseen data sources without requiring model updates. We validate our method using an experiment with six data sources corresponding to six countries from the RDD2022 dataset. The results show that our method can efficiently classify road surface defects on previously unseen data.

- **Summary**: Current 3D self-supervised learning methods of 3D scenes face a data desert issue, resulting from the time-consuming and expensive collecting process of 3D scene data. Conversely, 3D shape datasets are easier to collect. Despite this, existing pre-training strategies on shape data offer limited potential for 3D scene understanding due to significant disparities in point quantities. To tackle these challenges, we propose Shape2Scene (S2S), a novel method that learns representations of large-scale 3D scenes from 3D shape data. We first design multiscale and high-resolution backbones for shape and scene level 3D tasks, i.e., MH-P (point-based) and MH-V (voxel-based). MH-P/V establishes direct paths to highresolution features that capture deep semantic information across multiple scales. This pivotal nature makes them suitable for a wide range of 3D downstream tasks that tightly rely on high-resolution features. We then employ a Shape-to-Scene strategy (S2SS) to amalgamate points from various shapes, creating a random pseudo scene (comprising multiple objects) for training data, mitigating disparities between shapes and scenes. Finally, a point-point contrastive loss (PPC) is applied for the pre-training of MH-P/V. In PPC, the inherent correspondence (i.e., point pairs) is naturally obtained in S2SS. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the transferability of 3D representations learned by MH-P/V across shape-level and scene-level 3D tasks. MH-P achieves notable performance on well-known point cloud datasets (93.8% OA on ScanObjectNN and 87.6% instance mIoU on ShapeNetPart). MH-V also achieves promising performance in 3D semantic segmentation and 3D object detection.

- **Summary**: Deformable image registration establishes non-linear spatial correspondences between fixed and moving images. Deep learning-based deformable registration methods have been widely studied in recent years due to their speed advantage over traditional algorithms as well as their better accuracy. Most existing deep learning-based methods require neural networks to encode location information in their feature maps and predict displacement or deformation fields though convolutional or fully connected layers from these high-dimensional feature maps. In this work, we present Vector Field Attention (VFA), a novel framework that enhances the efficiency of the existing network design by enabling direct retrieval of location correspondences. VFA uses neural networks to extract multi-resolution feature maps from the fixed and moving images and then retrieves pixel-level correspondences based on feature similarity. The retrieval is achieved with a novel attention module without the need of learnable parameters. VFA is trained end-to-end in either a supervised or unsupervised manner. We evaluated VFA for intra- and inter-modality registration and for unsupervised and semi-supervised registration using public datasets, and we also evaluated it on the Learn2Reg challenge. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of VFA compared to existing methods. The source code of VFA is publicly available at https://github.com/yihao6/vfa/.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel approach for 3D whole-body pose estimation, addressing the challenge of scale- and deformability- variance across body parts brought by the challenge of extending the 17 major joints on the human body to fine-grained keypoints on the face and hands. In addition to addressing the challenge of exploiting motion in unevenly sampled data, we combine stable diffusion to a hierarchical part representation which predicts the relative locations of fine-grained keypoints within each part (e.g., face) with respect to the part's local reference frame. On the H3WB dataset, our method greatly outperforms the current state of the art, which fails to exploit the temporal information. We also show considerable improvements compared to other spatiotemporal 3D human-pose estimation approaches that fail to account for the body part specificities.

- **Summary**: Although synthetic data can alleviate acquisition challenges in image dehazing tasks, it also introduces the problem of domain bias when dealing with small-scale data. This paper proposes a novel dual-branch collaborative unpaired dehazing model (DCM-dehaze) to address this issue. The proposed method consists of two collaborative branches: dehazing and contour constraints. Specifically, we design a dual depthwise separable convolutional module (DDSCM) to enhance the information expressiveness of deeper features and the correlation to shallow features. In addition, we construct a bidirectional contour function to optimize the edge features of the image to enhance the clarity and fidelity of the image details. Furthermore, we present feature enhancers via a residual dense architecture to eliminate redundant features of the dehazing process and further alleviate the domain deviation problem. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method reaches the state-of-the-art. This project code will be available at \url{https://github.com/Fan-pixel/DCM-dehaze.

- **Summary**: As a fundamental and extensively studied task in computer vision, image segmentation aims to locate and identify different semantic concepts at the pixel level. Recently, inspired by In-Context Learning (ICL), several generalist segmentation frameworks have been proposed, providing a promising paradigm for segmenting specific objects. However, existing works mostly ignore the value of visual prompts or simply apply similarity sorting to select contextual examples. In this paper, we focus on rethinking and improving the example selection strategy. By comprehensive comparisons, we first demonstrate that ICL-based segmentation models are sensitive to different contexts. Furthermore, empirical evidence indicates that the diversity of contextual prompts plays a crucial role in guiding segmentation. Based on the above insights, we propose a new stepwise context search method. Different from previous works, we construct a small yet rich candidate pool and adaptively search the well-matched contexts. More importantly, this method effectively reduces the annotation cost by compacting the search space. Extensive experiments show that our method is an effective strategy for selecting examples and enhancing segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a form of blood cancer that affects the white blood cells. ALL constitutes approximately 25% of pediatric cancers. Early diagnosis and treatment of ALL are crucial for improving patient outcomes. The task of identifying immature leukemic blasts from normal cells under the microscope can prove challenging, since the images of a healthy and cancerous cell appear similar morphologically. In this study, we propose a binary image classification model to assist in the diagnostic process of ALL. Our model takes as input microscopic images of blood samples and outputs a binary prediction of whether the sample is normal or cancerous. Our dataset consists of 10661 images out of 118 subjects. Deep learning techniques on convolutional neural network architectures were used to achieve accurate classification results. Our proposed method achieved 94.3% accuracy and could be used as an assisting tool for hematologists trying to predict the likelihood of a patient developing ALL.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have become increasingly popular because of their impressive ability for novel view synthesis. However, their effectiveness is hindered by the Rolling Shutter (RS) effects commonly found in most camera systems. To solve this, we present RS-NeRF, a method designed to synthesize normal images from novel views using input with RS distortions. This involves a physical model that replicates the image formation process under RS conditions and jointly optimizes NeRF parameters and camera extrinsic for each image row. We further address the inherent shortcomings of the basic RS-NeRF model by delving into the RS characteristics and developing algorithms to enhance its functionality. First, we impose a smoothness regularization to better estimate trajectories and improve the synthesis quality, in line with the camera movement prior. We also identify and address a fundamental flaw in the vanilla RS model by introducing a multi-sampling algorithm. This new approach improves the model's performance by comprehensively exploiting the RGB data across different rows for each intermediate camera pose. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate that RS-NeRF surpasses previous methods in both synthetic and real-world scenarios, proving its ability to correct RS-related distortions effectively.

- **Summary**: Segmenting tumors in histological images is vital for cancer diagnosis. While fully supervised models excel with pixel-level annotations, creating such annotations is labor-intensive and costly. Accurate histopathology image segmentation under weakly-supervised conditions with coarse-grained image labels is still a challenging problem. Although multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown promise in segmentation tasks, surprisingly, no previous pseudo-supervision methods have used MIL-based outputs as pseudo-masks for training. We suspect this stems from concerns over noises in MIL results affecting pseudo supervision quality. To explore the potential of leveraging MIL-based segmentation for pseudo supervision, we propose a novel distillation framework for histopathology image segmentation. This framework introduces a iterative fusion-knowledge distillation strategy, enabling the student model to learn directly from the teacher's comprehensive outcomes. Through dynamic role reversal between the fixed teacher and learnable student models and the incorporation of weighted cross-entropy loss for model optimization, our approach prevents performance deterioration and noise amplification during knowledge distillation. Experimental results on public histopathology datasets, Camelyon16 and Digestpath2019, demonstrate that our approach not only complements various MIL-based segmentation methods but also significantly enhances their performance. Additionally, our method achieves new SOTA in the field.

- **Summary**: The fabrication of visual misinformation on the web and social media has increased exponentially with the advent of foundational text-to-image diffusion models. Namely, Stable Diffusion inpainters allow the synthesis of maliciously inpainted images of personal and private figures, and copyrighted contents, also known as deepfakes. To combat such generations, a disruption framework, namely Photoguard, has been proposed, where it adds adversarial noise to the context image to disrupt their inpainting synthesis. While their framework suggested a diffusion-friendly approach, the disruption is not sufficiently strong and it requires a significant amount of GPU and time to immunize the context image. In our work, we re-examine both the minimal and favorable conditions for a successful inpainting disruption, proposing DDD, a "Digression guided Diffusion Disruption" framework. First, we identify the most adversarially vulnerable diffusion timestep range with respect to the hidden space. Within this scope of noised manifold, we pose the problem as a semantic digression optimization. We maximize the distance between the inpainting instance's hidden states and a semantic-aware hidden state centroid, calibrated both by Monte Carlo sampling of hidden states and a discretely projected optimization in the token space. Effectively, our approach achieves stronger disruption and a higher success rate than Photoguard while lowering the GPU memory requirement, and speeding the optimization up to three times faster.

- **Summary**: The problem of Rehearsal-Free Continual Learning (RFCL) aims to continually learn new knowledge while preventing forgetting of the old knowledge, without storing any old samples and prototypes. The latest methods leverage large-scale pre-trained models as the backbone and use key-query matching to generate trainable prompts to learn new knowledge. However, the domain gap between the pre-training dataset and the downstream datasets can easily lead to inaccuracies in key-query matching prompt selection when directly generating queries using the pre-trained model, which hampers learning new knowledge. Thus, in this paper, we propose a beyond prompt learning approach to the RFCL task, called Continual Adapter (C-ADA). It mainly comprises a parameter-extensible continual adapter layer (CAL) and a scaling and shifting (S&S) module in parallel with the pre-trained model. C-ADA flexibly extends specific weights in CAL to learn new knowledge for each task and freezes old weights to preserve prior knowledge, thereby avoiding matching errors and operational inefficiencies introduced by key-query matching. To reduce the gap, C-ADA employs an S&S module to transfer the feature space from pre-trained datasets to downstream datasets. Moreover, we propose an orthogonal loss to mitigate the interaction between old and new knowledge. Our approach achieves significantly improved performance and training speed, outperforming the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method. Additionally, we conduct experiments on domain-incremental learning, surpassing the SOTA, and demonstrating the generality of our approach in different settings.

- **Summary**: In order to improve the quality of synthesized videos, currently, one predominant method involves retraining an expert diffusion model and then implementing a noising-denoising process for refinement. Despite the significant training costs, maintaining consistency of content between the original and enhanced videos remains a major challenge. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel formulation that considers both visual quality and consistency of content. Consistency of content is ensured by a proposed loss function that maintains the structure of the input, while visual quality is improved by utilizing the denoising process of pretrained diffusion models. To address the formulated optimization problem, we have developed a plug-and-play noise optimization strategy, referred to as Noise Calibration. By refining the initial random noise through a few iterations, the content of original video can be largely preserved, and the enhancement effect demonstrates a notable improvement. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is crucial for applications such as security surveillance and autonomous driving. However, existing VAD methods provide little rationale behind detection, hindering public trust in real-world deployments. In this paper, we approach VAD with a reasoning framework. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown revolutionary reasoning ability, we find that their direct use falls short of VAD. Specifically, the implicit knowledge pre-trained in LLMs focuses on general context and thus may not apply to every specific real-world VAD scenario, leading to inflexibility and inaccuracy. To address this, we propose AnomalyRuler, a novel rule-based reasoning framework for VAD with LLMs. AnomalyRuler comprises two main stages: induction and deduction. In the induction stage, the LLM is fed with few-shot normal reference samples and then summarizes these normal patterns to induce a set of rules for detecting anomalies. The deduction stage follows the induced rules to spot anomalous frames in test videos. Additionally, we design rule aggregation, perception smoothing, and robust reasoning strategies to further enhance AnomalyRuler's robustness. AnomalyRuler is the first reasoning approach for the one-class VAD task, which requires only few-normal-shot prompting without the need for full-shot training, thereby enabling fast adaption to various VAD scenarios. Comprehensive experiments across four VAD benchmarks demonstrate AnomalyRuler's state-of-the-art detection performance and reasoning ability.

- **Summary**: Water caustics are commonly observed in seafloor imaging data from shallow-water areas. Traditional methods that remove caustic patterns from images often rely on 2D filtering or pre-training on an annotated dataset, hindering the performance when generalizing to real-world seafloor data with 3D structures. In this paper, we present a novel method Recurrent Gaussian Splatting, which takes advantage of today's photorealistic 3D reconstruction technology, 3DGS, to separate caustics from seafloor imagery. With a sequence of images taken by an underwater robot, we build 3DGS recursively and decompose the caustic with low-pass filtering in each iteration. In the experiments, we analyze and compare with different methods, including joint optimization, 2D filtering, and deep learning approaches. The results show that our method can effectively separate the caustic from the seafloor, improving the visual appearance.

- **Summary**: Federated semi-supervised learning (FedSemi) refers to scenarios where there may be clients with fully labeled data, clients with partially labeled, and even fully unlabeled clients while preserving data privacy. However, challenges arise from client drift due to undefined heterogeneous class distributions and erroneous pseudo-labels. Existing FedSemi methods typically fail to aggregate models from unlabeled clients due to their inherent unreliability, thus overlooking unique information from their heterogeneous data distribution, leading to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we enable unlabeled client aggregation through SemiAnAgg, a novel Semi-supervised Anchor-Based federated Aggregation. SemiAnAgg learns unlabeled client contributions via an anchor model, effectively harnessing their informative value. Our key idea is that by feeding local client data to the same global model and the same consistently initialized anchor model (i.e., random model), we can measure the importance of each unlabeled client accordingly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemiAnAgg achieves new state-of-the-art results on four widely used FedSemi benchmarks, leading to substantial performance improvements: a 9% increase in accuracy on CIFAR-100 and a 7.6% improvement in recall on the medical dataset ISIC-18, compared with prior state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: We introduce Tree D-fusion, featuring the first collection of 600,000 environmentally aware, 3D simulation-ready tree models generated through Diffusion priors. Each reconstructed 3D tree model corresponds to an image from Google's Auto Arborist Dataset, comprising street view images and associated genus labels of trees across North America. Our method distills the scores of two tree-adapted diffusion models by utilizing text prompts to specify a tree genus, thus facilitating shape reconstruction. This process involves reconstructing a 3D tree envelope filled with point markers, which are subsequently utilized to estimate the tree's branching structure using the space colonization algorithm conditioned on a specified genus.

- **Summary**: The objective of this study was to develop an automated pipeline that enhances thyroid disease classification using thyroid scintigraphy images, aiming to decrease assessment time and increase diagnostic accuracy. Anterior thyroid scintigraphy images from 2,643 patients were collected and categorized into diffuse goiter (DG), multinodal goiter (MNG), and thyroiditis (TH) based on clinical reports, and then segmented by an expert. A ResUNet model was trained to perform auto-segmentation. Radiomic features were extracted from both physician (scenario 1) and ResUNet segmentations (scenario 2), followed by omitting highly correlated features using Spearman's correlation, and feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with XGBoost as the core. All models were trained under leave-one-center-out cross-validation (LOCOCV) scheme, where nine instances of algorithms were iteratively trained and validated on data from eight centers and tested on the ninth for both scenarios separately. Segmentation performance was assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), while classification performance was assessed using metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC AUC), and area under the precision-recall curve (PRC AUC). ResUNet achieved DSC values of 0.84$\pm$0.03, 0.71$\pm$0.06, and 0.86$\pm$0.02 for MNG, TH, and DG, respectively. Classification in scenario 1 achieved an accuracy of 0.76$\pm$0.04 and a ROC AUC of 0.92$\pm$0.02 while in scenario 2, classification yielded an accuracy of 0.74$\pm$0.05 and a ROC AUC of 0.90$\pm$0.02. The automated pipeline demonstrated comparable performance to physician segmentations on several classification metrics across different classes, effectively reducing assessment time while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy.

- **Summary**: Precision in identifying nanometer-scale device-killer defects is crucial in both semiconductor research and development as well as in production processes. The effectiveness of existing ML-based approaches in this context is largely limited by the scarcity of data, as the production of real semiconductor wafer data for training these models involves high financial and time costs. Moreover, the existing simulation methods fall short of replicating images with identical noise characteristics, surface roughness and stochastic variations at advanced nodes. We propose a method for generating synthetic semiconductor SEM images using a diffusion model within a limited data regime. In contrast to images generated through conventional simulation methods, SEM images generated through our proposed DL method closely resemble real SEM images, replicating their noise characteristics and surface roughness adaptively. Our main contributions, which are validated on three different real semiconductor datasets, are: i) proposing a patch-based generative framework utilizing DDPM to create SEM images with intended defect classes, addressing challenges related to class-imbalance and data insufficiency, ii) demonstrating generated synthetic images closely resemble real SEM images acquired from the tool, preserving all imaging conditions and metrology characteristics without any metadata supervision, iii) demonstrating a defect detector trained on generated defect dataset, either independently or combined with a limited real dataset, can achieve similar or improved performance on real wafer SEM images during validation/testing compared to exclusive training on a real defect dataset, iv) demonstrating the ability of the proposed approach to transfer defect types, critical dimensions, and imaging conditions from one specified CD/Pitch and metrology specifications to another, thereby highlighting its versatility.
