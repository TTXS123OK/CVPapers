- **Summary**: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) represents the predominant framework in Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, covering aspects such as sub-typing, diagnosis, and beyond. Current MIL models predominantly rely on instance-level features derived from pretrained models such as ResNet. These models segment each WSI into independent patches and extract features from these local patches, leading to a significant loss of global spatial context and restricting the model's focus to merely local features. To address this issue, we propose a novel MIL framework, named SAM-MIL, that emphasizes spatial contextual awareness and explicitly incorporates spatial context by extracting comprehensive, image-level information. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a pioneering visual segmentation foundational model that can capture segmentation features without the need for additional fine-tuning, rendering it an outstanding tool for extracting spatial context directly from raw WSIs. Our approach includes the design of group feature extraction based on spatial context and a SAM-Guided Group Masking strategy to mitigate class imbalance issues. We implement a dynamic mask ratio for different segmentation categories and supplement these with representative group features of categories. Moreover, SAM-MIL divides instances to generate additional pseudo-bags, thereby augmenting the training set, and introduces consistency of spatial context across pseudo-bags to further enhance the model's performance. Experimental results on the CAMELYON-16 and TCGA Lung Cancer datasets demonstrate that our proposed SAM-MIL model outperforms existing mainstream methods in WSIs classification. Our open-source implementation code is is available at https://github.com/FangHeng/SAM-MIL.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised anomaly localization on industrial textured images has achieved remarkable results through reconstruction-based methods, yet existing approaches based on image reconstruction and feature reconstruc-tion each have their own shortcomings. Firstly, image-based methods tend to reconstruct both normal and anomalous regions well, which lead to over-generalization. Feature-based methods contain a large amount of distin-guishable semantic information, however, its feature structure is redundant and lacks anomalous information, which leads to significant reconstruction errors. In this paper, we propose an Anomaly Localization method based on Mamba with Feature Reconstruction and Refinement(ALMRR) which re-constructs semantic features based on Mamba and then refines them through a feature refinement module. To equip the model with prior knowledge of anomalies, we enhance it by adding artificially simulated anomalies to the original images. Unlike image reconstruction or repair, the features of synthesized defects are repaired along with those of normal areas. Finally, the aligned features containing rich semantic information are fed in-to the refinement module to obtain the anomaly map. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the MVTec-AD-Textured dataset and other real-world industrial dataset, which has demonstrated superior performance com-pared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

- **Summary**: Survival analysis stands as a pivotal process in cancer treatment research, crucial for predicting patient survival rates accurately. Recent advancements in data collection techniques have paved the way for enhancing survival predictions by integrating information from multiple modalities. However, real-world scenarios often present challenges with incomplete data, particularly when dealing with censored survival labels. Prior works have addressed missing modalities but have overlooked incomplete labels, which can introduce bias and limit model efficacy. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel framework that simultaneously handles incomplete data across modalities and censored survival labels. Our approach employs advanced foundation models to encode individual modalities and align them into a universal representation space for seamless fusion. By generating pseudo labels and incorporating uncertainty, we significantly enhance predictive accuracy. The proposed method demonstrates outstanding prediction accuracy in two survival analysis tasks on both employed datasets. This innovative approach overcomes limitations associated with disparate modalities and improves the feasibility of comprehensive survival analysis using multiple large foundation models.

- **Summary**: The advent of vision-language models fosters the interactive conversations between AI-enabled models and humans. Yet applying these models into clinics must deal with daunting challenges around large-scale training data, financial, and computational resources. Here we propose a cost-effective instruction learning framework for conversational pathology named as CLOVER. CLOVER only trains a lightweight module and uses instruction tuning while freezing the parameters of the large language model. Instead of using costly GPT-4, we propose well-designed prompts on GPT-3.5 for building generation-based instructions, emphasizing the utility of pathological knowledge derived from the Internet source. To augment the use of instructions, we construct a high-quality set of template-based instructions in the context of digital pathology. From two benchmark datasets, our findings reveal the strength of hybrid-form instructions in the visual question-answer in pathology. Extensive results show the cost-effectiveness of CLOVER in answering both open-ended and closed-ended questions, where CLOVER outperforms strong baselines that possess 37 times more training parameters and use instruction data generated from GPT-4. Through the instruction tuning, CLOVER exhibits robustness of few-shot learning in the external clinical dataset. These findings demonstrate that cost-effective modeling of CLOVER could accelerate the adoption of rapid conversational applications in the landscape of digital pathology.

- **Summary**: Fine-Grained Object Detection (FGOD) is a critical task in high-resolution aerial image analysis. This letter introduces Orthogonal Mapping (OM), a simple yet effective method aimed at addressing the challenge of semantic confusion inherent in FGOD. OM introduces orthogonal constraints in the feature space by decoupling features from the last layer of the classification branch with a class-wise orthogonal vector basis. This effectively mitigates semantic confusion and enhances classification accuracy. Moreover, OM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream object detectors. Extensive experiments conducted on three FGOD datasets (FAIR1M, ShipRSImageNet, and MAR20) demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. Notably, with just one line of code, OM achieves a 4.08% improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP) over FCOS on the ShipRSImageNet dataset. Codes are released at https://github.com/ZhuHaoranEIS/Orthogonal-FGOD.

- **Summary**: This paper study one challenging issue in incomplete multi-view clustering, where valuable complementary information from other views is always ignored. To be specific, we propose a framework that effectively balances Complementarity and Consistency information in Incomplete Multi-view Clustering (CoCo-IMC). Specifically, we design a dual network of delayed activation, which achieves a balance of complementarity and consistency among different views. The delayed activation could enriches the complementarity information that was ignored during consistency learning. Then, we recover the incomplete information and enhance the consistency learning by minimizing the conditional entropy and maximizing the mutual information across different views. This could be the first theoretical attempt to incorporate delayed activation into incomplete data recovery and the balance of complementarity and consistency. We have proved the effectiveness of CoCo-IMC in extensive comparative experiments with 12 state-of-the-art baselines on four publicly available datasets.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the focus is on improving the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (DR) using machine learning and deep learning technologies. Researchers have explored various approaches, including the use of high-definition medical imaging, AI-driven algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Among all the available tools, CNNs have emerged as a preferred tool due to their superior classification accuracy and efficiency. Although the accuracy of CNNs is comparatively better but it can be improved by introducing some hybrid models by combining various machine learning and deep learning models. Therefore, in this paper, an ensemble learning technique is proposed for early detection and management of DR with higher accuracy. The proposed model is tested on the APTOS dataset and it is showing supremacy on the validation accuracy ($99\%)$ in comparison to the previous models. Hence, the model can be helpful for early detection and treatment of the DR, thereby enhancing the overall quality of care for affected individuals.

- **Summary**: Accurately and promptly predicting accidents among surrounding traffic agents from camera footage is crucial for the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs). This task presents substantial challenges stemming from the unpredictable nature of traffic accidents, their long-tail distribution, the intricacies of traffic scene dynamics, and the inherently constrained field of vision of onboard cameras. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel accident anticipation framework for AVs, termed CRASH. It seamlessly integrates five components: object detector, feature extractor, object-aware module, context-aware module, and multi-layer fusion. Specifically, we develop the object-aware module to prioritize high-risk objects in complex and ambiguous environments by calculating the spatial-temporal relationships between traffic agents. In parallel, the context-aware is also devised to extend global visual information from the temporal to the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and capture fine-grained visual features of potential objects and broader context cues within traffic scenes. To capture a wider range of visual cues, we further propose a multi-layer fusion that dynamically computes the temporal dependencies between different scenes and iteratively updates the correlations between different visual features for accurate and timely accident prediction. Evaluated on real-world datasets--Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D) datasets--our model surpasses existing top baselines in critical evaluation metrics like Average Precision (AP) and mean Time-To-Accident (mTTA). Importantly, its robustness and adaptability are particularly evident in challenging driving scenarios with missing or limited training data, demonstrating significant potential for application in real-world autonomous driving systems.

- **Summary**: Rapid development of disease detection models using computer vision is crucial in responding to medical emergencies, such as epidemics or bioterrorism events. Traditional data collection methods are often too slow in these scenarios, requiring innovative approaches for quick, reliable model generation from minimal data. Our study introduces a novel approach by constructing a comprehensive computer vision model to detect Mpox lesions using only synthetic data. Initially, these models generated a diverse set of synthetic images representing Mpox lesions on various body parts (face, back, chest, leg, neck, arm) across different skin tones as defined by the Fitzpatrick scale (fair, brown, dark skin). Subsequently, we trained and tested a vision model with this synthetic dataset to evaluate the diffusion models' efficacy in producing high-quality training data and its impact on the vision model's medical image recognition performance. The results were promising; the vision model achieved a 97% accuracy rate, with 96% precision and recall for Mpox cases, and similarly high metrics for normal and other skin disorder cases, demonstrating its ability to correctly identify true positives and minimize false positives. The model achieved an F1-Score of 96% for Mpox cases and 98% for normal and other skin disorders, reflecting a balanced precision-recall relationship, thus ensuring reliability and robustness in its predictions. Our proposed SynthVision methodology indicates the potential to develop accurate computer vision models with minimal data input for future medical emergencies.

- **Summary**: ERIT is a novel multimodal dataset designed to facilitate research in a lightweight multimodal fusion. It contains text and image data collected from videos of elderly individuals reacting to various situations, as well as seven emotion labels for each data sample. Because of the use of labeled images of elderly users reacting emotionally, it is also facilitating research on emotion recognition in an underrepresented age group in machine learning visual emotion recognition. The dataset is validated through comprehensive experiments indicating its importance in neural multimodal fusion research.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates visual analogical reasoning in large multimodal models (LMMs) compared to human adults and children. A "visual analogy" is an abstract rule inferred from one image and applied to another. While benchmarks exist for testing visual reasoning in LMMs, they require advanced skills and omit basic visual analogies that even young children can make. Inspired by developmental psychology, we propose a new benchmark of 1,400 visual transformations of everyday objects to test LMMs on visual analogical reasoning and compare them to children and adults. We structure the evaluation into three stages: identifying what changed (e.g., color, number, etc.), how it changed (e.g., added one object), and applying the rule to new scenarios. Our findings show that while models like GPT-4V, LLaVA-1.5, and MANTIS identify the "what" effectively, they struggle with quantifying the "how" and extrapolating this rule to new objects. In contrast, children and adults exhibit much stronger analogical reasoning at all three stages. Additionally, the strongest tested model, GPT-4V, performs better in tasks involving simple visual attributes like color and size, correlating with quicker human adult response times. Conversely, more complex tasks such as number, rotation, and reflection, which necessitate extensive cognitive processing and understanding of the 3D physical world, present more significant challenges. Altogether, these findings highlight the limitations of training models on data that primarily consists of 2D images and text.

- **Summary**: With the recent burst of 2D and 3D data, cross-modal retrieval has attracted increasing attention recently. However, manual labeling by non-experts will inevitably introduce corrupted annotations given ambiguous 2D/3D content. Though previous works have addressed this issue by designing a naive division strategy with hand-crafted thresholds, their performance generally exhibits great sensitivity to the threshold value. Besides, they fail to fully utilize the valuable supervisory signals within each divided subset. To tackle this problem, we propose a Divide-and-conquer 2D-3D cross-modal Alignment and Correction framework (DAC), which comprises Multimodal Dynamic Division (MDD) and Adaptive Alignment and Correction (AAC). Specifically, the former performs accurate sample division by adaptive credibility modeling for each sample based on the compensation information within multimodal loss distribution. Then in AAC, samples in distinct subsets are exploited with different alignment strategies to fully enhance the semantic compactness and meanwhile alleviate over-fitting to noisy labels, where a self-correction strategy is introduced to improve the quality of representation. Moreover. To evaluate the effectiveness in real-world scenarios, we introduce a challenging noisy benchmark, namely Objaverse-N200, which comprises 200k-level samples annotated with 1156 realistic noisy labels. Extensive experiments on both traditional and the newly proposed benchmarks demonstrate the generality and superiority of our DAC, where DAC outperforms state-of-the-art models by a large margin. (i.e., with +5.9% gain on ModelNet40 and +5.8% on Objaverse-N200).

- **Summary**: In clinical applications, X-ray technology is vital for noninvasive examinations like mammography, providing essential anatomical information. However, the radiation risk associated with X-ray procedures raises concerns. X-ray reconstruction is crucial in medical imaging for detailed visual representations of internal structures, aiding diagnosis and treatment without invasive procedures. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have shown promise in X-ray reconstruction, but conventional DL methods often require centralized aggregation of large datasets, leading to domain shifts and privacy issues. To address these challenges, we introduce the Hierarchical Framework-based Federated Learning method (HF-Fed) for customized X-ray imaging. HF-Fed tackles X-ray imaging optimization by decomposing the problem into local data adaptation and holistic X-ray imaging. It employs a hospital-specific hierarchical framework and a shared common imaging network called Network of Networks (NoN) to acquire stable features from diverse data distributions. The hierarchical hypernetwork extracts domain-specific hyperparameters, conditioning the NoN for customized X-ray reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate HF-Fed's competitive performance, offering a promising solution for enhancing X-ray imaging without data sharing. This study significantly contributes to the literature on federated learning in healthcare, providing valuable insights for policymakers and healthcare providers. The source code and pre-trained HF-Fed model are available at \url{https://tisharepo.github.io/Webpage/}.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we explore a strategy that uses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to streamline, rather than augment, vision transformers. Each expert in an MoE layer is a SwiGLU feedforward network, where V and W2 are shared across the layer. No complex attention or convolutional mechanisms are employed. Depth-wise scaling is applied to progressively reduce the size of the hidden layer and the number of experts is increased in stages. Grouped query attention is used. We studied the proposed approach with and without pre-training on small datasets and investigated whether transfer learning works at this scale. We found that the architecture is competitive even at a size of 0.67M parameters.

- **Summary**: We present a novel discrete optimization-based approach to generate downsampled versions of binary images that are guaranteed to have the same topology as the original, measured by the zeroth and first Betti numbers of the black regions, while having good similarity to the original image as measured by IoU and Dice scores. To our best knowledge, all existing binary image downsampling methods do not have such topology-preserving guarantees. We also implemented a baseline morphological operation (dilation)-based approach that always generates topologically correct results. However, we found the similarity scores to be much worse. We demonstrate several applications of our approach. First, generating smaller versions of medical image segmentation masks for easier human inspection. Second, improving the efficiency of binary image operations, including persistent homology computation and shortest path computation, by substituting the original images with smaller ones. In particular, the latter is a novel application that is made feasible only by the full topology-preservation guarantee of our method.

- **Summary**: Humans are capable of solving complex abstract reasoning tests. Whether this ability reflects a learning-independent inference mechanism applicable to any novel unlearned problem or whether it is a manifestation of extensive training throughout life is an open question. Addressing this question in humans is challenging because it is impossible to control their prior training. However, assuming a similarity between the cognitive processing of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and humans, the extent to which training is required for ANNs' abstract reasoning is informative about this question in humans. Previous studies demonstrated that ANNs can solve abstract reasoning tests. However, this success required extensive training. In this study, we examined the learning-independent abstract reasoning of ANNs. Specifically, we evaluated their performance without any pretraining, with the ANNs' weights being randomly-initialized, and only change in the process of problem solving. We found that naive ANN models can solve non-trivial visual reasoning tests, similar to those used to evaluate human learning-independent reasoning. We further studied the mechanisms that support this ability. Our results suggest the possibility of learning-independent abstract reasoning that does not require extensive training.

- **Summary**: As a fundamental task in long-form video understanding, temporal action detection (TAD) aims to capture inherent temporal relations in untrimmed videos and identify candidate actions with precise boundaries. Over the years, various networks, including convolutions, graphs, and transformers, have been explored for effective temporal modeling for TAD. However, these modules typically treat past and future information equally, overlooking the crucial fact that changes in action boundaries are essentially causal events. Inspired by this insight, we propose leveraging the temporal causality of actions to enhance TAD representation by restricting the model's access to only past or future context. We introduce CausalTAD, which combines causal attention and causal Mamba to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably, with CausalTAD, we ranked 1st in the Action Recognition, Action Detection, and Audio-Based Interaction Detection tracks at the EPIC-Kitchens Challenge 2024, as well as 1st in the Moment Queries track at the Ego4D Challenge 2024.

- **Summary**: With Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models demonstrating powerful multimodal interaction capabilities, the application scenarios of neural networks are no longer confined to unimodal domains but have expanded to more complex multimodal V+L downstream tasks. The security vulnerabilities of unimodal models have been extensively examined, whereas those of VLP models remain challenging. We note that in CV models, the understanding of images comes from annotated information, while VLP models are designed to learn image representations directly from raw text. Motivated by this discrepancy, we developed the Feature Guidance Attack (FGA), a novel method that uses text representations to direct the perturbation of clean images, resulting in the generation of adversarial images. FGA is orthogonal to many advanced attack strategies in the unimodal domain, facilitating the direct application of rich research findings from the unimodal to the multimodal scenario. By appropriately introducing text attack into FGA, we construct Feature Guidance with Text Attack (FGA-T). Through the interaction of attacking two modalities, FGA-T achieves superior attack effects against VLP models. Moreover, incorporating data augmentation and momentum mechanisms significantly improves the black-box transferability of FGA-T. Our method demonstrates stable and effective attack capabilities across various datasets, downstream tasks, and both black-box and white-box settings, offering a unified baseline for exploring the robustness of VLP models.

- **Summary**: The integration of large language models (LLMs) with vision-language (VL) tasks has been a transformative development in the realm of artificial intelligence, highlighting the potential of LLMs as a versatile general-purpose chatbot. However, the current trend in this evolution focuses on the integration of vision and language to create models that can operate in more diverse and real-world contexts. We present a novel approach, termed Bottleneck Adapter, specifically crafted for enhancing the multimodal functionalities of these complex models, enabling joint optimization of the entire multimodal LLM framework through a process known as Multimodal Model Tuning (MMT). Our approach utilizes lightweight adapters to connect the image encoder and LLM without the need for large, complex neural networks. Unlike the conventional modular training schemes, our approach adopts an end-to-end optimization regime, which, when combined with the adapters, facilitates the joint optimization using a significantly smaller parameter set. Our method exhibits robust performance with 90.12\% accuracy, outperforming both human-level performance (88.4\%) and LaVIN-7B (89.41\%).

- **Summary**: Visual-Language Alignment (VLA) has gained a lot of attention since CLIP's groundbreaking work. Although CLIP performs well, the typical direct latent feature alignment lacks clarity in its representation and similarity scores. On the other hand, lexical representation, a vector whose element represents the similarity between the sample and a word from the vocabulary, is a natural sparse representation and interpretable, providing exact matches for individual words. However, lexical representations is difficult to learn due to no ground-truth supervision and false-discovery issues, and thus requires complex design to train effectively. In this paper, we introduce LexVLA, a more interpretable VLA framework by learning a unified lexical representation for both modalities without complex design. We use DINOv2 as our visual model for its local-inclined features and Llama 2, a generative language model, to leverage its in-context lexical prediction ability. To avoid the false discovery, we propose an overuse penalty to refrain the lexical representation from falsely frequently activating meaningless words. We demonstrate that these two pre-trained uni-modal models can be well-aligned by fine-tuning on modest multi-modal dataset and avoid intricate training configurations. On cross-modal retrieval benchmarks, LexVLA, trained on the CC-12M multi-modal dataset, outperforms baselines fine-tuned on larger datasets (e.g., YFCC15M) and those trained from scratch on even bigger datasets (e.g., 1.1B data, including CC-12M). We conduct extensive experiments to analyze LexVLA.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving is a challenging scenario for image segmentation due to the presence of uncontrolled environmental conditions and the eventually catastrophic consequences of failures. Previous work suggested that a biologically motivated computation, the so-called Divisive Normalization, could be useful to deal with image variability, but its effects have not been systematically studied over different data sources and environmental factors. Here we put segmentation U-nets augmented with Divisive Normalization to work far from training conditions to find where this adaptation is more critical. We categorize the scenes according to their radiance level and dynamic range (day/night), and according to their achromatic/chromatic contrasts. We also consider video game (synthetic) images to broaden the range of environments. We check the performance in the extreme percentiles of such categorization. Then, we push the limits further by artificially modifying the images in perceptually/environmentally relevant dimensions: luminance, contrasts and spectral radiance. Results show that neural networks with Divisive Normalization get better results in all the scenarios and their performance remains more stable with regard to the considered environmental factors and nature of the source. Finally, we explain the improvements in segmentation performance in two ways: (1) by quantifying the invariance of the responses that incorporate Divisive Normalization, and (2) by illustrating the adaptive nonlinearity of the different layers that depends on the local activity.

- **Summary**: Representing signals using coordinate networks dominates the area of inverse problems recently, and is widely applied in various scientific computing tasks. Still, there exists an issue of spectral bias in coordinate networks, limiting the capacity to learn high-frequency components. This problem is caused by the pathological distribution of the neural tangent kernel's (NTK's) eigenvalues of coordinate networks. We find that, this pathological distribution could be improved using classical normalization techniques (batch normalization and layer normalization), which are commonly used in convolutional neural networks but rarely used in coordinate networks. We prove that normalization techniques greatly reduces the maximum and variance of NTK's eigenvalues while slightly modifies the mean value, considering the max eigenvalue is much larger than the most, this variance change results in a shift of eigenvalues' distribution from a lower one to a higher one, therefore the spectral bias could be alleviated. Furthermore, we propose two new normalization techniques by combining these two techniques in different ways. The efficacy of these normalization techniques is substantiated by the significant improvements and new state-of-the-arts achieved by applying normalization-based coordinate networks to various tasks, including the image compression, computed tomography reconstruction, shape representation, magnetic resonance imaging, novel view synthesis and multi-view stereo reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Underwater monocular depth estimation serves as the foundation for tasks such as 3D reconstruction of underwater scenes. However, due to the influence of light and medium, the underwater environment undergoes a distinctive imaging process, which presents challenges in accurately estimating depth from a single image. The existing methods fail to consider the unique characteristics of underwater environments, leading to inadequate estimation results and limited generalization performance. Furthermore, underwater depth estimation requires extracting and fusing both local and global features, which is not fully explored in existing methods. In this paper, an end-to-end learning framework for underwater monocular depth estimation called UMono is presented, which incorporates underwater image formation model characteristics into network architecture, and effectively utilize both local and global features of underwater image. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for underwater monocular depth estimation and outperforms the existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative analyses.

- **Summary**: Point-based image editing enables accurate and flexible control through content dragging. However, the role of text embedding in the editing process has not been thoroughly investigated. A significant aspect that remains unexplored is the interaction between text and image embeddings. In this study, we show that during the progressive editing of an input image in a diffusion model, the text embedding remains constant. As the image embedding increasingly diverges from its initial state, the discrepancy between the image and text embeddings presents a significant challenge. Moreover, we found that the text prompt significantly influences the dragging process, particularly in maintaining content integrity and achieving the desired manipulation. To utilize these insights, we propose DragText, which optimizes text embedding in conjunction with the dragging process to pair with the modified image embedding. Simultaneously, we regularize the text optimization process to preserve the integrity of the original text prompt. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated with existing diffusion-based drag methods with only a few lines of code.

- **Summary**: Current methods commonly utilize three-branch structures of inversion, reconstruction, and editing, to tackle consistent image editing task. However, these methods lack control over the generation position of the edited object and have issues with background preservation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a tuning-free method with only two branches: inversion and editing. This approach allows users to simultaneously edit the object's action and control the generation position of the edited object. Additionally, it achieves improved background preservation. Specifically, we transfer the edited object information to the target area and repair or preserve the background of other areas during the inversion process at a specific time step. In the editing stage, we use the image features in self-attention to query the key and value of the corresponding time step in the inversion to achieve consistent image editing. Impressive image editing results and quantitative evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/mobiushy/move-act.

- **Summary**: Current image editing methods primarily utilize DDIM Inversion, employing a two-branch diffusion approach to preserve the attributes and layout of the original image. However, these methods encounter challenges with non-rigid edits, which involve altering the image's layout or structure. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that the high-frequency components of DDIM latent, crucial for retaining the original image's key features and layout, significantly contribute to these limitations. Addressing this, we introduce FlexiEdit, which enhances fidelity to input text prompts by refining DDIM latent, by reducing high-frequency components in targeted editing areas. FlexiEdit comprises two key components: (1) Latent Refinement, which modifies DDIM latent to better accommodate layout adjustments, and (2) Edit Fidelity Enhancement via Re-inversion, aimed at ensuring the edits more accurately reflect the input text prompts. Our approach represents notable progress in image editing, particularly in performing complex non-rigid edits, showcasing its enhanced capability through comparative experiments.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in graph-based approaches for multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) images have significantly propelled the field forward, offering deeper insights into patient-level phenotyping. However, current graph-based methodologies encounter two primary challenges: (1) Cellular Heterogeneity, where existing approaches fail to adequately address the inductive biases inherent in graphs, particularly the homophily characteristic observed in cellular connectivity and; (2) Scalability, where handling cellular graphs from high-dimensional images faces difficulties in managing a high number of cells. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Mew, a novel framework designed to efficiently process mIF images through the lens of multiplex network. Mew innovatively constructs a multiplex network comprising two distinct layers: a Voronoi network for geometric information and a Cell-type network for capturing cell-wise homogeneity. This framework equips a scalable and efficient Graph Neural Network (GNN), capable of processing the entire graph during training. Furthermore, Mew integrates an interpretable attention module that autonomously identifies relevant layers for image classification. Extensive experiments on a real-world patient dataset from various institutions highlight Mew's remarkable efficacy and efficiency, marking a significant advancement in mIF image analysis.

- **Summary**: The 3D point cloud (3DPC) has significantly evolved and benefited from the advance of deep learning (DL). However, the latter faces various issues, including the lack of data or annotated data, the existence of a significant gap between training data and test data, and the requirement for high computational resources. To that end, deep transfer learning (DTL), which decreases dependency and costs by utilizing knowledge gained from a source data/task in training a target data/task, has been widely investigated. Numerous DTL frameworks have been suggested for aligning point clouds obtained from several scans of the same scene. Additionally, DA, which is a subset of DTL, has been modified to enhance the point cloud data's quality by dealing with noise and missing points. Ultimately, fine-tuning and DA approaches have demonstrated their effectiveness in addressing the distinct difficulties inherent in point cloud data. This paper presents the first review shedding light on this aspect. it provides a comprehensive overview of the latest techniques for understanding 3DPC using DTL and domain adaptation (DA). Accordingly, DTL's background is first presented along with the datasets and evaluation metrics. A well-defined taxonomy is introduced, and detailed comparisons are presented, considering different aspects such as different knowledge transfer strategies, and performance. The paper covers various applications, such as 3DPC object detection, semantic labeling, segmentation, classification, registration, downsampling/upsampling, and denoising. Furthermore, the article discusses the advantages and limitations of the presented frameworks, identifies open challenges, and suggests potential research directions.

- **Summary**: Over the past decade, computer vision applications in minimally invasive surgery have rapidly increased. Despite this growth, the impact of surgical computer vision remains limited compared to other medical fields like pathology and radiology, primarily due to the scarcity of representative annotated data. Whereas transfer learning from large annotated datasets such as ImageNet has been conventionally the norm to achieve high-performing models, recent advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL) have demonstrated superior performance. In medical image analysis, in-domain SSL pretraining has already been shown to outperform ImageNet-based initialization. Although unlabeled data in the field of surgical computer vision is abundant, the diversity within this data is limited. This study investigates the role of dataset diversity in SSL for surgical computer vision, comparing procedure-specific datasets against a more heterogeneous general surgical dataset across three different downstream surgical applications. The obtained results show that using solely procedure-specific data can lead to substantial improvements of 13.8%, 9.5%, and 36.8% compared to ImageNet pretraining. However, extending this data with more heterogeneous surgical data further increases performance by an additional 5.0%, 5.2%, and 2.5%, suggesting that increasing diversity within SSL data is beneficial for model performance.

- **Summary**: Moving object segmentation based on LiDAR is a crucial and challenging task for autonomous driving and mobile robotics. Most approaches explore spatio-temporal information from LiDAR sequences to predict moving objects in the current frame. However, they often focus on transferring temporal cues in a single inference and regard every prediction as independent of others. This may cause inconsistent segmentation results for the same object in different frames. To overcome this issue, we propose a streaming network with a memory mechanism, called StreamMOS, to build the association of features and predictions among multiple inferences. Specifically, we utilize a short-term memory to convey historical features, which can be regarded as spatial prior of moving objects and adopted to enhance current inference by temporal fusion. Meanwhile, we build a long-term memory to store previous predictions and exploit them to refine the present forecast at voxel and instance levels through voting. Besides, we present multi-view encoder with cascade projection and asymmetric convolution to extract motion feature of objects in different representations. Extensive experiments validate that our algorithm gets competitive performance on SemanticKITTI and Sipailou Campus datasets. Code will be released at https://github.com/NEU-REAL/StreamMOS.git.

- **Summary**: Recently, object detection methods (OD; e.g., YOLO-based models) have been widely utilized in plant disease diagnosis. These methods demonstrate robustness to distance variations and excel at detecting small lesions compared to classification methods (CL; e.g., CNN models). However, there are issues such as low diagnostic performance for hard-to-detect diseases and high labeling costs. Additionally, since healthy cases cannot be explicitly trained, there is a risk of false positives. We propose the Hierarchical object detection and recognition framework (HODRF), a sophisticated and highly integrated two-stage system that combines the strengths of both OD and CL for plant disease diagnosis. In the first stage, HODRF uses OD to identify regions of interest (ROIs) without specifying the disease. In the second stage, CL diagnoses diseases surrounding the ROIs. HODRF offers several advantages: (1) Since OD detects only one type of ROI, HODRF can detect diseases with limited training images by leveraging its ability to identify other lesions. (2) While OD over-detects healthy cases, HODRF significantly reduces these errors by using CL in the second stage. (3) CL's accuracy improves in HODRF as it identifies diagnostic targets given as ROIs, making it less vulnerable to size changes. (4) HODRF benefits from CL's lower annotation costs, allowing it to learn from a larger number of images. We implemented HODRF using YOLOv7 for OD and EfficientNetV2 for CL and evaluated its performance on a large-scale dataset (4 crops, 20 diseased and healthy classes, 281K images). HODRF outperformed YOLOv7 alone by 5.8 to 21.5 points on healthy data and 0.6 to 7.5 points on macro F1 scores, and it improved macro F1 by 1.1 to 7.2 points over EfficientNetV2.

- **Summary**: We propose a variational inference approach to sample from the posterior distribution for solving inverse problems. From a pre-trained diffusion model, our approach trains a conditional flow model to minimize the divergence between the proposal variational distribution and the posterior distribution implicitly defined through the diffusion model. Once trained, the flow model is capable of sampling from the posterior distribution with a single NFE, amortized with respect to the measurement. The proposed method paves a new path for distilling a diffusion prior for efficient posterior sampling. We show that our method is applicable to standard signals in Euclidean space, as well as signals on manifold.

- **Summary**: Vision-based inspection algorithms have significantly contributed to quality control in industrial settings, particularly in addressing structural defects like dent and contamination which are prevalent in mass production. Extensive research efforts have led to the development of related benchmarks such as MVTec AD (Bergmann et al., 2019). However, in industrial settings, there can be instances of logical defects, where acceptable items are found in unsuitable locations or product pairs do not match as expected. Recent methods tackling logical defects effectively employ knowledge distillation to generate difference maps. Knowledge distillation (KD) is used to learn normal data distribution in unsupervised manner. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often overlook the potential false negatives. Excessive similarity between the teacher network and student network can hinder the generation of a suitable difference map for logical anomaly detection. This technical report provides insights on handling potential false negatives by utilizing a simple constraint in KD-based logical anomaly detection methods. We select EfficientAD as a state-of-the-art baseline and apply a margin-based constraint to its unsupervised learning scheme. Applying this constraint, we can improve the AUROC for MVTec LOCO AD by 1.3 %.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models revolutionize image generation by leveraging natural language to guide the creation of multimedia content. Despite significant advancements in such generative models, challenges persist in depicting detailed human-object interactions, especially regarding pose and object placement accuracy. We introduce a training-free method named Reasoning and Correcting Diffusion (ReCorD) to address these challenges. Our model couples Latent Diffusion Models with Visual Language Models to refine the generation process, ensuring precise depictions of HOIs. We propose an interaction-aware reasoning module to improve the interpretation of the interaction, along with an interaction correcting module to refine the output image for more precise HOI generation delicately. Through a meticulous process of pose selection and object positioning, ReCorD achieves superior fidelity in generated images while efficiently reducing computational requirements. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three benchmarks to demonstrate the significant progress in solving text-to-image generation tasks, showcasing ReCorD's ability to render complex interactions accurately by outperforming existing methods in HOI classification score, as well as FID and Verb CLIP-Score.

However, these oversee affine transformations which may represent better the changes in the images actually happening in natural conditions. Humans can be particularly invariant to these natural transformations, as opposed to the digital ones. In this work, we evaluate state-of-the-art deep image quality metrics by assessing their invariance to affine transformations, specifically: rotation, translation, scaling, and changes in spectral illumination. We propose a methodology to assign invisibility thresholds for any perceptual metric. This methodology involves transforming the distance measured by an arbitrary metric to a common distance representation based on available subjectively rated databases. We psychophysically measure an absolute detection threshold in that common representation and express it in the physical units of each affine transform for each metric. By doing so, we allow the analyzed metrics to be directly comparable with actual human thresholds. We find that none of the state-of-the-art metrics shows human-like results under this strong test based on invisibility thresholds. This means that tuning the models exclusively to predict the visibility of generic distortions may disregard other properties of human vision as for instance invariances or invisibility thresholds.

- **Summary**: Slot attention aims to decompose an input image into a set of meaningful object files (slots). These latent object representations enable various downstream tasks. Yet, these slots often bind to object parts, not objects themselves, especially for real-world datasets. To address this, we introduce Guided Latent Slot Diffusion - GLASS, an object-centric model that uses generated captions as a guiding signal to better align slots with objects. Our key insight is to learn the slot-attention module in the space of generated images. This allows us to repurpose the pre-trained diffusion decoder model, which reconstructs the images from the slots, as a semantic mask generator based on the generated captions. GLASS learns an object-level representation suitable for multiple tasks simultaneously, e.g., segmentation, image generation, and property prediction, outperforming previous methods. For object discovery, GLASS achieves approx. a +35% and +10% relative improvement for mIoU over the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method on the VOC and COCO datasets, respectively, and establishes a new SOTA FID score for conditional image generation amongst slot-attention-based methods. For the segmentation task, GLASS surpasses SOTA weakly-supervised and language-based segmentation models, which were specifically designed for the task.

- **Summary**: The recently proposed Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a general tool for image segmentation, but it requires additional adaptation and careful fine-tuning for medical image segmentation, especially for small, irregularly-shaped, and boundary-ambiguous anatomical structures such as the knee cartilage that is of interest in this work. Repaired cartilage, after certain surgical procedures, exhibits imaging patterns unseen to pre-training, posing further challenges for using models like SAM with or without general-purpose fine-tuning. To address this, we propose a novel registration-based prompt engineering framework for medical image segmentation using SAM. This approach utilises established image registration algorithms to align the new image (to-be-segmented) and a small number of reference images, without requiring segmentation labels. The spatial transformations generated by registration align either the new image or pre-defined point-based prompts, before using them as input to SAM. This strategy, requiring as few as five reference images with defined point prompts, effectively prompts SAM for inference on new images, without needing any segmentation labels. Evaluation of MR images from patients who received cartilage stem cell therapy yielded Dice scores of 0.89, 0.87, 0.53, and 0.52 for segmenting femur, tibia, femoral- and tibial cartilages, respectively. This outperforms atlas-based label fusion and is comparable to supervised nnUNet, an upper-bound fair baseline in this application, both of which require full segmentation labels for reference samples.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in molecular and genetic research have identified a diverse range of brain tumor sub-types, shedding light on differences in their molecular mechanisms, heterogeneity, and origins. The present study performs whole-brain connectome analysis using diffusionweighted images. To achieve this, both graph theory and persistent homology - a prominent approach in topological data analysis are employed in order to quantify changes in the structural connectivity of the wholebrain connectome in subjects with brain tumors. Probabilistic tractography is used to map the number of streamlines connecting 84 distinct brain regions, as delineated by the Desikan-Killiany atlas from FreeSurfer. These streamline mappings form the connectome matrix, on which persistent homology based analysis and graph theoretical analysis are executed to evaluate the discriminatory power between tumor sub-types that include meningioma and glioma. A detailed statistical analysis is conducted on persistent homology-derived topological features and graphical features to identify the brain regions where differences between study groups are statistically significant (p < 0.05). For classification purpose, graph-based local features are utilized, achieving a highest accuracy of 88%. In classifying tumor sub-types, an accuracy of 80% is attained. The findings obtained from this study underscore the potential of persistent homology and graph theoretical analysis of the whole-brain connectome in detecting alterations in structural connectivity patterns specific to different types of brain tumors.

- **Summary**: By training over large-scale datasets, zero-shot monocular depth estimation (MDE) methods show robust performance in the wild but often suffer from insufficiently precise details. Although recent diffusion-based MDE approaches exhibit appealing detail extraction ability, they still struggle in geometrically challenging scenes due to the difficulty of gaining robust geometric priors from diverse datasets. To leverage the complementary merits of both worlds, we propose BetterDepth to efficiently achieve geometrically correct affine-invariant MDE performance while capturing fine-grained details. Specifically, BetterDepth is a conditional diffusion-based refiner that takes the prediction from pre-trained MDE models as depth conditioning, in which the global depth context is well-captured, and iteratively refines details based on the input image. For the training of such a refiner, we propose global pre-alignment and local patch masking methods to ensure the faithfulness of BetterDepth to depth conditioning while learning to capture fine-grained scene details. By efficient training on small-scale synthetic datasets, BetterDepth achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot MDE performance on diverse public datasets and in-the-wild scenes. Moreover, BetterDepth can improve the performance of other MDE models in a plug-and-play manner without additional re-training.

- **Summary**: Empirically-determined scaling laws have been broadly successful in predicting the evolution of large machine learning models with training data and number of parameters. As a consequence, they have been useful for optimizing the allocation of limited resources, most notably compute time.   In certain applications, storage space is an important constraint, and data format needs to be chosen carefully as a consequence. Computer vision is a prominent example: images are inherently analog, but are always stored in a digital format using a finite number of bits. Given a dataset of digital images, the number of bits $L$ to store each of them can be further reduced using lossy data compression. This, however, can degrade the quality of the model trained on such images, since each example has lower resolution.   In order to capture this trade-off and optimize storage of training data, we propose a `storage scaling law' that describes the joint evolution of test error with sample size and number of bits per image. We prove that this law holds within a stylized model for image compression, and verify it empirically on two computer vision tasks, extracting the relevant parameters. We then show that this law can be used to optimize the lossy compression level. At given storage, models trained on optimally compressed images present a significantly smaller test error with respect to models trained on the original data. Finally, we investigate the potential benefits of randomizing the compression level.

- **Summary**: The advancement of deep learning in object detection has predominantly focused on megapixel images, leaving a critical gap in the efficient processing of gigapixel images. These super high-resolution images present unique challenges due to their immense size and computational demands. To address this, we introduce 'SaccadeDet', an innovative architecture for gigapixel-level object detection, inspired by the human eye saccadic movement. The cornerstone of SaccadeDet is its ability to strategically select and process image regions, dramatically reducing computational load. This is achieved through a two-stage process: the 'saccade' stage, which identifies regions of probable interest, and the 'gaze' stage, which refines detection in these targeted areas. Our approach, evaluated on the PANDA dataset, not only achieves an 8x speed increase over the state-of-the-art methods but also demonstrates significant potential in gigapixel-level pathology analysis through its application to Whole Slide Imaging.

- **Summary**: Language-driven grasp detection is a fundamental yet challenging task in robotics with various industrial applications. In this work, we present a new approach for language-driven grasp detection that leverages the concept of lightweight diffusion models to achieve fast inference time. By integrating diffusion processes with grasping prompts in natural language, our method can effectively encode visual and textual information, enabling more accurate and versatile grasp positioning that aligns well with the text query. To overcome the long inference time problem in diffusion models, we leverage the image and text features as the condition in the consistency model to reduce the number of denoising timesteps during inference. The intensive experimental results show that our method outperforms other recent grasp detection methods and lightweight diffusion models by a clear margin. We further validate our method in real-world robotic experiments to demonstrate its fast inference time capability.

- **Summary**: The integration of miniaturized spectrometers into mobile devices offers new avenues for image quality enhancement and facilitates novel downstream tasks. However, the broader application of spectral sensors in mobile photography is hindered by the inherent complexity of spectral images and the constraints of spectral imaging capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we propose a joint RGB-Spectral decomposition model guided enhancement framework, which consists of two steps: joint decomposition and prior-guided enhancement. Firstly, we leverage the complementarity between RGB and Low-resolution Multi-Spectral Images (Lr-MSI) to predict shading, reflectance, and material semantic priors. Subsequently, these priors are seamlessly integrated into the established HDRNet to promote dynamic range enhancement, color mapping, and grid expert learning, respectively. Additionally, we construct a high-quality Mobile-Spec dataset to support our research, and our experiments validate the effectiveness of Lr-MSI in the tone enhancement task. This work aims to establish a solid foundation for advancing spectral vision in mobile photography. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/CalayZhou/JDM-HDRNet}.

- **Summary**: The development of practical and robust automated diagnostic systems for identifying plant pests is crucial for efficient agricultural production. In this paper, we first investigate three key research questions (RQs) that have not been addressed thus far in the field of image-based plant pest identification. Based on the knowledge gained, we then develop an accurate, robust, and fast plant pest identification framework using 334K images comprising 78 combinations of four plant portions (the leaf front, leaf back, fruit, and flower of cucumber, tomato, strawberry, and eggplant) and 20 pest species captured at 27 farms. The results reveal the following. (1) For an appropriate evaluation of the model, the test data should not include images of the field from which the training images were collected, or other considerations to increase the diversity of the test set should be taken into account. (2) Pre-extraction of ROIs, such as leaves and fruits, helps to improve identification accuracy. (3) Integration of closely related species using the same control methods and cross-crop training methods for the same pests, are effective. Our two-stage plant pest identification framework, enabling ROI detection and convolutional neural network (CNN)-based identification, achieved a highly practical performance of 91.0% and 88.5% in mean accuracy and macro F1 score, respectively, for 12,223 instances of test data of 21 classes collected from unseen fields, where 25 classes of images from 318,971 samples were used for training; the average identification time was 476 ms/image.

- **Summary**: Neural networks have emerged as powerful tools across various applications, yet their decision-making process often remains opaque, leading to them being perceived as "black boxes." This opacity raises concerns about their interpretability and reliability, especially in safety-critical scenarios. Network inversion techniques offer a solution by allowing us to peek inside these black boxes, revealing the features and patterns learned by the networks behind their decision-making processes and thereby provide valuable insights into how neural networks arrive at their conclusions, making them more interpretable and trustworthy. This paper presents a simple yet effective approach to network inversion using a carefully conditioned generator that learns the data distribution in the input space of the trained neural network, enabling the reconstruction of inputs that would most likely lead to the desired outputs. To capture the diversity in the input space for a given output, instead of simply revealing the conditioning labels to the generator, we hideously encode the conditioning label information into vectors, further exemplified by heavy dropout in the generation process and minimisation of cosine similarity between the features corresponding to the generated images. The paper concludes with immediate applications of Network Inversion including in interpretability, explainability and generation of adversarial samples.

- **Summary**: Inverse problems, such as accelerated MRI reconstruction, are ill-posed and an infinite amount of possible and plausible solutions exist. This may not only lead to uncertainty in the reconstructed image but also in downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation. This uncertainty, however, is mostly not analyzed in the literature, even though probabilistic reconstruction models are commonly used. These models can be prone to ignore plausible but unlikely solutions like rare pathologies. Building on MRI reconstruction approaches based on diffusion models, we add guidance to the diffusion process during inference, generating two meaningfully diverse reconstructions corresponding to an upper and lower bound segmentation. The reconstruction uncertainty can then be quantified by the difference between these bounds, which we coin the 'uncertainty boundary'. We analyzed the behavior of the upper and lower bound segmentations for a wide range of acceleration factors and found the uncertainty boundary to be both more reliable and more accurate compared to repeated sampling.

- **Summary**: Recently, there has been a significant amount of research conducted on 3D hand reconstruction to use various forms of human-computer interaction. However, 3D hand reconstruction in the wild is challenging due to extreme lack of in-the-wild 3D hand datasets. Especially, when hands are in complex pose such as interacting hands, the problems like appearance similarity, self-handed occclusion and depth ambiguity make it more difficult. To overcome these issues, we propose AttentionHand, a novel method for text-driven controllable hand image generation. Since AttentionHand can generate various and numerous in-the-wild hand images well-aligned with 3D hand label, we can acquire a new 3D hand dataset, and can relieve the domain gap between indoor and outdoor scenes. Our method needs easy-to-use four modalities (i.e, an RGB image, a hand mesh image from 3D label, a bounding box, and a text prompt). These modalities are embedded into the latent space by the encoding phase. Then, through the text attention stage, hand-related tokens from the given text prompt are attended to highlight hand-related regions of the latent embedding. After the highlighted embedding is fed to the visual attention stage, hand-related regions in the embedding are attended by conditioning global and local hand mesh images with the diffusion-based pipeline. In the decoding phase, the final feature is decoded to new hand images, which are well-aligned with the given hand mesh image and text prompt. As a result, AttentionHand achieved state-of-the-art among text-to-hand image generation models, and the performance of 3D hand mesh reconstruction was improved by additionally training with hand images generated by AttentionHand.

- **Summary**: Natural images captured by mobile devices often suffer from multiple types of degradation, such as noise, blur, and low light. Traditional image restoration methods require manual selection of specific tasks, algorithms, and execution sequences, which is time-consuming and may yield suboptimal results. All-in-one models, though capable of handling multiple tasks, typically support only a limited range and often produce overly smooth, low-fidelity outcomes due to their broad data distribution fitting. To address these challenges, we first define a new pipeline for restoring images with multiple degradations, and then introduce RestoreAgent, an intelligent image restoration system leveraging multimodal large language models. RestoreAgent autonomously assesses the type and extent of degradation in input images and performs restoration through (1) determining the appropriate restoration tasks, (2) optimizing the task sequence, (3) selecting the most suitable models, and (4) executing the restoration. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of RestoreAgent in handling complex degradation, surpassing human experts. Furthermore, the system modular design facilitates the fast integration of new tasks and models, enhancing its flexibility and scalability for various applications.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation and stereo matching, respectively analogous to the ventral and dorsal streams in our human brain, are two key components of autonomous driving perception systems. Addressing these two tasks with separate networks is no longer the mainstream direction in developing computer vision algorithms, particularly with the recent advances in large vision models and embodied artificial intelligence. The trend is shifting towards combining them within a joint learning framework, especially emphasizing feature sharing between the two tasks. The major contributions of this study lie in comprehensively tightening the coupling between semantic segmentation and stereo matching. Specifically, this study introduces three novelties: (1) a tightly coupled, gated feature fusion strategy, (2) a hierarchical deep supervision strategy, and (3) a coupling tightening loss function. The combined use of these technical contributions results in TiCoSS, a state-of-the-art joint learning framework that simultaneously tackles semantic segmentation and stereo matching. Through extensive experiments on the KITTI and vKITTI2 datasets, along with qualitative and quantitative analyses, we validate the effectiveness of our developed strategies and loss function, and demonstrate its superior performance compared to prior arts, with a notable increase in mIoU by over 9%. Our source code will be publicly available at mias.group/TiCoSS upon publication.

- **Summary**: In a multi-sensor fusion system composed of cameras and LiDAR, precise extrinsic calibration contributes to the system's long-term stability and accurate perception of the environment. However, methods based on extracting and registering corresponding points still face challenges in terms of automation and precision. This paper proposes a novel fully automatic extrinsic calibration method for LiDAR-camera systems that circumvents the need for corresponding point registration. In our approach, a novel algorithm to extract required LiDAR correspondence point is proposed. This method can effectively filter out irrelevant points by computing the orientation of plane point clouds and extracting points by applying distance- and density-based thresholds. We avoid the need for corresponding point registration by introducing extrinsic parameters between the LiDAR and camera into the projection of extracted points and constructing co-planar constraints. These parameters are then optimized to solve for the extrinsic. We validated our method across multiple sets of LiDAR-camera systems. In synthetic experiments, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to current calibration techniques. Real-world data experiments further confirm the precision and robustness of the proposed algorithm, with average rotation and translation calibration errors between LiDAR and camera of less than 0.05 degree and 0.015m, respectively. This method enables automatic and accurate extrinsic calibration in a single one step, emphasizing the potential of calibration algorithms beyond using corresponding point registration to enhance the automation and precision of LiDAR-camera system calibration.

- **Summary**: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have significantly advanced the field of arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR) of images. Most existing INR-based ASSR networks first extract features from the given low-resolution image using an encoder, and then render the super-resolved result via a multi-layer perceptron decoder. Although these approaches have shown promising results, their performance is constrained by the limited representation ability of discrete latent codes in the encoded features. In this paper, we propose a novel ASSR method named GaussianSR that overcomes this limitation through 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS). Unlike traditional methods that treat pixels as discrete points, GaussianSR represents each pixel as a continuous Gaussian field. The encoded features are simultaneously refined and upsampled by rendering the mutually stacked Gaussian fields. As a result, long-range dependencies are established to enhance representation ability. In addition, a classifier is developed to dynamically assign Gaussian kernels to all pixels to further improve flexibility. All components of GaussianSR (i.e., encoder, classifier, Gaussian kernels, and decoder) are jointly learned end-to-end. Experiments demonstrate that GaussianSR achieves superior ASSR performance with fewer parameters than existing methods while enjoying interpretable and content-aware feature aggregations.

- **Summary**: The segmentation of cell nuclei in tissue images stained with the blood dye hematoxylin and eosin (H$\&$E) is essential for various clinical applications and analyses. Due to the complex characteristics of cellular morphology, a large receptive field is considered crucial for generating high-quality segmentation. However, previous methods face challenges in achieving a balance between the receptive field and computational burden. To address this issue, we propose LKCell, a high-accuracy and efficient cell segmentation method. Its core insight lies in unleashing the potential of large convolution kernels to achieve computationally efficient large receptive fields. Specifically, (1) We transfer pre-trained large convolution kernel models to the medical domain for the first time, demonstrating their effectiveness in cell segmentation. (2) We analyze the redundancy of previous methods and design a new segmentation decoder based on large convolution kernels. It achieves higher performance while significantly reducing the number of parameters. We evaluate our method on the most challenging benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art results (0.5080 mPQ) in cell nuclei instance segmentation with only 21.6% FLOPs compared with the previous leading method.

- **Summary**: We introduce Human-like Video Models (HVM-1), large-scale video models pretrained with nearly 5000 hours of curated human-like video data (mostly egocentric, temporally extended, continuous video recordings), using the spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (ST-MAE) algorithm. We release two 633M parameter models trained at spatial resolutions of 224x224 and 448x448 pixels. We evaluate the performance of these models in downstream few-shot video and image recognition tasks and compare them against a model pretrained with 1330 hours of short action-oriented video clips from YouTube (Kinetics-700). HVM-1 models perform competitively against the Kinetics-700 pretrained model in downstream evaluations despite substantial qualitative differences between the spatiotemporal characteristics of the corresponding pretraining datasets. HVM-1 models also learn more accurate and more robust object representations compared to models pretrained with the image-based MAE algorithm on the same data, demonstrating the potential benefits of learning to predict temporal regularities in natural videos for learning better object representations.

- **Summary**: Deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures, have become the focus of extensive research in medical image segmentation, achieving impressive results. However, CNNs come with inductive biases that limit their effectiveness in more complex, varied segmentation scenarios. Conversely, while Transformer-based methods excel at capturing global and long-range semantic details, they suffer from high computational demands. In this study, we propose CSWin-UNet, a novel U-shaped segmentation method that incorporates the CSWin self-attention mechanism into the UNet to facilitate horizontal and vertical stripes self-attention. This method significantly enhances both computational efficiency and receptive field interactions. Additionally, our innovative decoder utilizes a content-aware reassembly operator that strategically reassembles features, guided by predicted kernels, for precise image resolution restoration. Our extensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets, including synapse multi-organ CT, cardiac MRI, and skin lesions, demonstrate that CSWin-UNet maintains low model complexity while delivering high segmentation accuracy.

- **Summary**: Stripe-like space target detection (SSTD) plays a key role in enhancing space situational awareness and assessing spacecraft behaviour. This domain faces three challenges: the lack of publicly available datasets, interference from stray light and stars, and the variability of stripe-like targets, which complicates pixel-level annotation. In response, we introduces `AstroStripeSet', a pioneering dataset designed for SSTD, aiming to bridge the gap in academic resources and advance research in SSTD. Furthermore, we propose a novel pseudo-label evolution teacher-student framework with single-point supervision. This framework starts with generating initial pseudo-labels using the zero-shot capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in a single-point setting, and refines these labels iteratively. In our framework, the fine-tuned StripeSAM serves as the teacher and the newly developed StripeNet as the student, consistently improving segmentation performance by improving the quality of pseudo-labels. We also introduce `GeoDice', a new loss function customized for the linear characteristics of stripe-like targets. Extensive experiments show that the performance of our approach matches fully supervised methods on all evaluation metrics, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmark. Our dataset and code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: This study investigates the interpretability, classification, and segmentation of CT-scan images of rock samples, with a particular focus on the application of DINOv2 within Geosciences. We compared various segmentation techniques to evaluate their efficacy, efficiency, and adaptability in geological image analysis. The methods assessed include the Otsu thresholding method, clustering techniques (K-means and fuzzy C-means), a supervised machine learning approach (Random Forest), and deep learning methods (UNet and DINOv2). We tested these methods using ten binary sandstone datasets and three multi-class calcite datasets. To begin, we provide a thorough interpretability analysis of DINOv2's features in the geoscientific context, discussing its suitability and inherent ability to process CT-scanned rock data. In terms of classification, the out-of-the-box DINOv2 demonstrates an impressive capability to perfectly classify rock images, even when the CT scans are out of its original training set. Regarding segmentation, thresholding and unsupervised methods, while fast, perform poorly despite image preprocessing, whereas supervised methods show better results. We underscore the computational demands of deep learning but highlight its minimal intervention, superior generalization, and performance without additional image preprocessing. Additionally, we observe a lack of correlation between a network's depth or the number of parameters and its performance. Our results show that a LoRA fine-tuned DINOv2 excels in out-of-distribution segmentation and significantly outperforms other methods in multi-class segmentation. By systematically comparing these methods, we identify the most efficient strategy for meticulous and laborious segmentation tasks. DINOv2 proves advantageous, achieving segmentations that could be described as "better than ground-truth" against relatively small training sets.

- **Summary**: Computer vision models are increasingly capable of classifying ovarian epithelial cancer subtypes, but they differ from pathologists by processing small tissue patches at a single resolution. Multi-resolution graph models leverage the spatial relationships of patches at multiple magnifications, learning the context for each patch. In this study, we conduct the most thorough validation of a graph model for ovarian cancer subtyping to date. Seven models were tuned and trained using five-fold cross-validation on a set of 1864 whole slide images (WSIs) from 434 patients treated at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. The cross-validation models were ensembled and evaluated using a balanced hold-out test set of 100 WSIs from 30 patients, and an external validation set of 80 WSIs from 80 patients in the Transcanadian Study. The best-performing model, a graph model using 10x+20x magnification data, gave balanced accuracies of 73%, 88%, and 99% in cross-validation, hold-out testing, and external validation, respectively. However, this only exceeded the performance of attention-based multiple instance learning in external validation, with a 93% balanced accuracy. Graph models benefitted greatly from using the UNI foundation model rather than an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet50 for feature extraction, with this having a much greater effect on performance than changing the subsequent classification approach. The accuracy of the combined foundation model and multi-resolution graph network offers a step towards the clinical applicability of these models, with a new highest-reported performance for this task, though further validations are still required to ensure the robustness and usability of the models.

- **Summary**: Occluded Person Re-Identification (ReID) is a metric learning task that involves matching occluded individuals based on their appearance. While many studies have tackled occlusions caused by objects, multi-person occlusions remain less explored. In this work, we identify and address a critical challenge overlooked by previous occluded ReID methods: the Multi-Person Ambiguity (MPA) arising when multiple individuals are visible in the same bounding box, making it impossible to determine the intended ReID target among the candidates. Inspired by recent work on prompting in vision, we introduce Keypoint Promptable ReID (KPR), a novel formulation of the ReID problem that explicitly complements the input bounding box with a set of semantic keypoints indicating the intended target. Since promptable re-identification is an unexplored paradigm, existing ReID datasets lack the pixel-level annotations necessary for prompting. To bridge this gap and foster further research on this topic, we introduce Occluded-PoseTrack ReID, a novel ReID dataset with keypoints labels, that features strong inter-person occlusions. Furthermore, we release custom keypoint labels for four popular ReID benchmarks. Experiments on person retrieval, but also on pose tracking, demonstrate that our method systematically surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches on various occluded scenarios. Our code, dataset and annotations are available at https://github.com/VlSomers/keypoint_promptable_reidentification.

- **Summary**: In the field of instruction-following large vision-language models (LVLMs), the efficient deployment of these models faces challenges, notably due to the high memory demands of their key-value (KV) caches. Conventional cache management strategies for LLMs focus on cache eviction, which often fails to address the specific needs of multimodal instruction-following models. Recognizing this gap, in this paper, we introduce Elastic Cache, a novel approach that benefits from applying distinct acceleration methods for instruction encoding and output generation stages. We investigate the metrics of importance in different stages and propose an importance-driven cache merging strategy to prune redundancy caches. Instead of discarding less important caches, our strategy identifies important key/value vectors as anchor points. Surrounding less important caches are then merged with these anchors, enhancing the preservation of contextual information in the KV caches while yielding an arbitrary acceleration ratio. For instruction encoding, we utilize the frequency to evaluate the importance of caches. Regarding output generation, we prioritize tokens based on their distance with an offset, by which both the initial and most recent tokens are retained. Results on a range of LVLMs demonstrate that Elastic Cache not only boosts efficiency but also notably outperforms existing pruning methods in language generation across various tasks.

- **Summary**: In the last few years, deep neural networks have been extensively applied in the medical domain for different tasks, ranging from image classification and segmentation to landmark detection. However, the application of these technologies in the medical domain is often hindered by data scarcity, both in terms of available annotations and images. This study introduces a new self-supervised pre-training protocol based on diffusion models for landmark detection in x-ray images. Our results show that the proposed self-supervised framework can provide accurate landmark detection with a minimal number of available annotated training images (up to 50), outperforming ImageNet supervised pre-training and state-of-the-art self-supervised pre-trainings for three popular x-ray benchmark datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first exploration of diffusion models for self-supervised learning in landmark detection, which may offer a valuable pre-training approach in few-shot regimes, for mitigating data scarcity.

- **Summary**: Earthquakes are commonly estimated using physical seismic stations, however, due to the installation requirements and costs of these stations, global coverage quickly becomes impractical. An efficient and lower-cost alternative is to develop machine learning models to globally monitor earth observation data to pinpoint regions impacted by these natural disasters. However, due to the small amount of historically recorded earthquakes, this becomes a low-data regime problem requiring algorithmic improvements to achieve peak performance when learning to regress earthquake magnitude. In this paper, we propose to pose the estimation of earthquake magnitudes as a metric-learning problem, training models to not only estimate earthquake magnitude from Sentinel-1 satellite imagery but to additionally rank pairwise samples. Our experiments show at max a 30%+ improvement in MAE over prior regression-only based methods, particularly transformer-based architectures.

- **Summary**: Learning good representations involves capturing the diverse ways in which data samples relate. Contrastive loss - an objective matching related samples - underlies methods from self-supervised to multimodal learning. Contrastive losses, however, can be viewed more broadly as modifying a similarity graph to indicate how samples should relate in the embedding space. This view reveals a shortcoming in contrastive learning: the similarity graph is binary, as only one sample is the related positive sample. Crucially, similarities \textit{across} samples are ignored. Based on this observation, we revise the standard contrastive loss to explicitly encode how a sample relates to others. We experiment with this new objective, called $\mathbb{X}$-Sample Contrastive, to train vision models based on similarities in class or text caption descriptions. Our study spans three scales: ImageNet-1k with 1 million, CC3M with 3 million, and CC12M with 12 million samples. The representations learned via our objective outperform both contrastive self-supervised and vision-language models trained on the same data across a range of tasks. When training on CC12M, we outperform CLIP by $0.6\%$ on both ImageNet and ImageNet Real. Our objective appears to work particularly well in lower-data regimes, with gains over CLIP of $16.8\%$ on ImageNet and $18.1\%$ on ImageNet Real when training with CC3M. Finally, our objective seems to encourage the model to learn representations that separate objects from their attributes and backgrounds, with gains of $3.3$-$5.6$\% over CLIP on ImageNet9. We hope the proposed solution takes a small step towards developing richer learning objectives for understanding sample relations in foundation models.

- **Summary**: Small Video Object Detection (SVOD) is a crucial subfield in modern computer vision, essential for early object discovery and detection. However, existing SVOD datasets are scarce and suffer from issues such as insufficiently small objects, limited object categories, and lack of scene diversity, leading to unitary application scenarios for corresponding methods. To address this gap, we develop the XS-VID dataset, which comprises aerial data from various periods and scenes, and annotates eight major object categories. To further evaluate existing methods for detecting extremely small objects, XS-VID extensively collects three types of objects with smaller pixel areas: extremely small (\textit{es}, $0\sim12^2$), relatively small (\textit{rs}, $12^2\sim20^2$), and generally small (\textit{gs}, $20^2\sim32^2$). XS-VID offers unprecedented breadth and depth in covering and quantifying minuscule objects, significantly enriching the scene and object diversity in the dataset. Extensive validations on XS-VID and the publicly available VisDrone2019VID dataset show that existing methods struggle with small object detection and significantly underperform compared to general object detectors. Leveraging the strengths of previous methods and addressing their weaknesses, we propose YOLOFT, which enhances local feature associations and integrates temporal motion features, significantly improving the accuracy and stability of SVOD. Our datasets and benchmarks are available at \url{https://gjhhust.github.io/XS-VID/}.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation models are typically trained on a fixed set of classes, limiting their applicability in open-world scenarios. Class-incremental semantic segmentation aims to update models with emerging new classes while preventing catastrophic forgetting of previously learned ones. However, existing methods impose strict rigidity on old classes, reducing their effectiveness in learning new incremental classes. In this work, we propose Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized Incremental-Class Segmentation (TOPICS) that learns feature embeddings in hyperbolic space following explicit taxonomy-tree structures. This supervision provides plasticity for old classes, updating ancestors based on new classes while integrating new classes at fitting positions. Additionally, we maintain implicit class relational constraints on the geometric basis of the Poincar\'e ball. This ensures that the latent space can continuously adapt to new constraints while maintaining a robust structure to combat catastrophic forgetting. We also establish eight realistic incremental learning protocols for autonomous driving scenarios, where novel classes can originate from known classes or the background. Extensive evaluations of TOPICS on the Cityscapes and Mapillary Vistas 2.0 benchmarks demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance. We make the code and trained models publicly available at http://topics.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

- **Summary**: Vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated their superior accuracy for computer vision tasks compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, ViT models are often computation-intensive for efficient deployment on resource-limited edge devices. This work proposes Quasar-ViT, a hardware-oriented quantization-aware architecture search framework for ViTs, to design efficient ViT models for hardware implementation while preserving the accuracy. First, Quasar-ViT trains a supernet using our row-wise flexible mixed-precision quantization scheme, mixed-precision weight entanglement, and supernet layer scaling techniques. Then, it applies an efficient hardware-oriented search algorithm, integrated with hardware latency and resource modeling, to determine a series of optimal subnets from supernet under different inference latency targets. Finally, we propose a series of model-adaptive designs on the FPGA platform to support the architecture search and mitigate the gap between the theoretical computation reduction and the practical inference speedup. Our searched models achieve 101.5, 159.6, and 251.6 frames-per-second (FPS) inference speed on the AMD/Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA with 80.4%, 78.6%, and 74.9% top-1 accuracy, respectively, for the ImageNet dataset, consistently outperforming prior works.

- **Summary**: In this work, we introduce PianoMime, a framework for training a piano-playing agent using internet demonstrations. The internet is a promising source of large-scale demonstrations for training our robot agents. In particular, for the case of piano-playing, Youtube is full of videos of professional pianists playing a wide myriad of songs. In our work, we leverage these demonstrations to learn a generalist piano-playing agent capable of playing any arbitrary song. Our framework is divided into three parts: a data preparation phase to extract the informative features from the Youtube videos, a policy learning phase to train song-specific expert policies from the demonstrations and a policy distillation phase to distil the policies into a single generalist agent. We explore different policy designs to represent the agent and evaluate the influence of the amount of training data on the generalization capability of the agent to novel songs not available in the dataset. We show that we are able to learn a policy with up to 56\% F1 score on unseen songs.

- **Summary**: Spherical or omni-directional images offer an immersive visual format appealing to a wide range of computer vision applications. However, geometric properties of spherical images pose a major challenge for models and metrics designed for ordinary 2D images. Here, we show that direct application of Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) is insufficient for quantifying geometric fidelity in spherical images. We introduce two quantitative metrics accounting for geometric constraints, namely Omnidirectional FID (OmniFID) and Discontinuity Score (DS). OmniFID is an extension of FID tailored to additionally capture field-of-view requirements of the spherical format by leveraging cubemap projections. DS is a kernel-based seam alignment score of continuity across borders of 2D representations of spherical images. In experiments, OmniFID and DS quantify geometry fidelity issues that are undetected by FID.

- **Summary**: The benefit of transformers in large-scale 3D point cloud perception tasks, such as 3D object detection, is limited by their quadratic computation cost when modeling long-range relationships. In contrast, linear RNNs have low computational complexity and are suitable for long-range modeling. Toward this goal, we propose a simple and effective window-based framework built on LInear grOup RNN (i.e., perform linear RNN for grouped features) for accurate 3D object detection, called LION. The key property is to allow sufficient feature interaction in a much larger group than transformer-based methods. However, effectively applying linear group RNN to 3D object detection in highly sparse point clouds is not trivial due to its limitation in handling spatial modeling. To tackle this problem, we simply introduce a 3D spatial feature descriptor and integrate it into the linear group RNN operators to enhance their spatial features rather than blindly increasing the number of scanning orders for voxel features. To further address the challenge in highly sparse point clouds, we propose a 3D voxel generation strategy to densify foreground features thanks to linear group RNN as a natural property of auto-regressive models. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed components and the generalization of our LION on different linear group RNN operators including Mamba, RWKV, and RetNet. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that our LION-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art on Waymo, nuScenes, Argoverse V2, and ONCE dataset. Last but not least, our method supports kinds of advanced linear RNN operators (e.g., RetNet, RWKV, Mamba, xLSTM and TTT) on small but popular KITTI dataset for a quick experience with our linear RNN-based framework.

- **Summary**: Autonomous robots often rely on monocular cameras for odometry estimation and navigation. However, the scale ambiguity problem presents a critical barrier to effective monocular visual odometry. In this paper, we present CodedVO, a novel monocular visual odometry method that overcomes the scale ambiguity problem by employing custom optics to physically encode metric depth information into imagery. By incorporating this information into our odometry pipeline, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in monocular visual odometry with a known scale. We evaluate our method in diverse indoor environments and demonstrate its robustness and adaptability. We achieve a 0.08m average trajectory error in odometry evaluation on the ICL-NUIM indoor odometry dataset.

- **Summary**: Individuals who are blind or have low vision (BLV) are at a heightened risk of sharing private information if they share photographs they have taken. To facilitate developing technologies that can help preserve privacy, we introduce BIV-Priv-Seg, the first localization dataset originating from people with visual impairments that shows private content. It contains 1,028 images with segmentation annotations for 16 private object categories. We first characterize BIV-Priv-Seg and then evaluate modern models' performance for locating private content in the dataset. We find modern models struggle most with locating private objects that are not salient, small, and lack text as well as recognizing when private content is absent from an image. We facilitate future extensions by sharing our new dataset with the evaluation server at https://vizwiz.org/tasks-and-datasets/object-localization.

- **Summary**: 3D referring segmentation is an emerging and challenging vision-language task that aims to segment the object described by a natural language expression in a point cloud scene. The key challenge behind this task is vision-language feature fusion and alignment. In this work, we propose RefMask3D to explore the comprehensive multi-modal feature interaction and understanding. First, we propose a Geometry-Enhanced Group-Word Attention to integrate language with geometrically coherent sub-clouds through cross-modal group-word attention, which effectively addresses the challenges posed by the sparse and irregular nature of point clouds. Then, we introduce a Linguistic Primitives Construction to produce semantic primitives representing distinct semantic attributes, which greatly enhance the vision-language understanding at the decoding stage. Furthermore, we introduce an Object Cluster Module that analyzes the interrelationships among linguistic primitives to consolidate their insights and pinpoint common characteristics, helping to capture holistic information and enhance the precision of target identification. The proposed RefMask3D achieves new state-of-the-art performance on 3D referring segmentation, 3D visual grounding, and also 2D referring image segmentation. Especially, RefMask3D outperforms previous state-of-the-art method by a large margin of 3.16% mIoU} on the challenging ScanRefer dataset.

- **Summary**: Human head detection, keypoint estimation, and 3D head model fitting are important tasks with many applications. However, traditional real-world datasets often suffer from bias, privacy, and ethical concerns, and they have been recorded in laboratory environments, which makes it difficult for trained models to generalize. Here, we introduce VGGHeads -- a large scale synthetic dataset generated with diffusion models for human head detection and 3D mesh estimation. Our dataset comprises over 1 million high-resolution images, each annotated with detailed 3D head meshes, facial landmarks, and bounding boxes. Using this dataset we introduce a new model architecture capable of simultaneous heads detection and head meshes reconstruction from a single image in a single step. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we demonstrate that models trained on our synthetic data achieve strong performance on real images. Furthermore, the versatility of our dataset makes it applicable across a broad spectrum of tasks, offering a general and comprehensive representation of human heads. Additionally, we provide detailed information about the synthetic data generation pipeline, enabling it to be re-used for other tasks and domains.

- **Summary**: Point-drag-based image editing methods, like DragDiffusion, have attracted significant attention. However, point-drag-based approaches suffer from computational overhead and misinterpretation of user intentions due to the sparsity of point-based editing instructions. In this paper, we propose a region-based copy-and-paste dragging method, RegionDrag, to overcome these limitations. RegionDrag allows users to express their editing instructions in the form of handle and target regions, enabling more precise control and alleviating ambiguity. In addition, region-based operations complete editing in one iteration and are much faster than point-drag-based methods. We also incorporate the attention-swapping technique for enhanced stability during editing. To validate our approach, we extend existing point-drag-based datasets with region-based dragging instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that RegionDrag outperforms existing point-drag-based approaches in terms of speed, accuracy, and alignment with user intentions. Remarkably, RegionDrag completes the edit on an image with a resolution of 512x512 in less than 2 seconds, which is more than 100x faster than DragDiffusion, while achieving better performance.

- **Summary**: We propose a simple yet effective approach for few-shot action recognition, emphasizing the disentanglement of motion and appearance representations. By harnessing recent progress in tracking, specifically point trajectories and self-supervised representation learning, we build trajectory-aligned tokens (TATs) that capture motion and appearance information. This approach significantly reduces the data requirements while retaining essential information. To process these representations, we use a Masked Space-time Transformer that effectively learns to aggregate information to facilitate few-shot action recognition. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on few-shot action recognition across multiple datasets. Our project page is available at https://www.cs.umd.edu/~pulkit/tats

- **Summary**: Assessing the robustness of multimodal models against adversarial examples is an important aspect for the safety of its users. We craft L0-norm perturbation attacks on the preprocessed input images. We launch them in a black-box setup against four multimodal models and two unimodal DNNs, considering both targeted and untargeted misclassification. Our attacks target less than 0.04% of perturbed image area and integrate different spatial positioning of perturbed pixels: sparse positioning and pixels arranged in different contiguous shapes (row, column, diagonal, and patch). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to assess the robustness of three state-of-the-art multimodal models (ALIGN, AltCLIP, GroupViT) against different sparse and contiguous pixel distribution perturbations. The obtained results indicate that unimodal DNNs are more robust than multimodal models. Furthermore, models using CNN-based Image Encoder are more vulnerable than models with ViT - for untargeted attacks, we obtain a 99% success rate by perturbing less than 0.02% of the image area.
