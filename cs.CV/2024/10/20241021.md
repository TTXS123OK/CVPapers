- **Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are receiving increasing attention for their ability to enable robots to perform complex tasks by integrating visual context with linguistic commands. However, achieving efficient real-time performance remains challenging due to the high computational demands of existing models. To overcome this, we propose Dual Process VLA (DP-VLA), a hierarchical framework inspired by dual-process theory. DP-VLA utilizes a Large System 2 Model (L-Sys2) for complex reasoning and decision-making, while a Small System 1 Model (S-Sys1) handles real-time motor control and sensory processing. By leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the L-Sys2 operates at low frequencies, reducing computational overhead, while the S-Sys1 ensures fast and accurate task execution. Experimental results on the RoboCasa dataset demonstrate that DP-VLA achieves faster inference and higher task success rates, providing a scalable solution for advanced robotic applications.

- **Summary**: The Unified Object Detection (UOD) task aims to achieve object detection of all merged categories through training on multiple datasets, and is of great significance in comprehensive object detection scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a thorough analysis of the cross datasets missing annotations issue, and propose an Online Pseudo-Label Unified Object Detection scheme. Our method uses a periodically updated teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabelled objects in each sub-dataset. This periodical update strategy could better ensure that the accuracy of the teacher model reaches the local maxima and maximized the quality of pseudo-labels. In addition, we survey the influence of overlapped region proposals on the accuracy of box regression. We propose a category specific box regression and a pseudo-label RPN head to improve the recall rate of the Region Proposal Network (PRN). Our experimental results on common used benchmarks (\eg COCO, Object365 and OpenImages) indicates that our online pseudo-label UOD method achieves higher accuracy than existing SOTA methods.

- **Summary**: In clinical In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF), identifying the most viable embryo for transfer is important to increasing the likelihood of a successful pregnancy. Traditionally, this process involves embryologists manually assessing embryos' static morphological features at specific intervals using light microscopy. This manual evaluation is not only time-intensive and costly, due to the need for expert analysis, but also inherently subjective, leading to variability in the selection process. To address these challenges, we develop a multimodal model that leverages both time-lapse video data and Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to predict embryo viability. One of the primary challenges of our research is to effectively combine time-lapse video and EHR data, owing to their inherent differences in modality. We comprehensively analyze our multimodal model with various modality inputs and integration approaches. Our approach will enable fast and automated embryo viability predictions in scale for clinical IVF.

- **Summary**: Although existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods have made significant progress, simultaneously estimating human pose and shape from low-resolution image features limits their performance. These image features lack sufficient spatial information about the human body and contain various noises (e.g., background, lighting, and clothing), which often results in inaccurate pose and inconsistent motion. Inspired by the rapid advance in human pose estimation, we discover that compared to image features, skeletons inherently contain accurate human pose and motion. Therefore, we propose a novel semiAnalytical Regressor using disenTangled Skeletal representations for human mesh recovery from videos, called ARTS. Specifically, a skeleton estimation and disentanglement module is proposed to estimate the 3D skeletons from a video and decouple them into disentangled skeletal representations (i.e., joint position, bone length, and human motion). Then, to fully utilize these representations, we introduce a semi-analytical regressor to estimate the parameters of the human mesh model. The regressor consists of three modules: Temporal Inverse Kinematics (TIK), Bone-guided Shape Fitting (BSF), and Motion-Centric Refinement (MCR). TIK utilizes joint position to estimate initial pose parameters and BSF leverages bone length to regress bone-aligned shape parameters. Finally, MCR combines human motion representation with image features to refine the initial human model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ARTS surpasses existing state-of-the-art video-based methods in both per-frame accuracy and temporal consistency on popular benchmarks: 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing 3D clothed humans from monocular camera data is highly challenging due to viewpoint limitations and image ambiguity. While implicit function-based approaches, combined with prior knowledge from parametric models, have made significant progress, there are still two notable problems. Firstly, the back details of human models are ambiguous due to viewpoint invisibility. The quality of the back details depends on the back normal map predicted by a convolutional neural network (CNN). However, the CNN lacks global information awareness for comprehending the back texture, resulting in excessively smooth back details. Secondly, a single image suffers from local ambiguity due to lighting conditions and body movement. However, implicit functions are highly sensitive to pixel variations in ambiguous regions. To address these ambiguities, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Transformer (STT) network for 3D clothed human reconstruction. A spatial transformer is employed to extract global information for normal map prediction. The establishment of global correlations facilitates the network in comprehending the holistic texture and shape of the human body. Simultaneously, to compensate for local ambiguity in images, a temporal transformer is utilized to extract temporal features from adjacent frames. The incorporation of temporal features can enhance the accuracy of input features in implicit networks. Furthermore, to obtain more accurate temporal features, joint tokens are employed to establish local correspondences between frames. Experimental results on the Adobe and MonoPerfCap datasets have shown that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods and maintains robust generalization even under low-light outdoor conditions.

- **Summary**: Distracted driving is a critical safety issue that leads to numerous fatalities and injuries worldwide. This study addresses the urgent need for efficient and real-time machine learning models to detect distracted driving behaviors. Leveraging the Pretrained YOLOv8 (P-YOLOv8) model, a real-time object detection system is introduced, optimized for both speed and accuracy. This approach addresses the computational constraints and latency limitations commonly associated with conventional detection models. The study demonstrates P-YOLOv8 versatility in both object detection and image classification tasks using the Distracted Driver Detection dataset from State Farm, which includes 22,424 images across ten behavior categories. Our research explores the application of P-YOLOv8 for image classification, evaluating its performance compared to deep learning models such as VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet. Some traditional models often struggle with low accuracy, while others achieve high accuracy but come with high computational costs and slow detection speeds, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. P-YOLOv8 addresses these issues by achieving competitive accuracy with significant computational cost and efficiency advantages. In particular, P-YOLOv8 generates a lightweight model with a size of only 2.84 MB and a lower number of parameters, totaling 1,451,098, due to its innovative architecture. It achieves a high accuracy of 99.46 percent with this small model size, opening new directions for deployment on inexpensive and small embedded devices using Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML). The experimental results show robust performance, making P-YOLOv8 a cost-effective solution for real-time deployment. This study provides a detailed analysis of P-YOLOv8's architecture, training, and performance benchmarks, highlighting its potential for real-time use in detecting distracted driving.

- **Summary**: Active learning (AL) is for optimizing the selection of unlabeled data for annotation (labeling), aiming to enhance model performance while minimizing labeling effort. The key question in AL is which unlabeled data should be selected for annotation. Existing deep AL methods arguably suffer from bias incurred by clabeled data, which takes a much lower percentage than unlabeled data in AL context. We observe that such an issue is severe in different types of data, such as vision and non-vision data. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, namely Manifold-Preserving Trajectory Sampling (MPTS), aiming to enforce the feature space learned from labeled data to represent a more accurate manifold. By doing so, we expect to effectively correct the bias incurred by labeled data, which can cause a biased selection of unlabeled data. Despite its focus on manifold, the proposed method can be conveniently implemented by performing distribution mapping with MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancies). Extensive experiments on various vision and non-vision benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our source code can be found here.

- **Summary**: Due to some complex factors (e.g., occlusion, pose variation and diverse camera perspectives), extracting stronger feature representation in person re-identification remains a challenging task. In this paper, we proposed a novel self-supervision and supervision combining transformer-based person re-identification framework, namely SSSC-TransReID. Different from the general transformer-based person re-identification models, we designed a self-supervised contrastive learning branch, which can enhance the feature representation for person re-identification without negative samples or additional pre-training. In order to train the contrastive learning branch, we also proposed a novel random rectangle mask strategy to simulate the occlusion in real scenes, so as to enhance the feature representation for occlusion. Finally, we utilized the joint-training loss function to integrate the advantages of supervised learning with ID tags and self-supervised contrastive learning without negative samples, which can reinforce the ability of our model to excavate stronger discriminative features, especially for occlusion. Extensive experimental results on several benchmark datasets show our proposed model obtains superior Re-ID performance consistently and outperforms the state-of-the-art ReID methods by large margins on the mean average accuracy (mAP) and Rank-1 accuracy.

- **Summary**: The Circle of Willis (CoW) vessels is critical to connecting major circulations of the brain. The topology of the vascular structure is clinical significance to evaluate the risk, severity of the neuro-vascular diseases. The CoW has two representative angiographic imaging modalities, computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). TopCow24 provided 125 paired CTA-MRA dataset for the analysis of CoW. To explore both CTA and MRA images in a unified framework to learn the inherent topology of Cow, we construct the universal dataset via independent intensity preprocess, followed by joint resampling and normarlization. Then, we utilize the topology-aware loss to enhance the topology completeness of the CoW and the discrimination between different classes. A complementary topology-aware refinement is further conducted to enhance the connectivity within the same class. Our method was evaluated on all the three tasks and two modalities, achieving competitive results. In the final test phase of TopCow24 Challenge, we achieved the second place in the CTA-Seg-Task, the third palce in the CTA-Box-Task, the first place in the CTA-Edg-Task, the second place in the MRA-Seg-Task, the third palce in the MRA-Box-Task, the second place in the MRA-Edg-Task.

- **Summary**: This paper tackles the challenging task of 3D visual grounding-locating a specific object in a 3D point cloud scene based on text descriptions. Existing methods fall into two categories: top-down and bottom-up methods. Top-down methods rely on a pre-trained 3D detector to generate and select the best bounding box, resulting in time-consuming processes. Bottom-up methods directly regress object bounding boxes with coarse-grained features, producing worse results. To combine their strengths while addressing their limitations, we propose a joint top-down and bottom-up framework, aiming to enhance the performance while improving the efficiency. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a bottom-up based proposal generation module, which utilizes lightweight neural layers to efficiently regress and cluster several coarse object proposals instead of using a complex 3D detector. Then, in the second stage, we introduce a top-down based proposal consolidation module, which utilizes graph design to effectively aggregate and propagate the query-related object contexts among the generated proposals for further refinement. By jointly training these two modules, we can avoid the inherent drawbacks of the complex proposals in the top-down framework and the coarse proposals in the bottom-up framework. Experimental results on the ScanRefer benchmark show that our framework is able to achieve the state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models excel at generating visually striking content from text but can inadvertently produce undesirable or harmful content when trained on unfiltered internet data. A practical solution is to selectively removing target concepts from the model, but this may impact the remaining concepts. Prior approaches have tried to balance this by introducing a loss term to preserve neutral content or a regularization term to minimize changes in the model parameters, yet resolving this trade-off remains challenging. In this work, we propose to identify and preserving concepts most affected by parameter changes, termed as \textit{adversarial concepts}. This approach ensures stable erasure with minimal impact on the other concepts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using the Stable Diffusion model, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art erasure methods in eliminating unwanted content while maintaining the integrity of other unrelated elements.

- **Summary**: Given coarser-resolution projections from global climate models or satellite data, the downscaling problem aims to estimate finer-resolution regional climate data, capturing fine-scale spatial patterns and variability. Downscaling is any method to derive high-resolution data from low-resolution variables, often to provide more detailed and local predictions and analyses. This problem is societally crucial for effective adaptation, mitigation, and resilience against significant risks from climate change. The challenge arises from spatial heterogeneity and the need to recover finer-scale features while ensuring model generalization. Most downscaling methods \cite{Li2020} fail to capture the spatial dependencies at finer scales and underperform on real-world climate datasets, such as sea-level rise. We propose a novel Kriging-informed Conditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (Ki-CDPM) to capture spatial variability while preserving fine-scale features. Experimental results on climate data show that our proposed method is more accurate than state-of-the-art downscaling techniques.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting has shown fast and high-quality rendering results in static scenes by leveraging dense 3D prior and explicit representations. Unfortunately, the benefits of the prior and representation do not involve novel view synthesis for dynamic motions. Ironically, this is because the main barrier is the reliance on them, which requires increasing training and rendering times to account for dynamic motions. In this paper, we design a Explicit 4D Gaussian Splatting(Ex4DGS). Our key idea is to firstly separate static and dynamic Gaussians during training, and to explicitly sample positions and rotations of the dynamic Gaussians at sparse timestamps. The sampled positions and rotations are then interpolated to represent both spatially and temporally continuous motions of objects in dynamic scenes as well as reducing computational cost. Additionally, we introduce a progressive training scheme and a point-backtracking technique that improves Ex4DGS's convergence. We initially train Ex4DGS using short timestamps and progressively extend timestamps, which makes it work well with a few point clouds. The point-backtracking is used to quantify the cumulative error of each Gaussian over time, enabling the detection and removal of erroneous Gaussians in dynamic scenes. Comprehensive experiments on various scenes demonstrate the state-of-the-art rendering quality from our method, achieving fast rendering of 62 fps on a single 2080Ti GPU.

- **Summary**: Recent large reconstruction models have made notable progress in generating high-quality 3D objects from single images. However, these methods often struggle with controllability, as they lack information from multiple views, leading to incomplete or inconsistent 3D reconstructions. To address this limitation, we introduce LucidFusion, a flexible end-to-end feed-forward framework that leverages the Relative Coordinate Map (RCM). Unlike traditional methods linking images to 3D world thorough pose, LucidFusion utilizes RCM to align geometric features coherently across different views, making it highly adaptable for 3D generation from arbitrary, unposed images. Furthermore, LucidFusion seamlessly integrates with the original single-image-to-3D pipeline, producing detailed 3D Gaussians at a resolution of $512 \times 512$, making it well-suited for a wide range of applications.

- **Summary**: Medical report generation is the task of automatically writing radiology reports for chest X-ray images. Manually composing these reports is a time-consuming process that is also prone to human errors. Generating medical reports can therefore help reduce the burden on radiologists. In other words, we can promote greater clinical automation in the medical domain. In this work, we propose a new framework leveraging vision-enabled Large Language Models (LLM) for the task of medical report generation. We introduce a lightweight solution that achieves better or comparative performance as compared to previous solutions on the task of medical report generation. We conduct extensive experiments exploring different model sizes and enhancement approaches, such as prefix tuning to improve the text generation abilities of the LLMs. We evaluate our approach on a prominent large-scale radiology report dataset - MIMIC-CXR. Our results demonstrate the capability of our resource-efficient framework to generate patient-specific reports with strong medical contextual understanding and high precision.

- **Summary**: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection has seen advancements with Vision Language Models (VLMs), but these methods often depend on extensive manual annotations. Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) can inherently recognize and reason about interactions at the image level but are computationally heavy and not designed for instance-level HOI detection. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Cross-Level HOI distillation (CL-HOI) framework, which distills instance-level HOIs from VLLMs image-level understanding without the need for manual annotations. Our approach involves two stages: context distillation, where a Visual Linguistic Translator (VLT) converts visual information into linguistic form, and interaction distillation, where an Interaction Cognition Network (ICN) reasons about spatial, visual, and context relations. We design contrastive distillation losses to transfer image-level context and interaction knowledge from the teacher to the student model, enabling instance-level HOI detection. Evaluations on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets demonstrate that our CL-HOI surpasses existing weakly supervised methods and VLLM supervised methods, showing its efficacy in detecting HOIs without manual labels.

- **Summary**: Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks are not well-calibrated and produce over-confident predictions. The miscalibration issue primarily stems from the minimization of cross-entropy, which aims to align predicted softmax probabilities with one-hot labels. In ordinal regression tasks, this problem is compounded by an additional challenge: the expectation that softmax probabilities should exhibit unimodal distribution is not met with cross-entropy. Rather, the ordinal regression literature has focused on unimodality and overlooked calibration. To address these issues, we propose a novel loss function that introduces order-aware calibration, ensuring that prediction confidence adheres to ordinal relationships between classes. It incorporates soft ordinal encoding and label-smoothing-based regularization to enforce both calibration and unimodality. Extensive experiments across three popular ordinal regression benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art calibration without compromising accuracy.

- **Summary**: Efficient detection and classification of blood cells are vital for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of blood disorders. This study utilizes a YOLOv10 model trained on Roboflow data with images resized to 640x640 pixels across varying epochs. The results show that increased training epochs significantly enhance accuracy, precision, and recall, particularly in real-time blood cell detection & classification. The YOLOv10 model outperforms MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, and DarkNet in real-time performance, though MobileNetV2 and ShuffleNetV2 are more computationally efficient, and DarkNet excels in feature extraction for blood cell classification. This research highlights the potential of integrating deep learning models like YOLOv10, MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, and DarkNet into clinical workflows, promising improvements in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, a new, well-annotated blood cell dataset was created and will be open-sourced to support further advancements in automatic blood cell detection and classification. The findings demonstrate the transformative impact of these models in revolutionizing medical diagnostics and enhancing blood disorder management

- **Summary**: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to perform geometric completion and semantic segmentation simultaneously. Despite the promising results achieved by existing studies, the inherently ill-posed nature of the task presents significant challenges in diverse driving scenarios. This paper introduces TALoS, a novel test-time adaptation approach for SSC that excavates the information available in driving environments. Specifically, we focus on that observations made at a certain moment can serve as Ground Truth (GT) for scene completion at another moment. Given the characteristics of the LiDAR sensor, an observation of an object at a certain location confirms both 1) the occupation of that location and 2) the absence of obstacles along the line of sight from the LiDAR to that point. TALoS utilizes these observations to obtain self-supervision about occupancy and emptiness, guiding the model to adapt to the scene in test time. In a similar manner, we aggregate reliable SSC predictions among multiple moments and leverage them as semantic pseudo-GT for adaptation. Further, to leverage future observations that are not accessible at the current time, we present a dual optimization scheme using the model in which the update is delayed until the future observation is available. Evaluations on the SemanticKITTI validation and test sets demonstrate that TALoS significantly improves the performance of the pre-trained SSC model. Our code is available at https://github.com/blue-531/TALoS.

- **Summary**: Correspondence-based point cloud registration (PCR) plays a key role in robotics and computer vision. However, challenges like sensor noises, object occlusions, and descriptor limitations inevitably result in numerous outliers. RANSAC family is the most popular outlier removal solution. However, the requisite iterations escalate exponentially with the outlier ratio, rendering it far inferior to existing methods (SC2PCR [1], MAC [2], etc.) in terms of accuracy or speed. Thus, we propose a two-stage consensus filtering (TCF) that elevates RANSAC to state-of-the-art (SOTA) speed and accuracy. Firstly, one-point RANSAC obtains a consensus set based on length consistency. Subsequently, two-point RANSAC refines the set via angle consistency. Then, three-point RANSAC computes a coarse pose and removes outliers based on transformed correspondence's distances. Drawing on optimizations from one-point and two-point RANSAC, three-point RANSAC requires only a few iterations. Eventually, an iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) is applied to yield the optimal pose. Experiments on the large-scale KITTI and ETH datasets demonstrate our method achieves up to three-orders-of-magnitude speedup compared to MAC while maintaining registration accuracy and recall.

- **Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), renowned for their low power consumption, brain-inspired architecture, and spatio-temporal representation capabilities, have garnered considerable attention in recent years. Similar to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), high-quality benchmark datasets are of great importance to the advances of SNNs. However, our analysis indicates that many prevalent neuromorphic datasets lack strong temporal correlation, preventing SNNs from fully exploiting their spatio-temporal representation capabilities. Meanwhile, the integration of event and frame modalities offers more comprehensive visual spatio-temporal information. Yet, the SNN-based cross-modality fusion remains underexplored.   In this work, we present a neuromorphic dataset called DVS-SLR that can better exploit the inherent spatio-temporal properties of SNNs. Compared to existing datasets, it offers advantages in terms of higher temporal correlation, larger scale, and more varied scenarios. In addition, our neuromorphic dataset contains corresponding frame data, which can be used for developing SNN-based fusion methods. By virtue of the dual-modal feature of the dataset, we propose a Cross-Modality Attention (CMA) based fusion method. The CMA model efficiently utilizes the unique advantages of each modality, allowing for SNNs to learn both temporal and spatial attention scores from the spatio-temporal features of event and frame modalities, subsequently allocating these scores across modalities to enhance their synergy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only improves recognition accuracy but also ensures robustness across diverse scenarios.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present PALMS, an innovative indoor global localization and relocalization system for mobile smartphones that utilizes publicly available floor plans. Unlike most vision-based methods that require constant visual input, our system adopts a dynamic form of localization that considers a single instantaneous observation and odometry data. The core contribution of this work is the introduction of a particle filter initialization method that leverages the Certainly Empty Space (CES) constraint along with principal orientation matching. This approach creates a spatial probability distribution of the device's location, significantly improving localization accuracy and reducing particle filter convergence time. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that PALMS outperforms traditional methods with uniformly initialized particle filters, providing a more efficient and accessible approach to indoor wayfinding. By eliminating the need for prior environmental fingerprinting, PALMS provides a scalable and practical approach to indoor navigation.

- **Summary**: The capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been applied in expert systems across various domains, providing new opportunities for AI in Education. Educational interactions involve a cyclical exchange between teachers and students. Current research predominantly focuses on using LLMs to simulate teachers, leveraging their expertise to enhance student learning outcomes. However, the simulation of students, which could improve teachers' instructional skills, has received insufficient attention due to the challenges of modeling and evaluating virtual students. This research asks: Can LLMs be utilized to develop virtual student agents that mimic human-like behavior and individual variability? Unlike expert systems focusing on knowledge delivery, virtual students must replicate learning difficulties, emotional responses, and linguistic uncertainties. These traits present significant challenges in both modeling and evaluation. To address these issues, this study focuses on language learning as a context for modeling virtual student agents. We propose a novel AI4Education framework, called SOE (Scene-Object-Evaluation), to systematically construct LVSA (LLM-based Virtual Student Agents). By curating a dataset of personalized teacher-student interactions with various personality traits, question types, and learning stages, and fine-tuning LLMs using LoRA, we conduct multi-dimensional evaluation experiments. Specifically, we: (1) develop a theoretical framework for generating LVSA; (2) integrate human subjective evaluation metrics into GPT-4 assessments, demonstrating a strong correlation between human evaluators and GPT-4 in judging LVSA authenticity; and (3) validate that LLMs can generate human-like, personalized virtual student agents in educational contexts, laying a foundation for future applications in pre-service teacher training and multi-agent simulation environments.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised object-centric learning from videos is a promising approach towards learning compositional representations that can be applied to various downstream tasks, such as prediction and reasoning. Recently, it was shown that pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) can be useful to learn object-centric representations on real-world video datasets. However, while these approaches succeed at extracting objects from the scenes, the slot-based representations fail to maintain temporal consistency across consecutive frames in a video, i.e. the mapping of objects to slots changes across the video. To address this, we introduce Conditional Autoregressive Slot Attention (CA-SA), a framework that enhances the temporal consistency of extracted object-centric representations in video-centric vision tasks. Leveraging an autoregressive prior network to condition representations on previous timesteps and a novel consistency loss function, CA-SA predicts future slot representations and imposes consistency across frames. We present qualitative and quantitative results showing that our proposed method outperforms the considered baselines on downstream tasks, such as video prediction and visual question-answering tasks.

- **Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models embody the divide-and-conquer concept and are a promising approach for increasing model capacity, demonstrating excellent scalability across multiple domains. In this paper, we integrate the MoE structure into the classic Vision Transformer (ViT), naming it ViMoE, and explore the potential of applying MoE to vision through a comprehensive study on image classification. However, we observe that the performance is sensitive to the configuration of MoE layers, making it challenging to obtain optimal results without careful design. The underlying cause is that inappropriate MoE layers lead to unreliable routing and hinder experts from effectively acquiring helpful knowledge. To address this, we introduce a shared expert to learn and capture common information, serving as an effective way to construct stable ViMoE. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to analyze expert routing behavior, revealing which MoE layers are capable of specializing in handling specific information and which are not. This provides guidance for retaining the critical layers while removing redundancies, thereby advancing ViMoE to be more efficient without sacrificing accuracy. We aspire for this work to offer new insights into the design of vision MoE models and provide valuable empirical guidance for future research.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in medical vision-language pre-training models have driven significant progress in zero-shot disease recognition. However, transferring image-level knowledge to pixel-level tasks, such as lesion segmentation in 3D CT scans, remains a critical challenge. Due to the complexity and variability of pathological visual characteristics, existing methods struggle to align fine-grained lesion features not encountered during training with disease-related textual representations. In this paper, we present Malenia, a novel multi-scale lesion-level mask-attribute alignment framework, specifically designed for 3D zero-shot lesion segmentation. Malenia improves the compatibility between mask representations and their associated elemental attributes, explicitly linking the visual features of unseen lesions with the extensible knowledge learned from previously seen ones. Furthermore, we design a Cross-Modal Knowledge Injection module to enhance both visual and textual features with mutually beneficial information, effectively guiding the generation of segmentation results. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets and 12 lesion categories validate the superior performance of Malenia. Codes will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: In contrast to the well-established technique of rasterization, vectorization of images poses a significant challenge in the field of computer graphics. Recent learning-based methods for converting raster images to vector formats frequently suffer from incomplete shapes, redundant path prediction, and a lack of accuracy in preserving the semantics of the original content. These shortcomings severely hinder the utility of these methods for further editing and manipulation of images. To address these challenges, we present DeepIcon, a novel hierarchical image vectorization network specifically tailored for generating variable-length icon vector graphics based on the raster image input. Our experimental results indicate that DeepIcon can efficiently produce Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) directly from raster images, bypassing the need for a differentiable rasterizer while also demonstrating a profound understanding of the image contents.

- **Summary**: We investigate the efficacy of data augmentations to close the domain gap in spaceborne computer vision, crucial for autonomous operations like on-orbit servicing. As the use of computer vision in space increases, challenges such as hostile illumination and low signal-to-noise ratios significantly hinder performance. While learning-based algorithms show promising results, their adoption is limited by the need for extensive annotated training data and the domain gap that arises from differences between synthesized and real-world imagery. This study explores domain generalization in terms of data augmentations -- classical color and geometric transformations, corruptions, and noise -- to enhance model performance across the domain gap. To this end, we conduct an large scale experiment using a hyperparameter optimization pipeline that samples hundreds of different configurations and searches for the best set to bridge the domain gap. As a reference task, we use 2D object detection and evaluate on the SPEED+ dataset that contains real hardware-in-the-loop satellite images in its test set. Moreover, we evaluate four popular object detectors, including Mask R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, YOLO-v7, and the open set detector GroundingDINO, and highlight their trade-offs between performance, inference speed, and training time. Our results underscore the vital role of data augmentations in bridging the domain gap, improving model performance, robustness, and reliability for critical space applications. As a result, we propose two novel data augmentations specifically developed to emulate the visual effects observed in orbital imagery. We conclude by recommending the most effective augmentations for advancing computer vision in challenging orbital environments. Code for training detectors and hyperparameter search will be made publicly available.



### Improving Instance Optimization in Deformable Image Registration with Gradient Projection

- **Summary**: Deformable image registration is inherently a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem, requiring a delicate balance between image similarity and deformation regularity. These conflicting objectives often lead to poor optimization outcomes, such as being trapped in unsatisfactory local minima or experiencing slow convergence. Deep learning methods have recently gained popularity in this domain due to their efficiency in processing large datasets and achieving high accuracy. However, they often underperform during test time compared to traditional optimization techniques, which further explore iterative, instance-specific gradient-based optimization. This performance gap is more pronounced when a distribution shift between training and test data exists. To address this issue, we focus on the instance optimization (IO) paradigm, which involves additional optimization for test-time instances based on a pre-trained model. IO effectively combines the generalization capabilities of deep learning with the fine-tuning advantages of instance-specific optimization. Within this framework, we emphasize the use of gradient projection to mitigate conflicting updates in MOO. This technique projects conflicting gradients into a common space, better aligning the dual objectives and enhancing optimization stability. We validate our method using a state-of-the-art foundation model on the 3D Brain inter-subject registration task (LUMIR) from the Learn2Reg 2024 Challenge. Our results show significant improvements over standard gradient descent, leading to more accurate and reliable registration results.

- **Summary**: Creating and understanding art has long been a hallmark of human ability. When presented with finished digital artwork, professional graphic artists can intuitively deconstruct and replicate it using various drawing tools, such as the line tool, paint bucket, and layer features, including opacity and blending modes. While most recent research in this field has focused on art generation, proposing a range of methods, these often rely on the concept of artwork being represented as a final image. To bridge the gap between pixel-level results and the actual drawing process, we present an approach that treats a set of drawing tools as executable programs. This method predicts a sequence of steps to achieve the final image, allowing for understandable and resolution-independent reproductions under the usage of a set of drawing commands. Our experiments demonstrate that our program synthesizer, Art2Prog, can comprehensively understand complex input images and reproduce them using high-quality executable programs. The experimental results evidence the potential of machines to grasp higher-level information from images and generate compact program-level descriptions.

- **Summary**: Large real-world driving datasets have sparked significant research into various aspects of data-driven motion planners for autonomous driving. These include data augmentation, model architecture, reward design, training strategies, and planner pipelines. These planners promise better generalizations on complicated and few-shot cases than previous methods. However, experiment results show that many of these approaches produce limited generalization abilities in planning performance due to overly complex designs or training paradigms. In this paper, we review and benchmark previous methods focusing on generalizations. The experimental results indicate that as models are appropriately scaled, many design elements become redundant. We introduce StateTransformer-2 (STR2), a scalable, decoder-only motion planner that uses a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and a mixture-of-experts (MoE) causal Transformer architecture. The MoE backbone addresses modality collapse and reward balancing by expert routing during training. Extensive experiments on the NuPlan dataset show that our method generalizes better than previous approaches across different test sets and closed-loop simulations. Furthermore, we assess its scalability on billions of real-world urban driving scenarios, demonstrating consistent accuracy improvements as both data and model size grow.

- **Summary**: Hallucination poses a challenge to the deployment of large vision-language models (LVLMs) in applications. Unlike in large language models (LLMs), hallucination in LVLMs often arises from misalignments between visual inputs and textual outputs. This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of hallucination, focusing on the unique structure of LVLMs that distinguishes them from large language models (LLMs). We identify that hallucinations often arise from the sensitivity of text decoders to vision inputs, a natural phenomenon when image encoders and text decoders are pre-trained separately. Inspired by this, we introduce Visual and Textual Intervention (VTI), a novel technique designed to reduce hallucinations by steering latent space representations during inference to enhance the stability of vision features. As a task-agnostic test-time intervention, VTI can be easily applied to any problem without additional cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it can effectively reduce hallucinations and outperform baseline methods across multiple metrics, highlighting the critical role of vision feature stability in LVLMs.

- **Summary**: Historical maps provide valuable information and knowledge about the past. However, as they often feature non-standard projections, hand-drawn styles, and artistic elements, it is challenging for non-experts to identify and interpret them. While existing image captioning methods have achieved remarkable success on natural images, their performance on maps is suboptimal as maps are underrepresented in their pre-training process. Despite the recent advance of GPT-4 in text recognition and map captioning, it still has a limited understanding of maps, as its performance wanes when texts (e.g., titles and legends) in maps are missing or inaccurate. Besides, it is inefficient or even impractical to fine-tune the model with users' own datasets. To address these problems, we propose a novel and lightweight map-captioning counterpart. Specifically, we fine-tune the state-of-the-art vision-language model CLIP to generate captions relevant to historical maps and enrich the captions with GPT-3.5 to tell a brief story regarding where, what, when and why of a given map. We propose a novel decision tree architecture to only generate captions relevant to the specified map type. Our system shows invariance to text alterations in maps. The system can be easily adapted and extended to other map types and scaled to a larger map captioning system. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/claudaff/automatic-map-storytelling.

- **Summary**: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is an essential part of autonomous driving, focusing on capturing the geometric details of scenes. Off-road environments are rich in geometric information, therefore it is suitable for 3D semantic occupancy prediction tasks to reconstruct such scenes. However, most of researches concentrate on on-road environments, and few methods are designed for off-road 3D semantic occupancy prediction due to the lack of relevant datasets and benchmarks. In response to this gap, we introduce WildOcc, to our knowledge, the first benchmark to provide dense occupancy annotations for off-road 3D semantic occupancy prediction tasks. A ground truth generation pipeline is proposed in this paper, which employs a coarse-to-fine reconstruction to achieve a more realistic result. Moreover, we introduce a multi-modal 3D semantic occupancy prediction framework, which fuses spatio-temporal information from multi-frame images and point clouds at voxel level. In addition, a cross-modality distillation function is introduced, which transfers geometric knowledge from point clouds to image features.

- **Summary**: Water segmentation is critical to disaster response and water resource management. Authorities may employ high-resolution photography to monitor rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, allowing for more proactive management in agriculture, industry, and conservation. Deep learning has improved flood monitoring by allowing models like CNNs, U-Nets, and transformers to handle large volumes of satellite and aerial data. However, these models usually have significant processing requirements, limiting their usage in real-time applications. This research proposes upgrading the SegFormer model for water segmentation by data augmentation with datasets such as ADE20K and RIWA to boost generalization. We examine how inductive bias affects attention-based models and discover that SegFormer performs better on bigger datasets. To further demonstrate the function of data augmentation, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is used to lower processing complexity while preserving accuracy. We show that the suggested Habaek model outperforms current models in segmentation, with an Intersection over Union (IoU) ranging from 0.91986 to 0.94397. In terms of F1-score, recall, accuracy, and precision, Habaek performs better than rival models, indicating its potential for real-world applications. This study highlights the need to enhance structures and include datasets for effective water segmentation.

- **Summary**: The paper introduces a novel framework for safe and autonomous aerial physical interaction in industrial settings. It comprises two main components: a neural network-based target detection system enhanced with edge computing for reduced onboard computational load, and a control barrier function (CBF)-based controller for safe and precise maneuvering. The target detection system is trained on a dataset under challenging visual conditions and evaluated for accuracy across various unseen data with changing lighting conditions. Depth features are utilized for target pose estimation, with the entire detection framework offloaded into low-latency edge computing. The CBF-based controller enables the UAV to converge safely to the target for precise contact. Simulated evaluations of both the controller and target detection are presented, alongside an analysis of real-world detection performance.

- **Summary**: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SF-UDA) aims to transfer a model's performance from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain without direct access to source samples, addressing data privacy issues. However, most existing SF-UDA approaches assume the availability of abundant source domain samples, which is often impractical due to the high cost of data annotation. In this paper, we explore a more challenging scenario where direct access to source domain samples is restricted, and the source domain contains only a few samples. To tackle the dual challenges of limited source data and privacy concerns, we introduce a data-efficient, CLIP-powered dual-branch network (CDBN in short). We design a cross-modal dual-branch network that integrates source domain class semantics into the unsupervised fine-tuning of the target domain. It preserves the class information from the source domain while enhancing the model's generalization to the target domain. Additionally, we propose an unsupervised optimization strategy driven by accurate classification and diversity, which aims to retain the classification capability learned from the source domain while producing more confident and diverse predictions in the target domain. Extensive experiments across 31 transfer tasks on 7 public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

- **Summary**: Early detection of lung cancer is crucial as it increases the chances of successful treatment. Automatic lung image segmentation assists doctors in identifying diseases such as lung cancer, COVID-19, and respiratory disorders. However, lung segmentation is challenging due to overlapping features like vascular and bronchial structures, along with pixel-level fusion of brightness, color, and texture. New lung segmentation methods face difficulties in identifying long-range relationships between image components, reliance on convolution operations that may not capture all critical features, and the complex structures of the lungs. Furthermore, semantic gaps between feature maps can hinder the integration of relevant information, reducing model accuracy. Skip connections can also limit the decoder's access to complete information, resulting in partial information loss during encoding. To overcome these challenges, we propose a hybrid approach using the FusionLungNet network, which has a multi-level structure with key components, including the ResNet-50 encoder, Channel-wise Aggregation Attention (CAA) module, Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) block, self refinement (SR) module, and multiple decoders. The refinement sub-network uses convolutional neural networks for image post-processing to improve quality. Our method employs a combination of loss functions, including SSIM, IOU, and focal loss, to optimize image reconstruction quality. We created and publicly released a new dataset for lung segmentation called LungSegDB, including 1800 CT images from the LIDC-IDRI dataset (dataset version 1) and 700 images from the Chest CT Cancer Images from Kaggle dataset (dataset version 2). Our method achieved an IOU score of 98.04, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating significant improvements in segmentation accuracy. https://github.com/sadjadrz/FusionLungNet

- **Summary**: With the development of AI-assisted driving, numerous methods have emerged for ego-vehicle 3D perception tasks, but there has been limited research on roadside perception. With its ability to provide a global view and a broader sensing range, the roadside perspective is worth developing. LiDAR provides precise three-dimensional spatial information, while cameras offer semantic information. These two modalities are complementary in 3D detection. However, adding camera data does not increase accuracy in some studies since the information extraction and fusion procedure is not sufficiently reliable. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been proposed as replacements for MLPs, which are better suited for high-dimensional, complex data. Both the camera and the LiDAR provide high-dimensional information, and employing KANs should enhance the extraction of valuable features to produce better fusion outcomes. This paper proposes Kaninfradet3D, which optimizes the feature extraction and fusion modules. To extract features from complex high-dimensional data, the model's encoder and fuser modules were improved using KAN Layers. Cross-attention was applied to enhance feature fusion, and visual comparisons verified that camera features were more evenly integrated. This addressed the issue of camera features being abnormally concentrated, negatively impacting fusion. Compared to the benchmark, our approach shows improvements of +9.87 mAP and +10.64 mAP in the two viewpoints of the TUMTraf Intersection Dataset and an improvement of +1.40 mAP in the roadside end of the TUMTraf V2X Cooperative Perception Dataset. The results indicate that Kaninfradet3D can effectively fuse features, demonstrating the potential of applying KANs in roadside perception tasks.

- **Summary**: Predicting the behavior of road users accurately is crucial to enable the safe operation of autonomous vehicles in urban or densely populated areas. Therefore, there has been a growing interest in time series motion prediction research, leading to significant advancements in state-of-the-art techniques in recent years. However, the potential of using LiDAR data to capture more detailed local features, such as a person's gaze or posture, remains largely unexplored. To address this, we develop a novel multimodal approach for motion prediction based on the PointNet foundation model architecture, incorporating local LiDAR features. Evaluation on the Waymo Open Dataset shows a performance improvement of 6.20% and 1.58% in minADE and mAP respectively, when integrated and compared with the previous state-of-the-art MTR. We open-source the code of our LiMTR model.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose LiOn-XA, an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approach that combines LiDAR-Only Cross-Modal (X) learning with Adversarial training for 3D LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation to bridge the domain gap arising from environmental and sensor setup changes. Unlike existing works that exploit multiple data modalities like point clouds and RGB image data, we address UDA in scenarios where RGB images might not be available and show that two distinct LiDAR data representations can learn from each other for UDA. More specifically, we leverage 3D voxelized point clouds to preserve important geometric structure in combination with 2D projection-based range images that provide information such as object orientations or surfaces. To further align the feature space between both domains, we apply adversarial training using both features and predictions of both 2D and 3D neural networks. Our experiments on 3 real-to-real adaptation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving new state-of-the-art performance when compared to previous uni- and multi-model UDA methods.

- **Summary**: In multi-view medical diagnosis, deep learning-based models often fuse information from different imaging perspectives to improve diagnostic performance. However, existing approaches are prone to overfitting and rely heavily on view-specific features, which can lead to trivial solutions. In this work, we introduce Random Token Fusion (RTF), a novel technique designed to enhance multi-view medical image analysis using vision transformers. By integrating randomness into the feature fusion process during training, RTF addresses the issue of overfitting and enhances the robustness and accuracy of diagnostic models without incurring any additional cost at inference. We validate our approach on standard mammography and chest X-ray benchmark datasets. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RTF consistently improves the performance of existing fusion methods, paving the way for a new generation of multi-view medical foundation models.

- **Summary**: The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for low-cost, scalable approaches to measuring contactless vital signs, either during initial triage at a healthcare facility or virtual telemedicine visits. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) can accurately estimate heart rate (HR) when applied to close-up videos of healthy volunteers in well-lit laboratory settings. However, results from such highly optimized laboratory studies may not be readily translated to healthcare settings. One significant barrier to the practical application of rPPG in health care is the accurate localization of the region of interest (ROI). Clinical or telemedicine visits may involve sub-optimal lighting, movement artifacts, variable camera angle, and subject distance. This paper presents an rPPG ROI selection method based on 3D facial landmarks and patient head yaw angle. We then demonstrate the robustness of this ROI selection method when coupled to the Plane-Orthogonal-to-Skin (POS) rPPG method when applied to videos of patients presenting to an Emergency Department for respiratory complaints. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in improving the accuracy and robustness of rPPG in a challenging clinical environment.

- **Summary**: In cinema, visual motifs are recurrent iconographic compositions that carry artistic or aesthetic significance. Their use throughout the history of visual arts and media is interesting to researchers and filmmakers alike. Our goal in this work is to recognise and classify these motifs by proposing a new machine learning model that uses a custom dataset to that end. We show how features extracted from a CLIP model can be leveraged by using a shallow network and an appropriate loss to classify images into 20 different motifs, with surprisingly good results: an $F_1$-score of 0.91 on our test set. We also present several ablation studies justifying the input features, architecture and hyperparameters used.

- **Summary**: Vision-language supervision has made remarkable strides in learning visual representations from textual guidance. In digital pathology, vision-language models (VLM), pre-trained on curated datasets of histological image-captions, have been adapted to downstream tasks, such as region of interest classification. Zero-shot transfer for slide-level prediction has been formulated by MI-Zero, but it exhibits high variability depending on the textual prompts. Inspired by prototypical learning, we propose MI-VisionShot, a training-free adaptation method on top of VLMs to predict slide-level labels in few-shot learning scenarios. Our framework takes advantage of the excellent representation learning of VLM to create prototype-based classifiers under a multiple-instance setting by retrieving the most discriminative patches within each slide. Experimentation through different settings shows the ability of MI-VisionShot to surpass zero-shot transfer with lower variability, even in low-shot scenarios.

- **Summary**: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms are increasingly deployed in dynamic, data-rich environments for applications such as environmental monitoring and surveillance. These scenarios demand efficient data processing while maintaining privacy and security, making Federated Learning (FL) a promising solution. FL allows UAVs to collaboratively train global models without sharing raw data, but challenges arise due to the non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) nature of the data collected by UAVs. In this study, we show an integration of the state-of-the-art FL methods to UAV Swarm application and invetigate the performance of multiple aggregation methods (namely FedAvg, FedProx, FedOpt, and MOON) with a particular focus on tackling non-IID on a variety of datasets, specifically MNIST for baseline performance, CIFAR10 for natural object classification, EuroSAT for environment monitoring, and CelebA for surveillance. These algorithms were selected to cover improved techniques on both client-side updates and global aggregation. Results show that while all algorithms perform comparably on IID data, their performance deteriorates significantly under non-IID conditions. FedProx demonstrated the most stable overall performance, emphasising the importance of regularising local updates in non-IID environments to mitigate drastic deviations in local models.

- **Summary**: Since the emergence of the ImageNet dataset, the pretraining and fine-tuning approach has become widely adopted in computer vision due to the ability of ImageNet-pretrained models to learn a wide variety of visual features. However, a significant challenge arises when adapting these models to domain-specific fields, such as digital pathology, due to substantial gaps between domains. To address this limitation, foundation models (FM) have been trained on large-scale in-domain datasets to learn the intricate features of histopathology images. In cancer diagnosis, whole-slide image (WSI) prediction is essential for patient prognosis, and multiple instance learning (MIL) has been implemented to handle the giga-pixel size of WSI. As MIL frameworks rely on patch-level feature aggregation, this work aims to compare the performance of various feature extractors developed under different pretraining strategies for cancer subtyping on WSI under a MIL framework. Results demonstrate the ability of foundation models to surpass ImageNet-pretrained models for the prediction of six skin cancer subtypes

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present TexPro, a novel method for high-fidelity material generation for input 3D meshes given text prompts. Unlike existing text-conditioned texture generation methods that typically generate RGB textures with baked lighting, TexPro is able to produce diverse texture maps via procedural material modeling, which enables physical-based rendering, relighting, and additional benefits inherent to procedural materials. Specifically, we first generate multi-view reference images given the input textual prompt by employing the latest text-to-image model. We then derive texture maps through a rendering-based optimization with recent differentiable procedural materials. To this end, we design several techniques to handle the misalignment between the generated multi-view images and 3D meshes, and introduce a novel material agent that enhances material classification and matching by exploring both part-level understanding and object-aware material reasoning. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing SOTAs and its capability of relighting.

- **Summary**: Seismic phase picking, which aims to determine the arrival time of P- and S-waves according to seismic waveforms, is fundamental to earthquake monitoring. Generally, manual phase picking is trustworthy, but with the increasing number of worldwide stations and seismic monitors, it becomes more challenging for human to complete the task comprehensively. In this work, we explore multiple ways to do automatic phase picking, including traditional and learning-based methods.

- **Summary**: We propose a new architecture for real-time anomaly detection in video data, inspired by human behavior by combining spatial and temporal analyses. This approach uses two distinct models: for temporal analysis, a recurrent convolutional network (CNN + RNN) is employed, associating VGG19 and a GRU to process video sequences. Regarding spatial analysis, it is performed using YOLOv7 to analyze individual images. These two analyses can be carried out either in parallel, with a final prediction that combines the results of both analyses, or in series, where the spatial analysis enriches the data before the temporal analysis. In this article, we will compare these two architectural configurations with each other, to evaluate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach in video anomaly detection.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been widely used to learn from both a few labeled images and many unlabeled images to overcome the scarcity of labeled samples in medical image segmentation. Most current SSL-based segmentation methods use pixel values directly to identify similar features in labeled and unlabeled data. They usually fail to accurately capture the intricate attachment structures in the left atrium, such as the areas of inconsistent density or exhibit outward curvatures, adding to the complexity of the task. In this paper, we delve into this issue and introduce an effective solution, CORAL(Correlation-Aligned)-Correlation Consistency Network (CORN), to capture the global structure shape and local details of Left Atrium. Diverging from previous methods focused on each local pixel value, the CORAL-Correlation Consistency Module (CCM) in the CORN leverages second-order statistical information to capture global structural features by minimizing the distribution discrepancy between labeled and unlabeled samples in feature space. Yet, direct construction of features from unlabeled data frequently results in ``Sample Selection Bias'', leading to flawed supervision. We thus further propose the Dynamic Feature Pool (DFP) for the CCM, which utilizes a confidence-based filtering strategy to remove incorrectly selected features and regularize both teacher and student models by constraining the similarity matrix to be consistent. Extensive experiments on the Left Atrium dataset have shown that the proposed CORN outperforms previous state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods.

- **Summary**: In ImageNet-condensation, the storage for auxiliary soft labels exceeds that of the condensed dataset by over 30 times. However, are large-scale soft labels necessary for large-scale dataset distillation? In this paper, we first discover that the high within-class similarity in condensed datasets necessitates the use of large-scale soft labels. This high within-class similarity can be attributed to the fact that previous methods use samples from different classes to construct a single batch for batch normalization (BN) matching. To reduce the within-class similarity, we introduce class-wise supervision during the image synthesizing process by batching the samples within classes, instead of across classes. As a result, we can increase within-class diversity and reduce the size of required soft labels. A key benefit of improved image diversity is that soft label compression can be achieved through simple random pruning, eliminating the need for complex rule-based strategies. Experiments validate our discoveries. For example, when condensing ImageNet-1K to 200 images per class, our approach compresses the required soft labels from 113 GB to 2.8 GB (40x compression) with a 2.6% performance gain.

- **Summary**: Recent Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) present remarkable zero-shot conversational and reasoning capabilities given multimodal queries. Nevertheless, they suffer from object hallucination, a phenomenon where LVLMs are prone to generate textual responses not factually aligned with image inputs. Our pilot study reveals that object hallucination is closely tied with Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), a widely adopted positional dependency modeling design in existing LVLMs. Due to the long-term decay in RoPE, LVLMs tend to hallucinate more when relevant visual cues are distant from instruction tokens in the multimodal input sequence. Additionally, we observe a similar effect when reversing the sequential order of visual tokens during multimodal alignment. Our tests indicate that long-term decay in RoPE poses challenges to LVLMs while capturing visual-instruction interactions across long distances. We propose Concentric Causal Attention (CCA), a simple yet effective positional alignment strategy that mitigates the impact of RoPE long-term decay in LVLMs by naturally reducing relative distance between visual and instruction tokens. With CCA, visual tokens can better interact with instruction tokens, thereby enhancing model's perception capability and alleviating object hallucination. Without bells and whistles, our positional alignment method surpasses existing hallucination mitigation strategies by large margins on multiple object hallucination benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Reliable facial expression learning (FEL) involves the effective learning of distinctive facial expression characteristics for more reliable, unbiased and accurate predictions in real-life settings. However, current systems struggle with FEL tasks because of the variance in people's facial expressions due to their unique facial structures, movements, tones, and demographics. Biased and imbalanced datasets compound this challenge, leading to wrong and biased prediction labels. To tackle these, we introduce GReFEL, leveraging Vision Transformers and a facial geometry-aware anchor-based reliability balancing module to combat imbalanced data distributions, bias, and uncertainty in facial expression learning. Integrating local and global data with anchors that learn different facial data points and structural features, our approach adjusts biased and mislabeled emotions caused by intra-class disparity, inter-class similarity, and scale sensitivity, resulting in comprehensive, accurate, and reliable facial expression predictions. Our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methodologies, as demonstrated by extensive experiments on various datasets.

- **Summary**: Birds-Eye-View (BEV) segmentation aims to establish a spatial mapping from the perspective view to the top view and estimate the semantic maps from monocular images. Recent studies have encountered difficulties in view transformation due to the disruption of BEV-agnostic features in image space. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel FocusBEV framework consisting of $(i)$ a self-calibrated cross view transformation module to suppress the BEV-agnostic image areas and focus on the BEV-relevant areas in the view transformation stage, $(ii)$ a plug-and-play ego-motion-based temporal fusion module to exploit the spatiotemporal structure consistency in BEV space with a memory bank, and $(iii)$ an occupancy-agnostic IoU loss to mitigate both semantic and positional uncertainties. Experimental evidence demonstrates that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art on two popular benchmarks,\ie, 29.2\% mIoU on nuScenes and 35.2\% mIoU on Argoverse.

- **Summary**: The task of point cloud upsampling (PCU) is to generate dense and uniform point clouds from sparse input captured by 3D sensors like LiDAR, holding potential applications in real yet is still a challenging task. Existing deep learning-based methods have shown significant achievements in this field. However, they still face limitations in effectively handling long sequences and addressing the issue of shrinkage artifacts around the surface of the point cloud. Inspired by the newly proposed Mamba, in this paper, we introduce a network named MBPU built on top of the Mamba architecture, which performs well in long sequence modeling, especially for large-scale point cloud upsampling, and achieves fast convergence speed. Moreover, MBPU is an arbitrary-scale upsampling framework as the predictor of point distance in the point refinement phase. At the same time, we simultaneously predict the 3D position shift and 1D point-to-point distance as regression quantities to constrain the global features while ensuring the accuracy of local details. We also introduce a fast differentiable renderer to further enhance the fidelity of the upsampled point cloud and reduce artifacts. It is noted that, by the merits of our fast point rendering, MBPU yields high-quality upsampled point clouds by effectively eliminating surface noise. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our MBPU outperforms other off-the-shelf methods in terms of point cloud upsampling, especially for large-scale point clouds.

- **Summary**: The diagnosis of glaucoma plays a critical role in the management and treatment of this vision-threatening disease. Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that cause blindness by damaging the optic nerve at the back of the eye. Often called "silent thief of sight", it exhibits no symptoms during the early stages. Therefore, early detection is crucial to prevent vision loss. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Deep Learning (DL) techniques, Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CADx) systems have emerged as promising tools to assist clinicians in accurately diagnosing glaucoma early. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of AI techniques utilized in CADx systems for glaucoma diagnosis. Through a detailed analysis of current literature, we identify key gaps and challenges in these systems, emphasizing the need for improved safety, reliability, interpretability, and explainability. By identifying research gaps, we aim to advance the field of CADx systems especially for the early diagnosis of glaucoma, in order to prevent any potential loss of vision.

- **Summary**: Recently, camera pose, as a user-friendly and physics-related condition, has been introduced into text-to-video diffusion model for camera control. However, existing methods simply inject camera conditions through a side input. These approaches neglect the inherent physical knowledge of camera pose, resulting in imprecise camera control, inconsistencies, and also poor interpretability. In this paper, we emphasize the necessity of integrating explicit physical constraints into model design. Epipolar attention is proposed for modeling all cross-frame relationships from a novel perspective of noised condition. This ensures that features are aggregated from corresponding epipolar lines in all noised frames, overcoming the limitations of current attention mechanisms in tracking displaced features across frames, especially when features move significantly with the camera and become obscured by noise. Additionally, we introduce register tokens to handle cases without intersections between frames, commonly caused by rapid camera movements, dynamic objects, or occlusions. To support image-to-video, we propose the multiple guidance scale to allow for precise control for image, text, and camera, respectively. Furthermore, we establish a more robust and reproducible evaluation pipeline to solve the inaccuracy and instability of existing camera control measurement. We achieve a 25.5% improvement in camera controllability on RealEstate10K while maintaining strong generalization to out-of-domain images. Only 24GB and 12GB are required for training and inference, respectively. We plan to release checkpoints, along with training and evaluation codes.

- **Summary**: Recent large visual-language action models pretrained on diverse robot datasets have demonstrated the potential for generalizing to new environments with a few in-domain data. However, those approaches usually predict discretized or continuous actions by a small action head, which limits the ability in handling diverse action spaces. In contrast, we model the continuous action with a large multi-modal diffusion transformer, dubbed as Diffusion Transformer Policy, in which we directly denoise action chunks by a large transformer model rather than a small action head. By leveraging the scaling capability of transformers, the proposed approach can effectively model continuous end-effector actions across large diverse robot datasets, and achieve better generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate Diffusion Transformer Policy pretrained on diverse robot data can generalize to different embodiments, including simulation environments like Maniskill2 and Calvin, as well as the real-world Franka arm. Specifically, without bells and whistles, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with only a single third-view camera stream in the Calvin novel task setting (ABC->D), improving the average number of tasks completed in a row of 5 to 3.6, and the pretraining stage significantly facilitates the success sequence length on the Calvin by over 1.2. The code will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Efficient vectorization of hand-drawn cadastral maps, such as Mouza maps in Bangladesh, poses a significant challenge due to their complex structures. Current manual digitization methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Our study proposes a semi-automated approach to streamline the digitization process, saving both time and human resources. Our methodology focuses on separating the plot boundaries and plot identifiers and applying our digitization methodology to convert both of them into vectorized format. To accomplish full vectorization, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models are utilized for pre-processing and plot number detection along with our smoothing algorithms based on the diversity of vector maps. The CNN models are trained with our own labeled dataset, generated from the maps, and smoothing algorithms are introduced from the various observations of the map's vector formats. Further human intervention remains essential for precision. We have evaluated our methods on several maps and provided both quantitative and qualitative results with user study. The result demonstrates that our methodology outperforms the existing map digitization processes significantly.

- **Summary**: Large language and vision models have been leading a revolution in visual computing. By greatly scaling up sizes of data and model parameters, the large models learn deep priors which lead to remarkable performance in various tasks. In this work, we present deep prior assembly, a novel framework that assembles diverse deep priors from large models for scene reconstruction from single images in a zero-shot manner. We show that this challenging task can be done without extra knowledge but just simply generalizing one deep prior in one sub-task. To this end, we introduce novel methods related to poses, scales, and occlusion parsing which are keys to enable deep priors to work together in a robust way. Deep prior assembly does not require any 3D or 2D data-driven training in the task and demonstrates superior performance in generalizing priors to open-world scenes. We conduct evaluations on various datasets, and report analysis, numerical and visual comparisons with the latest methods to show our superiority.

### Granularity Matters in Long-Tail Learning

- **Summary**: Balancing training on long-tail data distributions remains a long-standing challenge in deep learning. While methods such as re-weighting and re-sampling help alleviate the imbalance issue, limited sample diversity continues to hinder models from learning robust and generalizable feature representations, particularly for tail classes. In contrast to existing methods, we offer a novel perspective on long-tail learning, inspired by an observation: datasets with finer granularity tend to be less affected by data imbalance. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon through both quantitative and qualitative studies, showing that increased granularity enhances the generalization of learned features in tail categories. Motivated by these findings, we propose a method to increase dataset granularity through category extrapolation. Specifically, we introduce open-set auxiliary classes that are visually similar to existing ones, aiming to enhance representation learning for both head and tail classes. This forms the core contribution and insight of our approach. To automate the curation of auxiliary data, we leverage large language models (LLMs) as knowledge bases to search for auxiliary categories and retrieve relevant images through web crawling. To prevent the overwhelming presence of auxiliary classes from disrupting training, we introduce a neighbor-silencing loss that encourages the model to focus on class discrimination within the target dataset. During inference, the classifier weights for auxiliary categories are masked out, leaving only the target class weights for use. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on three standard long-tail benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, notably outperforming strong baseline methods that use the same amount of data. The code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Despite the remarkable success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in computer vision, they fail to remain high-performing when facing distribution shifts between training and testing data. In this paper, we propose Knowledge-Guided Visual representation learning (KGV), a distribution-based learning approach leveraging multi-modal prior knowledge, to improve generalization under distribution shift. We use prior knowledge from two distinct modalities: 1) a knowledge graph (KG) with hierarchical and association relationships; and 2) generated synthetic images of visual elements semantically represented in the KG. The respective embeddings are generated from the given modalities in a common latent space, i.e., visual embeddings from original and synthetic images as well as knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs). These embeddings are aligned via a novel variant of translation-based KGE methods, where the node and relation embeddings of the KG are modeled as Gaussian distributions and translations respectively. We claim that incorporating multi-model prior knowledge enables more regularized learning of image representations. Thus, the models are able to better generalize across different data distributions. We evaluate KGV on different image classification tasks with major or minor distribution shifts, namely road sign classification across datasets from Germany, China, and Russia, image classification with the mini-ImageNet dataset and its variants, as well as the DVM-CAR dataset. The results demonstrate that KGV consistently exhibits higher accuracy and data efficiency than the baselines across all experiments.

- **Summary**: Geometry and texture estimation from a single face image is an ill-posed problem since there is very little information to work with. The problem further escalates when the face is rotated at a different angle. This paper tries to tackle this problem by introducing a novel method for texture estimation from a single image by first using StyleGAN and 3D Morphable Models. The method begins by generating multi-view faces using the latent space of GAN. Then 3DDFA trained on 3DMM estimates a 3D face mesh as well as a high-resolution texture map that is consistent with the estimated face shape. The result shows that the generated mesh is of high quality with near to accurate texture representation.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art RGB texture synthesis algorithms rely on style distances that are computed through statistics of deep features. These deep features are extracted by classification neural networks that have been trained on large datasets of RGB images. Extending such synthesis methods to multispectral images is not straightforward, since the pre-trained networks are designed for and have been trained on RGB images. In this work, we propose two solutions to extend these methods to multispectral imaging. Neither of them require additional training of the neural network from which the second order neural statistics are extracted. The first one consists in optimizing over batches of random triplets of spectral bands throughout training. The second one projects multispectral pixels onto a 3 dimensional space. We further explore the benefit of a color transfer operation upstream of the projection to avoid the potentially abnormal color distributions induced by the projection. Our experiments compare the performances of the various methods through different metrics. We demonstrate that they can be used to perform exemplar-based texture synthesis, achieve good visual quality and comes close to state-of-the art methods on RGB bands.

- **Summary**: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enable models to generalize to unseen target domains by learning from multiple source domains. Existing DG methods primarily rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which inherently learn texture biases due to their limited receptive fields, making them prone to overfitting source domains. While some works have introduced transformer-based methods (ViTs) for DG to leverage the global receptive field, these methods incur high computational costs due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. Recently, advanced state space models (SSMs), represented by Mamba, have shown promising results in supervised learning tasks by achieving linear complexity in sequence length during training and fast RNN-like computation during inference. Inspired by this, we investigate the generalization ability of the Mamba model under domain shifts and find that input-dependent matrices within SSMs could accumulate and amplify domain-specific features, thus hindering model generalization. To address this issue, we propose a novel SSM-based architecture with saliency-based token-aware transformation (namely START), which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances and offers a competitive alternative to CNNs and ViTs. Our START can selectively perturb and suppress domain-specific features in salient tokens within the input-dependent matrices of SSMs, thus effectively reducing the discrepancy between different domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that START outperforms existing SOTA DG methods with efficient linear complexity.

- **Summary**: Current large open vision models could be useful for one and few-shot object recognition. Nevertheless, gradient-based re-training solutions are costly. On the other hand, open-vocabulary object detection models bring closer visual and textual concepts in the same latent space, allowing zero-shot detection via prompting at small computational cost. We propose a lightweight method to turn the latter into a one-shot or few-shot object recognition models without requiring textual descriptions. Our experiments on the TEgO dataset using the YOLO-World model as a base show that performance increases with the model size, the number of examples and the use of image augmentation.

- **Summary**: Road++ Track3 proposes a multi-label atomic activity recognition task in traffic scenarios, which can be standardized as a 64-class multi-label video action recognition task. In the multi-label atomic activity recognition task, the robustness of visual feature extraction remains a key challenge, which directly affects the model performance and generalization ability. To cope with these issues, our team optimized three aspects: data processing, model and post-processing. Firstly, the appropriate resolution and video sampling strategy are selected, and a fixed sampling strategy is set on the validation and test sets. Secondly, in terms of model training, the team selects a variety of visual backbone networks for feature extraction, and then introduces the action-slot model, which is trained on the training and validation sets, and reasoned on the test set. Finally, for post-processing, the team combined the strengths and weaknesses of different models for weighted fusion, and the final mAP on the test set was 58%, which is 4% higher than the challenge baseline.

- **Summary**: In computational pathology, several foundation models have recently emerged and demonstrated enhanced learning capability for analyzing pathology images. However, adapting these models to various downstream tasks remains challenging, particularly when faced with datasets from different sources and acquisition conditions, as well as limited data availability. In this study, we benchmark four pathology-specific foundation models across 14 datasets and two scenarios-consistency assessment and flexibility assessment-addressing diverse adaptation scenarios and downstream tasks. In the consistency assessment scenario, involving five fine-tuning methods, we found that the parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach was both efficient and effective for adapting pathology-specific foundation models to diverse datasets within the same downstream task. In the flexibility assessment scenario under data-limited environments, utilizing five few-shot learning methods, we observed that the foundation models benefited more from the few-shot learning methods that involve modification during the testing phase only. These findings provide insights that could guide the deployment of pathology-specific foundation models in real clinical settings, potentially improving the accuracy and reliability of pathology image analysis.

- **Summary**: Modeling strong gravitational lenses is prohibitively expensive for modern and next-generation cosmic survey data. Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a simulation-based inference (SBI) approach, has been studied as an avenue for efficient analysis of strong lensing data. However, NPE has not been demonstrated to perform well on out-of-domain target data -- e.g., when trained on simulated data and then applied to real, observational data. In this work, we perform the first study of the efficacy of NPE in combination with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). The source domain is noiseless, and the target domain has noise mimicking modern cosmology surveys. We find that combining UDA and NPE improves the accuracy of the inference by 1-2 orders of magnitude and significantly improves the posterior coverage over an NPE model without UDA. We anticipate that this combination of approaches will help enable future applications of NPE models to real observational data.

- **Summary**: The success of medical image segmentation usually requires a large number of high-quality labels. But since the labeling process is usually affected by the raters' varying skill levels and characteristics, the estimated masks provided by different raters usually suffer from high inter-rater variability. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Label Filling framework, termed as LF-Net, predicting the groundtruth segmentation label given only noisy annotations during training. The fundamental idea of label filling is to supervise the segmentation model by a subset of pixels with trustworthy labels, meanwhile filling labels of other pixels by mixed supervision. More concretely, we propose a qualified majority voting strategy, i.e., a threshold voting scheme is designed to model agreement among raters and the majority-voted labels of the selected subset of pixels are regarded as supervision. To fill labels of other pixels, two types of mixed auxiliary supervision are proposed: a soft label learned from intrinsic structures of noisy annotations, and raters' characteristics labels which propagate individual rater's characteristics information. LF-Net has two main advantages. 1) Training with trustworthy pixels incorporates training with confident supervision, guiding the direction of groundtruth label learning. 2) Two types of mixed supervision prevent over-fitting issues when the network is supervised by a subset of pixels, and guarantee high fidelity with the true label. Results on five datasets of diverse imaging modalities show that our LF-Net boosts segmentation accuracy in all datasets compared with state-of-the-art methods, with even a 7% improvement in DSC for MS lesion segmentation.

- **Summary**: Small sample instance segmentation is a very challenging task, and many existing methods follow the training strategy of meta-learning which pre-train models on support set and fine-tune on query set. The pre-training phase, which is highly task related, requires a significant amount of additional training time and the selection of datasets with close proximity to ensure effectiveness. The article proposes a novel small sample instance segmentation solution from the perspective of maximizing the utilization of existing information without increasing annotation burden and training costs. The proposed method designs two modules to address the problems encountered in small sample instance segmentation. First, it helps the model fully utilize unlabeled data by learning to generate pseudo labels, increasing the number of available samples. Second, by integrating the features of text and image, more accurate classification results can be obtained. These two modules are suitable for box-free and box-dependent frameworks. In the way, the proposed method not only improves the performance of small sample instance segmentation, but also greatly reduce reliance on pre-training. We have conducted experiments in three datasets from different scenes: on land, underwater and under microscope. As evidenced by our experiments, integrated image-text corrects the confidence of classification, and pseudo labels help the model obtain preciser masks. All the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

- **Summary**: Automating the theory-experiment cycle requires effective distributed workflows that utilize a computing continuum spanning lab instruments, edge sensors, computing resources at multiple facilities, data sets distributed across multiple information sources, and potentially cloud. Unfortunately, the obvious methods for constructing continuum platforms, orchestrating workflow tasks, and curating datasets over time fail to achieve scientific requirements for performance, energy, security, and reliability. Furthermore, achieving the best use of continuum resources depends upon the efficient composition and execution of workflow tasks, i.e., combinations of numerical solvers, data analytics, and machine learning. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's LDRD "Cloud, High-Performance Computing (HPC), and Edge for Science and Security" (CHESS) has developed a set of interrelated capabilities for enabling distributed scientific workflows and curating datasets. This report describes the results and successes of CHESS from the perspective of open science.

- **Summary**: Image dehazing has drawn a significant attention in recent years. Learning-based methods usually require paired hazy and corresponding ground truth (haze-free) images for training. However, it is difficult to collect real-world image pairs, which prevents developments of existing methods. Although several works partially alleviate this issue by using synthetic datasets or small-scale real datasets. The haze intensity distribution bias and scene homogeneity in existing datasets limit the generalization ability of these methods, particularly when encountering images with previously unseen haze intensities. In this work, we present LMHaze, a large-scale, high-quality real-world dataset. LMHaze comprises paired hazy and haze-free images captured in diverse indoor and outdoor environments, spanning multiple scenarios and haze intensities. It contains over 5K high-resolution image pairs, surpassing the size of the biggest existing real-world dehazing dataset by over 25 times. Meanwhile, to better handle images with different haze intensities, we propose a mixture-of-experts model based on Mamba (MoE-Mamba) for dehazing, which dynamically adjusts the model parameters according to the haze intensity. Moreover, with our proposed dataset, we conduct a new large multimodal model (LMM)-based benchmark study to simulate human perception for evaluating dehazed images. Experiments demonstrate that LMHaze dataset improves the dehazing performance in real scenarios and our dehazing method provides better results compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Understanding specifically where a model focuses on within an image is critical for human interpretability of the decision-making process. Deep learning-based solutions are prone to learning coincidental correlations in training datasets, causing over-fitting and reducing the explainability. Recent advances have shown that guiding models to human-defined regions of saliency within individual images significantly increases performance and interpretability. Human-guided models also exhibit greater generalization capabilities, as coincidental dataset features are avoided. Results show that models trained with saliency incorporation display an increase in interpretability of up to 30% over models trained without saliency information. The collection of this saliency information, however, can be costly, laborious and in some cases infeasible. To address this limitation, we propose a combination strategy of saliency incorporation and active learning to reduce the human annotation data required by 80% while maintaining the interpretability and performance increase from human saliency. Extensive experimentation outlines the effectiveness of the proposed approach across five public datasets and six active learning criteria.

- **Summary**: Solar flare forecasting mainly relies on photospheric magnetograms and associated physical features to predict forthcoming flares. However, it is believed that flare initiation mechanisms often originate in the chromosphere and the lower corona. In this study, we employ deep learning as a purely data-driven approach to compare the predictive capabilities of chromospheric and coronal UV and EUV emissions across different wavelengths with those of photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms. Our findings indicate that individual EUV wavelengths can provide discriminatory power comparable or better to that of line-of-sight magnetograms. Moreover, we identify simple multimodal neural network architectures that consistently outperform single-input models, showing complementarity between the flare precursors that can be extracted from the distinct layers of the solar atmosphere. To mitigate potential biases from known misattributions in Active Region flare catalogs, our models are trained and evaluated using full-disk images and a comprehensive flare event catalog at the full-disk level. We introduce a deep-learning architecture suited for extracting temporal features from full-disk videos.

- **Summary**: Pediatric pneumonia remains a significant global threat, posing a larger mortality risk than any other communicable disease. According to UNICEF, it is a leading cause of mortality in children under five and requires prompt diagnosis. Early diagnosis using chest radiographs is the prevalent standard, but limitations include low radiation levels in unprocessed images and data imbalance issues. This necessitates the development of efficient, computer-aided diagnosis techniques. To this end, we propose a novel EXplainable Contrastive-based Dilated Convolutional Network with Transformer (XCCNet) for pediatric pneumonia detection. XCCNet harnesses the spatial power of dilated convolutions and the global insights from contrastive-based transformers for effective feature refinement. A robust chest X-ray processing module tackles low-intensity radiographs, while adversarial-based data augmentation mitigates the skewed distribution of chest X-rays in the dataset. Furthermore, we actively integrate an explainability approach through feature visualization, directly aligning it with the attention region that pinpoints the presence of pneumonia or normality in radiographs. The efficacy of XCCNet is comprehensively assessed on four publicly available datasets. Extensive performance evaluation demonstrates the superiority of XCCNet compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Domain generalization methods aim to learn transferable knowledge from source domains that can generalize well to unseen target domains. Recent studies show that neural networks frequently suffer from a simplicity-biased learning behavior which leads to over-reliance on specific frequency sets, namely as frequency shortcuts, instead of semantic information, resulting in poor generalization performance. Despite previous data augmentation techniques successfully enhancing generalization performances, they intend to apply more frequency shortcuts, thereby causing hallucinations of generalization improvement. In this paper, we aim to prevent such learning behavior of applying frequency shortcuts from a data-driven perspective. Given the theoretical justification of models' biased learning behavior on different spatial frequency components, which is based on the dataset frequency properties, we argue that the learning behavior on various frequency components could be manipulated by changing the dataset statistical structure in the Fourier domain. Intuitively, as frequency shortcuts are hidden in the dominant and highly dependent frequencies of dataset structure, dynamically perturbating the over-reliance frequency components could prevent the application of frequency shortcuts. To this end, we propose two effective data augmentation modules designed to collaboratively and adaptively adjust the frequency characteristic of the dataset, aiming to dynamically influence the learning behavior of the model and ultimately serving as a strategy to mitigate shortcut learning.

- **Summary**: Using image models naively for solving inverse video problems often suffers from flickering, texture-sticking, and temporal inconsistency in generated videos. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we view frames as continuous functions in the 2D space, and videos as a sequence of continuous warping transformations between different frames. This perspective allows us to train function space diffusion models only on images and utilize them to solve temporally correlated inverse problems. The function space diffusion models need to be equivariant with respect to the underlying spatial transformations. To ensure temporal consistency, we introduce a simple post-hoc test-time guidance towards (self)-equivariant solutions. Our method allows us to deploy state-of-the-art latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion XL to solve video inverse problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for video inpainting and $8\times$ video super-resolution, outperforming existing techniques based on noise transformations.

- **Summary**: Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their development has predominantly focused on English- and western-centric datasets and tasks, leaving most of the world's languages and diverse cultural contexts underrepresented. This paper introduces Pangea, a multilingual multimodal LLM trained on PangeaIns, a diverse 6M instruction dataset spanning 39 languages. PangeaIns features: 1) high-quality English instructions, 2) carefully machine-translated instructions, and 3) culturally relevant multimodal tasks to ensure cross-cultural coverage. To rigorously assess models' capabilities, we introduce PangeaBench, a holistic evaluation suite encompassing 14 datasets covering 47 languages. Results show that Pangea significantly outperforms existing open-source models in multilingual settings and diverse cultural contexts. Ablation studies further reveal the importance of English data proportions, language popularity, and the number of multimodal training samples on overall performance. We fully open-source our data, code, and trained checkpoints, to facilitate the development of inclusive and robust multilingual MLLMs, promoting equity and accessibility across a broader linguistic and cultural spectrum.

- **Summary**: Artificial Neural Networks of varying architectures are generally paired with affine transformation at the core. However, we find dot product neurons with global influence less interpretable as compared to local influence of euclidean distance (as used in Radial Basis Function Network). In this work, we explore the generalization of dot product neurons to $l^p$-norm, metrics, and beyond. We find that metrics as transform performs similarly to affine transform when used in MultiLayer Perceptron or Convolutional Neural Network. Moreover, we explore various properties of Metrics, compare it with Affine, and present multiple cases where metrics seem to provide better interpretability. We develop an interpretable local dictionary based Neural Networks and use it to understand and reject adversarial examples.

- **Summary**: Vision language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, their proficiency in spatial reasoning remains limited, despite its crucial role in tasks involving navigation and interaction with physical environments. Specifically, much of the spatial reasoning in these tasks occurs in two-dimensional (2D) environments, and our evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art VLMs frequently generate implausible and incorrect responses to composite spatial reasoning problems, including simple pathfinding tasks that humans can solve effortlessly at a glance. To address this, we explore an effective approach to enhance 2D spatial reasoning within VLMs by training the model on basic spatial capabilities. We begin by disentangling the key components of 2D spatial reasoning: direction comprehension, distance estimation, and localization. Our central hypothesis is that mastering these basic spatial capabilities can significantly enhance a model's performance on composite spatial tasks requiring advanced spatial understanding and combinatorial problem-solving. To investigate this hypothesis, we introduce Sparkle, a framework that fine-tunes VLMs on these three basic spatial capabilities by synthetic data generation and targeted supervision to form an instruction dataset for each capability. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs fine-tuned with Sparkle achieve significant performance gains, not only in the basic tasks themselves but also in generalizing to composite and out-of-distribution spatial reasoning tasks (e.g., improving from 13.5% to 40.0% on the shortest path problem). These findings underscore the effectiveness of mastering basic spatial capabilities in enhancing composite spatial problem-solving, offering insights for improving VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities.

- **Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant breakthroughs in various vision-language and vision-centric tasks based on auto-regressive modeling. However, these models typically focus on either vision-centric tasks, such as visual grounding and region description, or vision-language tasks, like image caption and multi-scenario VQAs. None of the LMMs have yet comprehensively unified both types of tasks within a single model, as seen in Large Language Models in the natural language processing field. Furthermore, even with abundant multi-task instruction-following data, directly stacking these data for universal capabilities extension remains challenging. To address these issues, we introduce a novel multi-dimension curated and consolidated multimodal dataset, named CCMD-8M, which overcomes the data barriers of unifying vision-centric and vision-language tasks through multi-level data curation and multi-task consolidation. More importantly, we present Griffon-G, a general large multimodal model that addresses both vision-centric and vision-language tasks within a single end-to-end paradigm. Griffon-G resolves the training collapse issue encountered during the joint optimization of these tasks, achieving better training efficiency. Evaluations across multimodal benchmarks, general Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, scene text-centric VQA tasks, document-related VQA tasks, Referring Expression Comprehension, and object detection demonstrate that Griffon-G surpasses the advanced LMMs and achieves expert-level performance in complicated vision-centric tasks.



### Beyond Filtering: Adaptive Image-Text Quality Enhancement for MLLM Pretraining

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides by integrating visual and textual modalities. A critical factor in training MLLMs is the quality of image-text pairs within multimodal pretraining datasets. However, $\textit {de facto}$ filter-based data quality enhancement paradigms often discard a substantial portion of high-quality image data due to inadequate semantic alignment between images and texts, leading to inefficiencies in data utilization and scalability. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive Image-Text Quality Enhancer (AITQE), a model that dynamically assesses and enhances the quality of image-text pairs. AITQE employs a text rewriting mechanism for low-quality pairs and incorporates a negative sample learning strategy to improve evaluative capabilities by integrating deliberately selected low-quality samples during training. Unlike prior approaches that significantly alter text distributions, our method minimally adjusts text to preserve data volume while enhancing quality. Experimental results demonstrate that AITQE surpasses existing methods on various benchmark, effectively leveraging raw data and scaling efficiently with increasing data volumes. We hope our work will inspire future works. The code and model are available at: https://github.com/hanhuang22/AITQE.



### A Framework for Evaluating Predictive Models Using Synthetic Image Covariates and Longitudinal Data

- **Summary**: We present a novel framework for synthesizing patient data with complex covariates (e.g., eye scans) paired with longitudinal observations (e.g., visual acuity over time), addressing privacy concerns in healthcare research. Our approach introduces controlled association in latent spaces generating each data modality, enabling the creation of complex covariate-longitudinal observation pairs. This framework facilitates the development of predictive models and provides openly available benchmarking datasets for healthcare research. We demonstrate our framework using optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, though it is applicable across domains. Using 109,309 2D OCT scan slices, we trained an image generative model combining a variational autoencoder and a diffusion model. Longitudinal observations were simulated using a nonlinear mixed effect (NLME) model from a low-dimensional space of random effects. We generated 1.1M OCT scan slices paired with five sets of longitudinal observations at controlled association levels (100%, 50%, 10%, 5.26%, and 2% of between-subject variability). To assess the framework, we modeled synthetic longitudinal observations with another NLME model, computed empirical Bayes estimates of random effects, and trained a ResNet to predict these estimates from synthetic OCT scans. We then incorporated ResNet predictions into the NLME model for patient-individualized predictions. Prediction accuracy on withheld data declined as intended with reduced association between images and longitudinal measurements. Notably, in all but the 2% case, we achieved within 50% of the theoretical best possible prediction on withheld data, demonstrating our ability to detect even weak signals. This confirms the effectiveness of our framework in generating synthetic data with controlled levels of association, providing a valuable tool for healthcare research.

- **Summary**: This work explores how human judgement about salient regions of an image can be introduced into deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) training. Traditionally, training of DCNNs is purely data-driven. This often results in learning features of the data that are only coincidentally correlated with class labels. Human saliency can guide network training using our proposed new component of the loss function that ConveYs Brain Oversight to Raise Generalization (CYBORG) and penalizes the model for using non-salient regions. This mechanism produces DCNNs achieving higher accuracy and generalization compared to using the same training data without human salience. Experimental results demonstrate that CYBORG applies across multiple network architectures and problem domains (detection of synthetic faces, iris presentation attacks and anomalies in chest X-rays), while requiring significantly less data than training without human saliency guidance. Visualizations show that CYBORG-trained models' saliency is more consistent across independent training runs than traditionally-trained models, and also in better agreement with humans. To lower the cost of collecting human annotations, we also explore using deep learning to provide automated annotations. CYBORG training of CNNs addresses important issues such as reducing the appetite for large training sets, increasing interpretability, and reducing fragility by generalizing better to new types of data.

- **Summary**: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in vision language models (VLMs) is crucial for improving interpretability and trustworthiness. However, current training recipes lack robust CoT reasoning data, relying on datasets dominated by short annotations with minimal rationales. In this work, we show that training VLM on short answers does not generalize well to reasoning tasks that require more detailed responses. To address this, we propose a two-fold approach. First, we distill rationales from GPT-4o model to enrich the training data and fine-tune VLMs, boosting their CoT performance. Second, we apply reinforcement learning to further calibrate reasoning quality. Specifically, we construct positive (correct) and negative (incorrect) pairs of model-generated reasoning chains, by comparing their predictions with annotated short answers. Using this pairwise data, we apply the Direct Preference Optimization algorithm to refine the model's reasoning abilities. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in CoT reasoning on benchmark datasets and better generalization to direct answer prediction as well. This work emphasizes the importance of incorporating detailed rationales in training and leveraging reinforcement learning to strengthen the reasoning capabilities of VLMs.

- **Summary**: Prevailing wisdom asserts that one cannot rely on the cloud for critical real-time control systems like self-driving cars. We argue that we can, and must. Following the trends of increasing model sizes, improvements in hardware, and evolving mobile networks, we identify an opportunity to offload parts of time-sensitive and latency-critical compute to the cloud. Doing so requires carefully allocating bandwidth to meet strict latency SLOs, while maximizing benefit to the car.

- **Summary**: The success of Large Language Models (LLM) has led researchers to explore Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) for unified visual and linguistic understanding. However, the increasing model size and computational complexity of MLLM limit their use in resource-constrained environments. Small-scale MLLM (s-MLLM) aims to retain the capabilities of the large-scale model (l-MLLM) while reducing computational demands, but resulting in a significant decline in performance. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel LLaVA-KD framework to transfer knowledge from l-MLLM to s-MLLM. Specifically, we introduce Multimodal Distillation (MDist) to minimize the divergence between the visual-textual output distributions of l-MLLM and s-MLLM, and Relation Distillation (RDist) to transfer l-MLLM's ability to model correlations between visual features. Additionally, we propose a three-stage training scheme to fully exploit the potential of s-MLLM: 1) Distilled Pre-Training to align visual-textual representations, 2) Supervised Fine-Tuning to equip the model with multimodal understanding, and 3) Distilled Fine-Tuning to further transfer l-MLLM capabilities. Our approach significantly improves performance without altering the small model's architecture. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.

- **Summary**: Objective: To develop and evaluate a deep radiomics model for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa, grade group >= 2) detection and compare its performance to Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) assessment in a multicenter cohort. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study analyzed biparametric (T2W and DW) prostate MRI sequences of 615 patients (mean age, 63.1 +/- 7 years) from four datasets acquired between 2010 and 2020: PROSTATEx challenge, Prostate158 challenge, PCaMAP trial, and an in-house (NTNU/St. Olavs Hospital) dataset. With expert annotations as ground truth, a deep radiomics model was trained, including nnU-Net segmentation of the prostate gland, voxel-wise radiomic feature extraction, extreme gradient boost classification, and post-processing of tumor probability maps into csPCa detection maps. Training involved 5-fold cross-validation using the PROSTATEx (n=199), Prostate158 (n=138), and PCaMAP (n=78) datasets, and testing on the in-house (n=200) dataset. Patient- and lesion-level performance were compared to PI-RADS using area under ROC curve (AUROC [95% CI]), sensitivity, and specificity analysis. Results: On the test data, the radiologist achieved a patient-level AUROC of 0.94 [0.91-0.98] with 94% (75/80) sensitivity and 77% (92/120) specificity at PI-RADS >= 3. The deep radiomics model at a tumor probability cut-off >= 0.76 achieved 0.91 [0.86-0.95] AUROC with 90% (72/80) sensitivity and 73% (87/120) specificity, not significantly different (p = 0.068) from PI-RADS. On the lesion level, PI-RADS cut-off >= 3 had 84% (91/108) sensitivity at 0.2 (40/200) false positives per patient, while deep radiomics attained 68% (73/108) sensitivity at the same false positive rate. Conclusion: Deep radiomics machine learning model achieved comparable performance to PI-RADS assessment in csPCa detection at the patient-level but not at the lesion-level.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a novel Multi-Modal Contrastive Pre-training Framework that synergistically combines X-rays, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and radiology/cardiology reports. Our approach leverages transformers to encode these diverse modalities into a unified representation space, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy and facilitate comprehensive patient assessments. We utilize LoRA-Peft to significantly reduce trainable parameters in the LLM and incorporate recent linear attention dropping strategy in the Vision Transformer(ViT) for smoother attention. Furthermore, we provide novel multimodal attention explanations and retrieval for our model. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an integrated model that combines X-ray, ECG, and Radiology/Cardiology Report with this approach. By utilizing contrastive loss, MoRE effectively aligns modality-specific features into a coherent embedding, which supports various downstream tasks such as zero-shot classification and multimodal retrieval. Employing our proposed methodology, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the Mimic-IV, CheXpert, Edema Severity, and PtbXl downstream datasets, surpassing existing multimodal approaches. Our proposed framework shows significant improvements in capturing intricate inter-modal relationships and its robustness in medical diagnosis that establishes a framework for future research in multimodal learning in the healthcare sector.

- **Summary**: Industrial anomaly detection is crucial for quality control and predictive maintenance, but it presents challenges due to limited training data, diverse anomaly types, and external factors that alter object appearances. Existing methods commonly detect structural anomalies, such as dents and scratches, by leveraging multi-scale features from image patches extracted through deep pre-trained networks. However, significant memory and computational demands often limit their practical application. Additionally, detecting logical anomalies-such as images with missing or excess elements-requires an understanding of spatial relationships that traditional patch-based methods fail to capture. In this work, we address these limitations by focusing on Deep Feature Reconstruction (DFR), a memory- and compute-efficient approach for detecting structural anomalies. We further enhance DFR into a unified framework, called ULSAD, which is capable of detecting both structural and logical anomalies. Specifically, we refine the DFR training objective to improve performance in structural anomaly detection, while introducing an attention-based loss mechanism using a global autoencoder-like network to handle logical anomaly detection. Our empirical evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates the performance of ULSAD in detecting and localizing both structural and logical anomalies, outperforming eight state-of-the-art methods. An extensive ablation study further highlights the contribution of each component to the overall performance improvement.

- **Summary**: The success of autoregressive (AR) language models in text generation has inspired the computer vision community to adopt Large Language Models (LLMs) for image generation. However, considering the essential differences between text and image modalities, the design space of language models for image generation remains underexplored. We observe that image tokens exhibit greater randomness compared to text tokens, which presents challenges when training with token prediction. Nevertheless, AR models demonstrate their potential by effectively learning patterns even from a seemingly suboptimal optimization problem. Our analysis also reveals that while all models successfully grasp the importance of local information in image generation, smaller models struggle to capture the global context. In contrast, larger models showcase improved capabilities in this area, helping to explain the performance gains achieved when scaling up model size. We further elucidate the design space of language models for vision generation, including tokenizer choice, model choice, model scalability, vocabulary design, and sampling strategy through extensive comparative experiments. Our work is the first to analyze the optimization behavior of language models in vision generation, and we believe it can inspire more effective designs when applying LMs to other domains. Finally, our elucidated language model for image generation, termed as ELM, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet 256*256 benchmark.

- **Summary**: We present Agent-to-Sim (ATS), a framework for learning interactive behavior models of 3D agents from casual longitudinal video collections. Different from prior works that rely on marker-based tracking and multiview cameras, ATS learns natural behaviors of animal and human agents non-invasively through video observations recorded over a long time-span (e.g., a month) in a single environment. Modeling 3D behavior of an agent requires persistent 3D tracking (e.g., knowing which point corresponds to which) over a long time period. To obtain such data, we develop a coarse-to-fine registration method that tracks the agent and the camera over time through a canonical 3D space, resulting in a complete and persistent spacetime 4D representation. We then train a generative model of agent behaviors using paired data of perception and motion of an agent queried from the 4D reconstruction. ATS enables real-to-sim transfer from video recordings of an agent to an interactive behavior simulator. We demonstrate results on pets (e.g., cat, dog, bunny) and human given monocular RGBD videos captured by a smartphone.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in vision-language tasks across a broad spectrum of domains. However, the large model scale and associated high computational costs pose significant challenges for training and deploying MLLMs on consumer-grade GPUs or edge devices, thereby hindering their widespread application. In this work, we introduce Mini-InternVL, a series of MLLMs with parameters ranging from 1B to 4B, which achieves 90% of the performance with only 5% of the parameters. This significant improvement in efficiency and effectiveness makes our models more accessible and applicable in various real-world scenarios. To further promote the adoption of our models, we develop a unified adaptation framework for Mini-InternVL, which enables our models to transfer and outperform specialized models in downstream tasks, including autonomous driving, medical images, and remote sensing. We believe that our study can provide valuable insights and resources to advance the development of efficient and effective MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVL.

- **Summary**: Novel-view synthesis aims to generate novel views of a scene from multiple input images or videos, and recent advancements like 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) have achieved notable success in producing photorealistic renderings with efficient pipelines. However, generating high-quality novel views under challenging settings, such as sparse input views, remains difficult due to insufficient information in under-sampled areas, often resulting in noticeable artifacts. This paper presents 3DGS-Enhancer, a novel pipeline for enhancing the representation quality of 3DGS representations. We leverage 2D video diffusion priors to address the challenging 3D view consistency problem, reformulating it as achieving temporal consistency within a video generation process. 3DGS-Enhancer restores view-consistent latent features of rendered novel views and integrates them with the input views through a spatial-temporal decoder. The enhanced views are then used to fine-tune the initial 3DGS model, significantly improving its rendering performance. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets of unbounded scenes demonstrate that 3DGS-Enhancer yields superior reconstruction performance and high-fidelity rendering results compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: We present xGen-MM-Vid (BLIP-3-Video): a multimodal language model for videos, particularly designed to efficiently capture temporal information over multiple frames. BLIP-3-Video takes advantage of the 'temporal encoder' in addition to the conventional visual tokenizer, which maps a sequence of tokens over multiple frames into a compact set of visual tokens. This enables BLIP3-Video to use much fewer visual tokens than its competing models (e.g., 32 vs. 4608 tokens). We explore different types of temporal encoders, including learnable spatio-temporal pooling as well as sequential models like Token Turing Machines. We experimentally confirm that BLIP-3-Video obtains video question-answering accuracies comparable to much larger state-of-the-art models (e.g., 34B), while being much smaller (i.e., 4B) and more efficient by using fewer visual tokens.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has emerged as a powerful foundation model for object segmentation in both images and videos, paving the way for various downstream video applications. The crucial design of SAM 2 for video segmentation is its memory module, which prompts object-aware memories from previous frames for current frame prediction. However, its greedy-selection memory design suffers from the "error accumulation" problem, where an errored or missed mask will cascade and influence the segmentation of the subsequent frames, which limits the performance of SAM 2 toward complex long-term videos. To this end, we introduce SAM2Long, an improved training-free video object segmentation strategy, which considers the segmentation uncertainty within each frame and chooses the video-level optimal results from multiple segmentation pathways in a constrained tree search manner. In practice, we maintain a fixed number of segmentation pathways throughout the video. For each frame, multiple masks are proposed based on the existing pathways, creating various candidate branches. We then select the same fixed number of branches with higher cumulative scores as the new pathways for the next frame. After processing the final frame, the pathway with the highest cumulative score is chosen as the final segmentation result. Benefiting from its heuristic search design, SAM2Long is robust toward occlusions and object reappearances, and can effectively segment and track objects for complex long-term videos. Notably, SAM2Long achieves an average improvement of 3.0 points across all 24 head-to-head comparisons, with gains of up to 5.3 points in J&F on long-term video object segmentation benchmarks such as SA-V and LVOS. The code is released at https://github.com/Mark12Ding/SAM2Long.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) face significant challenges in few-shot scenarios, primarily due to overfitting and long training times for high-fidelity rendering. Existing methods, such as FreeNeRF and SparseNeRF, use frequency regularization or pre-trained priors but struggle with complex scheduling and bias. We introduce FrugalNeRF, a novel few-shot NeRF framework that leverages weight-sharing voxels across multiple scales to efficiently represent scene details. Our key contribution is a cross-scale geometric adaptation scheme that selects pseudo ground truth depth based on reprojection errors across scales. This guides training without relying on externally learned priors, enabling full utilization of the training data. It can also integrate pre-trained priors, enhancing quality without slowing convergence. Experiments on LLFF, DTU, and RealEstate-10K show that FrugalNeRF outperforms other few-shot NeRF methods while significantly reducing training time, making it a practical solution for efficient and accurate 3D scene reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Drag-based editing has become popular in 2D content creation, driven by the capabilities of image generative models. However, extending this technique to 3D remains a challenge. Existing 3D drag-based editing methods, whether employing explicit spatial transformations or relying on implicit latent optimization within limited-capacity 3D generative models, fall short in handling significant topology changes or generating new textures across diverse object categories. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MVDrag3D, a novel framework for more flexible and creative drag-based 3D editing that leverages multi-view generation and reconstruction priors. At the core of our approach is the usage of a multi-view diffusion model as a strong generative prior to perform consistent drag editing over multiple rendered views, which is followed by a reconstruction model that reconstructs 3D Gaussians of the edited object. While the initial 3D Gaussians may suffer from misalignment between different views, we address this via view-specific deformation networks that adjust the position of Gaussians to be well aligned. In addition, we propose a multi-view score function that distills generative priors from multiple views to further enhance the view consistency and visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVDrag3D provides a precise, generative, and flexible solution for 3D drag-based editing, supporting more versatile editing effects across various object categories and 3D representations.

- **Summary**: We introduce Joker, a new method for the conditional synthesis of 3D human heads with extreme expressions. Given a single reference image of a person, we synthesize a volumetric human head with the reference identity and a new expression. We offer control over the expression via a 3D morphable model (3DMM) and textual inputs. This multi-modal conditioning signal is essential since 3DMMs alone fail to define subtle emotional changes and extreme expressions, including those involving the mouth cavity and tongue articulation. Our method is built upon a 2D diffusion-based prior that generalizes well to out-of-domain samples, such as sculptures, heavy makeup, and paintings while achieving high levels of expressiveness. To improve view consistency, we propose a new 3D distillation technique that converts predictions of our 2D prior into a neural radiance field (NeRF). Both the 2D prior and our distillation technique produce state-of-the-art results, which are confirmed by our extensive evaluations. Also, to the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to achieve view-consistent extreme tongue articulation.

- **Summary**: Stroke-based Rendering (SBR) aims to decompose an input image into a sequence of parameterized strokes, which can be rendered into a painting that resembles the input image. Recently, Neural Painting methods that utilize deep learning and reinforcement learning models to predict the stroke sequences have been developed, but suffer from longer inference time or unstable training. To address these issues, we propose AttentionPainter, an efficient and adaptive model for single-step neural painting. First, we propose a novel scalable stroke predictor, which predicts a large number of stroke parameters within a single forward process, instead of the iterative prediction of previous Reinforcement Learning or auto-regressive methods, which makes AttentionPainter faster than previous neural painting methods. To further increase the training efficiency, we propose a Fast Stroke Stacking algorithm, which brings 13 times acceleration for training. Moreover, we propose Stroke-density Loss, which encourages the model to use small strokes for detailed information, to help improve the reconstruction quality. Finally, we propose a new stroke diffusion model for both conditional and unconditional stroke-based generation, which denoises in the stroke parameter space and facilitates stroke-based inpainting and editing applications helpful for human artists design. Extensive experiments show that AttentionPainter outperforms the state-of-the-art neural painting methods.

- **Summary**: Human hand and head movements are the most pervasive input modalities in extended reality (XR) and are significant for a wide range of applications. However, prior works on hand and head modelling in XR only explored a single modality or focused on specific applications. We present HaHeAE - a novel self-supervised method for learning generalisable joint representations of hand and head movements in XR. At the core of our method is an autoencoder (AE) that uses a graph convolutional network-based semantic encoder and a diffusion-based stochastic encoder to learn the joint semantic and stochastic representations of hand-head movements. It also features a diffusion-based decoder to reconstruct the original signals. Through extensive evaluations on three public XR datasets, we show that our method 1) significantly outperforms commonly used self-supervised methods by up to 74.0% in terms of reconstruction quality and is generalisable across users, activities, and XR environments, 2) enables new applications, including interpretable hand-head cluster identification and variable hand-head movement generation, and 3) can serve as an effective feature extractor for downstream tasks. Together, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and underline the potential of self-supervised methods for jointly modelling hand-head behaviours in extended reality.

- **Summary**: Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) aims to recognize corresponding text by analyzing visual information from lip movements. Due to the high variability and weak information of lip movements, VSR tasks require effectively utilizing any information from any source and at any level. In this paper, we propose a VSR method based on audio-visual cross-modal alignment, named AlignVSR. The method leverages the audio modality as an auxiliary information source and utilizes the global and local correspondence between the audio and visual modalities to improve visual-to-text inference. Specifically, the method first captures global alignment between video and audio through a cross-modal attention mechanism from video frames to a bank of audio units. Then, based on the temporal correspondence between audio and video, a frame-level local alignment loss is introduced to refine the global alignment, improving the utility of the audio information. Experimental results on the LRS2 and CNVSRC.Single datasets consistently show that AlignVSR outperforms several mainstream VSR methods, demonstrating its superior and robust performance.

- **Summary**: Domain adaptive semantic segmentation is the task of generating precise and dense predictions for an unlabeled target domain using a model trained on a labeled source domain. While significant efforts have been devoted to improving unsupervised domain adaptation for this task, it is crucial to note that many models rely on a strong assumption that the source data is entirely and accurately labeled, while the target data is unlabeled. In real-world scenarios, however, we often encounter partially or noisy labeled data in source and target domains, referred to as Generalized Domain Adaptation (GDA). In such cases, we suggest leveraging weak or unlabeled data from both domains to narrow the gap between them, resulting in effective adaptation. We introduce the Generalized Gaussian-mixture-based (GenGMM) domain adaptation model, which harnesses the underlying data distribution in both domains to refine noisy weak and pseudo labels. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: We address the challenge of creating 3D assets for household articulated objects from a single image. Prior work on articulated object creation either requires multi-view multi-state input, or only allows coarse control over the generation process. These limitations hinder the scalability and practicality for articulated object modeling. In this work, we propose a method to generate articulated objects from a single image. Observing the object in resting state from an arbitrary view, our method generates an articulated object that is visually consistent with the input image. To capture the ambiguity in part shape and motion posed by a single view of the object, we design a diffusion model that learns the plausible variations of objects in terms of geometry and kinematics. To tackle the complexity of generating structured data with attributes in multiple domains, we design a pipeline that produces articulated objects from high-level structure to geometric details in a coarse-to-fine manner, where we use a part connectivity graph and part abstraction as proxies. Our experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in articulated object creation by a large margin in terms of the generated object realism, resemblance to the input image, and reconstruction quality.

- **Summary**: The scarcity of high-quality, multimodal training data severely hinders the creation of lifelike avatar animations for conversational AI in virtual environments. Existing datasets often lack the intricate synchronization between speech, facial expressions, and body movements that characterize natural human communication. To address this critical gap, we introduce Allo-AVA, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for text and audio-driven avatar gesture animation in an allocentric (third person point-of-view) context. Allo-AVA consists of $\sim$1,250 hours of diverse video content, complete with audio, transcripts, and extracted keypoints. Allo-AVA uniquely maps these keypoints to precise timestamps, enabling accurate replication of human movements (body and facial gestures) in synchronization with speech. This comprehensive resource enables the development and evaluation of more natural, context-aware avatar animation models, potentially transforming applications ranging from virtual reality to digital assistants.

- **Summary**: While image-text representation learning has become very popular in recent years, existing models tend to lack spatial awareness and have limited direct applicability for dense understanding tasks. For this reason, self-supervised image-only pretraining is still the go-to method for many dense vision applications (e.g. depth estimation, semantic segmentation), despite the lack of explicit supervisory signals. In this paper, we close this gap between image-text and self-supervised learning, by proposing a novel general-purpose image-text model, which can be effectively used off-the-shelf for dense and global vision tasks. Our method, which we refer to as Text-Image Pretraining with Spatial awareness (TIPS), leverages two simple and effective insights. First, on textual supervision: we reveal that replacing noisy web image captions by synthetically generated textual descriptions boosts dense understanding performance significantly, due to a much richer signal for learning spatially aware representations. We propose an adapted training method that combines noisy and synthetic captions, resulting in improvements across both dense and global understanding tasks. Second, on the learning technique: we propose to combine contrastive image-text learning with self-supervised masked image modeling, to encourage spatial coherence, unlocking substantial enhancements for downstream applications. Building on these two ideas, we scale our model using the transformer architecture, trained on a curated set of public images. Our experiments are conducted on 8 tasks involving 16 datasets in total, demonstrating strong off-the-shelf performance on both dense and global understanding, for several image-only and image-text tasks.

- **Summary**: In training neural networks, it is common practice to use partial gradients computed over batches, mostly very small subsets of the training set. This approach is motivated by the argument that such a partial gradient is close to the true one, with precision growing only with the square root of the batch size. A theoretical justification is with the help of stochastic approximation theory. However, the conditions for the validity of this theory are not satisfied in the usual learning rate schedules. Batch processing is also difficult to combine with efficient second-order optimization methods. This proposal is based on another hypothesis: the loss minimum of the training set can be expected to be well-approximated by the minima of its subsets. Such subset minima can be computed in a fraction of the time necessary for optimizing over the whole training set. This hypothesis has been tested with the help of the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 image classification benchmarks, optionally extended by training data augmentation. The experiments have confirmed that results equivalent to conventional training can be reached. In summary, even small subsets are representative if the overdetermination ratio for the given model parameter set sufficiently exceeds unity. The computing expense can be reduced to a tenth or less.

- **Summary**: As virtual agents become increasingly prevalent in human-computer interaction, generating realistic and contextually appropriate gestures in real-time remains a significant challenge. While neural rendering techniques have made substantial progress with static scripts, their applicability to human-computer interactions remains limited. To address this, we introduce Large Body Language Models (LBLMs) and present LBLM-AVA, a novel LBLM architecture that combines a Transformer-XL large language model with a parallelized diffusion model to generate human-like gestures from multimodal inputs (text, audio, and video). LBLM-AVA incorporates several key components enhancing its gesture generation capabilities, such as multimodal-to-pose embeddings, enhanced sequence-to-sequence mapping with redefined attention mechanisms, a temporal smoothing module for gesture sequence coherence, and an attention-based refinement module for enhanced realism. The model is trained on our large-scale proprietary open-source dataset Allo-AVA. LBLM-AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating lifelike and contextually appropriate gestures with a 30% reduction in Fr\'echet Gesture Distance (FGD), and a 25% improvement in Fr\'echet Inception Distance compared to existing approaches.

- **Summary**: Plane instance segmentation from RGB-D data is a crucial research topic for many downstream tasks. However, most existing deep-learning-based methods utilize only information within the RGB bands, neglecting the important role of the depth band in plane instance segmentation. Based on EfficientSAM, a fast version of SAM, we propose a plane instance segmentation network called PlaneSAM, which can fully integrate the information of the RGB bands (spectral bands) and the D band (geometric band), thereby improving the effectiveness of plane instance segmentation in a multimodal manner. Specifically, we use a dual-complexity backbone, with primarily the simpler branch learning D-band features and primarily the more complex branch learning RGB-band features. Consequently, the backbone can effectively learn D-band feature representations even when D-band training data is limited in scale, retain the powerful RGB-band feature representations of EfficientSAM, and allow the original backbone branch to be fine-tuned for the current task. To enhance the adaptability of our PlaneSAM to the RGB-D domain, we pretrain our dual-complexity backbone using the segment anything task on large-scale RGB-D data through a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on imperfect pseudo-labels. To support the segmentation of large planes, we optimize the loss function combination ratio of EfficientSAM. In addition, Faster R-CNN is used as a plane detector, and its predicted bounding boxes are fed into our dual-complexity network as prompts, thereby enabling fully automatic plane instance segmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed PlaneSAM sets a new SOTA performance on the ScanNet dataset, and outperforms previous SOTA approaches in zero-shot transfer on the 2D-3D-S, Matterport3D, and ICL-NUIM RGB-D datasets, while only incurring a 10% increase in computational overhead compared to EfficientSAM.
