- **Summary**: Ant foraging behavior is essential to understanding ecological dynamics and developing effective pest management strategies, but quantifying this behavior is challenging due to the labor-intensive nature of manual counting, especially in densely populated images. This study presents an automated approach using computer vision to count ants and analyze their foraging behavior. Leveraging the YOLOv8 model, the system was calibrated and evaluated on datasets encompassing various imaging scenarios and densities. The study results demonstrate that the system achieves average precision and recall of up to 87.96% and 87,78%, respectively, with only 64 calibration images provided when the both calibration and evaluation images share similar imaging backgrounds. When the background is more complex than the calibration images, the system requires a larger calibration set to generalize effectively, with 1,024 images yielding the precision and recall of up to 83.60% and 78.88, respectively. In more challenging scenarios where more than one thousand ants are present in a single image, the system significantly improves detection accuracy by slicing images into smaller patches, reaching a precision and recall of 77.97% and 71.36%, respectively. The system's ability to generate heatmaps visualizes the spatial distribution of ant activity over time, providing valuable insights into their foraging patterns. This spatial-temporal analysis enables a more comprehensive understanding of ant behavior, which is crucial for ecological studies and improving pest control methods. By automating the counting process and offering detailed behavioral analysis, this study provides an efficient tool for researchers and pest control professionals to develop more effective strategies.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the medical imaging problem of joint detection in the upper limbs, viz. elbow, shoulder, wrist and finger joints. Localization of joints from X-Ray and Computerized Tomography (CT) scans is an essential step for the assessment of various bone-related medical conditions like Osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and can even be used for automated bone fracture detection. Automated joint localization also detects the corresponding bones and can serve as input to deep learning-based models used for the computerized diagnosis of the aforementioned medical disorders. This in-creases the accuracy of prediction and aids the radiologists with analyzing the scans, which is quite a complex and exhausting task. This paper provides a detailed comparative study between diverse Deep Learning (DL) models - YOLOv3, YOLOv7, EfficientDet and CenterNet in multiple bone joint detections in the upper limbs of the human body. The research analyses the performance of different DL models, mathematically, graphically and visually. These models are trained and tested on a portion of the openly available MURA (musculoskeletal radiographs) dataset. The study found that the best Mean Average Precision (mAP at 0.5:0.95) values of YOLOv3, YOLOv7, EfficientDet and CenterNet are 35.3, 48.3, 46.5 and 45.9 respectively. Besides, it has been found YOLOv7 performed the best for accurately predicting the bounding boxes while YOLOv3 performed the worst in the Visual Analysis test.

- **Summary**: The development of sophisticated models for video-to-video synthesis has been facilitated by recent advances in deep reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs). In this paper, we propose RL-V2V-GAN, a new deep neural network approach based on reinforcement learning for unsupervised conditional video-to-video synthesis. While preserving the unique style of the source video domain, our approach aims to learn a mapping from a source video domain to a target video domain. We train the model using policy gradient and employ ConvLSTM layers to capture the spatial and temporal information by designing a fine-grained GAN architecture and incorporating spatio-temporal adversarial goals. The adversarial losses aid in content translation while preserving style. Unlike traditional video-to-video synthesis methods requiring paired inputs, our proposed approach is more general because it does not require paired inputs. Thus, when dealing with limited videos in the target domain, i.e., few-shot learning, it is particularly effective. Our experiments show that RL-V2V-GAN can produce temporally coherent video results. These results highlight the potential of our approach for further advances in video-to-video synthesis.

- **Summary**: Omnidirectional (or 360-degree) images are increasingly being used for 3D applications since they allow the rendering of an entire scene with a single image. Existing works based on neural radiance fields demonstrate successful 3D reconstruction quality on egocentric videos, yet they suffer from long training and rendering times. Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting has gained attention for its fast optimization and real-time rendering. However, directly using a perspective rasterizer to omnidirectional images results in severe distortion due to the different optical properties between two image domains. In this work, we present ODGS, a novel rasterization pipeline for omnidirectional images, with geometric interpretation. For each Gaussian, we define a tangent plane that touches the unit sphere and is perpendicular to the ray headed toward the Gaussian center. We then leverage a perspective camera rasterizer to project the Gaussian onto the corresponding tangent plane. The projected Gaussians are transformed and combined into the omnidirectional image, finalizing the omnidirectional rasterization process. This interpretation reveals the implicit assumptions within the proposed pipeline, which we verify through mathematical proofs. The entire rasterization process is parallelized using CUDA, achieving optimization and rendering speeds 100 times faster than NeRF-based methods. Our comprehensive experiments highlight the superiority of ODGS by delivering the best reconstruction and perceptual quality across various datasets. Additionally, results on roaming datasets demonstrate that ODGS restores fine details effectively, even when reconstructing large 3D scenes.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a groundbreaking spectrally multiplexed photometric stereo approach for recovering surface normals of dynamic surfaces without the need for calibrated lighting or sensors, a notable advancement in the field traditionally hindered by stringent prerequisites and spectral ambiguity. By embracing spectral ambiguity as an advantage, our technique enables the generation of training data without specialized multispectral rendering frameworks. We introduce a unique, physics-free network architecture, SpectraM-PS, that effectively processes multiplexed images to determine surface normals across a wide range of conditions and material types, without relying on specific physically-based knowledge. Additionally, we establish the first benchmark dataset, SpectraM14, for spectrally multiplexed photometric stereo, facilitating comprehensive evaluations against existing calibrated methods. Our contributions significantly enhance the capabilities for dynamic surface recovery, particularly in uncalibrated setups, marking a pivotal step forward in the application of photometric stereo across various domains.

- **Summary**: Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved promising results on a wide range of vision-language tasks, their ability to perceive and understand human faces is rarely explored. In this work, we comprehensively evaluate existing MLLMs on face perception tasks. The quantitative results reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to handle these tasks. The primary reason is the lack of image-text datasets that contain fine-grained descriptions of human faces. To tackle this problem, we design a practical pipeline for constructing datasets, upon which we further build a novel multimodal large face perception model, namely Face-MLLM. Specifically, we re-annotate LAION-Face dataset with more detailed face captions and facial attribute labels. Besides, we re-formulate traditional face datasets using the question-answer style, which is fit for MLLMs. Together with these enriched datasets, we develop a novel three-stage MLLM training method. In the first two stages, our model learns visual-text alignment and basic visual question answering capability, respectively. In the third stage, our model learns to handle multiple specialized face perception tasks. Experimental results show that our model surpasses previous MLLMs on five famous face perception tasks. Besides, on our newly introduced zero-shot facial attribute analysis task, our Face-MLLM also presents superior performance.

- **Summary**: We present ProtoViT, a method for interpretable image classification combining deep learning and case-based reasoning. This method classifies an image by comparing it to a set of learned prototypes, providing explanations of the form ``this looks like that.'' In our model, a prototype consists of \textit{parts}, which can deform over irregular geometries to create a better comparison between images. Unlike existing models that rely on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbones and spatially rigid prototypes, our model integrates Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones into prototype based models, while offering spatially deformed prototypes that not only accommodate geometric variations of objects but also provide coherent and clear prototypical feature representations with an adaptive number of prototypical parts. Our experiments show that our model can generally achieve higher performance than the existing prototype based models. Our comprehensive analyses ensure that the prototypes are consistent and the interpretations are faithful.

- **Summary**: Recent breakthroughs in text-guided image generation have significantly advanced the field of 3D generation. While generating a single high-quality 3D object is now feasible, generating multiple objects with reasonable interactions within a 3D space, a.k.a. compositional 3D generation, presents substantial challenges. This paper introduces CompGS, a novel generative framework that employs 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) for efficient, compositional text-to-3D content generation. To achieve this goal, two core designs are proposed: (1) 3D Gaussians Initialization with 2D compositionality: We transfer the well-established 2D compositionality to initialize the Gaussian parameters on an entity-by-entity basis, ensuring both consistent 3D priors for each entity and reasonable interactions among multiple entities; (2) Dynamic Optimization: We propose a dynamic strategy to optimize 3D Gaussians using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. CompGS first automatically decomposes 3D Gaussians into distinct entity parts, enabling optimization at both the entity and composition levels. Additionally, CompGS optimizes across objects of varying scales by dynamically adjusting the spatial parameters of each entity, enhancing the generation of fine-grained details, particularly in smaller entities. Qualitative comparisons and quantitative evaluations on T3Bench demonstrate the effectiveness of CompGS in generating compositional 3D objects with superior image quality and semantic alignment over existing methods. CompGS can also be easily extended to controllable 3D editing, facilitating scene generation. We hope CompGS will provide new insights to the compositional 3D generation.

- **Summary**: Current approaches in 3D human pose estimation primarily focus on regressing 3D joint locations, often neglecting critical physical constraints such as bone length consistency and body symmetry. This work introduces a recurrent neural network architecture designed to capture holistic information across entire video sequences, enabling accurate prediction of bone lengths. To enhance training effectiveness, we propose a novel augmentation strategy using synthetic bone lengths that adhere to physical constraints. Moreover, we present a bone length adjustment method that preserves bone orientations while substituting bone lengths with predicted values. Our results demonstrate that existing 3D human pose estimation models can be significantly enhanced through this adjustment process. Furthermore, we fine-tune human pose estimation models using inferred bone lengths, observing notable improvements. Our bone length prediction model surpasses the previous best results, and our adjustment and fine-tuning method enhance performance across several metrics on the Human3.6M dataset.

- **Summary**: Quantitative analysis of cardiac motion is crucial for assessing cardiac function. This analysis typically uses imaging modalities such as MRI and Echocardiograms that capture detailed image sequences throughout the heartbeat cycle. Previous methods predominantly focused on the analysis of image pairs lacking consideration of the motion dynamics and spatial variability. Consequently, these methods often overlook the long-term relationships and regional motion characteristic of cardiac. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the \textbf{GPTrack}, a novel unsupervised framework crafted to fully explore the temporal and spatial dynamics of cardiac motion. The GPTrack enhances motion tracking by employing the sequential Gaussian Process in the latent space and encoding statistics by spatial information at each time stamp, which robustly promotes temporal consistency and spatial variability of cardiac dynamics. Also, we innovatively aggregate sequential information in a bidirectional recursive manner, mimicking the behavior of diffeomorphic registration to better capture consistent long-term relationships of motions across cardiac regions such as the ventricles and atria. Our GPTrack significantly improves the precision of motion tracking in both 3D and 4D medical images while maintaining computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: Echocardiogram video plays a crucial role in analysing cardiac function and diagnosing cardiac diseases. Current deep neural network methods primarily aim to enhance diagnosis accuracy by incorporating prior knowledge, such as segmenting cardiac structures or lesions annotated by human experts. However, diagnosing the inconsistent behaviours of the heart, which exist across both spatial and temporal dimensions, remains extremely challenging. For instance, the analysis of cardiac motion acquires both spatial and temporal information from the heartbeat cycle. To address this issue, we propose a novel reconstruction-based approach named CardiacNet to learn a better representation of local cardiac structures and motion abnormalities through echocardiogram videos. CardiacNet is accompanied by the Consistency Deformation Codebook (CDC) and the Consistency Deformed-Discriminator (CDD) to learn the commonalities across abnormal and normal samples by incorporating cardiac prior knowledge. In addition, we propose benchmark datasets named CardiacNet-PAH and CardiacNet-ASD to evaluate the effectiveness of cardiac disease assessment. In experiments, our CardiacNet can achieve state-of-the-art results in three different cardiac disease assessment tasks on public datasets CAMUS, EchoNet, and our datasets. The code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/CardiacNet.

- **Summary**: This paper studies stable learning methods for generative models that enable high-quality data generation. Noise injection is commonly used to stabilize learning. However, selecting a suitable noise distribution is challenging. Diffusion-GAN, a recently developed method, addresses this by using the diffusion process with a timestep-dependent discriminator. We investigate Diffusion-GAN and reveal that data scaling is a key component for stable learning and high-quality data generation. Building on our findings, we propose a learning algorithm, Scale-GAN, that uses data scaling and variance-based regularization. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that data scaling controls the bias-variance trade-off of the estimation error bound. As a theoretical extension, we consider GAN with invertible data augmentations. Comparative evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving stability and accuracy.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models have become pivotal in the field of video processing and is increasingly critical in practical applications such as autonomous driving and object detection. Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated their power, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain a highly efficient and high-performance choice for feature extraction and encoding. However, the intensive computational demands of convolution operations hinder its broader adoption as a video encoder. Given the inherent temporal continuity in video frames, changes between consecutive frames are minimal, allowing for the skipping of redundant computations. This technique, which we term as Diff Computation, presents two primary challenges. First, Diff Computation requires to cache intermediate feature maps to ensure the correctness of non-linear computations, leading to significant memory consumption. Second, the imbalance of sparsity among layers, introduced by Diff Computation, incurs accuracy degradation. To address these issues, we propose a memory-efficient scheduling method to eliminate memory overhead and an online adjustment mechanism to minimize accuracy degradation. We integrate these techniques into our framework, SparseTem, to seamlessly support various CNN-based video encoders. SparseTem achieves speedup of 1.79x for EfficientDet and 4.72x for CRNN, with minimal accuracy drop and no additional memory overhead. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SparseTem sets a new state-of-the-art by effectively utilizing temporal continuity to accelerate CNN-based video encoders.

- **Summary**: The planning of digital orthodontic treatment requires providing tooth alignment, which not only consumes a lot of time and labor to determine manually but also relays clinical experiences heavily. In this work, we proposed a lightweight tooth alignment neural network based on Swin-transformer. We first re-organized 3D point clouds based on virtual arch lines and converted them into order-sorted multi-channel textures, which improves the accuracy and efficiency simultaneously. We then designed two new occlusal loss functions that quantitatively evaluate the occlusal relationship between the upper and lower jaws. They are important clinical constraints, first introduced to the best of our knowledge, and lead to cutting-edge prediction accuracy. To train our network, we collected a large digital orthodontic dataset that has 591 clinical cases, including various complex clinical cases. This dataset will benefit the community after its release since there is no open dataset so far. Furthermore, we also proposed two new orthodontic dataset augmentation methods considering tooth spatial distribution and occlusion. We evaluated our method with this dataset and extensive experiments, including comparisons with STAT methods and ablation studies, and demonstrate the high prediction accuracy of our method.

- **Summary**: One key challenge in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is the absence of ground-truth OOD samples during training. One principled approach to address this issue is to use samples from external datasets as outliers (i.e., pseudo OOD samples) to train OOD detectors. However, we find empirically that the outlier samples often present a distribution shift compared to the true OOD samples, especially in Long-Tailed Recognition (LTR) scenarios, where ID classes are heavily imbalanced, \ie, the true OOD samples exhibit very different probability distribution to the head and tailed ID classes from the outliers. In this work, we propose a novel approach, namely normalized outlier distribution adaptation (AdaptOD), to tackle this distribution shift problem. One of its key components is dynamic outlier distribution adaptation that effectively adapts a vanilla outlier distribution based on the outlier samples to the true OOD distribution by utilizing the OOD knowledge in the predicted OOD samples during inference. Further, to obtain a more reliable set of predicted OOD samples on long-tailed ID data, a novel dual-normalized energy loss is introduced in AdaptOD, which leverages class- and sample-wise normalized energy to enforce a more balanced prediction energy on imbalanced ID samples. This helps avoid bias toward the head samples and learn a substantially better vanilla outlier distribution than existing energy losses during training. It also eliminates the need of manually tuning the sensitive margin hyperparameters in energy losses. Empirical results on three popular benchmarks for OOD detection in LTR show the superior performance of AdaptOD over state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Co-examination of second-harmonic generation (SHG) and bright-field (BF) microscopy enables the differentiation of tissue components and collagen fibers, aiding the analysis of human breast and pancreatic cancer tissues. However, large discrepancies between SHG and BF images pose challenges for current learning-based registration models in aligning SHG to BF. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal registration framework that employs fidelity-imposed displacement editing to address these challenges. The framework integrates batch-wise contrastive learning, feature-based pre-alignment, and instance-level optimization. Experimental results from the Learn2Reg COMULISglobe SHG-BF Challenge validate the effectiveness of our method, securing the 1st place on the online leaderboard.

- **Summary**: Recently, Gaussian splatting has received more and more attention in the field of static scene rendering. Due to the low computational overhead and inherent flexibility of explicit representations, plane-based explicit methods are popular ways to predict deformations for Gaussian-based dynamic scene rendering models. However, plane-based methods rely on the inappropriate low-rank assumption and excessively decompose the space-time 4D encoding, resulting in overmuch feature overlap and unsatisfactory rendering quality. To tackle these problems, we propose Grid4D, a dynamic scene rendering model based on Gaussian splatting and employing a novel explicit encoding method for the 4D input through the hash encoding. Different from plane-based explicit representations, we decompose the 4D encoding into one spatial and three temporal 3D hash encodings without the low-rank assumption. Additionally, we design a novel attention module that generates the attention scores in a directional range to aggregate the spatial and temporal features. The directional attention enables Grid4D to more accurately fit the diverse deformations across distinct scene components based on the spatial encoded features. Moreover, to mitigate the inherent lack of smoothness in explicit representation methods, we introduce a smooth regularization term that keeps our model from the chaos of deformation prediction. Our experiments demonstrate that Grid4D significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models in visual quality and rendering speed.

- **Summary**: A variety of neural networks architectures are being studied to tackle blur in images and videos caused by a non-steady camera and objects being captured. In this paper, we present an overview of these existing networks and perform experiments to remove the blur caused by atmospheric turbulence. Our experiments aim to examine the reusability of existing networks and identify desirable aspects of the architecture in a system that is geared specifically towards atmospheric turbulence mitigation. We compare five different architectures, including a network trained in an end-to-end fashion, thereby removing the need for a stabilization step.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we study an object synthesis task that combines an object text with an object image to create a new object image. However, most diffusion models struggle with this task, \textit{i.e.}, often generating an object that predominantly reflects either the text or the image due to an imbalance between their inputs. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method called Adaptive Text-Image Harmony (ATIH) to generate novel and surprising objects. First, we introduce a scale factor and an injection step to balance text and image features in cross-attention and to preserve image information in self-attention during the text-image inversion diffusion process, respectively. Second, to better integrate object text and image, we design a balanced loss function with a noise parameter, ensuring both optimal editability and fidelity of the object image. Third, to adaptively adjust these parameters, we present a novel similarity score function that not only maximizes the similarities between the generated object image and the input text/image but also balances these similarities to harmonize text and image integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing remarkable object creations such as colobus-glass jar. Project page: https://xzr52.github.io/ATIH/.

- **Summary**: Invisible watermarking is essential for safeguarding digital content, enabling copyright protection and content authentication. However, existing watermarking methods fall short in robustness against regeneration attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel method called FreqMark that involves unconstrained optimization of the image latent frequency space obtained after VAE encoding. Specifically, FreqMark embeds the watermark by optimizing the latent frequency space of the images and then extracts the watermark through a pre-trained image encoder. This optimization allows a flexible trade-off between image quality with watermark robustness and effectively resists regeneration attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that FreqMark offers significant advantages in image quality and robustness, permits flexible selection of the encoding bit number, and achieves a bit accuracy exceeding 90% when encoding a 48-bit hidden message under various attack scenarios.

- **Summary**: Multimedia file fragment classification (MFFC) aims to identify file fragment types, e.g., image/video, audio, and text without system metadata. It is of vital importance in multimedia storage and communication. Existing MFFC methods typically treat fragments as 1D byte sequences and emphasize the relations between separate bytes (interbytes) for classification. However, the more informative relations inside bytes (intrabytes) are overlooked and seldom investigated. By looking inside bytes, the bit-level details of file fragments can be accessed, enabling a more accurate classification. Motivated by this, we first propose Byte2Image, a novel visual representation model that incorporates previously overlooked intrabyte information into file fragments and reinterprets these fragments as 2D grayscale images. This model involves a sliding byte window to reveal the intrabyte information and a rowwise stacking of intrabyte ngrams for embedding fragments into a 2D space. Thus, complex interbyte and intrabyte correlations can be mined simultaneously using powerful vision networks. Additionally, we propose an end-to-end dual-branch network ByteNet to enhance robust correlation mining and feature representation. ByteNet makes full use of the raw 1D byte sequence and the converted 2D image through a shallow byte branch feature extraction (BBFE) and a deep image branch feature extraction (IBFE) network. In particular, the BBFE, composed of a single fully-connected layer, adaptively recognizes the co-occurrence of several some specific bytes within the raw byte sequence, while the IBFE, built on a vision Transformer, effectively mines the complex interbyte and intrabyte correlations from the converted image. Experiments on the two representative benchmarks, including 14 cases, validate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on different cases by up to 12.2%.

- **Summary**: This study investigates the relationship between sugarcane yield and cane height derived under different water and nitrogen conditions from pre-harvest Digital Surface Model (DSM) obtained via Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flights over a sugarcane test farm. The farm was divided into 62 blocks based on three water levels (low, medium, and high) and three nitrogen levels (low, medium, and high), with repeated treatments. In pixel distribution of DSM for each block, it provided bimodal distribution representing two peaks, ground level (gaps within canopies) and top of the canopies respectively. Using bimodal distribution, mean cane height was extracted for each block by applying a trimmed mean to the pixel distribution, focusing on the top canopy points. Similarly, the extracted mean elevation of the base was derived from the bottom points, representing ground level. The Derived Cane Height Model (DCHM) was generated by taking the difference between the mean canopy height and mean base elevation for each block. Yield measurements (tons/acre) were recorded post-harvest for each block. By aggregating the data into nine treatment zones (e.g., high water-low nitrogen, low water-high nitrogen), the DCHM and median yield were calculated for each zone. The regression analysis between the DCHM and corresponding yields for the different treatment zones yielded an R 2 of 0.95. This study demonstrates the significant impact of water and nitrogen treatments on sugarcane height and yield, utilizing one-time UAV-derived DSM data.

- **Summary**: Reconciling agricultural production with climate-change mitigation and adaptation is one of the most formidable problems in sustainability. One proposed strategy for addressing this problem is the judicious retention of trees in agricultural systems. However, the magnitude of the current and future-potential benefit that trees contribute remains uncertain, particularly in the agricultural sector where trees can also limit production. Here we help to resolve these issues across a West African region responsible for producing $\approx$60% of the world's cocoa, a crop that contributes one of the highest per unit carbon footprints of all foods. We use machine learning to generate spatially-explicit estimates of shade-tree cover and carbon stocks across the region. We find that existing shade-tree cover is low, and not spatially aligned with climate threat. But we also find enormous unrealized potential for the sector to counterbalance a large proportion of their high carbon footprint annually, without threatening production. Our methods can be applied to other globally significant commodities that can be grown in agroforests, and align with accounting requirements of carbon markets, and emerging legislative requirements for sustainability reporting.

- **Summary**: The cognitive faculty of visual reasoning necessitates the integration of multimodal perceptual processing and commonsense and external knowledge of the world. In recent years, a plethora of large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been proposed, demonstrating outstanding power and exceptional proficiency in commonsense reasoning across diverse domains and tasks. Nevertheless, training such LVLMs requires a lot of costly resources. Recent approaches, instead of training LVLMs from scratch on various large datasets, focus on exploring ways to take advantage of the capabilities of many different LVLMs, such as ensemble methods. In this work, we propose self-ensemble, a novel method that improves the generalization and visual reasoning of the model without updating any parameters, a training-free method. Our key insight is that we realized that LVLM itself can ensemble without the need for any other LVLMs, which helps to unlock their internal capabilities. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on SketchyVQA, Outside Knowledge VQA, and out-of-distribution VQA tasks.

- **Summary**: In this study, we delve into the robustness of neural network-based LiDAR point cloud tracking models under adversarial attacks, a critical aspect often overlooked in favor of performance enhancement. These models, despite incorporating advanced architectures like Transformer or Bird's Eye View (BEV), tend to neglect robustness in the face of challenges such as adversarial attacks, domain shifts, or data corruption. We instead focus on the robustness of the tracking models under the threat of adversarial attacks. We begin by establishing a unified framework for conducting adversarial attacks within the context of 3D object tracking, which allows us to thoroughly investigate both white-box and black-box attack strategies. For white-box attacks, we tailor specific loss functions to accommodate various tracking paradigms and extend existing methods such as FGSM, C\&W, and PGD to the point cloud domain. In addressing black-box attack scenarios, we introduce a novel transfer-based approach, the Target-aware Perturbation Generation (TAPG) algorithm, with the dual objectives of achieving high attack performance and maintaining low perceptibility. This method employs a heuristic strategy to enforce sparse attack constraints and utilizes random sub-vector factorization to bolster transferability. Our experimental findings reveal a significant vulnerability in advanced tracking methods when subjected to both black-box and white-box attacks, underscoring the necessity for incorporating robustness against adversarial attacks into the design of LiDAR point cloud tracking models. Notably, compared to existing methods, the TAPG also strikes an optimal balance between the effectiveness of the attack and the concealment of the perturbations.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce the Diff-Instruct*(DI*), a data-free approach for building one-step text-to-image generative models that align with human preference while maintaining the ability to generate highly realistic images. We frame human preference alignment as online reinforcement learning using human feedback (RLHF), where the goal is to maximize the reward function while regularizing the generator distribution to remain close to a reference diffusion process. Unlike traditional RLHF approaches, which rely on the KL divergence for regularization, we introduce a novel score-based divergence regularization, which leads to significantly better performances. Although the direct calculation of this divergence remains intractable, we demonstrate that we can efficiently compute its \emph{gradient} by deriving an equivalent yet tractable loss function. Remarkably, with Stable Diffusion V1.5 as the reference diffusion model, DI* outperforms \emph{all} previously leading models by a large margin. When using the 0.6B PixelArt-$\alpha$ model as the reference diffusion, DI* achieves a new record Aesthetic Score of 6.30 and an Image Reward of 1.31 with only a single generation step, almost doubling the scores of the rest of the models with similar sizes. It also achieves an HPSv2 score of 28.70, establishing a new state-of-the-art benchmark. We also observe that DI* can improve the layout and enrich the colors of generated images.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown exceptional performance when trained on well-illuminated images captured by Electro-Optical (EO) cameras, which provide rich texture details. However, in critical applications like aerial perception, it is essential for DNNs to maintain consistent reliability across all conditions, including low-light scenarios where EO cameras often struggle to capture sufficient detail. Additionally, UAV-based aerial object detection faces significant challenges due to scale variability from varying altitudes and slant angles, adding another layer of complexity. Existing methods typically address only illumination changes or style variations as domain shifts, but in aerial perception, correlation shifts also impact DNN performance. In this paper, we introduce the IndraEye dataset, a multi-sensor (EO-IR) dataset designed for various tasks. It includes 5,612 images with 145,666 instances, encompassing multiple viewing angles, altitudes, seven backgrounds, and different times of the day across the Indian subcontinent. The dataset opens up several research opportunities, such as multimodal learning, domain adaptation for object detection and segmentation, and exploration of sensor-specific strengths and weaknesses. IndraEye aims to advance the field by supporting the development of more robust and accurate aerial perception systems, particularly in challenging conditions. IndraEye dataset is benchmarked with object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Dataset and source codes are available at https://bit.ly/indraeye.

- **Summary**: Lately, the continuous development of deep learning models by many researchers in the area of computer vision has attracted more researchers to further improve the accuracy of these models. FasterRCNN [32] has already provided a state-of-the-art approach to improve the accuracy and detection of 80 different objects given in the COCO dataset. To further improve the performance of person detection we have conducted a different approach which gives the state-of-the-art conclusion. An ROI is a step in FasterRCNN that extract the features from the given image with a fixed size and transfer into for further classification. To enhance the ROI performance, we have conducted an approach that implements dense pooling and converts the image into a 3D model to further transform into UV(ultra Violet) images which makes it easy to extract the right features from the images. To implement our approach we have approached the state-of-the-art COCO datasets and extracted 6982 images that include a person object and our final achievements conclude that using our approach has made significant results in detecting the person object in the given image

- **Summary**: In the field of autonomous driving and mobile robotics, there has been a significant shift in the methods used to create Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations. This shift is characterised by using transformers and learning to fuse measurements from disparate vision sensors, mainly lidar and cameras, into a 2D planar ground-based representation. However, these learning-based methods for creating such maps often rely heavily on extensive annotated data, presenting notable challenges, particularly in diverse or non-urban environments where large-scale datasets are scarce. In this work, we present BEVPose, a framework that integrates BEV representations from camera and lidar data, using sensor pose as a guiding supervisory signal. This method notably reduces the dependence on costly annotated data. By leveraging pose information, we align and fuse multi-modal sensory inputs, facilitating the learning of latent BEV embeddings that capture both geometric and semantic aspects of the environment. Our pretraining approach demonstrates promising performance in BEV map segmentation tasks, outperforming fully-supervised state-of-the-art methods, while necessitating only a minimal amount of annotated data. This development not only confronts the challenge of data efficiency in BEV representation learning but also broadens the potential for such techniques in a variety of domains, including off-road and indoor environments.

- **Summary**: Despite their superb multimodal capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which are inference-time attacks that induce the model to output harmful responses with tricky prompts. It is thus essential to defend VLMs against potential jailbreaks for their trustworthy deployment in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on black-box defense for VLMs against jailbreak attacks. Existing black-box defense methods are either unimodal or bimodal. Unimodal methods enhance either the vision or language module of the VLM, while bimodal methods robustify the model through text-image representation realignment. However, these methods suffer from two limitations: 1) they fail to fully exploit the cross-modal information, or 2) they degrade the model performance on benign inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel blue-team method BlueSuffix that defends the black-box target VLM against jailbreak attacks without compromising its performance. BlueSuffix includes three key components: 1) a visual purifier against jailbreak images, 2) a textual purifier against jailbreak texts, and 3) a blue-team suffix generator fine-tuned via reinforcement learning for enhancing cross-modal robustness. We empirically show on three VLMs (LLaVA, MiniGPT-4, and Gemini) and two safety benchmarks (MM-SafetyBench and RedTeam-2K) that BlueSuffix outperforms the baseline defenses by a significant margin. Our BlueSuffix opens up a promising direction for defending VLMs against jailbreak attacks.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion and DALL-E, are capable of generating high-quality, diverse, and realistic images from textual prompts. However, they sometimes struggle to accurately depict specific entities described in prompts, a limitation known as the entity missing problem in compositional generation. While prior studies suggested that adjusting cross-attention maps during the denoising process could alleviate this problem, they did not systematically investigate which objective functions could best address it. This study examines three potential causes of the entity-missing problem, focusing on cross-attention dynamics: (1) insufficient attention intensity for certain entities, (2) overly broad attention spread, and (3) excessive overlap between attention maps of different entities. We found that reducing overlap in attention maps between entities can effectively minimize the rate of entity missing. Specifically, we hypothesize that tokens related to specific entities compete for attention on certain image regions during the denoising process, which can lead to divided attention across tokens and prevent accurate representation of each entity. To address this issue, we introduced four loss functions, Intersection over Union (IoU), center-of-mass (CoM) distance, Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and clustering compactness (CC) to regulate attention overlap during denoising steps without the need for retraining. Experimental results across a wide variety of benchmarks reveal that these proposed training-free methods significantly improve compositional accuracy, outperforming previous approaches in visual question answering (VQA), captioning scores, CLIP similarity, and human evaluations. Notably, these methods improved human evaluation scores by 9% over the best baseline, demonstrating substantial improvements in compositional alignment.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in character video synthesis still depend on extensive fine-tuning or complex 3D modeling processes, which can restrict accessibility and hinder real-time applicability. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective tuning-free framework for character video synthesis, named MovieCharacter, designed to streamline the synthesis process while ensuring high-quality outcomes. Our framework decomposes the synthesis task into distinct, manageable modules: character segmentation and tracking, video object removal, character motion imitation, and video composition. This modular design not only facilitates flexible customization but also ensures that each component operates collaboratively to effectively meet user needs. By leveraging existing open-source models and integrating well-established techniques, MovieCharacter achieves impressive synthesis results without necessitating substantial resources or proprietary datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enhances the efficiency, accessibility, and adaptability of character video synthesis, paving the way for broader creative and interactive applications.

- **Summary**: EEG-based visual perception reconstruction has become a current research hotspot. Neuroscientific studies have shown that humans can perceive various types of visual information, such as color, shape, and texture, when observing objects. However, existing technical methods often face issues such as inconsistencies in texture, shape, and color between the visual stimulus images and the reconstructed images. In this paper, we propose a method for reconstructing 3D objects with color consistency based on EEG signals. The method adopts a two-stage strategy: in the first stage, we train an implicit neural EEG encoder with the capability of perceiving 3D objects, enabling it to capture regional semantic features; in the second stage, based on the latent EEG codes obtained in the first stage, we integrate a diffusion model, neural style loss, and NeRF to implicitly decode the 3D objects. Finally, through experimental validation, we demonstrate that our method can reconstruct 3D objects with color consistency using EEG.

- **Summary**: Capturing and maintaining geometric interactions among different body parts is crucial for successful motion retargeting in skinned characters. Existing approaches often overlook body geometries or add a geometry correction stage after skeletal motion retargeting. This results in conflicts between skeleton interaction and geometry correction, leading to issues such as jittery, interpenetration, and contact mismatches. To address these challenges, we introduce a new retargeting framework, MeshRet, which directly models the dense geometric interactions in motion retargeting. Initially, we establish dense mesh correspondences between characters using semantically consistent sensors (SCS), effective across diverse mesh topologies. Subsequently, we develop a novel spatio-temporal representation called the dense mesh interaction (DMI) field. This field, a collection of interacting SCS feature vectors, skillfully captures both contact and non-contact interactions between body geometries. By aligning the DMI field during retargeting, MeshRet not only preserves motion semantics but also prevents self-interpenetration and ensures contact preservation. Extensive experiments on the public Mixamo dataset and our newly-collected ScanRet dataset demonstrate that MeshRet achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) has gained increasing attention at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. Its capability to interpret radiological images and deliver precise answers to clinical inquiries positions MedVQA as a valuable tool for supporting diagnostic decision-making for physicians and alleviating the workload on radiologists. While recent approaches focus on using unified pre-trained large models for multi-modal fusion like cross-modal Transformers, research on more efficient fusion methods remains relatively scarce within this discipline. In this paper, we introduce a novel fusion model that integrates Orthogonality loss, Multi-head attention and Bilinear Attention Network (OMniBAN) to achieve high computational efficiency and strong performance without the need for pre-training. We conduct comprehensive experiments and clarify aspects of how to enhance bilinear attention fusion to achieve performance comparable to that of large models. Experimental results show that OMniBAN outperforms traditional models on key MedVQA benchmarks while maintaining a lower computational cost, which indicates its potential for efficient clinical application in radiology and pathology image question answering.

- **Summary**: We introduce the Push-Forward Signed Distance Morphometric (PF-SDM), a novel method for shape quantification in biomedical imaging that is continuous, interpretable, and invariant to shape-preserving transformations. PF-SDM effectively captures the geometric properties of shapes, including their topological skeletons and radial symmetries. This results in a robust and interpretable shape descriptor that generalizes to capture temporal shape dynamics. Importantly, PF-SDM avoids certain issues of previous geometric morphometrics, like Elliptical Fourier Analysis and Generalized Procrustes Analysis, such as coefficient correlations and landmark choices. We present the PF-SDM theory, provide a practically computable algorithm, and benchmark it on synthetic data.

- **Summary**: Image-based diagnostic decision support systems (DDSS) utilizing deep learning have the potential to optimize clinical workflows. However, developing DDSS requires extensive datasets with expert annotations and is therefore costly. Leveraging report contents from radiological data bases with Natural Language Processing to annotate the corresponding image data promises to replace labor-intensive manual annotation. As mining "real world" databases can introduce label noise, noise-robust training losses are of great interest. However, current noise-robust losses do not consider noise estimations that can for example be derived based on the performance of the automatic label generator used. In this study, we expand the noise-robust Deep Abstaining Classifier (DAC) loss to an Informed Deep Abstaining Classifier (IDAC) loss by incorporating noise level estimations during training. Our findings demonstrate that IDAC enhances the noise robustness compared to DAC and several state-of-the-art loss functions. The results are obtained on various simulated noise levels using a public chest X-ray data set. These findings are reproduced on an in-house noisy data set, where labels were extracted from the clinical systems of the University Hospital Bonn by a text-based transformer. The IDAC can therefore be a valuable tool for researchers, companies or clinics aiming to develop accurate and reliable DDSS from routine clinical data.

- **Summary**: Long-tail learning has garnered widespread attention and achieved significant progress in recent times. However, even with pre-trained prior knowledge, models still exhibit weaker generalization performance on tail classes. The promising Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) can effectively improve the generalization capability of models by seeking out flat minima in the loss landscape, which, however, comes at the cost of doubling the computational time. Since the update rule of SAM necessitates two consecutive (non-parallelizable) forward and backpropagation at each step. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called Random SAM prompt tuning (RSAM-PT) to improve the model generalization, requiring only one-step gradient computation at each step. Specifically, we search for the gradient descent direction within a random neighborhood of the parameters during each gradient update. To amplify the impact of tail-class samples and avoid overfitting, we employ the deferred re-weight scheme to increase the significance of tail-class samples. The classification accuracy of long-tailed data can be significantly improved by the proposed RSAM-PT, particularly for tail classes. RSAM-PT achieves the state-of-the-art performance of 90.3\%, 76.5\%, and 50.1\% on benchmark datasets CIFAR100-LT (IF 100), iNaturalist 2018, and Places-LT, respectively.

- **Summary**: Recognising animals based on distinctive body patterns, such as stripes, spots, or other markings, in night images is a complex task in computer vision. Existing methods for detecting animals in images often rely on colour information, which is not always available in night images, posing a challenge for pattern recognition in such conditions. Nevertheless, recognition at night-time is essential for most wildlife, biodiversity, and conservation applications. The SPOTS-10 dataset was created to address this challenge and to provide a resource for evaluating machine learning algorithms in situ. This dataset is an extensive collection of grayscale images showcasing diverse patterns found in ten animal species. Specifically, SPOTS-10 contains 50,000 32 x 32 grayscale images, divided into ten categories, with 5,000 images per category. The training set comprises 40,000 images, while the test set contains 10,000 images.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models are popular for introducing image manipulation methods, such as editing, image fusion, inpainting, etc. At the same time, image-to-video (I2V) and text-to-video (T2V) models are also built on top of T2I models. We present Kandinsky 3, a novel T2I model based on latent diffusion, achieving a high level of quality and photorealism. The key feature of the new architecture is the simplicity and efficiency of its adaptation for many types of generation tasks. We extend the base T2I model for various applications and create a multifunctional generation system that includes text-guided inpainting/outpainting, image fusion, text-image fusion, image variations generation, I2V and T2V generation. We also present a distilled version of the T2I model, evaluating inference in 4 steps of the reverse process without reducing image quality and 3 times faster than the base model. We deployed a user-friendly demo system in which all the features can be tested in the public domain. Additionally, we released the source code and checkpoints for the Kandinsky 3 and extended models. Human evaluations show that Kandinsky 3 demonstrates one of the highest quality scores among open source generation systems.

- **Summary**: Recently, many foundation models for medical image analysis such as MedSAM, SwinUNETR have been released and proven to be useful in multiple tasks. However, considering the inherent heterogeneity and inhomogeneity of real-world medical data, directly applying these models to specific medical image segmentation tasks often leads to negative domain shift effects, which can severely weaken the model's segmentation capabilities. To this end, we propose an adaptive amalgamation knowledge framework that aims to train a versatile foundation model to handle the joint goals of multiple expert models, each specialized for a distinct task. Specifically, we first train an nnUNet-based expert model for each task, and reuse the pre-trained SwinUNTER as the target foundation model. Then, the input data for all challenging tasks are encoded in the foundation model and the expert models, respectively, and their backbone features are jointly projected into the adaptive amalgamation layer. Within the hidden layer, the hierarchical attention mechanisms are designed to achieve adaptive merging of the target model to the hidden layer feature knowledge of all experts, which significantly reduces the domain shift arising from the inter-task differences. Finally, the gold amalgamated features and the prompt features are fed into the mask decoder to obtain the segmentation results. Extensive experiments conducted in these challenging tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our foundation model for real-world medical image segmentation.

- **Summary**: Road safety remains a critical challenge worldwide, with approximately 1.35 million fatalities annually attributed to traffic accidents, often due to human errors. As we advance towards higher levels of vehicle automation, challenges still exist, as driving with automation can cognitively over-demand drivers if they engage in non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs), or lead to drowsiness if driving was the sole task. This calls for the urgent need for an effective Driver Monitoring System (DMS) that can evaluate cognitive load and drowsiness in SAE Level-2/3 autonomous driving contexts. In this study, we propose a novel multi-task DMS, termed VDMoE, which leverages RGB video input to monitor driver states non-invasively. By utilizing key facial features to minimize computational load and integrating remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) for physiological insights, our approach enhances detection accuracy while maintaining efficiency. Additionally, we optimize the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework to accommodate multi-modal inputs and improve performance across different tasks. A novel prior-inclusive regularization method is introduced to align model outputs with statistical priors, thus accelerating convergence and mitigating overfitting risks. We validate our method with the creation of a new dataset (MCDD), which comprises RGB video and physiological indicators from 42 participants, and two public datasets. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of VDMoE in monitoring driver states, contributing to safer autonomous driving systems. The code and data will be released.

- **Summary**: The widespread use of AI-generated content from diffusion models has raised significant concerns regarding misinformation and copyright infringement. Watermarking is a crucial technique for identifying these AI-generated images and preventing their misuse. In this paper, we introduce Shallow Diffuse, a new watermarking technique that embeds robust and invisible watermarks into diffusion model outputs. Unlike existing approaches that integrate watermarking throughout the entire diffusion sampling process, Shallow Diffuse decouples these steps by leveraging the presence of a low-dimensional subspace in the image generation process. This method ensures that a substantial portion of the watermark lies in the null space of this subspace, effectively separating it from the image generation process. Our theoretical and empirical analyses show that this decoupling strategy greatly enhances the consistency of data generation and the detectability of the watermark. Extensive experiments further validate that our Shallow Diffuse outperforms existing watermarking methods in terms of robustness and consistency. The codes will be released at https://github.com/liwd190019/Shallow-Diffuse.

- **Summary**: Group Activity Recognition (GAR) remains challenging in computer vision due to the complex nature of multi-agent interactions. This paper introduces LiGAR, a LIDAR-Guided Hierarchical Transformer for Multi-Modal Group Activity Recognition. LiGAR leverages LiDAR data as a structural backbone to guide the processing of visual and textual information, enabling robust handling of occlusions and complex spatial arrangements. Our framework incorporates a Multi-Scale LIDAR Transformer, Cross-Modal Guided Attention, and an Adaptive Fusion Module to integrate multi-modal data at different semantic levels effectively. LiGAR's hierarchical architecture captures group activities at various granularities, from individual actions to scene-level dynamics. Extensive experiments on the JRDB-PAR, Volleyball, and NBA datasets demonstrate LiGAR's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results with improvements of up to 10.6% in F1-score on JRDB-PAR and 5.9% in Mean Per Class Accuracy on the NBA dataset. Notably, LiGAR maintains high performance even when LiDAR data is unavailable during inference, showcasing its adaptability. Our ablation studies highlight the significant contributions of each component and the effectiveness of our multi-modal, multi-scale approach in advancing the field of group activity recognition.

- **Summary**: Inverse problems arise in many applications, especially tomographic imaging. We develop a Learned Alternating Minimization Algorithm (LAMA) to solve such problems via two-block optimization by synergizing data-driven and classical techniques with proven convergence. LAMA is naturally induced by a variational model with learnable regularizers in both data and image domains, parameterized as composite functions of neural networks trained with domain-specific data. We allow these regularizers to be nonconvex and nonsmooth to extract features from data effectively. We minimize the overall objective function using Nesterov's smoothing technique and residual learning architecture. It is demonstrated that LAMA reduces network complexity, improves memory efficiency, and enhances reconstruction accuracy, stability, and interpretability. Extensive experiments show that LAMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmark datasets for Computed Tomography.

- **Summary**: The growing demand for surveillance in public spaces presents significant challenges due to the shortage of human resources. Current AI-based video surveillance systems heavily rely on core computer vision models that require extensive finetuning, which is particularly difficult in surveillance settings due to limited datasets and difficult setting (viewpoint, low quality, etc.). In this work, we propose leveraging Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), known for their strong zero and few-shot generalization, to tackle video understanding tasks in surveillance. Specifically, we explore VideoLLaMA2, a state-of-the-art LVLM, and an improved token-level sampling method, Self-Reflective Sampling (Self-ReS). Our experiments on the UCF-Crime dataset show that VideoLLaMA2 represents a significant leap in zero-shot performance, with 20% boost over the baseline. Self-ReS additionally increases zero-shot action recognition performance to 44.6%. These results highlight the potential of LVLMs, paired with improved sampling techniques, for advancing surveillance video analysis in diverse scenarios.

- **Summary**: The utilization of longitudinal datasets for glaucoma progression prediction offers a compelling approach to support early therapeutic interventions. Predominant methodologies in this domain have primarily focused on the direct prediction of glaucoma stage labels from longitudinal datasets. However, such methods may not adequately encapsulate the nuanced developmental trajectory of the disease. To enhance the diagnostic acumen of medical practitioners, we propose a novel diffusion-based model to predict prospective images by extrapolating from existing longitudinal fundus images of patients. The methodology delineated in this study distinctively leverages sequences of images as inputs. Subsequently, a time-aligned mask is employed to select a specific year for image generation. During the training phase, the time-aligned mask resolves the issue of irregular temporal intervals in longitudinal image sequence sampling. Additionally, we utilize a strategy of randomly masking a frame in the sequence to establish the ground truth. This methodology aids the network in continuously acquiring knowledge regarding the internal relationships among the sequences throughout the learning phase. Moreover, the introduction of textual labels is instrumental in categorizing images generated within the sequence. The empirical findings from the conducted experiments indicate that our proposed model not only effectively generates longitudinal data but also significantly improves the precision of downstream classification tasks.

- **Summary**: In recent years, learned image compression methods have demonstrated superior rate-distortion performance compared to traditional image compression methods. Recent methods utilize convolutional neural networks (CNN), variational autoencoders (VAE), invertible neural networks (INN), and transformers. Despite their significant contributions, a main drawback of these models is their poor performance in capturing local redundancy. Therefore, to leverage global features along with local redundancy, we propose a CNN-based solution integrated with a feature encoding module. The feature encoding module encodes important features before feeding them to the CNN and then utilizes cross-scale window-based attention, which further captures local redundancy. Cross-scale window-based attention is inspired by the attention mechanism in transformers and effectively enlarges the receptive field. Both the feature encoding module and the cross-scale window-based attention module in our architecture are flexible and can be incorporated into any other network architecture. We evaluate our method on the Kodak and CLIC datasets and demonstrate that our approach is effective and on par with state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Vision-based object detectors are a crucial basis for robotics applications as they provide valuable information about object localisation in the environment. These need to ensure high reliability in different lighting conditions, occlusions, and visual artifacts, all while running in real-time. Collecting and annotating real-world data for these networks is prohibitively time consuming and costly, especially for custom assets, such as industrial objects, making it untenable for generalization to in-the-wild scenarios. To this end, we present Synthetica, a method for large-scale synthetic data generation for training robust state estimators. This paper focuses on the task of object detection, an important problem which can serve as the front-end for most state estimation problems, such as pose estimation. Leveraging data from a photorealistic ray-tracing renderer, we scale up data generation, generating 2.7 million images, to train highly accurate real-time detection transformers. We present a collection of rendering randomization and training-time data augmentation techniques conducive to robust sim-to-real performance for vision tasks. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the task of object detection while having detectors that run at 50-100Hz which is 9 times faster than the prior SOTA. We further demonstrate the usefulness of our training methodology for robotics applications by showcasing a pipeline for use in the real world with custom objects for which there do not exist prior datasets. Our work highlights the importance of scaling synthetic data generation for robust sim-to-real transfer while achieving the fastest real-time inference speeds.

- **Summary**: Background and Objective: In the realm of ophthalmic imaging, accurate vascular segmentation is paramount for diagnosing and managing various eye diseases. Contemporary deep learning-based vascular segmentation models rival human accuracy but still face substantial challenges in accurately segmenting minuscule blood vessels in neural network applications. Due to the necessity of multiple downsampling operations in the CNN models, fine details from high-resolution images are inevitably lost. The objective of this study is to design a structure to capture the delicate and small blood vessels. Methods: To address these issues, we propose a novel network (KaLDeX) for vascular segmentation leveraging a Kalman filter based linear deformable cross attention (LDCA) module, integrated within a UNet++ framework. Our approach is based on two key components: Kalman filter (KF) based linear deformable convolution (LD) and cross-attention (CA) modules. The LD module is designed to adaptively adjust the focus on thin vessels that might be overlooked in standard convolution. The CA module improves the global understanding of vascular structures by aggregating the detailed features from the LD module with the high level features from the UNet++ architecture. Finally, we adopt a topological loss function based on persistent homology to constrain the topological continuity of the segmentation. Results: The proposed method is evaluated on retinal fundus image datasets (DRIVE, CHASE_BD1, and STARE) as well as the 3mm and 6mm of the OCTA-500 dataset, achieving an average accuracy (ACC) of 97.25%, 97.77%, 97.85%, 98.89%, and 98.21%, respectively.

- **Summary**: Document parsing is essential for converting unstructured and semi-structured documents-such as contracts, academic papers, and invoices-into structured, machine-readable data. Document parsing extract reliable structured data from unstructured inputs, providing huge convenience for numerous applications. Especially with recent achievements in Large Language Models, document parsing plays an indispensable role in both knowledge base construction and training data generation. This survey presents a comprehensive review of the current state of document parsing, covering key methodologies, from modular pipeline systems to end-to-end models driven by large vision-language models. Core components such as layout detection, content extraction (including text, tables, and mathematical expressions), and multi-modal data integration are examined in detail. Additionally, this paper discusses the challenges faced by modular document parsing systems and vision-language models in handling complex layouts, integrating multiple modules, and recognizing high-density text. It emphasizes the importance of developing larger and more diverse datasets and outlines future research directions.

- **Summary**: Idling vehicle detection (IVD) can be helpful in monitoring and reducing unnecessary idling and can be integrated into real-time systems to address the resulting pollution and harmful products. The previous approach [13], a non-end-to-end model, requires extra user clicks to specify a part of the input, making system deployment more error-prone or even not feasible. In contrast, we introduce an end-to-end joint audio-visual IVD task designed to detect vehicles visually under three states: moving, idling and engine off. Unlike feature co-occurrence task such as audio-visual vehicle tracking, our IVD task addresses complementary features, where labels cannot be determined by a single modality alone. To this end, we propose AVIVD-Net, a novel network that integrates audio and visual features through a bidirectional attention mechanism. AVIVD-Net streamlines the input process by learning a joint feature space, reducing the deployment complexity of previous methods. Additionally, we introduce the AVIVD dataset, which is seven times larger than previous datasets, offering significantly more annotated samples to study the IVD problem. Our model achieves performance comparable to prior approaches, making it suitable for automated deployment. Furthermore, by evaluating AVIVDNet on the feature co-occurrence public dataset MAVD [23], we demonstrate its potential for extension to self-driving vehicle video-camera setups.

- **Summary**: For structural health monitoring, continuous and automatic crack detection has been a challenging problem. This study is conducted to propose a framework of automatic crack segmentation from high-resolution images containing crack information about steel box girders of bridges. Considering the multi-scale feature of cracks, convolutional neural network architecture of Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) for crack detection is proposed. As for input, 120 raw images are processed via two approaches (shrinking the size of images and splitting images into sub-images). Then, models with the proposed structure of FPN for crack detection are developed. The result shows all developed models can automatically detect the cracks at the raw images. By shrinking the images, the computation efficiency is improved without decreasing accuracy. Because of the separable characteristic of crack, models using the splitting method provide more accurate crack segmentations than models using the resizing method. Therefore, for high-resolution images, the FPN structure coupled with the splitting method is an promising solution for the crack segmentation and detection.

- **Summary**: Point cloud segmentation is an important topic in 3D understanding that has traditionally has been tackled using either the CNN or Transformer. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative, offering efficient long-range contextual modeling capabilities without the quadratic complexity associated with Transformer's attention mechanisms. However, despite Mamba's potential, early efforts have all failed to achieve better performance than the best CNN-based and Transformer-based methods. In this work, we address this challenge by identifying the key components of an effective and efficient point cloud segmentation architecture. Specifically, we show that: 1) Spatial locality and robust contextual understanding are critical for strong performance, and 2) Mamba features linear computational complexity, offering superior data and inference efficiency compared to Transformers, while still being capable of delivering strong contextual understanding. Additionally, we further enhance the standard Mamba specifically for point cloud segmentation by identifying its two key shortcomings. First, the enforced causality in the original Mamba is unsuitable for processing point clouds that have no such dependencies. Second, its unidirectional scanning strategy imposes a directional bias, hampering its ability to capture the full context of unordered point clouds in a single pass. To address these issues, we carefully remove the causal convolutions and introduce a novel Strided Bidirectional SSM to enhance the model's capability to capture spatial relationships. Our efforts culminate in the development of a novel architecture named MEEPO, which effectively integrates the strengths of CNN and Mamba. MEEPO surpasses the previous state-of-the-art method, PTv3, by up to +0.8 mIoU on multiple key benchmark datasets, while being 42.1% faster and 5.53x more memory efficient.

- **Summary**: Search engines enable the retrieval of unknown information with texts. However, traditional methods fall short when it comes to understanding unfamiliar visual content, such as identifying an object that the model has never seen before. This challenge is particularly pronounced for large vision-language models (VLMs): if the model has not been exposed to the object depicted in an image, it struggles to generate reliable answers to the user's question regarding that image. Moreover, as new objects and events continuously emerge, frequently updating VLMs is impractical due to heavy computational burdens. To address this limitation, we propose Vision Search Assistant, a novel framework that facilitates collaboration between VLMs and web agents. This approach leverages VLMs' visual understanding capabilities and web agents' real-time information access to perform open-world Retrieval-Augmented Generation via the web. By integrating visual and textual representations through this collaboration, the model can provide informed responses even when the image is novel to the system. Extensive experiments conducted on both open-set and closed-set QA benchmarks demonstrate that the Vision Search Assistant significantly outperforms the other models and can be widely applied to existing VLMs.

- **Summary**: Treatment selection in breast cancer is guided by molecular subtypes and clinical characteristics. Recurrence risk assessment plays a crucial role in personalizing treatment. Current methods, including genomic assays, have limited accuracy and clinical utility, leading to suboptimal decisions for many patients. We developed a test for breast cancer patient stratification based on digital pathology and clinical characteristics using novel AI methods. Specifically, we utilized a vision transformer-based pan-cancer foundation model trained with self-supervised learning to extract features from digitized H&E-stained slides. These features were integrated with clinical data to form a multi-modal AI test predicting cancer recurrence and death. The test was developed and evaluated using data from a total of 8,161 breast cancer patients across 15 cohorts originating from seven countries. Of these, 3,502 patients from five cohorts were used exclusively for evaluation, while the remaining patients were used for training. Our test accurately predicted our primary endpoint, disease-free interval, in the five external cohorts (C-index: 0.71 [0.68-0.75], HR: 3.63 [3.02-4.37, p<0.01]). In a direct comparison (N=858), the AI test was more accurate than Oncotype DX, the standard-of-care 21-gene assay, with a C-index of 0.67 [0.61-0.74] versus 0.61 [0.49-0.73], respectively. Additionally, the AI test added independent information to Oncotype DX in a multivariate analysis (HR: 3.11 [1.91-5.09, p<0.01)]). The test demonstrated robust accuracy across all major breast cancer subtypes, including TNBC (C-index: 0.71 [0.62-0.81], HR: 3.81 [2.35-6.17, p=0.02]), where no diagnostic tools are currently recommended by clinical guidelines. These results suggest that our AI test can improve accuracy, extend applicability to a wider range of patients, and enhance access to treatment selection tools.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have become essential for advancing the integration of visual and linguistic information, facilitating a wide range of complex applications and tasks. However, the evaluation of LVLMs presents significant challenges as the evaluation benchmark always demands lots of human cost for its construction, and remains static, lacking flexibility once constructed. Even though automatic evaluation has been explored in textual modality, the visual modality remains under-explored. As a result, in this work, we address a question: "Can LVLMs serve as a path to automatic benchmarking?". We introduce AutoBench-V, an automated framework for serving evaluation on demand, i.e., benchmarking LVLMs based on specific aspects of model capability. Upon receiving an evaluation capability, AutoBench-V leverages text-to-image models to generate relevant image samples and then utilizes LVLMs to orchestrate visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, completing the evaluation process efficiently and flexibly. Through an extensive evaluation of seven popular LVLMs across five demanded user inputs (i.e., evaluation capabilities), the framework shows effectiveness and reliability. We observe the following: (1) Our constructed benchmark accurately reflects varying task difficulties; (2) As task difficulty rises, the performance gap between models widens; (3) While models exhibit strong performance in abstract level understanding, they underperform in details reasoning tasks; and (4) Constructing a dataset with varying levels of difficulties is critical for a comprehensive and exhaustive evaluation. Overall, AutoBench-V not only successfully utilizes LVLMs for automated benchmarking but also reveals that LVLMs as judges have significant potential in various domains.

- **Summary**: We present LARP, a novel video tokenizer designed to overcome limitations in current video tokenization methods for autoregressive (AR) generative models. Unlike traditional patchwise tokenizers that directly encode local visual patches into discrete tokens, LARP introduces a holistic tokenization scheme that gathers information from the visual content using a set of learned holistic queries. This design allows LARP to capture more global and semantic representations, rather than being limited to local patch-level information. Furthermore, it offers flexibility by supporting an arbitrary number of discrete tokens, enabling adaptive and efficient tokenization based on the specific requirements of the task. To align the discrete token space with downstream AR generation tasks, LARP integrates a lightweight AR transformer as a training-time prior model that predicts the next token on its discrete latent space. By incorporating the prior model during training, LARP learns a latent space that is not only optimized for video reconstruction but is also structured in a way that is more conducive to autoregressive generation. Moreover, this process defines a sequential order for the discrete tokens, progressively pushing them toward an optimal configuration during training, ensuring smoother and more accurate AR generation at inference time. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LARP's strong performance, achieving state-of-the-art FVD on the UCF101 class-conditional video generation benchmark. LARP enhances the compatibility of AR models with videos and opens up the potential to build unified high-fidelity multimodal large language models (MLLMs).

- **Summary**: The scaling up has brought tremendous success in the fields of vision and language in recent years. When it comes to audio, however, researchers encounter a major challenge in scaling up the training data, as most natural audio contains diverse interfering signals. To address this limitation, we introduce Omni-modal Sound Separation (OmniSep), a novel framework capable of isolating clean soundtracks based on omni-modal queries, encompassing both single-modal and multi-modal composed queries. Specifically, we introduce the Query-Mixup strategy, which blends query features from different modalities during training. This enables OmniSep to optimize multiple modalities concurrently, effectively bringing all modalities under a unified framework for sound separation. We further enhance this flexibility by allowing queries to influence sound separation positively or negatively, facilitating the retention or removal of specific sounds as desired. Finally, OmniSep employs a retrieval-augmented approach known as Query-Aug, which enables open-vocabulary sound separation. Experimental evaluations on MUSIC, VGGSOUND-CLEAN+, and MUSIC-CLEAN+ datasets demonstrate effectiveness of OmniSep, achieving state-of-the-art performance in text-, image-, and audio-queried sound separation tasks.

- **Summary**: Recent work studying the generalization of diffusion models with UNet-based denoisers reveals inductive biases that can be expressed via geometry-adaptive harmonic bases. However, in practice, more recent denoising networks are often based on transformers, e.g., the diffusion transformer (DiT). This raises the question: do transformer-based denoising networks exhibit inductive biases that can also be expressed via geometry-adaptive harmonic bases? To our surprise, we find that this is not the case. This discrepancy motivates our search for the inductive bias that can lead to good generalization in DiT models. Investigating the pivotal attention modules of a DiT, we find that locality of attention maps are closely associated with generalization. To verify this finding, we modify the generalization of a DiT by restricting its attention windows. We inject local attention windows to a DiT and observe an improvement in generalization. Furthermore, we empirically find that both the placement and the effective attention size of these local attention windows are crucial factors. Experimental results on the CelebA, ImageNet, and LSUN datasets show that strengthening the inductive bias of a DiT can improve both generalization and generation quality when less training data is available. Source code will be released publicly upon paper publication. Project page: dit-generalization.github.io/.

- **Summary**: The sequential execution of actions and their hierarchical structure consisting of different levels of abstraction, provide features that remain unexplored in the task of action recognition. In this study, we present a novel approach to improve action recognition by exploiting the hierarchical organization of actions and by incorporating contextualized textual information, including location and prior actions to reflect the sequential context. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel transformer architecture tailored for action recognition that utilizes both visual and textual features. Visual features are obtained from RGB and optical flow data, while text embeddings represent contextual information. Furthermore, we define a joint loss function to simultaneously train the model for both coarse and fine-grained action recognition, thereby exploiting the hierarchical nature of actions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we extend the Toyota Smarthome Untrimmed (TSU) dataset to introduce action hierarchies, introducing the Hierarchical TSU dataset. We also conduct an ablation study to assess the impact of different methods for integrating contextual and hierarchical data on action recognition performance. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms pre-trained SOTA methods when trained with the same hyperparameters. Moreover, they also show a 17.12% improvement in top-1 accuracy over the equivalent fine-grained RGB version when using ground-truth contextual information, and a 5.33% improvement when contextual information is obtained from actual predictions.

- **Summary**: Domain adaptation has been extensively investigated in computer vision but still requires access to target data at the training time, which might be difficult to obtain in some uncommon conditions. In this paper, we present a new framework for domain adaptation relying on a single Vision-Language (VL) latent embedding instead of full target data. First, leveraging a contrastive language-image pre-training model (CLIP), we propose prompt/photo-driven instance normalization (PIN). PIN is a feature augmentation method that mines multiple visual styles using a single target VL latent embedding, by optimizing affine transformations of low-level source features. The VL embedding can come from a language prompt describing the target domain, a partially optimized language prompt, or a single unlabeled target image. Second, we show that these mined styles (i.e., augmentations) can be used for zero-shot (i.e., target-free) and one-shot unsupervised domain adaptation. Experiments on semantic segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms relevant baselines in the zero-shot and one-shot settings.

- **Summary**: Social relation reasoning aims to identify relation categories such as friends, spouses, and colleagues from images. While current methods adopt the paradigm of training a dedicated network end-to-end using labeled image data, they are limited in terms of generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we first present a simple yet well-crafted framework named {\name}, which combines the perception capability of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) within a modular framework, providing a strong baseline for social relation recognition. Specifically, we instruct VFMs to translate image content into a textual social story, and then utilize LLMs for text-based reasoning. {\name} introduces systematic design principles to adapt VFMs and LLMs separately and bridge their gaps. Without additional model training, it achieves competitive zero-shot results on two databases while offering interpretable answers, as LLMs can generate language-based explanations for the decisions. The manual prompt design process for LLMs at the reasoning phase is tedious and an automated prompt optimization method is desired. As we essentially convert a visual classification task into a generative task of LLMs, automatic prompt optimization encounters a unique long prompt optimization issue. To address this issue, we further propose the Greedy Segment Prompt Optimization (GSPO), which performs a greedy search by utilizing gradient information at the segment level. Experimental results show that GSPO significantly improves performance, and our method also generalizes to different image styles. The code is available at https://github.com/Mengzibin/SocialGPT.

- **Summary**: Adversarial attacks threaten the reliability of machine learning models in critical applications like autonomous vehicles and defense systems. As object detectors become more robust with models like YOLOv8, developing effective adversarial methodologies is increasingly challenging. We present Truck Adversarial Camouflage Optimization (TACO), a novel framework that generates adversarial camouflage patterns on 3D vehicle models to deceive state-of-the-art object detectors. Adopting Unreal Engine 5, TACO integrates differentiable rendering with a Photorealistic Rendering Network to optimize adversarial textures targeted at YOLOv8. To ensure the generated textures are both effective in deceiving detectors and visually plausible, we introduce the Convolutional Smooth Loss function, a generalized smooth loss function. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that TACO significantly degrades YOLOv8's detection performance, achieving an AP@0.5 of 0.0099 on unseen test data. Furthermore, these adversarial patterns exhibit strong transferability to other object detection models such as Faster R-CNN and earlier YOLO versions.

- **Summary**: Pore-scale modeling of rock images based on information in 3D micro-computed tomography data is crucial for studying complex subsurface processes such as CO2 and brine multiphase flow during Geologic Carbon Storage (GCS). While deep learning models can generate 3D rock microstructures that match static rock properties, they have two key limitations: they don't account for the spatial distribution of rock properties that can have an important influence on the flow and transport characteristics (such as permeability and relative permeability) of the rock and they generate structures below the representative elementary volume (REV) scale for those transport properties. Addressing these issues is crucial for building a consistent workflow between pore-scale analysis and field-scale modeling. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage modeling framework that combines a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE) and a transformer model for spatial upscaling and arbitrary-size 3D porous media reconstruction in an autoregressive manner. The VQVAE first compresses and quantizes sub-volume training images into low-dimensional tokens, while we train a transformer to spatially assemble these tokens into larger images following specific spatial order. By employing a multi-token generation strategy, our approach preserves both sub-volume integrity and spatial relationships among these sub-image patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our multi-token transformer generation approach and validate it using real data from a test well, showcasing its potential to generate models for the porous media at the well scale using only a spatial porosity model.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly enhanced the quality of image synthesis, yet they have also introduced serious safety concerns, particularly the generation of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content. Previous research has demonstrated that adversarial prompts can be used to generate NSFW content. However, such adversarial text prompts are often easily detectable by text-based filters, limiting their efficacy. In this paper, we expose a previously overlooked vulnerability: adversarial image attacks targeting Image-to-Image (I2I) diffusion models. We propose AdvI2I, a novel framework that manipulates input images to induce diffusion models to generate NSFW content. By optimizing a generator to craft adversarial images, AdvI2I circumvents existing defense mechanisms, such as Safe Latent Diffusion (SLD), without altering the text prompts. Furthermore, we introduce AdvI2I-Adaptive, an enhanced version that adapts to potential countermeasures and minimizes the resemblance between adversarial images and NSFW concept embeddings, making the attack more resilient against defenses. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that both AdvI2I and AdvI2I-Adaptive can effectively bypass current safeguards, highlighting the urgent need for stronger security measures to address the misuse of I2I diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Trust and interpretability are crucial for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in scientific research, but current models often operate as black boxes offering limited transparency and justifications for their outputs. We introduce AiSciVision, a framework that specializes Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) into interactive research partners and classification models for image classification tasks in niche scientific domains. Our framework uses two key components: (1) Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VisRAG) and (2) domain-specific tools utilized in an agentic workflow. To classify a target image, AiSciVision first retrieves the most similar positive and negative labeled images as context for the LMM. Then the LMM agent actively selects and applies tools to manipulate and inspect the target image over multiple rounds, refining its analysis before making a final prediction. These VisRAG and tooling components are designed to mirror the processes of domain experts, as humans often compare new data to similar examples and use specialized tools to manipulate and inspect images before arriving at a conclusion. Each inference produces both a prediction and a natural language transcript detailing the reasoning and tool usage that led to the prediction. We evaluate AiSciVision on three real-world scientific image classification datasets: detecting the presence of aquaculture ponds, diseased eelgrass, and solar panels. Across these datasets, our method outperforms fully supervised models in low and full-labeled data settings. AiSciVision is actively deployed in real-world use, specifically for aquaculture research, through a dedicated web application that displays and allows the expert users to converse with the transcripts. This work represents a crucial step toward AI systems that are both interpretable and effective, advancing their use in scientific research and scientific discovery.

- **Summary**: The lack of interpretability in the field of medical image analysis has significant ethical and legal implications. Existing interpretable methods in this domain encounter several challenges, including dependency on specific models, difficulties in understanding and visualization, as well as issues related to efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called Med-MICN (Medical Multi-dimensional Interpretable Concept Network). Med-MICN provides interpretability alignment for various angles, including neural symbolic reasoning, concept semantics, and saliency maps, which are superior to current interpretable methods. Its advantages include high prediction accuracy, interpretability across multiple dimensions, and automation through an end-to-end concept labeling process that reduces the need for extensive human training effort when working with new datasets. To demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of Med-MICN, we apply it to four benchmark datasets and compare it with baselines. The results clearly demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our Med-MICN.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Exposure Correction (EC) aims to recover proper exposure conditions for images captured under over-exposure or under-exposure scenarios. While existing deep learning models have shown promising results, few have fully embedded Retinex theory into their architecture, highlighting a gap in current methodologies. Additionally, the balance between high performance and efficiency remains an under-explored problem for exposure correction task. Inspired by Mamba which demonstrates powerful and highly efficient sequence modeling, we introduce a novel framework based on Mamba for Exposure Correction (ECMamba) with dual pathways, each dedicated to the restoration of reflectance and illumination map, respectively. Specifically, we firstly derive the Retinex theory and we train a Retinex estimator capable of mapping inputs into two intermediary spaces, each approximating the target reflectance and illumination map, respectively. This setup facilitates the refined restoration process of the subsequent Exposure Correction Mamba Module (ECMM). Moreover, we develop a novel 2D Selective State-space layer guided by Retinex information (Retinex-SS2D) as the core operator of ECMM. This architecture incorporates an innovative 2D scanning strategy based on deformable feature aggregation, thereby enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness. Extensive experiment results and comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the outstanding performance and the importance of each component of our proposed ECMamba.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we investigate how moving objects can be detected when images are impacted by atmospheric turbulence. We present a geometric spatio-temporal point of view to the problem and show that it is possible to distinguish movement due to the turbulence vs. moving objects. To perform this task, we propose an extension of 2D cartoon+texture decomposition algorithms to 3D vector fields. Our algorithm is based on curvelet spaces which permit to better characterize the movement flow geometry. We present experiments on real data which illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: We propose a methodology that exploits large and diverse data sets to accurately estimate the ambient medium's Green's functions in strongly scattering media. Given these estimates, obtained with and without the use of neural networks, excellent imaging results are achieved, with a resolution that is better than that of a homogeneous medium. This phenomenon, also known as super-resolution, occurs because the ambient scattering medium effectively enhances the physical imaging aperture.

- **Summary**: This study evaluates the generalisation capabilities of state-of-the-art histopathology foundation models on out-of-distribution multi-stain autoimmune Immunohistochemistry datasets. We compare 13 feature extractor models, including ImageNet-pretrained networks, and histopathology foundation models trained on both public and proprietary data, on Rheumatoid Arthritis subtyping and Sjogren's Disease detection tasks. Using a simple Attention-Based Multiple Instance Learning classifier, we assess the transferability of learned representations from cancer H&E images to autoimmune IHC images. Contrary to expectations, histopathology-pretrained models did not significantly outperform ImageNet-pretrained models. Furthermore, there was evidence of both autoimmune feature misinterpretation and biased feature importance. Our findings highlight the challenges in transferring knowledge from cancer to autoimmune histopathology and emphasise the need for careful evaluation of AI models across diverse histopathological tasks.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a new approach to perform supervised texture classification/segmentation. The proposed idea is to feed a Fully Convolutional Network with specific texture descriptors. These texture features are extracted from images by using an empirical curvelet transform. We propose a method to build a unique empirical curvelet filter bank adapted to a given dictionary of textures. We then show that the output of these filters can be used to build efficient texture descriptors utilized to finally feed deep learning networks. Our approach is finally evaluated on several datasets and compare the results to various state-of-the-art algorithms and show that the proposed method dramatically outperform all existing ones.

- **Summary**: The key challenge of multi-view indoor 3D object detection is to infer accurate geometry information from images for precise 3D detection. Previous method relies on NeRF for geometry reasoning. However, the geometry extracted from NeRF is generally inaccurate, which leads to sub-optimal detection performance. In this paper, we propose MVSDet which utilizes plane sweep for geometry-aware 3D object detection. To circumvent the requirement for a large number of depth planes for accurate depth prediction, we design a probabilistic sampling and soft weighting mechanism to decide the placement of pixel features on the 3D volume. We select multiple locations that score top in the probability volume for each pixel and use their probability score to indicate the confidence. We further apply recent pixel-aligned Gaussian Splatting to regularize depth prediction and improve detection performance with little computation overhead. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and ARKitScenes datasets are conducted to show the superiority of our model. Our code is available at https://github.com/Pixie8888/MVSDet.



### ImageNet-RIB Benchmark: Large Pre-Training Datasets Don't Guarantee Robustness after Fine-Tuning

- **Summary**: Highly performant large-scale pre-trained models promise to also provide a valuable foundation for learning specialized tasks, by fine-tuning the model to the desired task. By starting from a good general-purpose model, the goal is to achieve both specialization in the target task and maintain robustness. To assess the robustness of models to out-of-distribution samples after fine-tuning on downstream datasets, we introduce a new robust fine-tuning benchmark, ImageNet-RIB (Robustness Inheritance Benchmark). The benchmark consists of a set of related but distinct specialized (downstream) tasks; pre-trained models are fine-tuned on one task in the set and their robustness is assessed on the rest, iterating across all tasks for fine-tuning and assessment. We find that the continual learning methods, EWC and LwF maintain robustness after fine-tuning though fine-tuning generally does reduce performance on generalization to related downstream tasks across models. Not surprisingly, models pre-trained on large and rich datasets exhibit higher initial robustness across datasets and suffer more pronounced degradation during fine-tuning. The distance between the pre-training and downstream datasets, measured by optimal transport, predicts this performance degradation on the pre-training dataset. However, counterintuitively, model robustness after fine-tuning on related downstream tasks is the worst when the pre-training dataset is the richest and the most diverse. This suggests that starting with the strongest foundation model is not necessarily the best approach for performance on specialist tasks. The benchmark thus offers key insights for developing more resilient fine-tuning strategies and building robust machine learning models. https://jd730.github.io/projects/ImageNet-RIB

- **Summary**: In this paper, we adapt the two topological numbers, which have been proposed to efficiently characterize simple points in specific neighborhoods for 3D binary images, to the case of 2D binary images. Unlike the 3D case, we only use a single neighborhood to define these two topological numbers for the 2D case. Then, we characterize simple points either by using the two topological numbers or by a single topological number linked to another one condition. We compare the characterization of simple points by topological numbers with two other ones based on Hilditch crossing number and Yokoi number. We also highlight the number of possible configurations corresponding to a simple point, which also represents the maximum limit of local configurations that a thinning algorithm operating by parallel deletion of simple (individual) points may delete while preserving topology (limit usually not reachable, depending on the deletion strategy).

- **Summary**: Visual place recognition (VPR) enables autonomous robots to identify previously visited locations, which contributes to tasks like simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). VPR faces challenges such as accurate image neighbor retrieval and appearance change in scenery. Event cameras, also known as dynamic vision sensors, are a new sensor modality for VPR and offer a promising solution to the challenges with their unique attributes: high temporal resolution (1MHz clock), ultra-low latency (in {\mu}s), and high dynamic range (>120dB). These attributes make event cameras less susceptible to motion blur and more robust in variable lighting conditions, making them suitable for addressing VPR challenges. However, the scarcity of event-based VPR datasets, partly due to the novelty and cost of event cameras, hampers their adoption. To fill this data gap, our paper introduces the NYC-Event-VPR dataset to the robotics and computer vision communities, featuring the Prophesee IMX636 HD event sensor (1280x720 resolution), combined with RGB camera and GPS module. It encompasses over 13 hours of geotagged event data, spanning 260 kilometers across New York City, covering diverse lighting and weather conditions, day/night scenarios, and multiple visits to various locations. Furthermore, our paper employs three frameworks to conduct generalization performance assessments, promoting innovation in event-based VPR and its integration into robotics applications.
