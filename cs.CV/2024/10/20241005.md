- **Summary**: The part-whole relational property endowed by Capsule Networks (CapsNets) has been known successful for camouflaged object detection due to its segmentation integrity. However, the previous Expectation Maximization (EM) capsule routing algorithm with heavy computation and large parameters obstructs this trend. The primary attribution behind lies in the pixel-level capsule routing. Alternatively, in this paper, we propose a novel mamba capsule routing at the type level. Specifically, we first extract the implicit latent state in mamba as capsule vectors, which abstract type-level capsules from pixel-level versions. These type-level mamba capsules are fed into the EM routing algorithm to get the high-layer mamba capsules, which greatly reduce the computation and parameters caused by the pixel-level capsule routing for part-whole relationships exploration. On top of that, to retrieve the pixel-level capsule features for further camouflaged prediction, we achieve this on the basis of the low-layer pixel-level capsules with the guidance of the correlations from adjacent-layer type-level mamba capsules. Extensive experiments on three widely used COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts.

- **Summary**: Recent studies have shown that regularization techniques using soft labels, e.g., label smoothing, Mixup, and CutMix, not only enhance image classification accuracy but also improve model calibration and robustness against adversarial attacks. However, the underlying mechanisms of such improvements remain underexplored. In this paper, we offer a novel explanation from the perspective of the representation space (i.e., the space of the features obtained at the penultimate layer). Our investigation first reveals that the decision regions in the representation space form cone-like shapes around the origin after training regardless of the presence of regularization. However, applying regularization causes changes in the distribution of features (or representation vectors). The magnitudes of the representation vectors are reduced and subsequently the cosine similarities between the representation vectors and the class centers (minimal loss points for each class) become higher, which acts as a central mechanism inducing improved calibration and robustness. Our findings provide new insights into the characteristics of the high-dimensional representation space in relation to training and regularization using soft labels.

- **Summary**: Various imaging modalities are used in patient diagnosis, each offering unique advantages and valuable insights into anatomy and pathology. Computed Tomography (CT) is crucial in diagnostics, providing high-resolution images for precise internal organ visualization. CT's ability to detect subtle tissue variations is vital for diagnosing diseases like lung cancer, enabling early detection and accurate tumor assessment. However, variations in CT scanner models and acquisition protocols introduce significant variability in the extracted radiomic features, even when imaging the same patient. This variability poses considerable challenges for downstream research and clinical analysis, which depend on consistent and reliable feature extraction. Current methods for medical image feature extraction, often based on supervised learning approaches, including GAN-based models, face limitations in generalizing across different imaging environments. In response to these challenges, we propose LTDiff++, a multiscale latent diffusion model designed to enhance feature extraction in medical imaging. The model addresses variability by standardizing non-uniform distributions in the latent space, improving feature consistency. LTDiff++ utilizes a UNet++ encoder-decoder architecture coupled with a conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) at the latent bottleneck to achieve robust feature extraction and standardization. Extensive empirical evaluations on both patient and phantom CT datasets demonstrate significant improvements in image standardization, with higher Concordance Correlation Coefficients (CCC) across multiple radiomic feature categories. Through these advancements, LTDiff++ represents a promising solution for overcoming the inherent variability in medical imaging data, offering improved reliability and accuracy in feature extraction processes.

- **Summary**: Social media is increasingly plagued by realistic fake images, making it hard to trust content. Previous algorithms to detect these fakes often fail in new, real-world scenarios because they are trained on specific datasets. To address the problem, we introduce ForgeryTTT, the first method leveraging test-time training (TTT) to identify manipulated regions in images. The proposed approach fine-tunes the model for each individual test sample, improving its performance. ForgeryTTT first employs vision transformers as a shared image encoder to learn both classification and localization tasks simultaneously during the training-time training using a large synthetic dataset. Precisely, the localization head predicts a mask to highlight manipulated areas. Given such a mask, the input tokens can be divided into manipulated and genuine groups, which are then fed into the classification head to distinguish between manipulated and genuine parts. During test-time training, the predicted mask from the localization head is used for the classification head to update the image encoder for better adaptation. Additionally, using the classical dropout strategy in each token group significantly improves performance and efficiency. We test ForgeryTTT on five standard benchmarks. Despite its simplicity, ForgeryTTT achieves a 20.1% improvement in localization accuracy compared to other zero-shot methods and a 4.3% improvement over non-zero-shot techniques. Our code and data will be released upon publication.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces Gamified Adversarial Prompting (GAP), a framework that crowd-sources high-quality data for visual instruction tuning of large multimodal models. GAP transforms the data collection process into an engaging game, incentivizing players to provide fine-grained, challenging questions and answers that target gaps in the model's knowledge. Our contributions include (1) an approach to capture question-answer pairs from humans that directly address weaknesses in a model's knowledge, (2) a method for evaluating and rewarding players that successfully incentivizes them to provide high-quality submissions, and (3) a scalable, gamified platform that succeeds in collecting this data from over 50,000 participants in just a few weeks. Our implementation of GAP has significantly improved the accuracy of a small multimodal model, namely MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2.5-8B, increasing its GPT score from 0.147 to 0.477 on our dataset, approaching the benchmark set by the much larger GPT-4V. Moreover, we demonstrate that the data generated using MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2.5-8B also enhances its performance across other benchmarks, and exhibits cross-model benefits. Specifically, the same data improves the performance of QWEN2-VL-2B and QWEN2-VL-7B on the same multiple benchmarks.

- **Summary**: The 3D reconstruction of the surgical field in minimally invasive endoscopic surgery has posed a formidable challenge when using conventional monocular endoscopes. Existing 3D reconstruction methodologies are frequently encumbered by suboptimal accuracy and limited generalization capabilities. In this study, we introduce an innovative pipeline using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for 3D reconstruction. Our approach utilizes a preliminary NeRF reconstruction that yields a coarse model, then creates a binocular scene within the reconstructed environment, which derives an initial depth map via stereo vision. This initial depth map serves as depth supervision for subsequent NeRF iterations, progressively refining the 3D reconstruction with enhanced accuracy. The binocular depth is iteratively recalculated, with the refinement process continuing until the depth map converges, and exhibits negligible variations. Through this recursive process, high-fidelity depth maps are generated from monocular endoscopic video of a realistic cranial phantom. By repeated measures of the final 3D reconstruction compared to X-ray computed tomography, all differences of relevant clinical distances result in sub-millimeter accuracy.

- **Summary**: This work presents the development of a lane detection system aimed at assisting the driving of conventional and autonomous vehicles. The system was implemented using traditional computer vision techniques, focusing on robustness and efficiency to operate in real-time, even under adverse conditions such as worn-out lanes and weather variations. The methodology employs an image processing pipeline that includes camera calibration, distortion correction, perspective transformation, and binary image generation. Lane detection is performed using sliding window techniques and segmentation based on gradients and color channels, enabling the precise identification of lanes in various road scenarios. The results indicate that the system can effectively detect and track lanes, performing well under different lighting conditions and road surfaces. However, challenges were identified in extreme situations, such as intense shadows and sharp curves. It is concluded that, despite its limitations, the traditional computer vision approach shows significant potential for application in driver assistance systems and autonomous navigation, with room for future improvements.

- **Summary**: Artifacts often degrade the visual quality of virtual try-on (VTON) and pose transfer applications, impacting user experience. This study introduces a novel conditional inpainting technique designed to detect and remove such distortions, improving image aesthetics. Our work is the first to present an end-to-end framework addressing this specific issue, and we developed a specialized dataset of artifacts in VTON and pose transfer tasks, complete with masks highlighting the affected areas. Experimental results show that our method not only effectively removes artifacts but also significantly enhances the visual quality of the final images, setting a new benchmark in computer vision and image processing.

- **Summary**: Time cost is a major challenge in achieving high-quality pluralistic image completion. Recently, the Retentive Network (RetNet) in natural language processing offers a novel approach to this problem with its low-cost inference capabilities. Inspired by this, we apply RetNet to the pluralistic image completion task in computer vision. We present RetCompletion, a two-stage framework. In the first stage, we introduce Bi-RetNet, a bidirectional sequence information fusion model that integrates contextual information from images. During inference, we employ a unidirectional pixel-wise update strategy to restore consistent image structures, achieving both high reconstruction quality and fast inference speed. In the second stage, we use a CNN for low-resolution upsampling to enhance texture details. Experiments on ImageNet and CelebA-HQ demonstrate that our inference speed is 10$\times$ faster than ICT and 15$\times$ faster than RePaint. The proposed RetCompletion significantly improves inference speed and delivers strong performance, especially when masks cover large areas of the image.

- **Summary**: Scene sketching is to convert a scene into a simplified, abstract representation that captures the essential elements and composition of the original scene. It requires semantic understanding of the scene and consideration of different regions within the scene. Since scenes often contain diverse visual information across various regions, such as foreground objects, background elements, and spatial divisions, dealing with these different regions poses unique difficulties. In this paper, we define a sketch as some sets of Bezier curves. We optimize the different regions of input scene in multiple rounds. In each round of optimization, strokes sampled from the next region can seamlessly be integrated into the sketch generated in the previous round of optimization. We propose additional stroke initialization method to ensure the integrity of the scene and the convergence of optimization. A novel CLIP-Based Semantic loss and a VGG-Based Feature loss are utilized to guide our multi-round optimization. Extensive experimental results on the quality and quantity of the generated sketches confirm the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: In generative modeling, tokenization simplifies complex data into compact, structured representations, creating a more efficient, learnable space. For high-dimensional visual data, it reduces redundancy and emphasizes key features for high-quality generation. Current visual tokenization methods rely on a traditional autoencoder framework, where the encoder compresses data into latent representations, and the decoder reconstructs the original input. In this work, we offer a new perspective by proposing denoising as decoding, shifting from single-step reconstruction to iterative refinement. Specifically, we replace the decoder with a diffusion process that iteratively refines noise to recover the original image, guided by the latents provided by the encoder. We evaluate our approach by assessing both reconstruction (rFID) and generation quality (FID), comparing it to state-of-the-art autoencoding approach. We hope this work offers new insights into integrating iterative generation and autoencoding for improved compression and generation.

- **Summary**: Long-tailed problems in healthcare emerge from data imbalance due to variability in the prevalence and representation of different medical conditions, warranting the requirement of precise and dependable classification methods. Traditional loss functions such as cross-entropy and binary cross-entropy are often inadequate due to their inability to address the imbalances between the classes with high representation and the classes with low representation found in medical image datasets. We introduce a novel polynomial loss function based on Pade approximation, designed specifically to overcome the challenges associated with long-tailed classification. This approach incorporates asymmetric sampling techniques to better classify under-represented classes. We conducted extensive evaluations on three publicly available medical datasets and a proprietary medical dataset. Our implementation of the proposed loss function is open-sourced in the public repository:https://github.com/ipankhi/ALPA.



### Cross Resolution Encoding-Decoding For Detection Transformers

- **Summary**: Detection Transformers (DETR) are renowned object detection pipelines, however computationally efficient multiscale detection using DETR is still challenging. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Resolution Encoding-Decoding (CRED) mechanism that allows DETR to achieve the accuracy of high-resolution detection while having the speed of low-resolution detection. CRED is based on two modules; Cross Resolution Attention Module (CRAM) and One Step Multiscale Attention (OSMA). CRAM is designed to transfer the knowledge of low-resolution encoder output to a high-resolution feature. While OSMA is designed to fuse multiscale features in a single step and produce a feature map of a desired resolution enriched with multiscale information. When used in prominent DETR methods, CRED delivers accuracy similar to the high-resolution DETR counterpart in roughly 50% fewer FLOPs. Specifically, state-of-the-art DN-DETR, when used with CRED (calling CRED-DETR), becomes 76% faster, with ~50% reduced FLOPs than its high-resolution counterpart with 202 G FLOPs on MS-COCO benchmark. We plan to release pretrained CRED-DETRs for use by the community. Code: https://github.com/ashishkumar822/CRED-DETR

- **Summary**: In the era of vision Transformers, the recent success of VanillaNet shows the huge potential of simple and concise convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). Where such models mainly focus on runtime, it is also crucial to simultaneously focus on other aspects, e.g., FLOPs, parameters, etc, to strengthen their utility further. To this end, we introduce a refreshing ConvNet macro design called Columnar Stage Network (CoSNet). CoSNet has a systematically developed simple and concise structure, smaller depth, low parameter count, low FLOPs, and attention-less operations, well suited for resource-constrained deployment. The key novelty of CoSNet is deploying parallel convolutions with fewer kernels fed by input replication, using columnar stacking of these convolutions, and minimizing the use of 1x1 convolution layers. Our comprehensive evaluations show that CoSNet rivals many renowned ConvNets and Transformer designs under resource-constrained scenarios. Code: https://github.com/ashishkumar822/CoSNet

- **Summary**: We present an accurate and GPU-accelerated Stereo Visual SLAM design called Jetson-SLAM. It exhibits frame-processing rates above 60FPS on NVIDIA's low-powered 10W Jetson-NX embedded computer and above 200FPS on desktop-grade 200W GPUs, even in stereo configuration and in the multiscale setting. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a Bounded Rectification technique to prevent tagging many non-corner points as a corner in FAST detection, improving SLAM accuracy. (ii) A novel Pyramidal Culling and Aggregation (PyCA) technique that yields robust features while suppressing redundant ones at high speeds by harnessing a GPU device. PyCA uses our new Multi-Location Per Thread culling strategy (MLPT) and Thread-Efficient Warp-Allocation (TEWA) scheme for GPU to enable Jetson-SLAM achieving high accuracy and speed on embedded devices. (iii) Jetson-SLAM library achieves resource efficiency by having a data-sharing mechanism. Our experiments on three challenging datasets: KITTI, EuRoC, and KAIST-VIO, and two highly accurate SLAM backends: Full-BA and ICE-BA show that Jetson-SLAM is the fastest available accurate and GPU-accelerated SLAM system (Fig. 1).

- **Summary**: While functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) offers valuable insights into cognitive processes, its inherent spatial limitations pose challenges for detailed analysis of the fine-grained functional architecture of the brain. More specifically, MRI scanner and sequence specifications impose a trade-off between temporal resolution, spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and scan time. Deep Learning (DL) Super-Resolution (SR) methods have emerged as a promising solution to enhance fMRI resolution, generating high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) images typically acquired with lower scanning times. However, most existing SR approaches depend on supervised DL techniques, which require training ground truth (GT) HR data, which is often difficult to acquire and simultaneously sets a bound for how far SR can go. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-supervised DL SR model that combines a DL network with an analytical approach and Total Variation (TV) regularization. Our method eliminates the need for external GT images, achieving competitive performance compared to supervised DL techniques and preserving the functional maps.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on visual perception and linguistic interpretation. Despite their impressive capabilities across various tasks, LVLMs still suffer from the issue of hallucination, which involves generating content that is incorrect or unfaithful to the visual or textual inputs. Traditional benchmarks, such as MME and POPE, evaluate hallucination in LVLMs within the scope of Visual Question Answering (VQA) using answerable questions. However, some questions are unanswerable due to insufficient information in the images, and the performance of LVLMs on such unanswerable questions remains underexplored. To bridge this research gap, we propose TUBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the reliability of LVLMs using unanswerable questions. TUBench comprises an extensive collection of high-quality, unanswerable questions that are meticulously crafted using ten distinct strategies. To thoroughly evaluate LVLMs, the unanswerable questions in TUBench are based on images from four diverse domains as visual contexts: screenshots of code snippets, natural images, geometry diagrams, and screenshots of statistical tables. These unanswerable questions are tailored to test LVLMs' trustworthiness in code reasoning, commonsense reasoning, geometric reasoning, and mathematical reasoning related to tables, respectively. We conducted a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of 28 leading foundational models on TUBench, with Gemini-1.5-Pro, the top-performing model, achieving an average accuracy of 69.2%, and GPT-4o, the third-ranked model, reaching 66.7% average accuracy, in determining whether questions are answerable. TUBench is available at https://github.com/NLPCode/TUBench.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose to leverage a deep-learning (DL) based reconstruction framework for high quality Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography (SS-OCT) images, by incorporating wavelength ({\lambda}) space interferometric fringes. Generally, the SS-OCT captured fringe is linear in wavelength space and if Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) is applied to extract depth-resolved spectral information, the resultant images are blurred due to the broadened Point Spread Function (PSF). Thus, the recorded wavelength space fringe is to be scaled to uniform grid in wavenumber (k) space using k-linearization and calibration involving interpolations which may result in loss of information along with increased system complexity. Another challenge in OCT is the speckle noise, inherent in the low coherence interferometry-based systems. Hence, we propose a systematic design methodology WAVE-UNET to reconstruct the high-quality OCT images directly from the {\lambda}-space to reduce the complexity. The novel design paradigm surpasses the linearization procedures and uses DL to enhance the realism and quality of raw {\lambda}-space scans. This framework uses modified UNET having attention gating and residual connections, with IDFT processed {\lambda}-space fringes as the input. The method consistently outperforms the traditional OCT system by generating good-quality B-scans with highly reduced time-complexity.

- **Summary**: U-Net is widely used in medical image segmentation due to its simple and flexible architecture design. To address the challenges of scale and complexity in medical tasks, several variants of U-Net have been proposed. In particular, methods based on Vision Transformer (ViT), represented by Swin UNETR, have gained widespread attention in recent years. However, these improvements often focus on the encoder, overlooking the crucial role of the decoder in optimizing segmentation details. This design imbalance limits the potential for further enhancing segmentation performance. To address this issue, we analyze the roles of various decoder components, including upsampling method, skip connection, and feature extraction module, as well as the shortcomings of existing methods. Consequently, we propose Swin DER (i.e., Swin UNETR Decoder Enhanced and Refined) by specifically optimizing the design of these three components. Swin DER performs upsampling using learnable interpolation algorithm called offset coordinate neighborhood weighted up sampling (Onsampling) and replaces traditional skip connection with spatial-channel parallel attention gate (SCP AG). Additionally, Swin DER introduces deformable convolution along with attention mechanism in the feature extraction module of the decoder. Our model design achieves excellent results, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods on both the Synapse and the MSD brain tumor segmentation task.

- **Summary**: IceCloudNet is a novel method based on machine learning able to predict high-quality vertically resolved cloud ice water contents (IWC) and ice crystal number concentrations (N$_\textrm{ice}$). The predictions come at the spatio-temporal coverage and resolution of geostationary satellite observations (SEVIRI) and the vertical resolution of active satellite retrievals (DARDAR). IceCloudNet consists of a ConvNeXt-based U-Net and a 3D PatchGAN discriminator model and is trained by predicting DARDAR profiles from co-located SEVIRI images. Despite the sparse availability of DARDAR data due to its narrow overpass, IceCloudNet is able to predict cloud occurrence, spatial structure, and microphysical properties with high precision. The model has been applied to ten years of SEVIRI data, producing a dataset of vertically resolved IWC and N$_\textrm{ice}$ of clouds containing ice with a 3 kmx3 kmx240 mx15 minute resolution in a spatial domain of 30{\deg}W to 30{\deg}E and 30{\deg}S to 30{\deg}N. The produced dataset increases the availability of vertical cloud profiles, for the period when DARDAR is available, by more than six orders of magnitude and moreover, IceCloudNet is able to produce vertical cloud profiles beyond the lifetime of the recently ended satellite missions underlying DARDAR.

- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation aims to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a compact student counterpart, often coming with a significant performance gap between them. We find that a too-large performance gap can hamper the training process, which is also verified in recent studies. To address this, we propose a Gap Preserving Distillation (GPD) method that trains an additional dynamic teacher model from scratch along with training the student to bridge this gap. In this way, it becomes possible to maintain a reasonable performance gap between teacher and student during the whole distillation process. To further strengthen distillation from the dynamic teacher to the student, we develop a hard strategy by enforcing them to share parameters and encouraging parameter inheritance. Besides hard strategy, we also build the soft bidirectional mappings between them which are built on an Inverse Reparameterization (IR) method and a Channel-Branch Reparameterization (CBR) strategy. We highlight that our IR is able to initialize a larger dynamic teacher with an arbitrary expansion ratio, while preserving exactly the same accuracy as the given student model. In this way, it guarantees that the dynamic teacher and student start from the same point and avoid a too large gap in early stage of training. As for our CBR, with parameter-sharing, it directly extracts an effective student model from the well-learned dynamic teacher without any post-training, making our method highly flexible for model deployment. In the experiments, GPD significantly outperforms existing distillation methods on top of both CNNs and transformers architectures, achieving up to 1.58% accuracy improvement. Interestingly, GPD also generalizes well to the scenarios without a pre-trained teacher, including training from scratch and fine-tuning, yielding a large improvement of 1.80% and 0.89% on ResNet18, respectively.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel Multi-modal Guided Real-World Face Restoration (MGFR) technique designed to improve the quality of facial image restoration from low-quality inputs. Leveraging a blend of attribute text prompts, high-quality reference images, and identity information, MGFR can mitigate the generation of false facial attributes and identities often associated with generative face restoration methods. By incorporating a dual-control adapter and a two-stage training strategy, our method effectively utilizes multi-modal prior information for targeted restoration tasks. We also present the Reface-HQ dataset, comprising over 23,000 high-resolution facial images across 5,000 identities, to address the need for reference face training images. Our approach achieves superior visual quality in restoring facial details under severe degradation and allows for controlled restoration processes, enhancing the accuracy of identity preservation and attribute correction. Including negative quality samples and attribute prompts in the training further refines the model's ability to generate detailed and perceptually accurate images.

- **Summary**: The multi-step sampling mechanism, a key feature of visual diffusion models, has significant potential to replicate the success of OpenAI's Strawberry in enhancing performance by increasing the inference computational cost. Sufficient prior studies have demonstrated that correctly scaling up computation in the sampling process can successfully lead to improved generation quality, enhanced image editing, and compositional generalization. While there have been rapid advancements in developing inference-heavy algorithms for improved image generation, relatively little work has explored inference scaling laws in video diffusion models (VDMs). Furthermore, existing research shows only minimal performance gains that are perceptible to the naked eye. To address this, we design a novel training-free algorithm IV-Mixed Sampler that leverages the strengths of image diffusion models (IDMs) to assist VDMs surpass their current capabilities. The core of IV-Mixed Sampler is to use IDMs to significantly enhance the quality of each video frame and VDMs ensure the temporal coherence of the video during the sampling process. Our experiments have demonstrated that IV-Mixed Sampler achieves state-of-the-art performance on 4 benchmarks including UCF-101-FVD, MSR-VTT-FVD, Chronomagic-Bench-150, and Chronomagic-Bench-1649. For example, the open-source Animatediff with IV-Mixed Sampler reduces the UMT-FVD score from 275.2 to 228.6, closing to 223.1 from the closed-source Pika-2.0.

- **Summary**: Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated promising segmentation capabilities in a variety of downstream segmentation tasks. However in the context of universal medical image segmentation there exists a notable performance discrepancy when directly applying SAM due to the domain gap between natural and 2D/3D medical data. In this work, we propose a dual-branch adapted SAM framework, named DB-SAM, that strives to effectively bridge this domain gap. Our dual-branch adapted SAM contains two branches in parallel: a ViT branch and a convolution branch. The ViT branch incorporates a learnable channel attention block after each frozen attention block, which captures domain-specific local features. On the other hand, the convolution branch employs a light-weight convolutional block to extract domain-specific shallow features from the input medical image. To perform cross-branch feature fusion, we design a bilateral cross-attention block and a ViT convolution fusion block, which dynamically combine diverse information of two branches for mask decoder. Extensive experiments on large-scale medical image dataset with various 3D and 2D medical segmentation tasks reveal the merits of our proposed contributions. On 21 3D medical image segmentation tasks, our proposed DB-SAM achieves an absolute gain of 8.8%, compared to a recent medical SAM adapter in the literature.

- **Summary**: This machine learning study investigates a lowcost edge device integrated with an embedded system having computer vision and resulting in an improved performance in inferencing time and precision of object detection and classification. A primary aim of this study focused on reducing inferencing time and low-power consumption and to enable an embedded device of a competition-ready autonomous humanoid robot and to support real-time object recognition, scene understanding, visual navigation, motion planning, and autonomous navigation of the robot. This study compares processors for inferencing time performance between a central processing unit (CPU), a graphical processing unit (GPU), and a tensor processing unit (TPU). CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs are all processors that can be used for machine learning tasks. Related to the aim of supporting an autonomous humanoid robot, there was an additional effort to observe whether or not there was a significant difference in using a camera having monocular vision versus stereo vision capability. TPU inference time results for this study reflect a 25% reduction in time over the GPU, and a whopping 87.5% reduction in inference time compared to the CPU. Much information in this paper is contributed to the final selection of Google's Coral brand, Edge TPU device. The Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Tiny ML Kit was also considered for comparison but due to initial incompatibilities and in the interest of time to complete this study, a decision was made to review the kit in a future experiment.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a method, VectorPD, for converting a given human face image into a vector portrait sketch. VectorPD supports different levels of abstraction by simply controlling the number of strokes. Since vector graphics are composed of different shape primitives, it is challenging for rendering complex faces to accurately express facial details and structure. To address this, VectorPD employs a novel two-round optimization mechanism. We first initialize the strokes with facial keypoints, and generate a basic portrait sketch by a CLIP-based Semantic Loss. Then we complete the face structure through VGG-based Structure Loss, and propose a novel Crop-based Shadow Loss to enrich the shadow details of the sketch, achieving a visually pleasing portrait sketch. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations both demonstrate that the portrait sketches generated by VectorPD can produce better visual effects than existing state-of-the-art methods, maintaining as much fidelity as possible at different levels of abstraction.

- **Summary**: Concept drift typically refers to the analysis of changes in data distribution. A drift in the input data can have negative consequences on a learning predictor and the system's stability. The majority of concept drift methods emphasize the analysis of statistical changes in non-stationary data over time. In this context, we consider another perspective, where the concept drift also integrates substantial changes in the topological characteristics of the data stream. In this article, we introduce a novel framework for monitoring changes in multi-dimensional data streams. We explore a generalization of the standard concept drift focusing on the changes in the topological characteristics of the data. Our developed approach is based on persistent entropy and topology-preserving projections in a continual learning scenario. The framework operates in both unsupervised and supervised environments. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework, we analyze the model across three scenarios using data streams generated with MNIST samples. The obtained results reveal the potential of applying topological data analysis for shift detection and encourage further research in this area.

- **Summary**: Significant advancements in image generation have been made with diffusion models. Nevertheless, when contrasted with previous generative models, diffusion models face substantial computational overhead, leading to failure in real-time generation. Recent approaches have aimed to accelerate diffusion models by reducing the number of sampling steps through improved sampling techniques or step distillation. However, the methods to diminish the computational cost for each timestep remain a relatively unexplored area. Observing the fact that diffusion models exhibit varying input distributions and feature distributions at different timesteps, we introduce one-to-many knowledge distillation (O2MKD), which distills a single teacher diffusion model into multiple student diffusion models, where each student diffusion model is trained to learn the teacher's knowledge for a subset of continuous timesteps. Experiments on CIFAR10, LSUN Church, CelebA-HQ with DDPM and COCO30K with Stable Diffusion show that O2MKD can be applied to previous knowledge distillation and fast sampling methods to achieve significant acceleration. Codes will be released in Github.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces Idempotent Test-Time Training (IT$^3$), a novel approach to addressing the challenge of distribution shift. While supervised-learning methods assume matching train and test distributions, this is rarely the case for machine learning systems deployed in the real world. Test-Time Training (TTT) approaches address this by adapting models during inference, but they are limited by a domain specific auxiliary task. IT$^3$ is based on the universal property of idempotence. An idempotent operator is one that can be applied sequentially without changing the result beyond the initial application, that is $f(f(x))=f(x)$. At training, the model receives an input $x$ along with another signal that can either be the ground truth label $y$ or a neutral "don't know" signal $0$. At test time, the additional signal can only be $0$. When sequentially applying the model, first predicting $y_0 = f(x, 0)$ and then $y_1 = f(x, y_0)$, the distance between $y_0$ and $y_1$ measures certainty and indicates out-of-distribution input $x$ if high. We use this distance, that can be expressed as $||f(x, f(x, 0)) - f(x, 0)||$ as our TTT loss during inference. By carefully optimizing this objective, we effectively train $f(x,\cdot)$ to be idempotent, projecting the internal representation of the input onto the training distribution. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach across various tasks, including corrupted image classification, aerodynamic predictions, tabular data with missing information, age prediction from face, and large-scale aerial photo segmentation. Moreover, these tasks span different architectures such as MLPs, CNNs, and GNNs.

- **Summary**: Image manipulation is rapidly evolving, allowing the creation of credible content that can be used to bend reality. Although the results of deepfake detectors are promising, deepfakes can be made even more complicated to detect through adversarial attacks. They aim to further manipulate the image to camouflage deepfakes' artifacts or to insert signals making the image appear pristine. In this paper, we further explore the potential of super-resolution attacks based on different super-resolution techniques and with different scales that can impact the performance of deepfake detectors with more or less intensity. We also evaluated the impact of the attack on more diverse datasets discovering that the super-resolution process is effective in hiding the artifacts introduced by deepfake generation models but fails in hiding the traces contained in fully synthetic images. Finally, we propose some changes to the detectors' training process to improve their robustness to this kind of attack.

- **Summary**: We present TANGO, a framework for generating co-speech body-gesture videos. Given a few-minute, single-speaker reference video and target speech audio, TANGO produces high-fidelity videos with synchronized body gestures. TANGO builds on Gesture Video Reenactment (GVR), which splits and retrieves video clips using a directed graph structure - representing video frames as nodes and valid transitions as edges. We address two key limitations of GVR: audio-motion misalignment and visual artifacts in GAN-generated transition frames. In particular, (i) we propose retrieving gestures using latent feature distance to improve cross-modal alignment. To ensure the latent features could effectively model the relationship between speech audio and gesture motion, we implement a hierarchical joint embedding space (AuMoCLIP); (ii) we introduce the diffusion-based model to generate high-quality transition frames. Our diffusion model, Appearance Consistent Interpolation (ACInterp), is built upon AnimateAnyone and includes a reference motion module and homography background flow to preserve appearance consistency between generated and reference videos. By integrating these components into the graph-based retrieval framework, TANGO reliably produces realistic, audio-synchronized videos and outperforms all existing generative and retrieval methods.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have been achieving excellent performance for real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) with considerable computational costs. Current approaches are trying to derive one-step diffusion models from multi-step counterparts through knowledge distillation. However, these methods incur substantial training costs and may constrain the performance of the student model by the teacher's limitations. To tackle these issues, we propose DFOSD, a Distillation-Free One-Step Diffusion model. Specifically, we propose a noise-aware discriminator (NAD) to participate in adversarial training, further enhancing the authenticity of the generated content. Additionally, we improve the perceptual loss with edge-aware DISTS (EA-DISTS) to enhance the model's ability to generate fine details. Our experiments demonstrate that, compared with previous diffusion-based methods requiring dozens or even hundreds of steps, our DFOSD attains comparable or even superior results in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations. Our DFOSD also abtains higher performance and efficiency compared with other one-step diffusion methods. We will release code and models at \url{https://github.com/JianzeLi-114/DFOSD}.

- **Summary**: This paper presents the Video Super-Resolution (SR) Quality Assessment (QA) Challenge that was part of the Advances in Image Manipulation (AIM) workshop, held in conjunction with ECCV 2024. The task of this challenge was to develop an objective QA method for videos upscaled 2x and 4x by modern image- and video-SR algorithms. QA methods were evaluated by comparing their output with aggregate subjective scores collected from >150,000 pairwise votes obtained through crowd-sourced comparisons across 52 SR methods and 1124 upscaled videos. The goal was to advance the state-of-the-art in SR QA, which had proven to be a challenging problem with limited applicability of traditional QA methods. The challenge had 29 registered participants, and 5 teams had submitted their final results, all outperforming the current state-of-the-art. All data, including the private test subset, has been made publicly available on the challenge homepage at https://challenges.videoprocessing.ai/challenges/super-resolution-metrics-challenge.html

- **Summary**: Automatic annotation of large-scale datasets can introduce noisy training data labels, which adversely affect the learning process of deep neural networks (DNNs). Consequently, Noisy Labels Learning (NLL) has become a critical research field for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), though it remains less explored for Vision Transformers (ViTs). In this study, we evaluate the vulnerability of ViT fine-tuning to noisy labels and compare its robustness with CNNs. We also investigate whether NLL methods developed for CNNs are equally effective for ViTs. Using linear probing and MLP-K fine-tuning, we benchmark two ViT backbones (ViT-B/16 and ViT-L/16) using three commonly used classification losses: Cross Entropy (CE), Focal Loss (FL), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), alongside six robust NLL methods: GCE, SCE, NLNL, APL, NCE+AGCE, and ANL-CE. The evaluation is conducted across six datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, WebVision, Clothing1M, and Food-101N. Furthermore, we explore whether implicit prediction entropy minimization contributes to ViT robustness against noisy labels, noting a general trend of prediction entropy reduction across most NLL methods. Building on this observation, we examine whether explicit entropy minimization could enhance ViT resilience to noisy labels. Our findings indicate that incorporating entropy regularization enhances the performance of established loss functions such as CE and FL, as well as the robustness of the six studied NLL methods across both ViT backbones.

- **Summary**: Accurate anomaly detection is critical in vision-based infrastructure inspection, where it helps prevent costly failures and enhances safety. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) offers a promising approach by learning robust representations from unlabeled data. However, its application in anomaly detection remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive evaluation of SSL methods for real-world anomaly detection, focusing on sewer infrastructure. Using the Sewer-ML dataset, we evaluate lightweight models such as ViT-Tiny and ResNet-18 across SSL frameworks, including BYOL, Barlow Twins, SimCLR, DINO, and MAE, under varying class imbalance levels. Through 250 experiments, we rigorously assess the performance of these SSL methods to ensure a robust and comprehensive evaluation. Our findings highlight the superiority of joint-embedding methods like SimCLR and Barlow Twins over reconstruction-based approaches such as MAE, which struggle to maintain performance under class imbalance. Furthermore, we find that the SSL model choice is more critical than the backbone architecture. Additionally, we emphasize the need for better label-free assessments of SSL representations, as current methods like RankMe fail to adequately evaluate representation quality, making cross-validation without labels infeasible. Despite the remaining performance gap between SSL and supervised models, these findings highlight the potential of SSL to enhance anomaly detection, paving the way for further research in this underexplored area of SSL applications.

- **Summary**: Due to the difficulty of replicating the real conditions during training, supervised algorithms for spacecraft pose estimation experience a drop in performance when trained on synthetic data and applied to real operational data. To address this issue, we propose a test-time adaptation approach that leverages the temporal redundancy between images acquired during close proximity operations. Our approach involves extracting features from sequential spacecraft images, estimating their poses, and then using this information to synthesise a reconstructed view. We establish a self-supervised learning objective by comparing the synthesised view with the actual one. During training, we supervise both pose estimation and image synthesis, while at test-time, we optimise the self-supervised objective. Additionally, we introduce a regularisation loss to prevent solutions that are not consistent with the keypoint structure of the spacecraft.
