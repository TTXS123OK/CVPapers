- **Summary**: Reconstructing 3D face models from a single image is an inherently ill-posed problem, which becomes even more challenging in the presence of occlusions. In addition to fewer available observations, occlusions introduce an extra source of ambiguity, where multiple reconstructions can be equally valid. Despite the ubiquity of the problem, very few methods address its multi-hypothesis nature. In this paper we introduce OFER, a novel approach for single image 3D face reconstruction that can generate plausible, diverse, and expressive 3D faces, even under strong occlusions. Specifically, we train two diffusion models to generate the shape and expression coefficients of a face parametric model, conditioned on the input image. This approach captures the multi-modal nature of the problem, generating a distribution of solutions as output. Although this addresses the ambiguity problem, the challenge remains to pick the best matching shape to ensure consistency across diverse expressions. To achieve this, we propose a novel ranking mechanism that sorts the outputs of the shape diffusion network based on the predicted shape accuracy scores to select the best match. We evaluate our method using standard benchmarks and introduce CO-545, a new protocol and dataset designed to assess the accuracy of expressive faces under occlusion. Our results show improved performance over occlusion-based methods, with added ability to generate multiple expressions for a given image.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in generative modeling with diffusion processes (DPs) enabled breakthroughs in image synthesis. Despite impressive image quality, these models have various prompt compliance problems, including low recall in generating multiple objects, difficulty in generating text in images, and meeting constraints like object locations and pose. For fine-grained editing and manipulation, they also require fine-grained semantic or instance maps that are tedious to produce manually. While prompt compliance can be enhanced by addition of loss functions at inference, this is time consuming and does not scale to complex scenes. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a new family of \textit{Factor Graph Diffusion Models} (FG-DMs) that models the joint distribution of images and conditioning variables, such as semantic, sketch, depth or normal maps via a factor graph decomposition. This joint structure has several advantages, including support for efficient sampling based prompt compliance schemes, which produce images of high object recall, semi-automated fine-grained editing, text-based editing of conditions with noise inversion, explainability at intermediate levels, ability to produce labeled datasets for the training of downstream models such as segmentation or depth, training with missing data, and continual learning where new conditioning variables can be added with minimal or no modifications to the existing structure. We propose an implementation of FG-DMs by adapting a pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) model to implement all FG-DM factors, using only COCO dataset, and show that it is effective in generating images with 15\% higher recall than SD while retaining its generalization ability. We introduce an attention distillation loss that encourages consistency among the attention maps of all factors, improving the fidelity of the generated conditions and image.

- **Summary**: In this work, we extract the optical flow field corresponding to moving objects from an image sequence of a scene impacted by atmospheric turbulence \emph{and} captured from a moving camera. Our procedure first computes the optical flow field and creates a motion model to compensate for the flow field induced by camera motion. After subtracting the motion model from the optical flow, we proceed with our previous work, Gilles et al~\cite{gilles2018detection}, where a spatial-temporal cartoon+texture inspired decomposition is performed on the motion-compensated flow field in order to separate flows corresponding to atmospheric turbulence and object motion. Finally, the geometric component is processed with the detection and tracking method and is compared against a ground truth. All of the sequences and code used in this work are open source and are available by contacting the authors.

- **Summary**: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have proven effective in various tasks including image, shape, audio, and video reconstruction. These INRs typically learn the implicit field from sampled input points. This is often done using a single network for the entire domain, imposing many global constraints on a single function. In this paper, we propose a mixture of experts (MoE) implicit neural representation approach that enables learning local piece-wise continuous functions that simultaneously learns to subdivide the domain and fit locally. We show that incorporating a mixture of experts architecture into existing INR formulations provides a boost in speed, accuracy, and memory requirements. Additionally, we introduce novel conditioning and pretraining methods for the gating network that improves convergence to the desired solution. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on multiple reconstruction tasks, including surface reconstruction, image reconstruction, and audio signal reconstruction and show improved performance compared to non-MoE methods.

- **Summary**: The deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) in computer vision has given promising results. It is widely applied in many areas, from medicine, agriculture, self-driving car, biometric system, and almost all computer vision-based applications. Filters or weights are the critical elements responsible for learning in DCNN. Backpropagation has been the primary learning algorithm for DCNN and provides promising results, but the size and numbers of the filters remain hyper-parameters. Various studies have been done in the last decade on semi-supervised, self-supervised, and unsupervised methods and their properties. The effects of filter initialization, size-shape selection, and the number of filters on learning and optimization have not been investigated in a separate publication to collate all the options. Such attributes are often treated as hyper-parameters and lack mathematical understanding. Computer vision algorithms have many limitations in real-life applications, and understanding the learning process is essential to have some significant improvement. To the best of our knowledge, no separate investigation has been published discussing the filters; this is our primary motivation. This study focuses on arguments for choosing specific physical parameters of filters, initialization, and learning technic over scattered methods. The promising unsupervised approaches have been evaluated. Additionally, the limitations, current challenges, and future scope have been discussed in this paper.

- **Summary**: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), which encode signals such as images, videos, and 3D shapes in the weights of neural networks, are becoming increasingly popular. Among their many applications is signal compression, for which there is great interest in achieving the highest possible fidelity to the original signal subject to constraints such as neural network size, training (encoding) and inference (decoding) time. But training INRs can be a computationally expensive process, making it challenging to determine the best possible tradeoff under such constraints. Towards this goal, we present a method which predicts the encoding error that a popular INR network (SIREN) will reach, given its network hyperparameters and the signal to encode. This method is trained on a unique dataset of 300,000 SIRENs, trained across a variety of images and hyperparameters. (Dataset available here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/predict-SIREN-PSNR/COIN-collection.) Our predictive method demonstrates the feasibility of this regression problem, and allows users to anticipate the encoding error that a SIREN network will reach in milliseconds instead of minutes or longer. We also provide insights into the behavior of SIREN networks, such as why narrow SIRENs can have very high random variation in encoding error, and how the performance of SIRENs relates to JPEG compression.

- **Summary**: Several recent studies have demonstrated that deep-learning based image generation models, such as GANs, can be uniquely identified, and possibly even reverse-engineered, by the fingerprints they leave on their output images. We extend this research to single image super-resolution (SISR) networks. Compared to previously studied models, SISR networks are a uniquely challenging class of image generation model from which to extract and analyze fingerprints, as they can often generate images that closely match the corresponding ground truth and thus likely leave little flexibility to embed signatures. We take SISR models as examples to investigate if the findings from the previous work on fingerprints of GAN-based networks are valid for general image generation models. We show that SISR networks with a high upscaling factor or trained using adversarial loss leave highly distinctive fingerprints, and that under certain conditions, some SISR network hyperparameters can be reverse-engineered from these fingerprints.

- **Summary**: In public safety and social life, the task of Clothes-Changing Person Re-Identification (CC-ReID) has become increasingly significant. However, this task faces considerable challenges due to appearance changes caused by clothing alterations. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes an innovative method for disentangled feature extraction, effectively extracting discriminative features from pedestrian images that are invariant to clothing. This method leverages pedestrian parsing techniques to identify and retain features closely associated with individual identity while disregarding the variable nature of clothing attributes. Furthermore, this study introduces a gated channel attention mechanism, which, by adjusting the network's focus, aids the model in more effectively learning and emphasizing features critical for pedestrian identity recognition. Extensive experiments conducted on two standard CC-ReID datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with performance surpassing current leading solutions. The Top-1 accuracy under clothing change scenarios on the PRCC and VC-Clothes datasets reached 64.8% and 83.7%, respectively.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we identify and leverage a novel `bright ending' (BE) anomaly in diffusion models prone to memorizing training images to address a new task: locating localized memorization regions within these models. BE refers to a distinct cross-attention pattern observed in text-to-image generations using diffusion models. Specifically, memorized image patches exhibit significantly greater attention to the end token during the final inference step compared to non-memorized patches. This attention map effectively highlights regions where the generated image replicates training data. Furthermore, driven by our observation that local memorization significantly underperforms in existing tasks of measuring, detecting, and mitigating memorization in diffusion models compared to global memorization, we propose a simple yet effective method to integrate BE and the results of the new localization task into these existing frameworks. This integration effectively improves their performances by narrowing the performance gap caused by local memorization. Our results not only demonstrate the successful execution of the new localization task but also establish new state-of-the-art performance across all existing tasks, underscoring the significance of the BE phenomenon.

- **Summary**: Vehicle re-identification (Vehicle ReID) aims at retrieving vehicle images across disjoint surveillance camera views. The majority of vehicle ReID research is heavily reliant upon supervisory labels from specific human-collected datasets for training. When applied to the large-scale real-world scenario, these models will experience dreadful performance declines due to the notable domain discrepancy between the source dataset and the target. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised vehicle ReID framework (MGR-GCL). It integrates a multi-granularity CNN representation for learning discriminative transferable features and a contrastive learning module responsible for efficient domain adaptation in the unlabeled target domain. Specifically, after training the proposed Multi-Granularity Representation (MGR) on the labeled source dataset, we propose a group contrastive learning module (GCL) to generate pseudo labels for the target dataset, facilitating the domain adaptation process. We conducted extensive experiments and the results demonstrated our superiority against existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models, widely used for image and video generation, face a significant limitation: the risk of memorizing and reproducing training data during inference, potentially generating unauthorized copyrighted content. While prior research has focused on image diffusion models (IDMs), video diffusion models (VDMs) remain underexplored. To address this gap, we first formally define the two types of memorization in VDMs (content memorization and motion memorization) in a practical way that focuses on privacy preservation and applies to all generation types. We then introduce new metrics specifically designed to separately assess content and motion memorization in VDMs. Additionally, we curate a dataset of text prompts that are most prone to triggering memorization when used as conditioning in VDMs. By leveraging these prompts, we generate diverse videos from various open-source VDMs, successfully extracting numerous training videos from each tested model. Through the application of our proposed metrics, we systematically analyze memorization across various pretrained VDMs, including text-conditional and unconditional models, on a variety of datasets. Our comprehensive study reveals that memorization is widespread across all tested VDMs, indicating that VDMs can also memorize image training data in addition to video datasets. Finally, we propose efficient and effective detection strategies for both content and motion memorization, offering a foundational approach for improving privacy in VDMs.

- **Summary**: Different from the traditional semi-supervised learning paradigm that is constrained by the close-world assumption, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) presumes that the unlabeled dataset contains new categories not appearing in the labeled set, and aims to not only classify old categories but also discover new categories in the unlabeled data. Existing studies on GCD typically devote to transferring the general knowledge from the self-supervised pretrained model to the target GCD task via some fine-tuning strategies, such as partial tuning and prompt learning. Nevertheless, these fine-tuning methods fail to make a sound balance between the generalization capacity of pretrained backbone and the adaptability to the GCD task. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel adapter-tuning-based method named AdaptGCD, which is the first work to introduce the adapter tuning into the GCD task and provides some key insights expected to enlighten future research. Furthermore, considering the discrepancy of supervision information between the old and new classes, a multi-expert adapter structure equipped with a route assignment constraint is elaborately devised, such that the data from old and new classes are separated into different expert groups. Extensive experiments are conducted on 7 widely-used datasets. The remarkable improvements in performance highlight the effectiveness of our proposals.



### Unsupervised Modality Adaptation with Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Semantic Segmentation

- **Summary**: Despite their success, unsupervised domain adaptation methods for semantic segmentation primarily focus on adaptation between image domains and do not utilize other abundant visual modalities like depth, infrared and event. This limitation hinders their performance and restricts their application in real-world multimodal scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Modality Adaptation with text-to-image Diffusion Models (MADM) for semantic segmentation task which utilizes text-to-image diffusion models pre-trained on extensive image-text pairs to enhance the model's cross-modality capabilities. Specifically, MADM comprises two key complementary components to tackle major challenges. First, due to the large modality gap, using one modal data to generate pseudo labels for another modality suffers from a significant drop in accuracy. To address this, MADM designs diffusion-based pseudo-label generation which adds latent noise to stabilize pseudo-labels and enhance label accuracy. Second, to overcome the limitations of latent low-resolution features in diffusion models, MADM introduces the label palette and latent regression which converts one-hot encoded labels into the RGB form by palette and regresses them in the latent space, thus ensuring the pre-trained decoder for up-sampling to obtain fine-grained features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MADM achieves state-of-the-art adaptation performance across various modality tasks, including images to depth, infrared, and event modalities. We open-source our code and models at https://github.com/XiaRho/MADM.

- **Summary**: To prevent unauthorized use of text in images, Scene Text Removal (STR) has become a crucial task. It focuses on automatically removing text and replacing it with a natural, text-less background while preserving significant details such as texture, color, and contrast. Despite its importance in privacy protection, STR faces several challenges, including boundary artifacts, inconsistent texture and color, and preserving correct shadows. Most STR approaches estimate a text region mask to train a model, solving for image translation or inpainting to generate a text-free image. Thus, the quality of the generated image depends on the accuracy of the inpainting mask and the generator's capability. In this work, we leverage the superior capabilities of diffusion models in generating high-quality, consistent images to address the STR problem. We introduce a ControlNet diffusion model, treating STR as an inpainting task. To enhance the model's robustness, we develop a mask pretraining pipeline to condition our diffusion model. This involves training a masked autoencoder (MAE) using a combination of box masks and coarse stroke masks, and fine-tuning it using masks derived from our novel segmentation-based mask refinement framework. This framework iteratively refines an initial mask and segments it using the SLIC and Hierarchical Feature Selection (HFS) algorithms to produce an accurate final text mask. This improves mask prediction and utilizes rich textural information in natural scene images to provide accurate inpainting masks. Experiments on the SCUT-EnsText and SCUT-Syn datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing accurate 3D surfaces for street-view scenarios is crucial for applications such as digital entertainment and autonomous driving simulation. However, existing street-view datasets, including KITTI, Waymo, and nuScenes, only offer noisy LiDAR points as ground-truth data for geometric evaluation of reconstructed surfaces. These geometric ground-truths often lack the necessary precision to evaluate surface positions and do not provide data for assessing surface normals. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the SS3DM dataset, comprising precise \textbf{S}ynthetic \textbf{S}treet-view \textbf{3D} \textbf{M}esh models exported from the CARLA simulator. These mesh models facilitate accurate position evaluation and include normal vectors for evaluating surface normal. To simulate the input data in realistic driving scenarios for 3D reconstruction, we virtually drive a vehicle equipped with six RGB cameras and five LiDAR sensors in diverse outdoor scenes. Leveraging this dataset, we establish a benchmark for state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the associated challenges.

- **Summary**: Event cameras, with high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, have limited research on the inter-modality local feature extraction and matching of event-image data. We propose EI-Nexus, an unmediated and flexible framework that integrates two modality-specific keypoint extractors and a feature matcher. To achieve keypoint extraction across viewpoint and modality changes, we bring Local Feature Distillation (LFD), which transfers the viewpoint consistency from a well-learned image extractor to the event extractor, ensuring robust feature correspondence. Furthermore, with the help of Context Aggregation (CA), a remarkable enhancement is observed in feature matching. We further establish the first two inter-modality feature matching benchmarks, MVSEC-RPE and EC-RPE, to assess relative pose estimation on event-image data. Our approach outperforms traditional methods that rely on explicit modal transformation, offering more unmediated and adaptable feature extraction and matching, achieving better keypoint similarity and state-of-the-art results on the MVSEC-RPE and EC-RPE benchmarks. The source code and benchmarks will be made publicly available at https://github.com/ZhonghuaYi/EI-Nexus_official.

- **Summary**: Generating lifelike human motions from descriptive texts has experienced remarkable research focus in the recent years, propelled by the emerging requirements of digital humans.Despite impressive advances, existing approaches are often constrained by limited control modalities, task specificity, and focus solely on body motion representations.In this paper, we present MotionGPT-2, a unified Large Motion-Language Model (LMLM) that addresses these limitations. MotionGPT-2 accommodates multiple motion-relevant tasks and supporting multimodal control conditions through pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). It quantizes multimodal inputs-such as text and single-frame poses-into discrete, LLM-interpretable tokens, seamlessly integrating them into the LLM's vocabulary. These tokens are then organized into unified prompts, guiding the LLM to generate motion outputs through a pretraining-then-finetuning paradigm. We also show that the proposed MotionGPT-2 is highly adaptable to the challenging 3D holistic motion generation task, enabled by the innovative motion discretization framework, Part-Aware VQVAE, which ensures fine-grained representations of body and hand movements. Extensive experiments and visualizations validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating the adaptability of MotionGPT-2 across motion generation, motion captioning, and generalized motion completion tasks.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in deep learning have improved 3D point cloud registration but increased graphics processing unit (GPU) memory usage, often requiring preliminary sampling that reduces accuracy. We propose an overlapping region sampling method to reduce memory usage while maintaining accuracy. Our approach estimates the overlapping region and intensively samples from it, using a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) based point compression mechanism with multi layer perceptron (MLP) and transformer architectures. Evaluations on 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch datasets show our method outperforms other sampling methods in registration recall, especially at lower GPU memory levels. For 3DMatch, we achieve 94% recall with 33% reduced memory usage, with greater advantages in 3DLoMatch. Our method enables efficient large-scale point cloud registration in resource-constrained environments, maintaining high accuracy while significantly reducing memory requirements.

- **Summary**: This work proposes DOFS, a pilot dataset of 3D deformable objects (DOs) (e.g., elasto-plastic objects) with full spatial information (i.e., top, side, and bottom information) using a novel and low-cost data collection platform with a transparent operating plane. The dataset consists of active manipulation action, multi-view RGB-D images, well-registered point clouds, 3D deformed mesh, and 3D occupancy with semantics, using a pinching strategy with a two-parallel-finger gripper. In addition, we trained a neural network with the down-sampled 3D occupancy and action as input to model the dynamics of an elasto-plastic object.

- **Summary**: Fine-tuning large-scale text-to-image diffusion models for various downstream tasks has yielded impressive results. However, the heavy computational burdens of tuning large models prevent personal customization. Recent advances have attempted to employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to adapt the floating-point (FP) or quantized pre-trained weights. Nonetheless, the adaptation parameters in existing works are still restricted to FP arithmetic, hindering hardware-friendly acceleration. In this work, we propose IntLoRA, to further push the efficiency limits by using integer type (INT) low-rank parameters to adapt the quantized diffusion models. By working in the integer arithmetic, our IntLoRA offers three key advantages: (i) for fine-tuning, the pre-trained weights are quantized, reducing memory usage; (ii) for storage, both pre-trained and low-rank weights are in INT which consumes less disk space; (iii) for inference, IntLoRA weights can be naturally merged into quantized pre-trained weights through efficient integer multiplication or bit-shifting, eliminating additional post-training quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IntLoRA can achieve performance on par with or even superior to the vanilla LoRA, accompanied by significant efficiency improvements.

- **Summary**: Most learned B-frame codecs with hierarchical temporal prediction suffer from the domain shift issue caused by the discrepancy in the Group-of-Pictures (GOP) size used for training and test. As such, the motion estimation network may fail to predict large motion properly. One effective strategy to mitigate this domain shift issue is to downsample video frames for motion estimation. However, finding the optimal downsampling factor involves a time-consuming rate-distortion optimization process. This work introduces lightweight classifiers to determine the downsampling factor. To strike a good rate-distortion-complexity trade-off, our classifiers observe simple state signals, including only the coding and reference frames, to predict the best downsampling factor. We present two variants that adopt binary and multi-class classifiers, respectively. The binary classifier adopts the Focal Loss for training, classifying between motion estimation at high and low resolutions. Our multi-class classifier is trained with novel soft labels incorporating the knowledge of the rate-distortion costs of different downsampling factors. Both variants operate as add-on modules without the need to re-train the B-frame codec. Experimental results confirm that they achieve comparable coding performance to the brute-force search methods while greatly reducing computational complexity.

- **Summary**: Hair editing is a critical image synthesis task that aims to edit hair color and hairstyle using text descriptions or reference images, while preserving irrelevant attributes (e.g., identity, background, cloth). Many existing methods are based on StyleGAN to address this task. However, due to the limited spatial distribution of StyleGAN, it struggles with multiple hair color editing and facial preservation. Considering the advancements in diffusion models, we utilize Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for hairstyle editing. Our approach introduces Multi-stage Hairstyle Blend (MHB), effectively separating control of hair color and hairstyle in diffusion latent space. Additionally, we train a warping module to align the hair color with the target region. To further enhance multi-color hairstyle editing, we fine-tuned a CLIP model using a multi-color hairstyle dataset. Our method not only tackles the complexity of multi-color hairstyles but also addresses the challenge of preserving original colors during diffusion editing. Extensive experiments showcase the superiority of our method in editing multi-color hairstyles while preserving facial attributes given textual descriptions and reference images.

- **Summary**: Due to the impressive zero-shot capabilities, pre-trained vision-language models (e.g. CLIP), have attracted widespread attention and adoption across various domains. Nonetheless, CLIP has been observed to be susceptible to adversarial examples. Through experimental analysis, we have observed a phenomenon wherein adversarial perturbations induce shifts in text-guided attention. Building upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective strategy: Text-Guided Attention for Zero-Shot Robustness (TGA-ZSR). This framework incorporates two components: the Attention Refinement module and the Attention-based Model Constraint module. Our goal is to maintain the generalization of the CLIP model and enhance its adversarial robustness: The Attention Refinement module aligns the text-guided attention obtained from the target model via adversarial examples with the text-guided attention acquired from the original model via clean examples. This alignment enhances the model's robustness. Additionally, the Attention-based Model Constraint module acquires text-guided attention from both the target and original models using clean examples. Its objective is to maintain model performance on clean samples while enhancing overall robustness. The experiments validate that our method yields a 9.58% enhancement in zero-shot robust accuracy over the current state-of-the-art techniques across 16 datasets.

- **Summary**: Multi-task learning (MTL) leverages a shared model to accomplish multiple tasks and facilitate knowledge transfer. Recent research on task arithmetic-based MTL demonstrates that merging the parameters of independently fine-tuned models can effectively achieve MTL. However, existing merging methods primarily seek a static optimal solution within the original model parameter space, which often results in performance degradation due to the inherent diversity among tasks and potential interferences. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a Weight-Ensembling Mixture of Experts (WEMoE) method for multi-task model merging. Specifically, we first identify critical (or sensitive) modules by analyzing parameter variations in core modules of Transformer-based models before and after finetuning. Then, our WEMoE statically merges non-critical modules while transforming critical modules into a mixture-of-experts (MoE) structure. During inference, expert modules in the MoE are dynamically merged based on input samples, enabling a more flexible and adaptive merging approach. Building on WEMoE, we further introduce an efficient-and-effective WEMoE (E-WEMoE) method, whose core mechanism involves eliminating non-essential elements in the critical modules of WEMoE and implementing shared routing across multiple MoE modules, thereby significantly reducing both the trainable parameters, the overall parameter count, and computational overhead of the merged model by WEMoE. Experimental results across various architectures and tasks demonstrate that both WEMoE and E-WEMoE outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) model merging methods in terms of MTL performance, generalization, and robustness.

- **Summary**: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify both base and novel images using labeled base data. However, current approaches inadequately address the intrinsic optimization of the co-occurrence matrix $\bar{A}$ based on cosine similarity, failing to achieve zero base-novel regions and adequate sparsity in base and novel domains. To address these deficiencies, we propose a Non-Negative Generalized Category Discovery (NN-GCD) framework. It employs Symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SNMF) as a mathematical medium to prove the equivalence of optimal K-means with optimal SNMF, and the equivalence of SNMF solver with non-negative contrastive learning (NCL) optimization. Utilizing these theoretical equivalences, it reframes the optimization of $\bar{A}$ and K-means clustering as an NCL optimization problem. Moreover, to satisfy the non-negative constraints and make a GCD model converge to a near-optimal region, we propose a GELU activation function and an NMF NCE loss. To transition $\bar{A}$ from a suboptimal state to the desired $\bar{A}^*$, we introduce a hybrid sparse regularization approach to impose sparsity constraints. Experimental results show NN-GCD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on GCD benchmarks, achieving an average accuracy of 66.1\% on the Semantic Shift Benchmark, surpassing prior counterparts by 4.7\%.

- **Summary**: Laryngo-pharyngeal cancer (LPC) is a highly lethal malignancy in the head and neck region. Recent advancements in tumor detection, particularly through dual-branch network architectures, have significantly improved diagnostic accuracy by integrating global and local feature extraction. However, challenges remain in accurately localizing lesions and fully capitalizing on the complementary nature of features within these branches. To address these issues, we propose SAM-Swin, an innovative SAM-driven Dual-Swin Transformer for laryngo-pharyngeal tumor detection. This model leverages the robust segmentation capabilities of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to achieve precise lesion segmentation. Meanwhile, we present a multi-scale lesion-aware enhancement module (MS-LAEM) designed to adaptively enhance the learning of nuanced complementary features across various scales, improving the quality of feature extraction and representation. Furthermore, we implement a multi-scale class-aware guidance (CAG) loss that delivers multi-scale targeted supervision, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to extract class-specific features. To validate our approach, we compiled three LPC datasets from the First Affiliated Hospital (FAHSYSU), the Sixth Affiliated Hospital (SAHSYSU) of Sun Yat-sen University, and Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University (NHSMU). The FAHSYSU dataset is utilized for internal training, while the SAHSYSU and NHSMU datasets serve for external evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAM-Swin outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its potential for advancing LPC detection and improving patient outcomes.

- **Summary**: The debate between self-interpretable models and post-hoc explanations for black-box models is central to Explainable AI (XAI). Self-interpretable models, such as concept-based networks, offer insights by connecting decisions to human-understandable concepts but often struggle with performance and scalability. Conversely, post-hoc methods like Shapley values, while theoretically robust, are computationally expensive and resource-intensive. To bridge the gap between these two lines of research, we propose a novel method that combines their strengths, providing theoretically guaranteed self-interpretability for black-box models without compromising prediction accuracy. Specifically, we introduce a parameter-efficient pipeline, *AutoGnothi*, which integrates a small side network into the black-box model, allowing it to generate Shapley value explanations without changing the original network parameters. This side-tuning approach significantly reduces memory, training, and inference costs, outperforming traditional parameter-efficient methods, where full fine-tuning serves as the optimal baseline. *AutoGnothi* enables the black-box model to predict and explain its predictions with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments show that *AutoGnothi* offers accurate explanations for both vision and language tasks, delivering superior computational efficiency with comparable interpretability.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often struggle to generate rare compositions of concepts, e.g., objects with unusual attributes. In this paper, we show that the compositional generation power of diffusion models on such rare concepts can be significantly enhanced by the Large Language Model (LLM) guidance. We start with empirical and theoretical analysis, demonstrating that exposing frequent concepts relevant to the target rare concepts during the diffusion sampling process yields more accurate concept composition. Based on this, we propose a training-free approach, R2F, that plans and executes the overall rare-to-frequent concept guidance throughout the diffusion inference by leveraging the abundant semantic knowledge in LLMs. Our framework is flexible across any pre-trained diffusion models and LLMs, and can be seamlessly integrated with the region-guided diffusion approaches. Extensive experiments on three datasets, including our newly proposed benchmark, RareBench, containing various prompts with rare compositions of concepts, R2F significantly surpasses existing models including SD3.0 and FLUX by up to 28.1%p in T2I alignment.

- **Summary**: Brain tumor detection in multiplane Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) slices is a challenging task due to the various appearances and relationships in the structure of the multiplane images. In this paper, we propose a new You Only Look Once (YOLO)-based detection model that incorporates Pretrained Knowledge (PK), called PK-YOLO, to improve the performance for brain tumor detection in multiplane MRI slices. To our best knowledge, PK-YOLO is the first pretrained knowledge guided YOLO-based object detector. The main components of the new method are a pretrained pure lightweight convolutional neural network-based backbone via sparse masked modeling, a YOLO architecture with the pretrained backbone, and a regression loss function for improving small object detection. The pretrained backbone allows for feature transferability of object queries on individual plane MRI slices into the model encoders, and the learned domain knowledge base can improve in-domain detection. The improved loss function can further boost detection performance on small-size brain tumors in multiplanar two-dimensional MRI slices. Experimental results show that the proposed PK-YOLO achieves competitive performance on the multiplanar MRI brain tumor detection datasets compared to state-of-the-art YOLO-like and DETR-like object detectors.

- **Summary**: Spatial control methods using additional modules on pretrained diffusion models have gained attention for enabling conditional generation in natural images. These methods guide the generation process with new conditions while leveraging the capabilities of large models. They could be beneficial as training strategies in the context of 3D medical imaging, where training a diffusion model from scratch is challenging due to high computational costs and data scarcity. However, the potential application of spatial control methods with additional modules to 3D medical images has not yet been explored. In this paper, we present a tailored spatial control method for 3D medical images with a novel lightweight module, Volumetric Conditioning Module (VCM). Our VCM employs an asymmetric U-Net architecture to effectively encode complex information from various levels of 3D conditions, providing detailed guidance in image synthesis. To examine the applicability of spatial control methods and the effectiveness of VCM for 3D medical data, we conduct experiments under single- and multimodal conditions scenarios across a wide range of dataset sizes, from extremely small datasets with 10 samples to large datasets with 500 samples. The experimental results show that the VCM is effective for conditional generation and efficient in terms of requiring less training data and computational resources. We further investigate the potential applications for our spatial control method through axial super-resolution for medical images. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/Ahn-Ssu/VCM}

- **Summary**: Accurate survival prediction in head and neck cancer (HNC) is essential for guiding clinical decision-making and optimizing treatment strategies. Traditional models, such as Cox proportional hazards, have been widely used but are limited in their ability to handle complex multi-modal data. This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach leveraging CT and PET imaging modalities to predict survival outcomes in HNC patients. Our method integrates feature extraction with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and a multi-modal data fusion layer that combines imaging data to generate a compact feature representation. The final prediction is achieved through a fully parametric discrete-time survival model, allowing for flexible hazard functions that overcome the limitations of traditional survival models. We evaluated our approach using the HECKTOR and HEAD-NECK-RADIOMICS- HN1 datasets, demonstrating its superior performance compared to conconventional statistical and machine learning models. The results indicate that our deep learning model significantly improves survival prediction accuracy, offering a robust tool for personalized treatment planning in HNC

- **Summary**: The Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) task requires the agent to navigate to a specified target in an unseen environment. Since the environment layout is unknown, the agent needs to perform semantic reasoning to infer the potential location of the target, based on its accumulated memory of the environment during the navigation process. Diffusion models have been shown to be able to learn the distribution relationships between features in RGB images, and thus generate new realistic images.In this work, we propose a new approach to solving the ObjectNav task, by training a diffusion model to learn the statistical distribution patterns of objects in semantic maps, and using the map of the explored regions during navigation as the condition to generate the map of the unknown regions, thereby realizing the semantic reasoning of the target object, i.e., diffusion as reasoning (DAR). Meanwhile, we propose the global target bias and local LLM bias methods, where the former can constrain the diffusion model to generate the target object more effectively, and the latter utilizes the common sense knowledge extracted from the LLM to improve the generalization of the reasoning process. Based on the generated map in the unknown region, the agent sets the predicted location of the target as the goal and moves towards it. Experiments on Gibson and MP3D show the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Point Cloud Registration (PCR) is a fundamental and significant issue in photogrammetry and remote sensing, aiming to seek the optimal rigid transformation between sets of points. Achieving efficient and precise PCR poses a considerable challenge. We propose a novel micro-structures graph-based global point cloud registration method. The overall method is comprised of two stages. 1) Coarse registration (CR): We develop a graph incorporating micro-structures, employing an efficient graph-based hierarchical strategy to remove outliers for obtaining the maximal consensus set. We propose a robust GNC-Welsch estimator for optimization derived from a robust estimator to the outlier process in the Lie algebra space, achieving fast and robust alignment. 2) Fine registration (FR): To refine local alignment further, we use the octree approach to adaptive search plane features in the micro-structures. By minimizing the distance from the point-to-plane, we can obtain a more precise local alignment, and the process will also be addressed effectively by being treated as a planar adjustment algorithm combined with Anderson accelerated optimization (PA-AA). After extensive experiments on real data, our proposed method performs well on the 3DMatch and ETH datasets compared to the most advanced methods, achieving higher accuracy metrics and reducing the time cost by at least one-third.

- **Summary**: Image manipulation detection is to identify the authenticity of each pixel in images. One typical approach to uncover manipulation traces is to model image correlations.   The previous methods commonly adopt the grids, which are fixed-size squares, as graph nodes to model correlations. However, these grids, being independent of image content, struggle to retain local content coherence, resulting in imprecise detection.   To address this issue, we describe a new method named Hierarchical Region-aware Graph Reasoning (HRGR) to enhance image manipulation detection. Unlike existing grid-based methods, we model image correlations based on content-coherence feature regions with irregular shapes, generated by a novel Differentiable Feature Partition strategy. Then we construct a Hierarchical Region-aware Graph based on these regions within and across different feature layers. Subsequently, we describe a structural-agnostic graph reasoning strategy tailored for our graph to enhance the representation of nodes.   Our method is fully differentiable and can seamlessly integrate into mainstream networks in an end-to-end manner, without requiring additional supervision.   Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in image manipulation detection, exhibiting its great potential as a plug-and-play component for existing architectures.

- **Summary**: Early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors is crucial for improving patient survival rates. However, the detection and classification of brain tumors are challenging due to their diverse types and complex morphological characteristics. This study investigates the application of pre-trained models for brain tumor classification, with a particular focus on deploying the Mamba model. We fine-tuned several mainstream transfer learning models and applied them to the multi-class classification of brain tumors. By comparing these models to those trained from scratch, we demonstrated the significant advantages of transfer learning, especially in the medical imaging field, where annotated data is often limited. Notably, we introduced the Vision Mamba (Vim), a novel network architecture, and applied it for the first time in brain tumor classification, achieving exceptional classification accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the Vim model achieved 100% classification accuracy on an independent test set, emphasizing its potential for tumor classification tasks. These findings underscore the effectiveness of transfer learning in brain tumor classification and reveal that, compared to existing state-of-the-art models, the Vim model is lightweight, efficient, and highly accurate, offering a new perspective for clinical applications. Furthermore, the framework proposed in this study for brain tumor classification, based on transfer learning and the Vision Mamba model, is broadly applicable to other medical imaging classification problems.

- **Summary**: Severity level estimation is a crucial task in medical image diagnosis. However, accurately assigning severity class labels to individual images is very costly and challenging. Consequently, the attached labels tend to be noisy. In this paper, we propose a new framework for training with ``ordinal'' noisy labels. Since severity levels have an ordinal relationship, we can leverage this to train a classifier while mitigating the negative effects of noisy labels. Our framework uses two techniques: clean sample selection and dual-network architecture. A technical highlight of our approach is the use of soft labels derived from noisy hard labels. By appropriately using the soft and hard labels in the two techniques, we achieve more accurate sample selection and robust network training. The proposed method outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in experiments using two endoscopic ulcerative colitis (UC) datasets and a retinal Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) dataset.

- **Summary**: The manner in which different racial and gender groups are portrayed in news coverage plays a large role in shaping public opinion. As such, understanding how such groups are portrayed in news media is of notable societal value, and has thus been a significant endeavour in both the computer and social sciences. Yet, the literature still lacks a longitudinal study examining both the frequency of appearance of different racial and gender groups in online news articles, as well as the context in which such groups are discussed. To fill this gap, we propose two machine learning classifiers to detect the race and age of a given subject. Next, we compile a dataset of 123,337 images and 441,321 online news articles from New York Times (NYT) and Fox News (Fox), and examine representation through two computational approaches. Firstly, we examine the frequency and prominence of appearance of racial and gender groups in images embedded in news articles, revealing that racial and gender minorities are largely under-represented, and when they do appear, they are featured less prominently compared to majority groups. Furthermore, we find that NYT largely features more images of racial minority groups compared to Fox. Secondly, we examine both the frequency and context with which racial minority groups are presented in article text. This reveals the narrow scope in which certain racial groups are covered and the frequency with which different groups are presented as victims and/or perpetrators in a given conflict. Taken together, our analysis contributes to the literature by providing two novel open-source classifiers to detect race and age from images, and shedding light on the racial and gender biases in news articles from venues on opposite ends of the American political spectrum.

- **Summary**: Quick and accurate assessment of the damage state of buildings after natural disasters is crucial for undertaking properly targeted rescue and subsequent recovery operations, which can have a major impact on the safety of victims and the cost of disaster recovery. The quality of such a process can be significantly improved by harnessing the potential of machine learning methods in computer vision. This paper presents a novel damage assessment method using an original multi-step feature fusion network for the classification of the damage state of buildings based on pre- and post-disaster large-scale satellite images. We introduce a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) module that performs feature fusion at multiple network levels between pre- and post-disaster images in the horizontal and vertical directions of CNN network. An additional network element - Fuse Module - was proposed to adapt any CNN model to analyze image pairs in the issue of pair classification. We use, open, large-scale datasets (IDA-BD and xView2) to verify, that the proposed method is suitable to improve on existing state-of-the-art architectures. We report over a 3 percentage point increase in the accuracy of the Vision Transformer model.

- **Summary**: Historical ciphered manuscripts are documents that were typically used in sensitive communications within military and diplomatic contexts or among members of secret societies. These secret messages were concealed by inventing a method of writing employing symbols from diverse sources such as digits, alchemy signs and Latin or Greek characters. When studying a new, unseen cipher, the automatic search and grouping of ciphers with a similar alphabet can aid the scholar in its transcription and cryptanalysis because it indicates a probability that the underlying cipher is similar. In this study, we address this need by proposing the CSI metric, a novel way of comparing pairs of ciphered documents. We assess their effectiveness in an unsupervised clustering scenario utilising visual features, including SIFT, pre-trained learnt embeddings, and OCR descriptors.

- **Summary**: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Computed Tomography (CT) are essential for diagnosing, staging, and monitoring various diseases, particularly cancer. Despite their importance, the use of PET/CT systems is limited by the necessity for radioactive materials, the scarcity of PET scanners, and the high cost associated with PET imaging. In contrast, CT scanners are more widely available and significantly less expensive. In response to these challenges, our study addresses the issue of generating PET images from CT images, aiming to reduce both the medical examination cost and the associated health risks for patients. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a conditional diffusion model named CPDM, which, to our knowledge, is one of the initial attempts to employ a diffusion model for translating from CT to PET images. Second, we provide the largest CT-PET dataset to date, comprising 2,028,628 paired CT-PET images, which facilitates the training and evaluation of CT-to-PET translation models. For the CPDM model, we incorporate domain knowledge to develop two conditional maps: the Attention map and the Attenuation map. The former helps the diffusion process focus on areas of interest, while the latter improves PET data correction and ensures accurate diagnostic information. Experimental evaluations across various benchmarks demonstrate that CPDM surpasses existing methods in generating high-quality PET images in terms of multiple metrics.

- **Summary**: Modern person re-identification (Re-ID) methods have a weak generalization ability and experience a major accuracy drop when capturing environments change. This is because existing multi-camera Re-ID datasets are limited in size and diversity, since such data is difficult to obtain. At the same time, enormous volumes of unlabeled single-camera records are available. Such data can be easily collected, and therefore, it is more diverse. Currently, single-camera data is used only for self-supervised pre-training of Re-ID methods. However, the diversity of single-camera data is suppressed by fine-tuning on limited multi-camera data after pre-training. In this paper, we propose ReMix, a generalized Re-ID method jointly trained on a mixture of limited labeled multi-camera and large unlabeled single-camera data. Effective training of our method is achieved through a novel data sampling strategy and new loss functions that are adapted for joint use with both types of data. Experiments show that ReMix has a high generalization ability and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalizable person Re-ID. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores joint training on a mixture of multi-camera and single-camera data in person Re-ID.

- **Summary**: Noise, an unwanted component in an image, can be the reason for the degradation of Image at the time of transmission or capturing. Noise reduction from images is still a challenging task. Digital Image Processing is a component of Digital signal processing. A wide variety of algorithms can be used in image processing to apply to an image or an input dataset and obtain important outcomes. In image processing research, removing noise from images before further analysis is essential. Post-noise removal of images improves clarity, enabling better interpretation and analysis across medical imaging, satellite imagery, and radar applications. While numerous algorithms exist, each comes with its own assumptions, strengths, and limitations. The paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of different filtering techniques on images with eight types of noise. It evaluates methodologies like Wiener, Median, Gaussian, Mean, Low pass, High pass, Laplacian and bilateral filtering, using the performance metric Peak signal to noise ratio. It shows us the impact of different filters on noise models by applying a variety of filters to various kinds of noise. Additionally, it also assists us in determining which filtering strategy is most appropriate for a certain noise model based on the circumstances.

- **Summary**: We propose ActiveSplat, an autonomous high-fidelity reconstruction system leveraging Gaussian splatting. Taking advantage of efficient and realistic rendering, the system establishes a unified framework for online mapping, viewpoint selection, and path planning. The key to ActiveSplat is a hybrid map representation that integrates both dense information about the environment and a sparse abstraction of the workspace. Therefore, the system leverages sparse topology for efficient viewpoint sampling and path planning, while exploiting view-dependent dense prediction for viewpoint selection, facilitating efficient decision-making with promising accuracy and completeness. A hierarchical planning strategy based on the topological map is adopted to mitigate repetitive trajectories and improve local granularity given limited budgets, ensuring high-fidelity reconstruction with photorealistic view synthesis. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the efficacy of the proposed method in terms of reconstruction accuracy, data coverage, and exploration efficiency.

- **Summary**: Face analysis has been studied from different angles to infer emotion, poses, shapes, and landmarks. Traditionally RGB cameras are used, yet for fine-grained tasks standard sensors might not be up to the task due to their latency, making it impossible to record and detect micro-movements that carry a highly informative signal, which is necessary for inferring the true emotions of a subject. Event cameras have been increasingly gaining interest as a possible solution to this and similar high-frame rate tasks. We propose a novel spatiotemporal Vision Transformer model that uses Shifted Patch Tokenization (SPT) and Locality Self-Attention (LSA) to enhance the accuracy of Action Unit classification from event streams. We also address the lack of labeled event data in the literature, which can be considered one of the main causes of an existing gap between the maturity of RGB and neuromorphic vision models. Gathering data is harder in the event domain since it cannot be crawled from the web and labeling frames should take into account event aggregation rates and the fact that static parts might not be visible in certain frames. To this end, we present FACEMORPHIC, a temporally synchronized multimodal face dataset composed of RGB videos and event streams. The dataset is annotated at a video level with facial Action Units and contains streams collected with various possible applications, ranging from 3D shape estimation to lip-reading. We then show how temporal synchronization can allow effective neuromorphic face analysis without the need to manually annotate videos: we instead leverage cross-modal supervision bridging the domain gap by representing face shapes in a 3D space. Our proposed model outperforms baseline methods by effectively capturing spatial and temporal information, crucial for recognizing subtle facial micro-expressions.

- **Summary**: Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved unprecedented effectiveness in the general domain of image classification. Nonetheless, these models remain underexplored in the field of deepfake detection, given their lower performance as compared to Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) in that specific context. In this paper, we start by investigating why plain ViT architectures exhibit a suboptimal performance when dealing with the detection of facial forgeries. Our analysis reveals that, as compared to CNNs, ViT struggles to model localized forgery artifacts that typically characterize deepfakes. Based on this observation, we propose a deepfake detection framework called FakeFormer, which extends ViTs to enforce the extraction of subtle inconsistency-prone information. For that purpose, an explicit attention learning guided by artifact-vulnerable patches and tailored to ViTs is introduced. Extensive experiments are conducted on diverse well-known datasets, including FF++, Celeb-DF, WildDeepfake, DFD, DFDCP, and DFDC. The results show that FakeFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of generalization and computational cost, without the need for large-scale training datasets.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we make the first attempt to align diffusion models for image inpainting with human aesthetic standards via a reinforcement learning framework, significantly improving the quality and visual appeal of inpainted images. Specifically, instead of directly measuring the divergence with paired images, we train a reward model with the dataset we construct, consisting of nearly 51,000 images annotated with human preferences. Then, we adopt a reinforcement learning process to fine-tune the distribution of a pre-trained diffusion model for image inpainting in the direction of higher reward. Moreover, we theoretically deduce the upper bound on the error of the reward model, which illustrates the potential confidence of reward estimation throughout the reinforcement alignment process, thereby facilitating accurate regularization. Extensive experiments on inpainting comparison and downstream tasks, such as image extension and 3D reconstruction, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing significant improvements in the alignment of inpainted images with human preference compared with state-of-the-art methods. This research not only advances the field of image inpainting but also provides a framework for incorporating human preference into the iterative refinement of generative models based on modeling reward accuracy, with broad implications for the design of visually driven AI applications.

- **Summary**: Medical Vision-Language Pretraining (MedVLP) shows promise in learning generalizable and transferable visual representations from paired and unpaired medical images and reports. MedVLP can provide useful features to downstream tasks and facilitate adapting task-specific models to new setups using fewer examples. However, existing MedVLP methods often differ in terms of datasets, preprocessing, and finetuning implementations. This pose great challenges in evaluating how well a MedVLP method generalizes to various clinically-relevant tasks due to the lack of unified, standardized, and comprehensive benchmark. To fill this gap, we propose BenchX, a unified benchmark framework that enables head-to-head comparison and systematical analysis between MedVLP methods using public chest X-ray datasets. Specifically, BenchX is composed of three components: 1) Comprehensive datasets covering nine datasets and four medical tasks; 2) Benchmark suites to standardize data preprocessing, train-test splits, and parameter selection; 3) Unified finetuning protocols that accommodate heterogeneous MedVLP methods for consistent task adaptation in classification, segmentation, and report generation, respectively. Utilizing BenchX, we establish baselines for nine state-of-the-art MedVLP methods and found that the performance of some early MedVLP methods can be enhanced to surpass more recent ones, prompting a revisiting of the developments and conclusions from prior works in MedVLP.

- **Summary**: In the advancement of industrial informatization, Unsupervised Industrial Anomaly Detection (UIAD) technology effectively overcomes the scarcity of abnormal samples and significantly enhances the automation and reliability of smart manufacturing. While RGB, 3D, and multimodal anomaly detection have demonstrated comprehensive and robust capabilities within the industrial informatization sector, existing reviews on industrial anomaly detection have not sufficiently classified and discussed methods in 3D and multimodal settings. We focus on 3D UIAD and multimodal UIAD, providing a comprehensive summary of unsupervised industrial anomaly detection in three modal settings. Firstly, we compare our surveys with recent works, introducing commonly used datasets, evaluation metrics, and the definitions of anomaly detection problems. Secondly, we summarize five research paradigms in RGB, 3D and multimodal UIAD and three emerging industrial manufacturing optimization directions in RGB UIAD, and review three multimodal feature fusion strategies in multimodal settings. Finally, we outline the primary challenges currently faced by UIAD in three modal settings, and offer insights into future development directions, aiming to provide researchers with a thorough reference and offer new perspectives for the advancement of industrial informatization.

- **Summary**: Recently, research based on pre-trained models has demonstrated outstanding performance in violence surveillance tasks. However, these black-box systems face challenges regarding explainability during training and inference processes. An important question is how to incorporate explicit knowledge into these implicit models, thereby designing expert-driven and interpretable violence surveillance systems. This paper proposes a new paradigm for weakly supervised violence monitoring (WSVM) called Rule base Violence monitoring (RuleVM). The proposed RuleVM uses a dual-branch structure for different designs for images and text. One of the branches is called the implicit branch, which uses only visual features for coarse-grained binary classification. In this branch, image feature extraction is divided into two channels: one responsible for extracting scene frames and the other focusing on extracting actions. The other branch is called the explicit branch, which utilizes language-image alignment to perform fine-grained classification. For the language channel design in the explicit branch, the proposed RuleCLIP uses the state-of-the-art YOLO-World model to detect objects and actions in video frames, and association rules are identified through data mining methods as descriptions of the video. Leveraging the dual-branch architecture, RuleVM achieves interpretable coarse-grained and fine-grained violence surveillance. Extensive experiments were conducted on two commonly used benchmarks, and the results show that RuleCLIP achieved the best performance in both coarse-grained and fine-grained detection, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, interpretability experiments uncovered some interesting rules, such as the observation that as the number of people increases, the risk level of violent behavior also rises.

- **Summary**: Face verification is a well-known image analysis application and is widely used to recognize individuals in contemporary society. However, most real-world recognition systems ignore the importance of protecting the identity-sensitive facial images that are used for verification. To address this problem, we investigate how to implement a secure face verification system that protects the facial images from being imitated. In our work, we use the DeepID2 convolutional neural network to extract the features of a facial image and an EM algorithm to solve the facial verification problem. To maintain the privacy of facial images, we apply homomorphic encryption schemes to encrypt the facial data and compute the EM algorithm in the ciphertext domain. We develop three face verification systems for surveillance (or entrance) control of a local community based on three levels of privacy concerns. The associated timing performances are presented to demonstrate their feasibility for practical implementation.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel deep inductive transfer learning framework, named feature distribution adaptation network, to tackle the challenging multi-modal speech emotion recognition problem. Our method aims to use deep transfer learning strategies to align visual and audio feature distributions to obtain consistent representation of emotion, thereby improving the performance of speech emotion recognition. In our model, the pre-trained ResNet-34 is utilized for feature extraction for facial expression images and acoustic Mel spectrograms, respectively. Then, the cross-attention mechanism is introduced to model the intrinsic similarity relationships of multi-modal features. Finally, the multi-modal feature distribution adaptation is performed efficiently with feed-forward network, which is extended using the local maximum mean discrepancy loss. Experiments are carried out on two benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that our model can achieve excellent performance compared with existing ones.

- **Summary**: Vision Language Models excel in handling a wide range of complex tasks, including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Visual Question Answering (VQA), and advanced geometric reasoning. However, these models fail to perform well on low-level basic visual tasks which are especially easy for humans. Our goal in this work was to determine if these models are truly "blind" to geometric reasoning or if there are ways to enhance their capabilities in this area. Our work presents a novel automatic pipeline designed to extract key information from images in response to specific questions. Instead of just relying on direct VQA, we use question-derived keywords to create a caption that highlights important details in the image related to the question. This caption is then used by a language model to provide a precise answer to the question without requiring external fine-tuning.

- **Summary**: Achieving the EU's climate neutrality goal requires retrofitting existing buildings to reduce energy use and emissions. A critical step in this process is the precise assessment of geometric building envelope characteristics to inform retrofitting decisions. Previous methods for estimating building characteristics, such as window-to-wall ratio, building footprint area, and the location of architectural elements, have primarily relied on applying deep-learning-based detection or segmentation techniques on 2D images. However, these approaches tend to focus on planar facade properties, limiting their accuracy and comprehensiveness when analyzing complete building envelopes in 3D.   While neural scene representations have shown exceptional performance in indoor scene reconstruction, they remain under-explored for external building envelope analysis. This work addresses this gap by leveraging cutting-edge neural surface reconstruction techniques based on signed distance function (SDF) representations for 3D building analysis. We propose BuildNet3D, a novel framework to estimate geometric building characteristics from 2D image inputs. By integrating SDF-based representation with semantic modality, BuildNet3D recovers fine-grained 3D geometry and semantics of building envelopes, which are then used to automatically extract building characteristics. Our framework is evaluated on a range of complex building structures, demonstrating high accuracy and generalizability in estimating window-to-wall ratio and building footprint. The results underscore the effectiveness of BuildNet3D for practical applications in building analysis and retrofitting.

- **Summary**: The remarkable capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for tackling image segmentation tasks in an intuitive and interactive manner has sparked interest in the design of effective visual prompts. Such interest has led to the creation of automated point prompt selection strategies, typically motivated from a feature extraction perspective. However, there is still very little understanding of how appropriate these automated visual prompting strategies are, particularly when compared to humans, across diverse image domains. Additionally, the performance benefits of including such automated visual prompting strategies within the finetuning process of SAM also remains unexplored, as does the effect of interpretable factors like distance between the prompt points on segmentation performance. To bridge these gaps, we leverage a recently released visual prompting dataset, PointPrompt, and introduce a number of benchmarking tasks that provide an array of opportunities to improve the understanding of the way human prompts differ from automated ones and what underlying factors make for effective visual prompts. We demonstrate that the resulting segmentation scores obtained by humans are approximately 29% higher than those given by automated strategies and identify potential features that are indicative of prompting performance with $R^2$ scores over 0.5. Additionally, we demonstrate that performance when using automated methods can be improved by up to 68% via a finetuning approach. Overall, our experiments not only showcase the existing gap between human prompts and automated methods, but also highlight potential avenues through which this gap can be leveraged to improve effective visual prompt design.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of brain metastases (BMs) in MR image is crucial for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients. Methods based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved high segmentation performance. However, due to the loss of critical feature information caused by convolutional and pooling operations, CNNs still face great challenges in small BMs segmentation. Besides, BMs are irregular and easily confused with healthy tissues, which makes it difficult for the model to effectively learn tumor structure during training. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel model called feature-guided attention network with curriculum learning (FANCL). Based on CNNs, FANCL utilizes the input image and its feature to establish the intrinsic connections between metastases of different sizes, which can effectively compensate for the loss of high-level feature from small tumors with the information of large tumors. Furthermore, FANCL applies the voxel-level curriculum learning strategy to help the model gradually learn the structure and details of BMs. And baseline models of varying depths are employed as curriculum-mining networks for organizing the curriculum progression. The evaluation results on the BraTS-METS 2023 dataset indicate that FANCL significantly improves the segmentation performance, confirming the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Scene rearrangement, like table tidying, is a challenging task in robotic manipulation due to the complexity of predicting diverse object arrangements. Web-scale trained generative models such as Stable Diffusion can aid by generating natural scenes as goals. To facilitate robot execution, object-level representations must be extracted to match the real scenes with the generated goals and to calculate object pose transformations. Current methods typically use a multi-step design that involves separate models for generation, segmentation, and feature encoding, which can lead to a low success rate due to error accumulation. Furthermore, they lack control over the viewing perspectives of the generated goals, restricting the tasks to 3-DoF settings. In this paper, we propose PACA, a zero-shot pipeline for scene rearrangement that leverages perspective-aware cross-attention representation derived from Stable Diffusion. Specifically, we develop a representation that integrates generation, segmentation, and feature encoding into a single step to produce object-level representations. Additionally, we introduce perspective control, thus enabling the matching of 6-DoF camera views and extending past approaches that were limited to 3-DoF top-down views. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through its zero-shot performance in real robot experiments across various scenes, achieving an average matching accuracy and execution success rate of 87% and 67%, respectively.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing controllable Gaussian splats from monocular video is a challenging task due to its inherently insufficient constraints. Widely adopted approaches supervise complex interactions with additional masks and control signal annotations, limiting their real-world applications. In this paper, we propose an annotation guidance-free method, dubbed FreeGaussian, that mathematically derives dynamic Gaussian motion from optical flow and camera motion using novel dynamic Gaussian constraints. By establishing a connection between 2D flows and 3D Gaussian dynamic control, our method enables self-supervised optimization and continuity of dynamic Gaussian motions from flow priors. Furthermore, we introduce a 3D spherical vector controlling scheme, which represents the state with a 3D Gaussian trajectory, thereby eliminating the need for complex 1D control signal calculations and simplifying controllable Gaussian modeling. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art visual performance and control capability of our method.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing neuron morphology from 3D light microscope imaging data is critical to aid neuroscientists in analyzing brain networks and neuroanatomy. With the boost from deep learning techniques, a variety of learning-based segmentation models have been developed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of raw neuron images as a pre-processing step in the reconstruction workflow. However, most existing models directly encode the latent representative features of volumetric neuron data but neglect their intrinsic morphological knowledge. To address this limitation, we design a novel framework that distills the prior knowledge from a 2D Vision Transformer pre-trained on extensive 2D natural images to facilitate neuronal morphological learning of our 3D Vision Transformer. To bridge the knowledge gap between the 2D natural image and 3D microscopic morphologic domains, we propose a deformable tubular transferring strategy that adapts the pre-trained 2D natural knowledge to the inherent tubular characteristics of neuronal structure in the latent embedding space. The experimental results on the Janelia dataset of the BigNeuron project demonstrate that our method achieves a segmentation performance improvement of 4.53% in mean Dice and 3.56% in mean 95% Hausdorff distance.

- **Summary**: Human pose estimation on medium and small scales has long been a significant challenge in this field. Most existing methods focus on restoring high-resolution feature maps by stacking multiple costly deconvolutional layers or by continuously aggregating semantic information from low-resolution feature maps while maintaining high-resolution ones, which can lead to information redundancy. Additionally, due to quantization errors, heatmap-based methods have certain disadvantages in accurately locating keypoints of medium and small-scale human figures. In this paper, we propose HRPVT, which utilizes PVT v2 as the backbone to model long-range dependencies. Building on this, we introduce the High-Resolution Pyramid Module (HRPM), designed to generate higher quality high-resolution representations by incorporating the intrinsic inductive biases of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) into the high-resolution feature maps. The integration of HRPM enhances the performance of pure transformer-based models for human pose estimation at medium and small scales. Furthermore, we replace the heatmap-based method with SimCC approach, which eliminates the need for costly upsampling layers, thereby allowing us to allocate more computational resources to HRPM. To accommodate models with varying parameter scales, we have developed two insertion strategies of HRPM, each designed to enhancing the model's ability to perceive medium and small-scale human poses from two distinct perspectives.

- **Summary**: Machine perception is an important prerequisite for safe interaction and locomotion in dynamic environments. This requires not only the timely perception of surrounding geometries and distances but also the ability to react to changing situations through predefined, learned but also reusable skill endings of a robot so that physical damage or bodily harm can be avoided. In this context, 4D perception offers the possibility of predicting one's own position and changes in the environment over time. In this paper, we present a 4D-based approach to robot navigation using relativistic image processing. Relativistic image processing handles the temporal-related sensor information in a tensor model within a constructive 4D space. 4D-based navigation expands the causal understanding and the resulting interaction radius of a robot through the use of visual and sensory 4D information.

- **Summary**: Brain imaging studies have demonstrated that diffusion MRI tractography geometric shape descriptors can inform the study of the brain's white matter pathways and their relationship to brain function. In this work, we investigate the possibility of utilizing a deep learning model to compute shape measures of the brain's white matter connections. We introduce a novel framework, TractShapeNet, that leverages a point cloud representation of tractography to compute five shape measures: length, span, volume, total surface area, and irregularity. We assess the performance of the method on a large dataset including 1065 healthy young adults. Experiments for shape measure computation demonstrate that our proposed TractShapeNet outperforms other point cloud-based neural network models in both the Pearson correlation coefficient and normalized error metrics. We compare the inference runtime results with the conventional shape computation tool DSI-Studio. Our results demonstrate that a deep learning approach enables faster and more efficient shape measure computation. We also conduct experiments on two downstream language cognition prediction tasks, showing that shape measures from TractShapeNet perform similarly to those computed by DSI-Studio.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) is known for its advantages over traditional RGB imaging in remote sensing, agriculture, and medicine. Recently, it has gained attention for enhancing Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) perception. Several HSI datasets such as HyKo, HSI-Drive, HSI-Road, and Hyperspectral City have been made available. However, a comprehensive evaluation of semantic segmentation models (SSM) using these datasets is lacking. To address this gap, we evaluated the available annotated HSI datasets on four deep learning-based baseline SSMs: DeepLab v3+, HRNet, PSPNet, and U-Net, along with its two variants: Coordinate Attention (UNet-CA) and Convolutional Block-Attention Module (UNet-CBAM). The original model architectures were adapted to handle the varying spatial and spectral dimensions of the datasets. These baseline SSMs were trained using a class-weighted loss function for individual HSI datasets and evaluated using mean-based metrics such as intersection over union (IoU), recall, precision, F1 score, specificity, and accuracy. Our results indicate that UNet-CBAM, which extracts channel-wise features, outperforms other SSMs and shows potential to leverage spectral information for enhanced semantic segmentation. This study establishes a baseline SSM benchmark on available annotated datasets for future evaluation of HSI-based ADAS perception. However, limitations of current HSI datasets, such as limited dataset size, high class imbalance, and lack of fine-grained annotations, remain significant constraints for developing robust SSMs for ADAS applications.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art (SOTA) semi-supervised learning techniques, such as FixMatch and it's variants, have demonstrated impressive performance in classification tasks. However, these methods are not directly applicable to regression tasks. In this paper, we present RankUp, a simple yet effective approach that adapts existing semi-supervised classification techniques to enhance the performance of regression tasks. RankUp achieves this by converting the original regression task into a ranking problem and training it concurrently with the original regression objective. This auxiliary ranking classifier outputs a classification result, thus enabling integration with existing semi-supervised classification methods. Moreover, we introduce regression distribution alignment (RDA), a complementary technique that further enhances RankUp's performance by refining pseudo-labels through distribution alignment. Despite its simplicity, RankUp, with or without RDA, achieves SOTA results in across a range of regression benchmarks, including computer vision, audio, and natural language processing tasks.

- **Summary**: We consider the problem of novel view synthesis from unposed images in a single feed-forward. Our framework capitalizes on fast speed, scalability, and high-quality 3D reconstruction and view synthesis capabilities of 3DGS, where we further extend it to offer a practical solution that relaxes common assumptions such as dense image views, accurate camera poses, and substantial image overlaps. We achieve this through identifying and addressing unique challenges arising from the use of pixel-aligned 3DGS: misaligned 3D Gaussians across different views induce noisy or sparse gradients that destabilize training and hinder convergence, especially when above assumptions are not met. To mitigate this, we employ pre-trained monocular depth estimation and visual correspondence models to achieve coarse alignments of 3D Gaussians. We then introduce lightweight, learnable modules to refine depth and pose estimates from the coarse alignments, improving the quality of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Furthermore, the refined estimates are leveraged to estimate geometry confidence scores, which assess the reliability of 3D Gaussian centers and condition the prediction of Gaussian parameters accordingly. Extensive evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that PF3plat sets a new state-of-the-art across all benchmarks, supported by comprehensive ablation studies validating our design choices.

- **Summary**: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is proposed to first pre-train the model on a large-scale source-domain dataset, and then transfer the model to data-scarce target-domain datasets for pixel-level segmentation. The significant domain gap between the source and target datasets leads to a sharp decline in the performance of existing few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods in cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we discover an intriguing phenomenon: simply filtering different frequency components for target domains can lead to a significant performance improvement, sometimes even as high as 14% mIoU. Then, we delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation, and find such improvements stem from the reduced inter-channel correlation in feature maps, which benefits CD-FSS with enhanced robustness against domain gaps and larger activated regions for segmentation. Based on this, we propose a lightweight frequency masker, which further reduces channel correlations by an amplitude-phase-masker (APM) module and an Adaptive Channel Phase Attention (ACPA) module. Notably, APM introduces only 0.01% additional parameters but improves the average performance by over 10%, and ACPA imports only 2.5% parameters but further improves the performance by over 1.5%, which significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art CD-FSS methods.

- **Summary**: As a fundamental operation in modern machine vision models, feature upsampling has been widely used and investigated in the literatures. An ideal upsampling operation should be lightweight, with low computational complexity. That is, it can not only improve the overall performance but also not affect the model complexity. Content-aware Reassembly of Features (CARAFE) is a well-designed learnable operation to achieve feature upsampling. Albeit encouraging performance achieved, this method requires generating large-scale kernels, which brings a mass of extra redundant parameters, and inherently has limited scalability. To this end, we propose a lightweight upsampling operation, termed Dynamic Lightweight Upsampling (DLU) in this paper. In particular, it first constructs a small-scale source kernel space, and then samples the large-scale kernels from the kernel space by introducing learnable guidance offsets, hence avoiding introducing a large collection of trainable parameters in upsampling. Experiments on several mainstream vision tasks show that our DLU achieves comparable and even better performance to the original CARAFE, but with much lower complexity, e.g., DLU requires 91% fewer parameters and at least 63% fewer FLOPs (Floating Point Operations) than CARAFE in the case of 16x upsampling, but outperforms the CARAFE by 0.3% mAP in object detection.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present compelling evidence that controlling model capacity during fine-tuning can effectively mitigate memorization in diffusion models. Specifically, we demonstrate that adopting Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) within the pre-train fine-tune paradigm significantly reduces memorization compared to traditional full fine-tuning approaches. Our experiments utilize the MIMIC dataset, which comprises image-text pairs of chest X-rays and their corresponding reports. The results, evaluated through a range of memorization and generation quality metrics, indicate that PEFT not only diminishes memorization but also enhances downstream generation quality. Additionally, PEFT methods can be seamlessly combined with existing memorization mitigation techniques for further improvement.

- **Summary**: Amidst escalating climate change, hurricanes are inflicting severe socioeconomic impacts, marked by heightened economic losses and increased displacement. Previous research utilized nighttime light data to predict the impact of hurricanes on economic losses. However, prior work did not provide a thorough analysis of the impact of combining different techniques for pre-processing nighttime light (NTL) data. Addressing this gap, our research explores a variety of NTL pre-processing techniques, including value thresholding, built masking, and quality filtering and imputation, applied to two distinct datasets, VSC-NTL and VNP46A2, at the zip code level. Experiments evaluate the correlation of the denoised NTL data with economic damages of Category 4-5 hurricanes in Florida. They reveal that the quality masking and imputation technique applied to VNP46A2 show a substantial correlation with economic damage data.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel teacher-student framework to distill knowledge from multiple teachers trained on distinct datasets. Each teacher is first trained from scratch on its own dataset. Then, the teachers are combined into a joint architecture, which fuses the features of all teachers at multiple representation levels. The joint teacher architecture is fine-tuned on samples from all datasets, thus gathering useful generic information from all data samples. Finally, we employ a multi-level feature distillation procedure to transfer the knowledge to a student model for each of the considered datasets. We conduct image classification experiments on seven benchmarks, and action recognition experiments on three benchmarks. To illustrate the power of our feature distillation procedure, the student architectures are chosen to be identical to those of the individual teachers. To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, we combine teachers with distinct architectures. We show that our novel Multi-Level Feature Distillation (MLFD) can significantly surpass equivalent architectures that are either trained on individual datasets, or jointly trained on all datasets at once. Furthermore, we confirm that each step of the proposed training procedure is well motivated by a comprehensive ablation study. We publicly release our code at https://github.com/AdrianIordache/MLFD.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance on a wide range of downstream computer vision tasks. However, there still exists a considerable performance gap between these models and a supervised deep model trained on a downstream dataset. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel active learning (AL) framework that enhances the zero-shot classification performance of VLMs by selecting only a few informative samples from the unlabeled data for annotation during training. To achieve this, our approach first calibrates the predicted entropy of VLMs and then utilizes a combination of self-uncertainty and neighbor-aware uncertainty to calculate a reliable uncertainty measure for active sample selection. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms existing AL approaches on several image classification datasets, and significantly enhances the zero-shot performance of VLMs.

- **Summary**: In open-world environments like Minecraft, existing agents face challenges in continuously learning structured knowledge, particularly causality. These challenges stem from the opacity inherent in black-box models and an excessive reliance on prior knowledge during training, which impair their interpretability and generalization capability. To this end, we introduce ADAM, An emboDied causal Agent in Minecraft, that can autonomously navigate the open world, perceive multimodal contexts, learn causal world knowledge, and tackle complex tasks through lifelong learning. ADAM is empowered by four key components: 1) an interaction module, enabling the agent to execute actions while documenting the interaction processes; 2) a causal model module, tasked with constructing an ever-growing causal graph from scratch, which enhances interpretability and diminishes reliance on prior knowledge; 3) a controller module, comprising a planner, an actor, and a memory pool, which uses the learned causal graph to accomplish tasks; 4) a perception module, powered by multimodal large language models, which enables ADAM to perceive like a human player. Extensive experiments show that ADAM constructs an almost perfect causal graph from scratch, enabling efficient task decomposition and execution with strong interpretability. Notably, in our modified Minecraft games where no prior knowledge is available, ADAM maintains its performance and shows remarkable robustness and generalization capability. ADAM pioneers a novel paradigm that integrates causal methods and embodied agents in a synergistic manner. Our project page is at https://opencausalab.github.io/ADAM.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an accurate and robust Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline named LiVisSfM, which is an SfM-based reconstruction system that fully combines LiDAR and visual cues. Unlike most existing LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) and LiDAR-inertial-visual odometry (LIVO) methods relying heavily on LiDAR registration coupled with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), we propose a LiDAR-visual SfM method which innovatively carries out LiDAR frame registration to LiDAR voxel map in a Point-to-Gaussian residual metrics, combined with a LiDAR-visual BA and explicit loop closure in a bundle optimization way to achieve accurate and robust LiDAR pose estimation without dependence on IMU incorporation. Besides, we propose an incremental voxel updating strategy for efficient voxel map updating during the process of LiDAR frame registration and LiDAR-visual BA optimization. Experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our LiVisSfM framework over state-of-the-art LIO and LIVO works on more accurate and robust LiDAR pose recovery and dense point cloud reconstruction of both public KITTI benchmark and a variety of self-captured dataset.

- **Summary**: Autoregression in large language models (LLMs) has shown impressive scalability by unifying all language tasks into the next token prediction paradigm. Recently, there is a growing interest in extending this success to vision foundation models. In this survey, we review the recent advances and discuss future directions for autoregressive vision foundation models. First, we present the trend for next generation of vision foundation models, i.e., unifying both understanding and generation in vision tasks. We then analyze the limitations of existing vision foundation models, and present a formal definition of autoregression with its advantages. Later, we categorize autoregressive vision foundation models from their vision tokenizers and autoregression backbones. Finally, we discuss several promising research challenges and directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey to comprehensively summarize autoregressive vision foundation models under the trend of unifying understanding and generation.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation is pivotal in healthcare, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, informing treatment strategies, and tracking disease progression. This process allows clinicians to extract critical information from visual data, enabling personalized patient care. However, developing neural networks for segmentation remains challenging, especially when preserving image resolution, which is essential in detecting subtle details that influence diagnoses. Moreover, the lack of transparency in these deep learning models has slowed their adoption in clinical practice. Efforts in model interpretability are increasingly focused on making these models' decision-making processes more transparent. In this paper, we introduce MAPUNetR, a novel architecture that synergizes the strengths of transformer models with the proven U-Net framework for medical image segmentation. Our model addresses the resolution preservation challenge and incorporates attention maps highlighting segmented regions, increasing accuracy and interpretability. Evaluated on the BraTS 2020 dataset, MAPUNetR achieved a dice score of 0.88 and a dice coefficient of 0.92 on the ISIC 2018 dataset. Our experiments show that the model maintains stable performance and potential as a powerful tool for medical image segmentation in clinical practice.

- **Summary**: Endovascular surgical tool reconstruction represents an important factor in advancing endovascular tool navigation, which is an important step in endovascular surgery. However, the lack of publicly available datasets significantly restricts the development and validation of novel machine learning approaches. Moreover, due to the need for specialized equipment such as biplanar scanners, most of the previous research employs monoplanar fluoroscopic technologies, hence only capturing the data from a single view and significantly limiting the reconstruction accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce Guide3D, a bi-planar X-ray dataset for 3D reconstruction. The dataset represents a collection of high resolution bi-planar, manually annotated fluoroscopic videos, captured in real-world settings. Validating our dataset within a simulated environment reflective of clinical settings confirms its applicability for real-world applications. Furthermore, we propose a new benchmark for guidewrite shape prediction, serving as a strong baseline for future work. Guide3D not only addresses an essential need by offering a platform for advancing segmentation and 3D reconstruction techniques but also aids the development of more accurate and efficient endovascular surgery interventions.

- **Summary**: Contextual advertising serves ads that are aligned to the content that the user is viewing. The rapid growth of video content on social platforms and streaming services, along with privacy concerns, has increased the need for contextual advertising. Placing the right ad in the right context creates a seamless and pleasant ad viewing experience, resulting in higher audience engagement and, ultimately, better ad monetization. From a technology standpoint, effective contextual advertising requires a video retrieval system capable of understanding complex video content at a very granular level. Current text-to-video retrieval models based on joint multimodal training demand large datasets and computational resources, limiting their practicality and lacking the key functionalities required for ad ecosystem integration. We introduce ContextIQ, a multimodal expert-based video retrieval system designed specifically for contextual advertising. ContextIQ utilizes modality-specific experts-video, audio, transcript (captions), and metadata such as objects, actions, emotion, etc.-to create semantically rich video representations. We show that our system, without joint training, achieves better or comparable results to state-of-the-art models and commercial solutions on multiple text-to-video retrieval benchmarks. Our ablation studies highlight the benefits of leveraging multiple modalities for enhanced video retrieval accuracy instead of using a vision-language model alone. Furthermore, we show how video retrieval systems such as ContextIQ can be used for contextual advertising in an ad ecosystem while also addressing concerns related to brand safety and filtering inappropriate content.

- **Summary**: Medical image registration is a critical process that aligns various patient scans, facilitating tasks like diagnosis, surgical planning, and tracking. Traditional optimization based methods are slow, prompting the use of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, such as VoxelMorph and Transformer-based strategies, for faster results. However, these DL methods often impose significant resource demands. In response to these challenges, we present NCA-Morph, an innovative approach that seamlessly blends DL with a bio-inspired communication and networking approach, enabled by Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs). NCA-Morph not only harnesses the power of DL for efficient image registration but also builds a network of local communications between cells and respective voxels over time, mimicking the interaction observed in living systems. In our extensive experiments, we subject NCA-Morph to evaluations across three distinct 3D registration tasks, encompassing Brain, Prostate and Hippocampus images from both healthy and diseased patients. The results showcase NCA-Morph's ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Notably, NCA-Morph distinguishes itself as a lightweight architecture with significantly fewer parameters; 60% and 99.7% less than VoxelMorph and TransMorph. This characteristic positions NCA-Morph as an ideal solution for resource-constrained medical applications, such as primary care settings and operating rooms.

- **Summary**: Event cameras provide a natural and data efficient representation of visual information, motivating novel computational strategies towards extracting visual information. Inspired by the biological vision system, we propose a behavior driven approach for object-wise distance estimation from event camera data. This behavior-driven method mimics how biological systems, like the human eye, stabilize their view based on object distance: distant objects require minimal compensatory rotation to stay in focus, while nearby objects demand greater adjustments to maintain alignment. This adaptive strategy leverages natural stabilization behaviors to estimate relative distances effectively. Unlike traditional vision algorithms that estimate depth across the entire image, our approach targets local depth estimation within a specific region of interest. By aligning events within a small region, we estimate the angular velocity required to stabilize the image motion. We demonstrate that, under certain assumptions, the compensatory rotational flow is inversely proportional to the object's distance. The proposed approach achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy in distance estimation - a performance gain of 16% on EVIMO2. EVIMO2 event sequences comprise complex camera motion and substantial variance in depth of static real world scenes.

- **Summary**: We introduce motion graph, a novel approach to the video prediction problem, which predicts future video frames from limited past data. The motion graph transforms patches of video frames into interconnected graph nodes, to comprehensively describe the spatial-temporal relationships among them. This representation overcomes the limitations of existing motion representations such as image differences, optical flow, and motion matrix that either fall short in capturing complex motion patterns or suffer from excessive memory consumption. We further present a video prediction pipeline empowered by motion graph, exhibiting substantial performance improvements and cost reductions. Experiments on various datasets, including UCF Sports, KITTI and Cityscapes, highlight the strong representative ability of motion graph. Especially on UCF Sports, our method matches and outperforms the SOTA methods with a significant reduction in model size by 78% and a substantial decrease in GPU memory utilization by 47%.

- **Summary**: Generating music from images can enhance various applications, including background music for photo slideshows, social media experiences, and video creation. This paper presents an emotion-guided image-to-music generation framework that leverages the Valence-Arousal (VA) emotional space to produce music that aligns with the emotional tone of a given image. Unlike previous models that rely on contrastive learning for emotional consistency, the proposed approach directly integrates a VA loss function to enable accurate emotional alignment. The model employs a CNN-Transformer architecture, featuring pre-trained CNN image feature extractors and three Transformer encoders to capture complex, high-level emotional features from MIDI music. Three Transformer decoders refine these features to generate musically and emotionally consistent MIDI sequences. Experimental results on a newly curated emotionally paired image-MIDI dataset demonstrate the proposed model's superior performance across metrics such as Polyphony Rate, Pitch Entropy, Groove Consistency, and loss convergence.

- **Summary**: Multi-object 3D Grounding involves locating 3D boxes based on a given query phrase from a point cloud. It is a challenging and significant task with numerous applications in visual understanding, human-computer interaction, and robotics. To tackle this challenge, we introduce D-LISA, a two-stage approach incorporating three innovations. First, a dynamic vision module that enables a variable and learnable number of box proposals. Second, a dynamic camera positioning that extracts features for each proposal. Third, a language-informed spatial attention module that better reasons over the proposals to output the final prediction. Empirically, experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on multi-object 3D grounding by 12.8% (absolute) and is competitive in single-object 3D grounding.

- **Summary**: Modern deep learning models often make predictions by focusing on irrelevant areas, leading to biased performance and limited generalization. Existing methods aimed at rectifying model attention require explicit labels for irrelevant areas or complex pixel-wise ground truth attention maps. We present CRAYON (Correcting Reasoning with Annotations of Yes Or No), offering effective, scalable, and practical solutions to rectify model attention using simple yes-no annotations. CRAYON empowers classical and modern model interpretation techniques to identify and guide model reasoning: CRAYON-ATTENTION directs classic interpretations based on saliency maps to focus on relevant image regions, while CRAYON-PRUNING removes irrelevant neurons identified by modern concept-based methods to mitigate their influence. Through extensive experiments with both quantitative and human evaluation, we showcase CRAYON's effectiveness, scalability, and practicality in refining model attention. CRAYON achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming 12 methods across 3 benchmark datasets, surpassing approaches that require more complex annotations.

- **Summary**: End-to-end autonomous driving demonstrates strong planning capabilities with large-scale data but still struggles in complex, rare scenarios due to limited commonsense. In contrast, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in scene understanding and reasoning. The path forward lies in merging the strengths of both approaches. Previous methods using LVLMs to predict trajectories or control signals yield suboptimal results, as LVLMs are not well-suited for precise numerical predictions. This paper presents Senna, an autonomous driving system combining an LVLM (Senna-VLM) with an end-to-end model (Senna-E2E). Senna decouples high-level planning from low-level trajectory prediction. Senna-VLM generates planning decisions in natural language, while Senna-E2E predicts precise trajectories. Senna-VLM utilizes a multi-image encoding approach and multi-view prompts for efficient scene understanding. Besides, we introduce planning-oriented QAs alongside a three-stage training strategy, which enhances Senna-VLM's planning performance while preserving commonsense. Extensive experiments on two datasets show that Senna achieves state-of-the-art planning performance. Notably, with pre-training on a large-scale dataset DriveX and fine-tuning on nuScenes, Senna significantly reduces average planning error by 27.12% and collision rate by 33.33% over model without pre-training. We believe Senna's cross-scenario generalization and transferability are essential for achieving fully autonomous driving. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/hustvl/Senna.

- **Summary**: Compositional reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remains challenging as these models often struggle to relate objects, attributes, and spatial relationships. Recent methods aim to address these limitations by relying on the semantics of the textual description, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to break them down into subsets of questions and answers. However, these methods primarily operate on the surface level, failing to incorporate deeper lexical understanding while introducing incorrect assumptions generated by the LLM. In response to these issues, we present Caption Expansion with Contradictions and Entailments (CECE), a principled approach that leverages Natural Language Inference (NLI) to generate entailments and contradictions from a given premise. CECE produces lexically diverse sentences while maintaining their core meaning. Through extensive experiments, we show that CECE enhances interpretability and reduces overreliance on biased or superficial features. By balancing CECE along the original premise, we achieve significant improvements over previous methods without requiring additional fine-tuning, producing state-of-the-art results on benchmarks that score agreement with human judgments for image-text alignment, and achieving an increase in performance on Winoground of +19.2% (group score) and +12.9% on EqBen (group score) over the best prior work (finetuned with targeted data).

- **Summary**: With the advent of large pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP, prompt learning methods aim to enhance the transferability of the CLIP model. They learn the prompt given few samples from the downstream task given the specific class names as prior knowledge, which we term as semantic-aware classification. However, in many realistic scenarios, we only have access to few samples and knowledge of the class names (e.g., when considering instances of classes). This challenging scenario represents the semantic-agnostic discriminative case. Text-to-Image (T2I) personalization methods aim to adapt T2I models to unseen concepts by learning new tokens and endowing these tokens with the capability of generating the learned concepts. These methods do not require knowledge of class names as a semantic-aware prior. Therefore, in this paper, we first explore Textual Inversion and reveal that the new concept tokens possess both generation and classification capabilities by regarding each category as a single concept. However, learning classifiers from single-concept textual inversion is limited since the learned tokens are suboptimal for the discriminative tasks. To mitigate this issue, we propose Multi-Class textual inversion, which includes a discriminative regularization term for the token updating process. Using this technique, our method MC-TI achieves stronger Semantic-Agnostic Classification while preserving the generation capability of these modifier tokens given only few samples per category. In the experiments, we extensively evaluate MC-TI on 12 datasets covering various scenarios, which demonstrates that MC-TI achieves superior results in terms of both classification and generation outcomes.

- **Summary**: Breast cancer histopathology image classification is crucial for early cancer detection, offering the potential to reduce mortality rates through timely diagnosis. This paper introduces a novel approach integrating Hybrid EfficientNet models with advanced attention mechanisms, including Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Self-Attention, and Deformable Attention, to enhance feature extraction and focus on critical image regions. We evaluate the performance of our models across multiple magnification scales using publicly available histopathological datasets. Our method achieves significant improvements, with accuracy reaching 98.42% at 400X magnification, surpassing several state-of-the-art models, including VGG and ResNet architectures. The results are validated using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall, demonstrating the clinical potential of our model in improving diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed method shows increased computational efficiency, making it suitable for integration into real-time diagnostic workflows.

- **Summary**: The pre-training of visual representations has enhanced the efficiency of robot learning. Due to the lack of large-scale in-domain robotic datasets, prior works utilize in-the-wild human videos to pre-train robotic visual representation. Despite their promising results, representations from human videos are inevitably subject to distribution shifts and lack the dynamics information crucial for task completion. We first evaluate various pre-trained representations in terms of their correlation to the downstream robotic manipulation tasks (i.e., manipulation centricity). Interestingly, we find that the "manipulation centricity" is a strong indicator of success rates when applied to downstream tasks. Drawing from these findings, we propose Manipulation Centric Representation (MCR), a foundation representation learning framework capturing both visual features and the dynamics information such as actions and proprioceptions of manipulation tasks to improve manipulation centricity. Specifically, we pre-train a visual encoder on the DROID robotic dataset and leverage motion-relevant data such as robot proprioceptive states and actions. We introduce a novel contrastive loss that aligns visual observations with the robot's proprioceptive state-action dynamics, combined with a behavior cloning (BC)-like actor loss to predict actions during pre-training, along with a time contrastive loss. Empirical results across 4 simulation domains with 20 tasks verify that MCR outperforms the strongest baseline method by 14.8%. Moreover, MCR boosts the performance of data-efficient learning with a UR5e arm on 3 real-world tasks by 76.9%. Project website: https://robots-pretrain-robots.github.io/.

- **Summary**: We investigate the internal representations of vision-and-language models (VLMs) and how they encode task representations. We consider tasks specified through examples or instructions, using either text or image inputs. Surprisingly, we find that conceptually similar tasks are mapped to similar task vector representations, regardless of how they are specified. Our findings suggest that to output answers, tokens in VLMs undergo three distinct phases: input, task, and answer, a process which is consistent across different modalities and specifications. The task vectors we identify in VLMs are general enough to be derived in one modality (e.g., text) and transferred to another (e.g., image). Additionally, we find that ensembling exemplar and instruction based task vectors produce better task representations. Taken together, these insights shed light on the underlying mechanisms of VLMs, particularly their ability to represent tasks in a shared manner across different modalities and task specifications.

- **Summary**: Sim2real for robotic manipulation is difficult due to the challenges of simulating complex contacts and generating realistic task distributions. To tackle the latter problem, we introduce ManipGen, which leverages a new class of policies for sim2real transfer: local policies. Locality enables a variety of appealing properties including invariances to absolute robot and object pose, skill ordering, and global scene configuration. We combine these policies with foundation models for vision, language and motion planning and demonstrate SOTA zero-shot performance of our method to Robosuite benchmark tasks in simulation (97%). We transfer our local policies from simulation to reality and observe they can solve unseen long-horizon manipulation tasks with up to 8 stages with significant pose, object and scene configuration variation. ManipGen outperforms SOTA approaches such as SayCan, OpenVLA, LLMTrajGen and VoxPoser across 50 real-world manipulation tasks by 36%, 76%, 62% and 60% respectively.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Unsigned Distance Functions (UDFs) can be used to represent non-watertight surfaces in a deep learning framework. However, UDFs tend to be brittle and difficult to learn, in part because the surface is located exactly where the UDF is non-differentiable. In this work, we show that Gradient Distance Functions (GDFs) can remedy this by being differentiable at the surface while still being able to represent open surfaces. This is done by associating to each 3D point a 3D vector whose norm is taken to be the unsigned distance to the surface and whose orientation is taken to be the direction towards the closest surface point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GDFs on ShapeNet Car, Multi-Garment, and 3D-Scene datasets with both single-shape reconstruction networks or categorical auto-decoders.

- **Summary**: In practical application, the widespread deployment of diffusion models often necessitates substantial investment in training. As diffusion models find increasingly diverse applications, concerns about potential misuse highlight the imperative for robust intellectual property protection. Current protection strategies either employ backdoor-based methods, integrating a watermark task as a simpler training objective with the main model task, or embedding watermarks directly into the final output samples. However, the former approach is fragile compared to existing backdoor defense techniques, while the latter fundamentally alters the expected output. In this work, we introduce a novel watermarking framework by embedding the watermark into the whole diffusion process, and theoretically ensure that our final output samples contain no additional information. Furthermore, we utilize statistical algorithms to verify the watermark from internally generated model samples without necessitating triggers as conditions. Detailed theoretical analysis and experimental validation demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: Contemporary state-of-the-art video object segmentation (VOS) models compare incoming unannotated images to a history of image-mask relations via affinity or cross-attention to predict object masks. We refer to the internal memory state of the initial image-mask pair and past image-masks as a working memory buffer. While the current state of the art models perform very well on clean video data, their reliance on a working memory of previous frames leaves room for error. Affinity-based algorithms include the inductive bias that there is temporal continuity between consecutive frames. To account for inconsistent camera views of the desired object, working memory models need an algorithmic modification that regulates the memory updates and avoid writing irrelevant frames into working memory. A simple algorithmic change is proposed that can be applied to any existing working memory-based VOS model to improve performance on inconsistent views, such as sudden camera cuts, frame interjections, and extreme context changes. The resulting model performances show significant improvement on video data with these frame interjections over the same model without the algorithmic addition. Our contribution is a simple decision function that determines whether working memory should be updated based on the detection of sudden, extreme changes and the assumption that the object is no longer in frame. By implementing algorithmic changes, such as this, we can increase the real-world applicability of current VOS models.

- **Summary**: Estimated brain age from magnetic resonance image (MRI) and its deviation from chronological age can provide early insights into potential neurodegenerative diseases, supporting early detection and implementation of prevention strategies. Diffusion MRI (dMRI), a widely used modality for brain age estimation, presents an opportunity to build an earlier biomarker for neurodegenerative disease prediction because it captures subtle microstructural changes that precede more perceptible macrostructural changes. However, the coexistence of macro- and micro-structural information in dMRI raises the question of whether current dMRI-based brain age estimation models are leveraging the intended microstructural information or if they inadvertently rely on the macrostructural information. To develop a microstructure-specific brain age, we propose a method for brain age identification from dMRI that minimizes the model's use of macrostructural information by non-rigidly registering all images to a standard template. Imaging data from 13,398 participants across 12 datasets were used for the training and evaluation. We compare our brain age models, trained with and without macrostructural information minimized, with an architecturally similar T1-weighted (T1w) MRI-based brain age model and two state-of-the-art T1w MRI-based brain age models that primarily use macrostructural information. We observe difference between our dMRI-based brain age and T1w MRI-based brain age across stages of neurodegeneration, with dMRI-based brain age being older than T1w MRI-based brain age in participants transitioning from cognitively normal (CN) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but younger in participants already diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Approximately 4 years before MCI diagnosis, dMRI-based brain age yields better performance than T1w MRI-based brain ages in predicting transition from CN to MCI.

- **Summary**: We introduce Image2Struct, a benchmark to evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) on extracting structure from images. Our benchmark 1) captures real-world use cases, 2) is fully automatic and does not require human judgment, and 3) is based on a renewable stream of fresh data. In Image2Struct, VLMs are prompted to generate the underlying structure (e.g., LaTeX code or HTML) from an input image (e.g., webpage screenshot). The structure is then rendered to produce an output image (e.g., rendered webpage), which is compared against the input image to produce a similarity score. This round-trip evaluation allows us to quantitatively evaluate VLMs on tasks with multiple valid structures. We create a pipeline that downloads fresh data from active online communities upon execution and evaluates the VLMs without human intervention. We introduce three domains (Webpages, LaTeX, and Musical Scores) and use five image metrics (pixel similarity, cosine similarity between the Inception vectors, learned perceptual image patch similarity, structural similarity index measure, and earth mover similarity) that allow efficient and automatic comparison between pairs of images. We evaluate Image2Struct on 14 prominent VLMs and find that scores vary widely, indicating that Image2Struct can differentiate between the performances of different VLMs. Additionally, the best score varies considerably across domains (e.g., 0.402 on sheet music vs. 0.830 on LaTeX equations), indicating that Image2Struct contains tasks of varying difficulty. For transparency, we release the full results at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/image2struct/v1.0.1/.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in 3D object detection leveraging multi-view cameras have demonstrated their practical and economical value in various challenging vision tasks. However, typical supervised learning approaches face challenges in achieving satisfactory adaptation toward unseen and unlabeled target datasets (\ie, direct transfer) due to the inevitable geometric misalignment between the source and target domains. In practice, we also encounter constraints on resources for training models and collecting annotations for the successful deployment of 3D object detectors. In this paper, we propose Unified Domain Generalization and Adaptation (UDGA), a practical solution to mitigate those drawbacks. We first propose Multi-view Overlap Depth Constraint that leverages the strong association between multi-view, significantly alleviating geometric gaps due to perspective view changes. Then, we present a Label-Efficient Domain Adaptation approach to handle unfamiliar targets with significantly fewer amounts of labels (\ie, 1$\%$ and 5$\%)$, while preserving well-defined source knowledge for training efficiency. Overall, UDGA framework enables stable detection performance in both source and target domains, effectively bridging inevitable domain gaps, while demanding fewer annotations. We demonstrate the robustness of UDGA with large-scale benchmarks: nuScenes, Lyft, and Waymo, where our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation (FS-PCS) aims at generalizing models to segment novel categories with minimal annotated support samples. While existing FS-PCS methods have shown promise, they primarily focus on unimodal point cloud inputs, overlooking the potential benefits of leveraging multimodal information. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a cost-free multimodal FS-PCS setup, utilizing textual labels and the potentially available 2D image modality. Under this easy-to-achieve setup, we present the MultiModal Few-Shot SegNet (MM-FSS), a model effectively harnessing complementary information from multiple modalities. MM-FSS employs a shared backbone with two heads to extract intermodal and unimodal visual features, and a pretrained text encoder to generate text embeddings. To fully exploit the multimodal information, we propose a Multimodal Correlation Fusion (MCF) module to generate multimodal correlations, and a Multimodal Semantic Fusion (MSF) module to refine the correlations using text-aware semantic guidance. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective Test-time Adaptive Cross-modal Calibration (TACC) technique to mitigate training bias, further improving generalization. Experimental results on S3DIS and ScanNet datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements achieved by our method. The efficacy of our approach indicates the benefits of leveraging commonly-ignored free modalities for FS-PCS, providing valuable insights for future research.

- **Summary**: As the global food security landscape continues to evolve, the need for accurate and reliable crop disease diagnosis has never been more pressing. To address global food security concerns, we extend the widely used PlantVillage dataset with additional apple leaf disease classes, enhancing diversity and complexity. Experimental evaluations on both original and extended datasets reveal that existing models struggle with the new additions, highlighting the need for more robust and generalizable computer vision models. Test F1 scores of 99.63% and 97.87% were obtained on the original and extended datasets, respectively. Our study provides a more challenging and diverse benchmark, paving the way for the development of accurate and reliable models for identifying apple leaf diseases under varying imaging conditions. The expanded dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akinyemijoseph/apple-leaf-disease-dataset-6-classes-v2 enabling future research to build upon our findings.

- **Summary**: Automated Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is challenging due to intra-class variations and inter-class similarities. FER can be especially difficult when facial expressions reflect a mixture of various emotions (aka compound expressions). Existing FER datasets, such as AffectNet, provide discrete emotion labels (hard-labels), where a single category of emotion is assigned to an expression. To alleviate inter- and intra-class challenges, as well as provide a better facial expression descriptor, we propose a new approach to create FER datasets through a labeling method in which an image is labeled with more than one emotion (called soft-labels), each with different confidences. Specifically, we introduce the notion of soft-labels for facial expression datasets, a new approach to affective computing for more realistic recognition of facial expressions. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel methodology to accurately calculate soft-labels: a vector representing the extent to which multiple categories of emotion are simultaneously present within a single facial expression. Finding smoother decision boundaries, enabling multi-labeling, and mitigating bias and imbalanced data are some of the advantages of our proposed method. Building upon AffectNet, we introduce AffectNet+, the next-generation facial expression dataset. This dataset contains soft-labels, three categories of data complexity subsets, and additional metadata such as age, gender, ethnicity, head pose, facial landmarks, valence, and arousal. AffectNet+ will be made publicly accessible to researchers.

- **Summary**: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across institutions without sharing sensitive data, making it an attractive solution for medical imaging tasks. However, traditional FL methods, such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), face difficulties in generalizing across domains due to variations in imaging protocols and patient demographics across institutions. This challenge is particularly evident in pancreas MRI segmentation, where anatomical variability and imaging artifacts significantly impact performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of FL algorithms for pancreas MRI segmentation and introduce a novel approach that incorporates adaptive aggregation weights. By dynamically adjusting the contribution of each client during model aggregation, our method accounts for domain-specific differences and improves generalization across heterogeneous datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances segmentation accuracy and reduces the impact of domain shift compared to conventional FL methods while maintaining privacy-preserving capabilities. Significant performance improvements are observed across multiple hospitals (centers).

- **Summary**: Image generation is a prevailing technique for clinical data augmentation for advancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing healthcare disparities. Diffusion Model (DM) has become a leading method in generating synthetic medical images, but it suffers from a critical twofold bias: (1) The quality of images generated for Caucasian individuals is significantly higher, as measured by the Frechet Inception Distance (FID). (2) The ability of the downstream-task learner to learn critical features from disease images varies across different skin tones. These biases pose significant risks, particularly in skin disease detection, where underrepresentation of certain skin tones can lead to misdiagnosis or neglect of specific conditions. To address these challenges, we propose FairSkin, a novel DM framework that mitigates these biases through a three-level resampling mechanism, ensuring fairer representation across racial and disease categories. Our approach significantly improves the diversity and quality of generated images, contributing to more equitable skin disease detection in clinical settings.

- **Summary**: Italian ryegrass is a grass weed commonly found in winter wheat fields that are competitive with winter wheat for moisture and nutrients. Ryegrass can cause substantial reductions in yield and grain quality if not properly controlled with the use of herbicides. To control the cost and environmental impact we detect weeds in drone and satellite imagery. Satellite imagery is too coarse to be used for precision spraying, but can aid in planning drone flights and treatments. Drone images on the other hand have sufficiently good resolution for precision spraying. However, ryegrass is hard to distinguish from the crop and annotation requires expert knowledge. We used the Python segmentation models library to test more than 600 different neural network architectures for weed segmentation in drone images and we map accuracy versus the cost of the model prediction for these. Our best system applies herbicides to over 99% of the weeds while only spraying an area 30% larger than the annotated weed area. These models yield large savings if the weed covers a small part of the field.

- **Summary**: In this work, we designed a completely blind video quality assessment algorithm using the deep video prior. This work mainly explores the utility of deep video prior in estimating the visual quality of the video. In our work, we have used a single distorted video and a reference video pair to learn the deep video prior. At inference time, the learned deep prior is used to restore the original videos from the distorted videos. The ability of learned deep video prior to restore the original video from the distorted video is measured to quantify distortion in the video. Our hypothesis is that the learned deep video prior fails in restoring the highly distorted videos. The restoring ability of deep video prior is proportional to the distortion present in the video. Therefore, we propose to use the distance between the distorted video and the restored video as the perceptual quality of the video. Our algorithm is trained using a single video pair and it does not need any labelled data. We show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing unsupervised video quality assessment algorithms in terms of LCC and SROCC on a synthetically distorted video quality assessment dataset.

- **Summary**: End-to-end vision-based autonomous driving has achieved impressive success, but safety remains a major concern. The safe control problem has been addressed in low-dimensional settings using safety filters, e.g., those based on control barrier functions. Designing safety filters for vision-based controllers in the high-dimensional settings of autonomous driving can similarly alleviate the safety problem, but is significantly more challenging. In this paper, we address this challenge by using frozen pre-trained vision representation models as perception backbones to design vision-based safety filters, inspired by these models' success as backbones of robotic control policies. We empirically evaluate the offline performance of four common pre-trained vision models in this context. We try three existing methods for training safety filters for black-box dynamics, as the dynamics over representation spaces are not known. We use the DeepAccident dataset that consists of action-annotated videos from multiple cameras on vehicles in CARLA simulating real accident scenarios. Our results show that the filters resulting from our approach are competitive with the ones that are given the ground truth state of the ego vehicle and its environment.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) models are remarkable at generating realistic images based on textual descriptions. However, textual prompts are inherently underspecified: they do not specify all possible attributes of the required image. This raises two key questions: Do T2I models generate diverse outputs on underspecified prompts? How can we automatically measure diversity? We propose GRADE: Granular Attribute Diversity Evaluation, an automatic method for quantifying sample diversity. GRADE leverages the world knowledge embedded in large language models and visual question-answering systems to identify relevant concept-specific axes of diversity (e.g., ``shape'' and ``color'' for the concept ``cookie''). It then estimates frequency distributions of concepts and their attributes and quantifies diversity using (normalized) entropy. GRADE achieves over 90% human agreement while exhibiting weak correlation to commonly used diversity metrics. We use GRADE to measure the overall diversity of 12 T2I models using 400 concept-attribute pairs, revealing that all models display limited variation. Further, we find that these models often exhibit default behaviors, a phenomenon where the model consistently generates concepts with the same attributes (e.g., 98% of the cookies are round). Finally, we demonstrate that a key reason for low diversity is due to underspecified captions in training data. Our work proposes a modern, semantically-driven approach to measure sample diversity and highlights the stunning homogeneity in outputs by T2I models.
