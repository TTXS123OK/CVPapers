- **Summary**: Gait recognition is a remote biometric technology that utilizes the dynamic characteristics of human movement to identify individuals even under various extreme lighting conditions. Due to the limitation in spatial perception capability inherent in 2D gait representations, LiDAR can directly capture 3D gait features and represent them as point clouds, reducing environmental and lighting interference in recognition while significantly advancing privacy protection. For complex 3D representations, shallow networks fail to achieve accurate recognition, making vision Transformers the foremost prevalent method. However, the prevalence of dumb patches has limited the widespread use of Transformer architecture in gait recognition. This paper proposes a method named HorGait, which utilizes a hybrid model with a Transformer architecture for gait recognition on the planar projection of 3D point clouds from LiDAR. Specifically, it employs a hybrid model structure called LHM Block to achieve input adaptation, long-range, and high-order spatial interaction of the Transformer architecture. Additionally, it uses large convolutional kernel CNNs to segment the input representation, replacing attention windows to reduce dumb patches. We conducted extensive experiments, and the results show that HorGait achieves state-of-the-art performance among Transformer architecture methods on the SUSTech1K dataset, verifying that the hybrid model can complete the full Transformer process and perform better in point cloud planar projection. The outstanding performance of HorGait offers new insights for the future application of the Transformer architecture in gait recognition.

- **Summary**: Supervised Person Re-identification (Person ReID) methods have achieved excellent performance when training and testing within one camera network. However, they usually suffer from considerable performance degradation when applied to different camera systems. In recent years, many Domain Adaptation Person ReID methods have been proposed, achieving impressive performance without requiring labeled data from the target domain. However, these approaches still need the unlabeled data of the target domain during the training process, making them impractical in many real-world scenarios. Our work focuses on the more practical Domain Generalized Person Re-identification (DG-ReID) problem. Given one or more source domains, it aims to learn a generalized model that can be applied to unseen target domains. One promising research direction in DG-ReID is the use of implicit deep semantic feature expansion, and our previous method, Domain Embedding Expansion (DEX), is one such example that achieves powerful results in DG-ReID. However, in this work we show that DEX and other similar implicit deep semantic feature expansion methods, due to limitations in their proposed loss function, fail to reach their full potential on large evaluation benchmarks as they have a tendency to saturate too early. Leveraging on this analysis, we propose Unified Deep Semantic Expansion, our novel framework that unifies implicit and explicit semantic feature expansion techniques in a single framework to mitigate this early over-fitting and achieve a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in all DG-ReID benchmarks. Further, we apply our method on more general image retrieval tasks, also surpassing the current SOTA in all of these benchmarks by wide margins.

- **Summary**: Person Re-identification (Person ReID) has progressed to a level where single-domain supervised Person ReID performance has saturated. However, such methods experience a significant drop in performance when trained and tested across different datasets, motivating the development of domain generalization techniques. However, our research reveals that domain generalization methods significantly underperform single-domain supervised methods on single dataset benchmarks. An ideal Person ReID method should be effective regardless of the number of domains involved, and when test domain data is available for training it should perform as well as state-of-the-art (SOTA) fully supervised methods. This is a paradigm that we call Omni-Domain Generalization Person ReID (ODG-ReID). We propose a way to achieve ODG-ReID by creating deep feature diversity with self-ensembles. Our method, Diverse Deep Feature Ensemble Learning (D2FEL), deploys unique instance normalization patterns that generate multiple diverse views and recombines these views into a compact encoding. To the best of our knowledge, our work is one of few to consider omni-domain generalization in Person ReID, and we advance the study of applying feature ensembles in Person ReID. D2FEL significantly improves and matches the SOTA performance for major domain generalization and single-domain supervised benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Person Re-identification (Person ReID) has advanced significantly in fully supervised and domain generalized Person R e ID. However, methods developed for one task domain transfer poorly to the other. An ideal Person ReID method should be effective regardless of the number of domains involved in training or testing. Furthermore, given training data from the target domain, it should perform at least as well as state-of-the-art (SOTA) fully supervised Person ReID methods. We call this paradigm Omni-Domain Generalization Person ReID, referred to as ODG-ReID, and propose a way to achieve this by expanding compatible backbone architectures into multiple diverse pathways. Our method, Aligned Divergent Pathways (ADP), first converts a base architecture into a multi-branch structure by copying the tail of the original backbone. We design our module Dynamic Max-Deviance Adaptive Instance Normalization (DyMAIN) that encourages learning of generalized features that are robust to omni-domain directions and apply DyMAIN to the branches of ADP. Our proposed Phased Mixture-of-Cosines (PMoC) coordinates a mix of stable and turbulent learning rate schedules among branches for further diversified learning. Finally, we realign the feature space between branches with our proposed Dimensional Consistency Metric Loss (DCML). ADP outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for multi-source domain generalization and supervised ReID within the same domain. Furthermore, our method demonstrates improvement on a wide range of single-source domain generalization benchmarks, achieving Omni-Domain Generalization over Person ReID tasks.

- **Summary**: A text encoder within Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP plays a crucial role in translating textual input into an embedding space shared with images, thereby facilitating the interpretative analysis of vision tasks through natural language. Despite the varying significance of different textual elements within a sentence depending on the context, efforts to account for variation of importance in constructing text embeddings have been lacking. We propose a framework of Semantic Token Reweighting to build Interpretable text embeddings (SToRI), which incorporates controllability as well. SToRI refines the text encoding process in CLIP by differentially weighting semantic elements based on contextual importance, enabling finer control over emphasis responsive to data-driven insights and user preferences. The efficacy of SToRI is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on few-shot image classification and image retrieval tailored to user preferences.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Engagement estimation plays a crucial role in understanding human social behaviors, attracting increasing research interests in fields such as affective computing and human-computer interaction. In this paper, we propose a Dialogue-Aware Transformer framework (DAT) with Modality-Group Fusion (MGF), which relies solely on audio-visual input and is language-independent, for estimating human engagement in conversations. Specifically, our method employs a modality-group fusion strategy that independently fuses audio and visual features within each modality for each person before inferring the entire audio-visual content. This strategy significantly enhances the model's performance and robustness. Additionally, to better estimate the target participant's engagement levels, the introduced Dialogue-Aware Transformer considers both the participant's behavior and cues from their conversational partners. Our method was rigorously tested in the Multi-Domain Engagement Estimation Challenge held by MultiMediate'24, demonstrating notable improvements in engagement-level regression precision over the baseline model. Notably, our approach achieves a CCC score of 0.76 on the NoXi Base test set and an average CCC of 0.64 across the NoXi Base, NoXi-Add, and MPIIGI test sets.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are advancing the ability to reason about complex sports scenarios by integrating textual and visual information. To comprehensively evaluate their capabilities, we introduce SPORTU, a benchmark designed to assess MLLMs across multi-level sports reasoning tasks. SPORTU comprises two key components: SPORTU-text, featuring 900 multiple-choice questions with human-annotated explanations for rule comprehension and strategy understanding. This component focuses on testing models' ability to reason about sports solely through question-answering (QA), without requiring visual inputs; SPORTU-video, consisting of 1,701 slow-motion video clips across 7 different sports and 12,048 QA pairs, designed to assess multi-level reasoning, from simple sports recognition to complex tasks like foul detection and rule application. We evaluate four prevalent LLMs mainly utilizing few-shot learning paradigms supplemented by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting on the SPORTU-text part. We evaluate four LLMs using few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting on SPORTU-text. GPT-4o achieves the highest accuracy of 71%, but still falls short of human-level performance, highlighting room for improvement in rule comprehension and reasoning. The evaluation for the SPORTU-video part includes 7 proprietary and 6 open-source MLLMs. Experiments show that models fall short on hard tasks that require deep reasoning and rule-based understanding. Claude-3.5-Sonnet performs the best with only 52.6% accuracy on the hard task, showing large room for improvement. We hope that SPORTU will serve as a critical step toward evaluating models' capabilities in sports understanding and reasoning.

- **Summary**: Recently, deep generative models have greatly advanced the progress of face video coding towards promising rate-distortion performance and diverse application functionalities. Beyond traditional hybrid video coding paradigms, Generative Face Video Compression (GFVC) relying on the strong capabilities of deep generative models and the philosophy of early Model-Based Coding (MBC) can facilitate the compact representation and realistic reconstruction of visual face signal, thus achieving ultra-low bitrate face video communication. However, these GFVC algorithms are sometimes faced with unstable reconstruction quality and limited bitrate ranges. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel Progressive Face Video Compression framework, namely PFVC, that utilizes adaptive visual tokens to realize exceptional trade-offs between reconstruction robustness and bandwidth intelligence. In particular, the encoder of the proposed PFVC projects the high-dimensional face signal into adaptive visual tokens in a progressive manner, whilst the decoder can further reconstruct these adaptive visual tokens for motion estimation and signal synthesis with different granularity levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PFVC framework can achieve better coding flexibility and superior rate-distortion performance in comparison with the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC) codec and the state-of-the-art GFVC algorithms.

- **Summary**: Iodinated contrast agents are widely utilized in numerous interventional procedures, yet posing substantial health risks to patients. This paper presents CAS-GAN, a novel GAN framework that serves as a ``virtual contrast agent" to synthesize X-ray angiographies via disentanglement representation learning and vessel semantic guidance, thereby reducing the reliance on iodinated agents during interventional procedures. Specifically, our approach disentangles X-ray angiographies into background and vessel components, leveraging medical prior knowledge. A specialized predictor then learns to map the interrelationships between these components. Additionally, a vessel semantic-guided generator and a corresponding loss function are introduced to enhance the visual fidelity of generated images. Experimental results on the XCAD dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our CAS-GAN, achieving a FID of 5.94 and a MMD of 0.017. These promising results highlight CAS-GAN's potential for clinical applications.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we study weakly-supervised laparoscopic image segmentation with sparse annotations. We introduce a novel Bayesian deep learning approach designed to enhance both the accuracy and interpretability of the model's segmentation, founded upon a comprehensive Bayesian framework, ensuring a robust and theoretically validated method. Our approach diverges from conventional methods that directly train using observed images and their corresponding weak annotations. Instead, we estimate the joint distribution of both images and labels given the acquired data. This facilitates the sampling of images and their high-quality pseudo-labels, enabling the training of a generalizable segmentation model. Each component of our model is expressed through probabilistic formulations, providing a coherent and interpretable structure. This probabilistic nature benefits accurate and practical learning from sparse annotations and equips our model with the ability to quantify uncertainty. Extensive evaluations with two public laparoscopic datasets demonstrated the efficacy of our method, which consistently outperformed existing methods. Furthermore, our method was adapted for scribble-supervised cardiac multi-structure segmentation, presenting competitive performance compared to previous methods.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary multi-object tracking (OVMOT) represents a critical new challenge involving the detection and tracking of diverse object categories in videos, encompassing both seen categories (base classes) and unseen categories (novel classes). This issue amalgamates the complexities of open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) and multi-object tracking (MOT). Existing approaches to OVMOT often merge OVD and MOT methodologies as separate modules, predominantly focusing on the problem through an image-centric lens. In this paper, we propose VOVTrack, a novel method that integrates object states relevant to MOT and video-centric training to address this challenge from a video object tracking standpoint. First, we consider the tracking-related state of the objects during tracking and propose a new prompt-guided attention mechanism for more accurate localization and classification (detection) of the time-varying objects. Subsequently, we leverage raw video data without annotations for training by formulating a self-supervised object similarity learning technique to facilitate temporal object association (tracking). Experimental results underscore that VOVTrack outperforms existing methods, establishing itself as a state-of-the-art solution for open-vocabulary tracking task.

- **Summary**: The growing interest in embodied intelligence has brought ego-centric perspectives to contemporary research. One significant challenge within this realm is the accurate localization and tracking of objects in ego-centric videos, primarily due to the substantial variability in viewing angles. Addressing this issue, this paper introduces a novel zero-shot approach for the 3D reconstruction and tracking of all objects from the ego-centric video. We present Ego3DT, a novel framework that initially identifies and extracts detection and segmentation information of objects within the ego environment. Utilizing information from adjacent video frames, Ego3DT dynamically constructs a 3D scene of the ego view using a pre-trained 3D scene reconstruction model. Additionally, we have innovated a dynamic hierarchical association mechanism for creating stable 3D tracking trajectories of objects in ego-centric videos. Moreover, the efficacy of our approach is corroborated by extensive experiments on two newly compiled datasets, with 1.04x - 2.90x in HOTA, showcasing the robustness and accuracy of our method in diverse ego-centric scenarios.

- **Summary**: Conventional class-guided diffusion models generally succeed in generating images with correct semantic content, but often struggle with texture details. This limitation stems from the usage of class priors, which only provide coarse and limited conditional information. To address this issue, we propose Diffusion on Diffusion (DoD), an innovative multi-stage generation framework that first extracts visual priors from previously generated samples, then provides rich guidance for the diffusion model leveraging visual priors from the early stages of diffusion sampling. Specifically, we introduce a latent embedding module that employs a compression-reconstruction approach to discard redundant detail information from the conditional samples in each stage, retaining only the semantic information for guidance. We evaluate DoD on the popular ImageNet-$256 \times 256$ dataset, reducing 7$\times$ training cost compared to SiT and DiT with even better performance in terms of the FID-50K score. Our largest model DoD-XL achieves an FID-50K score of 1.83 with only 1 million training steps, which surpasses other state-of-the-art methods without bells and whistles during inference.

- **Summary**: The advent of AI has influenced many aspects of human life, from self-driving cars and intelligent chatbots to text-based image and video generation models capable of creating realistic images and videos based on user prompts (text-to-image, image-to-image, and image-to-video). AI-based methods for image and video super resolution, video frame interpolation, denoising, and compression have already gathered significant attention and interest in the industry and some solutions are already being implemented in real-world products and services. However, to achieve widespread integration and acceptance, AI-generated and enhanced content must be visually accurate, adhere to intended use, and maintain high visual quality to avoid degrading the end user's quality of experience (QoE).   One way to monitor and control the visual "quality" of AI-generated and -enhanced content is by deploying Image Quality Assessment (IQA) and Video Quality Assessment (VQA) models. However, most existing IQA and VQA models measure visual fidelity in terms of "reconstruction" quality against a pristine reference content and were not designed to assess the quality of "generative" artifacts. To address this, newer metrics and models have recently been proposed, but their performance evaluation and overall efficacy have been limited by datasets that were too small or otherwise lack representative content and/or distortion capacity; and by performance measures that can accurately report the success of an IQA/VQA model for "GenAI". This paper examines the current shortcomings and possibilities presented by AI-generated and enhanced image and video content, with a particular focus on end-user perceived quality. Finally, we discuss open questions and make recommendations for future work on the "GenAI" quality assessment problems, towards further progressing on this interesting and relevant field of research.

- **Summary**: Anonymization plays a key role in protecting sensible information of individuals in real world datasets. Self-driving cars for example need high resolution facial features to track people and their viewing direction to predict future behaviour and react accordingly. In order to protect people's privacy whilst keeping important features in the dataset, it is important to replace the full body of a person with a highly detailed anonymized one. In contrast to doing face anonymization, full body replacement decreases the ability of recognizing people by their hairstyle or clothes. In this paper, we propose a workflow for full body person anonymization utilizing Stable Diffusion as a generative backend. Text-to-image diffusion models, like Stable Diffusion, OpenAI's DALL-E or Midjourney, have become very popular in recent time, being able to create photorealistic images from a single text prompt. We show that our method outperforms state-of-the art anonymization pipelines with respect to image quality, resolution, Inception Score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Additionally, our method is invariant with respect to the image generator and thus able to be used with the latest models available.

- **Summary**: The salient multimodal capabilities and interactive experience of GPT-4o highlight its critical role in practical applications, yet it lacks a high-performing open-source counterpart. In this paper, we introduce Baichuan-Omni, the first open-source 7B Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adept at concurrently processing and analyzing modalities of image, video, audio, and text, while delivering an advanced multimodal interactive experience and strong performance. We propose an effective multimodal training schema starting with 7B model and proceeding through two stages of multimodal alignment and multitask fine-tuning across audio, image, video, and text modal. This approach equips the language model with the ability to handle visual and audio data effectively. Demonstrating strong performance across various omni-modal and multimodal benchmarks, we aim for this contribution to serve as a competitive baseline for the open-source community in advancing multimodal understanding and real-time interaction.

- **Summary**: Transparent and reflective objects, which are common in our everyday lives, present a significant challenge to 3D imaging techniques due to their unique visual and optical properties. Faced with these types of objects, RGB-D cameras fail to capture the real depth value with their accurate spatial information. To address this issue, we propose DITR, a diffusion-based Depth Inpainting framework specifically designed for Transparent and Reflective objects. This network consists of two stages, including a Region Proposal stage and a Depth Inpainting stage. DITR dynamically analyzes the optical and geometric depth loss and inpaints them automatically. Furthermore, comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that DITR is highly effective in depth inpainting tasks of transparent and reflective objects with robust adaptability.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers with various attention modules have demonstrated superior performance on vision tasks. While using sparsity-adaptive attention, such as in DAT, has yielded strong results in image classification, the key-value pairs selected by deformable points lack semantic relevance when fine-tuning for semantic segmentation tasks. The query-aware sparsity attention in BiFormer seeks to focus each query on top-k routed regions. However, during attention calculation, the selected key-value pairs are influenced by too many irrelevant queries, reducing attention on the more important ones. To address these issues, we propose the Deformable Bi-level Routing Attention (DBRA) module, which optimizes the selection of key-value pairs using agent queries and enhances the interpretability of queries in attention maps. Based on this, we introduce the Deformable Bi-level Routing Attention Transformer (DeBiFormer), a novel general-purpose vision transformer built with the DBRA module. DeBiFormer has been validated on various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, providing strong evidence of its effectiveness.Code is available at {https://github.com/maclong01/DeBiFormer}

- **Summary**: The efficiency of large vision-language models (LVLMs) is constrained by the computational bottleneck of the attention mechanism during the prefill phase and the memory bottleneck of fetching the key-value (KV) cache in the decoding phase, particularly in scenarios involving high-resolution images or videos. Visual content often exhibits substantial redundancy, resulting in highly sparse attention maps within LVLMs. This sparsity can be leveraged to accelerate attention computation or compress the KV cache through various approaches. However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these bottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity concerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an efficient inference framework designed for LVLMs that resolves both computation and memory bottlenecks through a dynamic ratio allocation strategy of important tokens. This ratio is adaptively determined based on the layer-specific distribution of attention scores, rather than fixed hyper-parameters, thereby improving efficiency for less complex tasks while maintaining high performance for more challenging ones. Then we select important tokens based on their normalized attention scores and perform attention mechanism solely on those important tokens to accelerate the prefill phase. To mitigate the memory bottleneck in the decoding phase, we employ mixed-precision quantization to the KV cache, where high-bit quantization is used for caches of important tokens, while low-bit quantization is applied to those of less importance. Our experiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by 2.6$\times$ and reduce GPU memory usage by 50.0%, with a minimal accuracy reduction of only 0.2% on Video-MME benchmark over LongVA-7B model, effectively enhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.

- **Summary**: Automatic medical report generation (MRG), which aims to produce detailed text reports from medical images, has emerged as a critical task in this domain. MRG systems can enhance radiological workflows by reducing the time and effort required for report writing, thereby improving diagnostic efficiency. In this work, we present a novel approach for automatic MRG utilizing a multimodal large language model. Specifically, we employed the 3D Vision Transformer (ViT3D) image encoder introduced from M3D-CLIP to process 3D scans and use the Asclepius-Llama3-8B as the language model to generate the text reports by auto-regressive decoding. The experiment shows our model achieved an average Green score of 0.3 on the MRG task validation set and an average accuracy of 0.61 on the visual question answering (VQA) task validation set, outperforming the baseline model. Our approach demonstrates the effectiveness of the ViT3D alignment of LLaMA3 for automatic MRG and VQA tasks by tuning the model on a small dataset.

- **Summary**: This work tackles the challenge of efficiently selecting high-performance pre-trained vision backbones for specific target tasks. Although exhaustive search within a finite set of backbones can solve this problem, it becomes impractical for large datasets and backbone pools. To address this, we introduce Vision Backbone Efficient Selection (VIBES), which aims to quickly find well-suited backbones, potentially trading off optimality for efficiency. We propose several simple yet effective heuristics to address VIBES and evaluate them across four diverse computer vision datasets. Our results show that these approaches can identify backbones that outperform those selected from generic benchmarks, even within a limited search budget of one hour on a single GPU. We reckon VIBES marks a paradigm shift from benchmarks to task-specific optimization.

- **Summary**: Existing Video Corpus Moment Retrieval (VCMR) is limited to coarse-grained understanding, which hinders precise video moment localization when given fine-grained queries. In this paper, we propose a more challenging fine-grained VCMR benchmark requiring methods to localize the best-matched moment from the corpus with other partially matched candidates. To improve the dataset construction efficiency and guarantee high-quality data annotations, we propose VERIFIED, an automatic \underline{V}id\underline{E}o-text annotation pipeline to generate captions with \underline{R}el\underline{I}able \underline{FI}n\underline{E}-grained statics and \underline{D}ynamics. Specifically, we resort to large language models (LLM) and large multimodal models (LMM) with our proposed Statics and Dynamics Enhanced Captioning modules to generate diverse fine-grained captions for each video. To filter out the inaccurate annotations caused by the LLM hallucination, we propose a Fine-Granularity Aware Noise Evaluator where we fine-tune a video foundation model with disturbed hard-negatives augmented contrastive and matching losses. With VERIFIED, we construct a more challenging fine-grained VCMR benchmark containing Charades-FIG, DiDeMo-FIG, and ActivityNet-FIG which demonstrate a high level of annotation quality. We evaluate several state-of-the-art VCMR models on the proposed dataset, revealing that there is still significant scope for fine-grained video understanding in VCMR.

- **Summary**: Generating realistic images from human texts is one of the most challenging problems in the field of computer vision (CV). The meaning of descriptions given can be roughly reflected by existing text-to-image approaches. In this paper, our main purpose is to propose a brief comparison between five different methods base on the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to make image from the text. In addition, each model architectures synthesis images with different resolution. Furthermore, the best and worst obtained resolutions is 64*64, 256*256 respectively. However, we checked and compared some metrics that introduce the accuracy of each model. Also, by doing this study, we found out the best model for this problem by comparing these different approaches essential metrics.



### Conjugated Semantic Pool Improves OOD Detection with Pre-trained Vision-Language Models

- **Summary**: A straightforward pipeline for zero-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection involves selecting potential OOD labels from an extensive semantic pool and then leveraging a pre-trained vision-language model to perform classification on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD labels. In this paper, we theorize that enhancing performance requires expanding the semantic pool, while increasing the expected probability of selected OOD labels being activated by OOD samples, and ensuring low mutual dependence among the activations of these OOD labels. A natural expansion manner is to adopt a larger lexicon; however, the inevitable introduction of numerous synonyms and uncommon words fails to meet the above requirements, indicating that viable expansion manners move beyond merely selecting words from a lexicon. Since OOD detection aims to correctly classify input images into ID/OOD class groups, we can "make up" OOD label candidates which are not standard class names but beneficial for the process. Observing that the original semantic pool is comprised of unmodified specific class names, we correspondingly construct a conjugated semantic pool (CSP) consisting of modified superclass names, each serving as a cluster center for samples sharing similar properties across different categories. Consistent with our established theory, expanding OOD label candidates with the CSP satisfies the requirements and outperforms existing works by 7.89% in FPR95.

- **Summary**: Sonar image synthesis is crucial for advancing applications in underwater exploration, marine biology, and defence. Traditional methods often rely on extensive and costly data collection using sonar sensors, jeopardizing data quality and diversity. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a new sonar image synthesis framework, Synth-SONAR leveraging diffusion models and GPT prompting. The key novelties of Synth-SONAR are threefold: First, by integrating Generative AI-based style injection techniques along with publicly available real/simulated data, thereby producing one of the largest sonar data corpus for sonar research. Second, a dual text-conditioning sonar diffusion model hierarchy synthesizes coarse and fine-grained sonar images with enhanced quality and diversity. Third, high-level (coarse) and low-level (detailed) text-based sonar generation methods leverage advanced semantic information available in visual language models (VLMs) and GPT-prompting. During inference, the method generates diverse and realistic sonar images from textual prompts, bridging the gap between textual descriptions and sonar image generation. This marks the application of GPT-prompting in sonar imagery for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Synth-SONAR achieves state-of-the-art results in producing high-quality synthetic sonar datasets, significantly enhancing their diversity and realism.

- **Summary**: Given a natural language expression and a remote sensing image, the goal of referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) is to generate a pixel-level mask of the target object identified by the referring expression. In contrast to natural scenarios, expressions in RRSIS often involve complex geospatial relationships, with target objects of interest that vary significantly in scale and lack visual saliency, thereby increasing the difficulty of achieving precise segmentation. To address the aforementioned challenges, a novel RRSIS framework is proposed, termed the cross-modal bidirectional interaction model (CroBIM). Specifically, a context-aware prompt modulation (CAPM) module is designed to integrate spatial positional relationships and task-specific knowledge into the linguistic features, thereby enhancing the ability to capture the target object. Additionally, a language-guided feature aggregation (LGFA) module is introduced to integrate linguistic information into multi-scale visual features, incorporating an attention deficit compensation mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. Finally, a mutual-interaction decoder (MID) is designed to enhance cross-modal feature alignment through cascaded bidirectional cross-attention, thereby enabling precise segmentation mask prediction. To further forster the research of RRSIS, we also construct RISBench, a new large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 52,472 image-language-label triplets. Extensive benchmarking on RISBench and two other prevalent datasets demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed CroBIM over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The source code for CroBIM and the RISBench dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/CroBIM

- **Summary**: Research of adversarial attacks is important for AI security because it shows the vulnerability of deep learning models and helps to build more robust models. Adversarial attacks on images are most widely studied, which include noise-based attacks, image editing-based attacks, and latent space-based attacks. However, the adversarial examples crafted by these methods often lack sufficient semantic information, making it challenging for humans to understand the failure modes of deep learning models under natural conditions. To address this limitation, we propose a natural language induced adversarial image attack method. The core idea is to leverage a text-to-image model to generate adversarial images given input prompts, which are maliciously constructed to lead to misclassification for a target model. To adopt commercial text-to-image models for synthesizing more natural adversarial images, we propose an adaptive genetic algorithm (GA) for optimizing discrete adversarial prompts without requiring gradients and an adaptive word space reduction method for improving query efficiency. We further used CLIP to maintain the semantic consistency of the generated images. In our experiments, we found that some high-frequency semantic information such as "foggy", "humid", "stretching", etc. can easily cause classifier errors. This adversarial semantic information exists not only in generated images but also in photos captured in the real world. We also found that some adversarial semantic information can be transferred to unknown classification tasks. Furthermore, our attack method can transfer to different text-to-image models (e.g., Midjourney, DALL-E 3, etc.) and image classifiers. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zxp555/Natural-Language-Induced-Adversarial-Images.

We introduce an efficient deep learning model for precipitation nowcasting, capable of predicting rainfall up to 8 hours in advance with greater accuracy than existing operational physics-based and extrapolation-based models. Our model leverages multi-source meteorological data and physics-based forecasts to deliver high-resolution predictions in both time and space. It captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics through temporal attention networks and is optimized using data quality maps and dynamic thresholds. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art, and highlight its potential for fast reliable responses to evolving weather conditions.

- **Summary**: Research on conspiracy theories and related content online has traditionally focused on textual data. To address the increasing prevalence of (audio-)visual data on social media, and to capture the evolving and dynamic nature of this communication, researchers have begun to explore the potential of unsupervised approaches for analyzing multimodal online content. Our research contributes to this field by exploring the potential of multimodal topic modeling for analyzing conspiracy theories in German-language Telegram channels. Our work uses the BERTopic topic modeling approach in combination with CLIP for the analysis of textual and visual data. We analyze a corpus of ~40, 000 Telegram messages posted in October 2023 in 571 German-language Telegram channels known for disseminating conspiracy theories and other deceptive content. We explore the potentials and challenges of this approach for studying a medium-sized corpus of user-generated, text-image online content. We offer insights into the dominant topics across modalities, different text and image genres discovered during the analysis, quantitative inter-modal topic analyses, and a qualitative case study of textual, visual, and multimodal narrative strategies in the communication of conspiracy theories.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary object detection is the task of accurately detecting objects from a candidate vocabulary list that includes both base and novel categories. Currently, numerous open-vocabulary detectors have achieved success by leveraging the impressive zero-shot capabilities of CLIP. However, we observe that CLIP models struggle to effectively handle background images (i.e. images without corresponding labels) due to their language-image learning methodology. This limitation results in suboptimal performance for open-vocabulary detectors that rely on CLIP when processing background samples. In this paper, we propose Background Information Representation for open-vocabulary Detector (BIRDet), a novel approach to address the limitations of CLIP in handling background samples. Specifically, we design Background Information Modeling (BIM) to replace the single, fixed background embedding in mainstream open-vocabulary detectors with dynamic scene information, and prompt it into image-related background representations. This method effectively enhances the ability to classify oversized regions as background. Besides, we introduce Partial Object Suppression (POS), an algorithm that utilizes the ratio of overlap area to address the issue of misclassifying partial regions as foreground. Experiments on OV-COCO and OV-LVIS benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed model is capable of achieving performance enhancements across various open-vocabulary detectors.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing dynamic MRI image sequences from undersampled accelerated measurements is crucial for faster and higher spatiotemporal resolution real-time imaging of cardiac motion, free breathing motion and many other applications. Classical paradigms, such as gated cine MRI, assume periodicity, disallowing imaging of true motion. Supervised deep learning methods are fundamentally flawed as, in dynamic imaging, ground truth fully-sampled videos are impossible to truly obtain. We propose an unsupervised framework to learn to reconstruct dynamic MRI sequences from undersampled measurements alone by leveraging natural geometric spatiotemporal equivariances of MRI. Dynamic Diffeomorphic Equivariant Imaging (DDEI) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods such as SSDU on highly accelerated dynamic cardiac imaging. Our method is agnostic to the underlying neural network architecture and can be used to adapt the latest models and post-processing approaches.

- **Summary**: Forecasting a typical object's future motion is a critical task for interpreting and interacting with dynamic environments in computer vision. Event-based sensors, which could capture changes in the scene with exceptional temporal granularity, may potentially offer a unique opportunity to predict future motion with a level of detail and precision previously unachievable. Inspired by that, we propose to integrate the strong learning capacity of the video diffusion model with the rich motion information of an event camera as a motion simulation framework. Specifically, we initially employ pre-trained stable video diffusion models to adapt the event sequence dataset. This process facilitates the transfer of extensive knowledge from RGB videos to an event-centric domain. Moreover, we introduce an alignment mechanism that utilizes reinforcement learning techniques to enhance the reverse generation trajectory of the diffusion model, ensuring improved performance and accuracy. Through extensive testing and validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various complex scenarios, showcasing its potential to revolutionize motion flow prediction in computer vision applications such as autonomous vehicle guidance, robotic navigation, and interactive media. Our findings suggest a promising direction for future research in enhancing the interpretative power and predictive accuracy of computer vision systems.

- **Summary**: Predicting the future motion of surrounding agents is essential for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to operate safely in dynamic, human-robot-mixed environments. However, the scarcity of large-scale driving datasets has hindered the development of robust and generalizable motion prediction models, limiting their ability to capture complex interactions and road geometries. Inspired by recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), self-supervised learning (SSL) has gained significant attention in the motion prediction community for learning rich and transferable scene representations. Nonetheless, existing pre-training methods for motion prediction have largely focused on specific model architectures and single dataset, limiting their scalability and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose SmartPretrain, a general and scalable SSL framework for motion prediction that is both model-agnostic and dataset-agnostic. Our approach integrates contrastive and reconstructive SSL, leveraging the strengths of both generative and discriminative paradigms to effectively represent spatiotemporal evolution and interactions without imposing architectural constraints. Additionally, SmartPretrain employs a dataset-agnostic scenario sampling strategy that integrates multiple datasets, enhancing data volume, diversity, and robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that SmartPretrain consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art prediction models across datasets, data splits and main metrics. For instance, SmartPretrain significantly reduces the MissRate of Forecast-MAE by 10.6%. These results highlight SmartPretrain's effectiveness as a unified, scalable solution for motion prediction, breaking free from the limitations of the small-data regime.

- **Summary**: The advent of intelligent mobile applications highlights the crucial demand for deploying powerful deep learning models on resource-constrained mobile devices. An effective solution in this context is the device-edge co-inference framework, which partitions a deep neural network between a mobile device and a nearby edge server. This approach requires balancing on-device computations and communication costs, often achieved through compressed intermediate feature transmission. Conventional deep neural network architectures require continuous data processing, leading to substantial energy consumption by edge devices. This motivates exploring binary, event-driven activations enabled by spiking neural networks (SNNs), known for their extremely energy efficiency. In this research, we propose a novel architecture named SpikeBottleNet, a significant improvement to the existing architecture by integrating SNNs. A key aspect of our investigation is the development of an intermediate feature compression technique specifically designed for SNNs. This technique leverages a split computing approach for SNNs to partition complex architectures, such as Spike ResNet50. By incorporating the power of SNNs within device-edge co-inference systems, experimental results demonstrate that our SpikeBottleNet achieves a significant bit compression ratio of up to 256x in the final convolutional layer while maintaining high classification accuracy with only a 2.5% reduction. Moreover, compared to the baseline BottleNet++ architecture, our framework reduces the transmitted feature size at earlier splitting points by 75%. Furthermore, in terms of the energy efficiency of edge devices, our methodology surpasses the baseline by a factor of up to 98, demonstrating significant enhancements in both efficiency and performance.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates the recognition of the Russian fingerspelling alphabet, also known as the Russian Sign Language (RSL) dactyl. Dactyl is a component of sign languages where distinct hand movements represent individual letters of a written language. This method is used to spell words without specific signs, such as proper nouns or technical terms. The alphabet learning simulator is an essential isolated dactyl recognition application. There is a notable issue of data shortage in isolated dactyl recognition: existing Russian dactyl datasets lack subject heterogeneity, contain insufficient samples, or cover only static signs. We provide Bukva, the first full-fledged open-source video dataset for RSL dactyl recognition. It contains 3,757 videos with more than 101 samples for each RSL alphabet sign, including dynamic ones. We utilized crowdsourcing platforms to increase the subject's heterogeneity, resulting in the participation of 155 deaf and hard-of-hearing experts in the dataset creation. We use a TSM (Temporal Shift Module) block to handle static and dynamic signs effectively, achieving 83.6% top-1 accuracy with a real-time inference with CPU only. The dataset, demo code, and pre-trained models are publicly available.

- **Summary**: Quantum computing has introduced novel perspectives for tackling and improving machine learning tasks. Moreover, the integration of quantum technologies together with well-known deep learning (DL) architectures has emerged as a potential research trend gaining attraction across various domains, such as Earth Observation (EO) and many other research fields. However, prior related works in EO literature have mainly focused on convolutional architectural advancements, leaving several essential topics unexplored. Consequently, this research investigates through three cases of study fundamental aspects of hybrid quantum machine models for EO tasks aiming to provide a solid groundwork for future research studies towards more adequate simulations and looking at the post-NISQ era. More in detail, we firstly (1) investigate how different quantum libraries behave when training hybrid quantum models, assessing their computational efficiency and effectiveness. Secondly, (2) we analyze the stability/sensitivity to initialization values (i.e., seed values) in both traditional model and quantum-enhanced counterparts. Finally, (3) we explore the benefits of hybrid quantum attention-based models in EO applications, examining how integrating quantum circuits into ViTs can improve model performance.

- **Summary**: Recently, 3D LiDAR has emerged as a promising technique in the field of gait-based person identification, serving as an alternative to traditional RGB cameras, due to its robustness under varying lighting conditions and its ability to capture 3D geometric information. However, long capture distances or the use of low-cost LiDAR sensors often result in sparse human point clouds, leading to a decline in identification performance. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse-to-dense upsampling model for pedestrian point clouds in LiDAR-based gait recognition, named LidarGSU, which is designed to improve the generalization capability of existing identification models. Our method utilizes diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs), which have shown high fidelity in generative tasks such as image completion. In this work, we leverage DPMs on sparse sequential pedestrian point clouds as conditional masks in a video-to-video translation approach, applied in an inpainting manner. We conducted extensive experiments on the SUSTeck1K dataset to evaluate the generative quality and recognition performance of the proposed method. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our upsampling model using a real-world dataset, captured with a low-resolution sensor across varying measurement distances.

- **Summary**: Safe navigation in new environments requires autonomous vehicles and robots to accurately interpret their surroundings, relying on LiDAR scene segmentation, out-of-distribution (OOD) obstacle detection, and uncertainty computation. We propose a method to distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OOD samples and quantify both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties using the feature space of a single deterministic model. After training a semantic segmentation network, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is fitted to its feature space. OOD samples are detected by checking if their squared Mahalanobis distances to each Gaussian component conform to a chi-squared distribution, eliminating the need for an additional OOD training set. Given that the estimated mean and covariance matrix of a multivariate Gaussian distribution follow Gaussian and Inverse-Wishart distributions, multiple GMMs are generated by sampling from these distributions to assess epistemic uncertainty through classification variability. Aleatoric uncertainty is derived from the entropy of responsibility values within Gaussian components. Comparing our method with deep ensembles and logit-sampling for uncertainty computation demonstrates its superior performance in real-world applications for quantifying epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, as well as detecting OOD samples. While deep ensembles miss some highly uncertain samples, our method successfully detects them and assigns high epistemic uncertainty.

- **Summary**: Despite previous works typically targeting isolated degradation types, recent research has increasingly focused on addressing composite degradations which involve a complex interplay of multiple different isolated degradations. Recognizing the challenges posed by the exponential number of possible degradation combinations, we propose Universal Image Restoration (UIR), a new task setting that requires models to be trained on a set of degradation bases and then remove any degradation that these bases can potentially compose in a zero-shot manner. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought which prompts LLMs to address problems step-by-step, we propose the Chain-of-Restoration (CoR), which instructs models to step-by-step remove unknown composite degradations. By integrating a simple Degradation Discriminator into pre-trained multi-task models, CoR facilitates the process where models remove one degradation basis per step, continuing this process until the image is fully restored from the unknown composite degradation. Extensive experiments show that CoR significantly improves model performance in removing composite degradations, achieving results comparable to or surpassing those of State-of-The-Art (SoTA) methods trained on all degradations. The code will be released at https://github.com/toummHus/Chain-of-Restoration.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across multimodal tasks such as visual perception and reasoning, leading to good performance on various multimodal evaluation benchmarks. However, these benchmarks keep a static nature and overlap with the pre-training data, resulting in fixed complexity constraints and data contamination issues. This raises the concern regarding the validity of the evaluation. To address these two challenges, we introduce a dynamic multimodal evaluation protocol called Vision-Language Bootstrapping (VLB). VLB provides a robust and comprehensive assessment for LVLMs with reduced data contamination and flexible complexity. To this end, VLB dynamically generates new visual question-answering samples through a multimodal bootstrapping module that modifies both images and language, while ensuring that newly generated samples remain consistent with the original ones by a judge module. By composing various bootstrapping strategies, VLB offers dynamic variants of existing benchmarks with diverse complexities, enabling the evaluation to co-evolve with the ever-evolving capabilities of LVLMs. Extensive experimental results across multiple benchmarks, including SEEDBench, MMBench, and MME, show that VLB significantly reduces data contamination and exposes performance limitations of LVLMs.

- **Summary**: Maritime obstacle detection aims to detect possible obstacles for autonomous driving of unmanned surface vehicles. In the context of maritime obstacle detection, the water surface can act like a mirror on certain circumstances, causing reflections on imagery. Previous works have indicated surface reflections as a source of false positives for object detectors in maritime obstacle detection tasks. In this work, we show that surface reflections indeed adversely affect detector performance. We measure the effect of reflections by testing on two custom datasets, which we make publicly available. The first one contains imagery with reflections, while in the second reflections are inpainted. We show that the reflections reduce mAP by 1.2 to 9.6 points across various detectors. To remove false positives on reflections, we propose a novel filtering approach named Heatmap Based Sliding Filter. We show that the proposed method reduces the total number of false positives by 34.64% while minimally affecting true positives. We also conduct qualitative analysis and show that the proposed method indeed removes false positives on the reflections. The datasets can be found on https://github.com/SamedYalcin/MRAD.

- **Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) has become a cornerstone of privacy protection, shifting the paradigm towards localizing sensitive data while only sending model gradients to a central server. This strategy is designed to reinforce privacy protections and minimize the vulnerabilities inherent in centralized data storage systems. Despite its innovative approach, recent empirical studies have highlighted potential weaknesses in FL, notably regarding the exchange of gradients. In response, this study introduces a novel, efficacious method aimed at safeguarding against gradient leakage, namely, ``AdaDefense". Following the idea that model convergence can be achieved by using different types of optimization methods, we suggest using a local stand-in rather than the actual local gradient for global gradient aggregation on the central server. This proposed approach not only effectively prevents gradient leakage, but also ensures that the overall performance of the model remains largely unaffected. Delving into the theoretical dimensions, we explore how gradients may inadvertently leak private information and present a theoretical framework supporting the efficacy of our proposed method. Extensive empirical tests, supported by popular benchmark experiments, validate that our approach maintains model integrity and is robust against gradient leakage, marking an important step in our pursuit of safe and efficient FL.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving necessitates advanced object detection techniques that integrate information from multiple modalities to overcome the limitations associated with single-modal approaches. The challenges of aligning diverse data in early fusion and the complexities, along with overfitting issues introduced by deep fusion, underscore the efficacy of late fusion at the decision level. Late fusion ensures seamless integration without altering the original detector's network structure. This paper introduces a pioneering Multi-modal Multi-class Late Fusion method, designed for late fusion to enable multi-class detection. Fusion experiments conducted on the KITTI validation and official test datasets illustrate substantial performance improvements, presenting our model as a versatile solution for multi-modal object detection in autonomous driving. Moreover, our approach incorporates uncertainty analysis into the classification fusion process, rendering our model more transparent and trustworthy and providing more reliable insights into category predictions.

- **Summary**: Specimen associated biodiversity data are sought after for biological, environmental, climate, and conservation sciences. A rate shift is required for the extraction of data from specimen images to eliminate the bottleneck that the reliance on human-mediated transcription of these data represents. We applied advanced computer vision techniques to develop the `Hespi' (HErbarium Specimen sheet PIpeline), which extracts a pre-catalogue subset of collection data on the institutional labels on herbarium specimens from their digital images. The pipeline integrates two object detection models; the first detects bounding boxes around text-based labels and the second detects bounding boxes around text-based data fields on the primary institutional label. The pipeline classifies text-based institutional labels as printed, typed, handwritten, or a combination and applies Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) for data extraction. The recognized text is then corrected against authoritative databases of taxon names. The extracted text is also corrected with the aide of a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM). Hespi accurately detects and extracts text for test datasets including specimen sheet images from international herbaria. The components of the pipeline are modular and users can train their own models with their own data and use them in place of the models provided.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as a powerful tool for fast and accurate novel-view synthesis from a set of posed input images. However, like most novel-view synthesis approaches, it relies on accurate camera pose information, limiting its applicability in real-world scenarios where acquiring accurate camera poses can be challenging or even impossible. We propose an extension to the 3D Gaussian Splatting framework by optimizing the extrinsic camera parameters with respect to photometric residuals. We derive the analytical gradients and integrate their computation with the existing high-performance CUDA implementation. This enables downstream tasks such as 6-DoF camera pose estimation as well as joint reconstruction and camera refinement. In particular, we achieve rapid convergence and high accuracy for pose estimation on real-world scenes. Our method enables fast reconstruction of 3D scenes without requiring accurate pose information by jointly optimizing geometry and camera poses, while achieving state-of-the-art results in novel-view synthesis. Our approach is considerably faster to optimize than most competing methods, and several times faster in rendering. We show results on real-world scenes and complex trajectories through simulated environments, achieving state-of-the-art results on LLFF while reducing runtime by two to four times compared to the most efficient competing method.

- **Summary**: The advancement of multi-object tracking (MOT) technologies presents the dual challenge of maintaining high performance while addressing critical security and privacy concerns. In applications such as pedestrian tracking, where sensitive personal data is involved, the potential for privacy violations and data misuse becomes a significant issue if data is transmitted to external servers. To mitigate these risks, processing data directly on an edge device, such as a smart camera, has emerged as a viable solution. Edge computing ensures that sensitive information remains local, thereby aligning with stringent privacy principles and significantly reducing network latency. However, the implementation of MOT on edge devices is not without its challenges. Edge devices typically possess limited computational resources, necessitating the development of highly optimized algorithms capable of delivering real-time performance under these constraints. The disparity between the computational requirements of state-of-the-art MOT algorithms and the capabilities of edge devices emphasizes a significant obstacle. To address these challenges, we propose a neural network pruning method specifically tailored to compress complex networks, such as those used in modern MOT systems. This approach optimizes MOT performance by ensuring high accuracy and efficiency within the constraints of limited edge devices, such as NVIDIA's Jetson Orin Nano. By applying our pruning method, we achieve model size reductions of up to 70% while maintaining a high level of accuracy and further improving performance on the Jetson Orin Nano, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for edge computing applications.

- **Summary**: We present a novel Hand-pose Embedding Interactive System (HpEIS) as a virtual sensor, which maps users' flexible hand poses to a two-dimensional visual space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on a variety of hand poses. HpEIS enables visually interpretable and guidable support for user explorations in multimedia collections, using only a camera as an external hand pose acquisition device. We identify general usability issues associated with system stability and smoothing requirements through pilot experiments with expert and inexperienced users. We then design stability and smoothing improvements, including hand-pose data augmentation, an anti-jitter regularisation term added to loss function, stabilising post-processing for movement turning points and smoothing post-processing based on One Euro Filters. In target selection experiments (n=12), we evaluate HpEIS by measures of task completion time and the final distance to target points, with and without the gesture guidance window condition. Experimental responses indicate that HpEIS provides users with a learnable, flexible, stable and smooth mid-air hand movement interaction experience.

- **Summary**: Video segmentation is essential for advancing robotics and autonomous driving, particularly in open-world settings where continuous perception and object association across video frames are critical. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has excelled in static image segmentation, extending its capabilities to video segmentation poses significant challenges. We tackle two major hurdles: a) SAM's embedding limitations in associating objects across frames, and b) granularity inconsistencies in object segmentation. To this end, we introduce VideoSAM, an end-to-end framework designed to address these challenges by improving object tracking and segmentation consistency in dynamic environments. VideoSAM integrates an agglomerated backbone, RADIO, enabling object association through similarity metrics and introduces Cycle-ack-Pairs Propagation with a memory mechanism for stable object tracking. Additionally, we incorporate an autoregressive object-token mechanism within the SAM decoder to maintain consistent granularity across frames. Our method is extensively evaluated on the UVO and BURST benchmarks, and robotic videos from RoboTAP, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. All codes will be available.

- **Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently been adopted in robotics for their capability in common sense reasoning and generalizability. Existing work has applied VLMs to generate task and motion planning from natural language instructions and simulate training data for robot learning. In this work, we explore using VLM to interpret human demonstration videos and generate robot task planning. Our method integrates keyframe selection, visual perception, and VLM reasoning into a pipeline. We named it SeeDo because it enables the VLM to ''see'' human demonstrations and explain the corresponding plans to the robot for it to ''do''. To validate our approach, we collected a set of long-horizon human videos demonstrating pick-and-place tasks in three diverse categories and designed a set of metrics to comprehensively benchmark SeeDo against several baselines, including state-of-the-art video-input VLMs. The experiments demonstrate SeeDo's superior performance. We further deployed the generated task plans in both a simulation environment and on a real robot arm.

- **Summary**: Multimodal attributed graphs (MAGs) are prevalent in various real-world scenarios and generally contain two kinds of knowledge: (a) Attribute knowledge is mainly supported by the attributes of different modalities contained in nodes (entities) themselves, such as texts and images. (b) Topology knowledge, on the other hand, is provided by the complex interactions posed between nodes. The cornerstone of MAG representation learning lies in the seamless integration of multimodal attributes and topology. Recent advancements in Pre-trained Language/Vision models (PLMs/PVMs) and Graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated effective learning on MAGs, garnering increased research interest. However, the absence of meaningful benchmark datasets and standardized evaluation procedures for MAG representation learning has impeded progress in this field. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Attribute Graph Benchmark (MAGB)}, a comprehensive and diverse collection of challenging benchmark datasets for MAGs. The MAGB datasets are notably large in scale and encompass a wide range of domains, spanning from e-commerce networks to social networks. In addition to the brand-new datasets, we conduct extensive benchmark experiments over MAGB with various learning paradigms, ranging from GNN-based and PLM-based methods, to explore the necessity and feasibility of integrating multimodal attributes and graph topology. In a nutshell, we provide an overview of the MAG datasets, standardized evaluation procedures, and present baseline experiments.

- **Summary**: Swift and accurate blood smear analysis is an effective diagnostic method for leukemia and other hematological malignancies. However, manual leukocyte count and morphological evaluation using a microscope is time-consuming and prone to errors. Conventional image processing methods also exhibit limitations in differentiating cells due to the visual similarity between malignant and benign cell morphology. This limitation is further compounded by the skewed training data that hinders the extraction of reliable and pertinent features. In response to these challenges, we propose an optimized Coupled Transformer Convolutional Network (CoTCoNet) framework for the classification of leukemia, which employs a well-designed transformer integrated with a deep convolutional network to effectively capture comprehensive global features and scalable spatial patterns, enabling the identification of complex and large-scale hematological features. Further, the framework incorporates a graph-based feature reconstruction module to reveal the hidden or unobserved hard-to-see biological features of leukocyte cells and employs a Population-based Meta-Heuristic Algorithm for feature selection and optimization. To mitigate data imbalance issues, we employ a synthetic leukocyte generator. In the evaluation phase, we initially assess CoTCoNet on a dataset containing 16,982 annotated cells, and it achieves remarkable accuracy and F1-Score rates of 0.9894 and 0.9893, respectively. To broaden the generalizability of our model, we evaluate it across four publicly available diverse datasets, which include the aforementioned dataset. This evaluation demonstrates that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches. We also incorporate an explainability approach in the form of feature visualization closely aligned with cell annotations to provide a deeper understanding of the framework.

- **Summary**: Due to the nature of enhancement--the absence of paired ground-truth information, high-level vision tasks have been recently employed to evaluate the performance of low-light image enhancement. A widely-used manner is to see how accurately an object detector trained on enhanced low-light images by different candidates can perform with respect to annotated semantic labels. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the mentioned approach is generally prone to overfitting, and thus diminishes its measurement reliability. In search of a proper evaluation metric, we propose LIME-Bench, the first online benchmark platform designed to collect human preferences for low-light enhancement, providing a valuable dataset for validating the correlation between human perception and automated evaluation metrics. We then customize LIME-Eval, a novel evaluation framework that utilizes detectors pre-trained on standard-lighting datasets without object annotations, to judge the quality of enhanced images. By adopting an energy-based strategy to assess the accuracy of output confidence maps, our LIME-Eval can simultaneously bypass biases associated with retraining detectors and circumvent the reliance on annotations for dim images. Comprehensive experiments are provided to reveal the effectiveness of our LIME-Eval. Our benchmark platform (https://huggingface.co/spaces/lime-j/eval) and code (https://github.com/lime-j/lime-eval) are available online.

- **Summary**: 3D-aware image generation necessitates extensive training data to ensure stable training and mitigate the risk of overfitting. This paper first considers a novel task known as One-shot 3D Generative Domain Adaptation (GDA), aimed at transferring a pre-trained 3D generator from one domain to a new one, relying solely on a single reference image. One-shot 3D GDA is characterized by the pursuit of specific attributes, namely, high fidelity, large diversity, cross-domain consistency, and multi-view consistency. Within this paper, we introduce 3D-Adapter, the first one-shot 3D GDA method, for diverse and faithful generation. Our approach begins by judiciously selecting a restricted weight set for fine-tuning, and subsequently leverages four advanced loss functions to facilitate adaptation. An efficient progressive fine-tuning strategy is also implemented to enhance the adaptation process. The synergy of these three technological components empowers 3D-Adapter to achieve remarkable performance, substantiated both quantitatively and qualitatively, across all desired properties of 3D GDA. Furthermore, 3D-Adapter seamlessly extends its capabilities to zero-shot scenarios, and preserves the potential for crucial tasks such as interpolation, reconstruction, and editing within the latent space of the pre-trained generator. Code will be available at https://github.com/iceli1007/3D-Adapter.

- **Summary**: In this contribution, we define (and test) a pipeline to perform virtual painting recolouring using raw data of X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis on pictorial artworks. To circumvent the small dataset size, we generate a synthetic dataset, starting from a database of XRF spectra; furthermore, to ensure a better generalisation capacity (and to tackle the issue of in-memory size and inference time), we define a Deep Variational Embedding network to embed the XRF spectra into a lower dimensional, K-Means friendly, metric space.   We thus train a set of models to assign coloured images to embedded XRF images. We report here the devised pipeline performances in terms of visual quality metrics, and we close on a discussion on the results.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose to create animatable avatars for interacting hands with 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and single-image inputs. Existing GS-based methods designed for single subjects often yield unsatisfactory results due to limited input views, various hand poses, and occlusions. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel two-stage interaction-aware GS framework that exploits cross-subject hand priors and refines 3D Gaussians in interacting areas. Particularly, to handle hand variations, we disentangle the 3D presentation of hands into optimization-based identity maps and learning-based latent geometric features and neural texture maps. Learning-based features are captured by trained networks to provide reliable priors for poses, shapes, and textures, while optimization-based identity maps enable efficient one-shot fitting of out-of-distribution hands. Furthermore, we devise an interaction-aware attention module and a self-adaptive Gaussian refinement module. These modules enhance image rendering quality in areas with intra- and inter-hand interactions, overcoming the limitations of existing GS-based methods. Our proposed method is validated via extensive experiments on the large-scale InterHand2.6M dataset, and it significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance in image quality.

- **Summary**: Audio descriptions (ADs) function as acoustic commentaries designed to assist blind persons and persons with visual impairments in accessing digital media content on television and in movies, among other settings. As an accessibility service typically provided by trained AD professionals, the generation of ADs demands significant human effort, making the process both time-consuming and costly. Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), particularly in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), have allowed for getting a step closer to automatic AD generation. This paper reviews the technologies pertinent to AD generation in the era of LLMs and VLMs: we discuss how state-of-the-art NLP and CV technologies can be applied to generate ADs and identify essential research directions for the future.

- **Summary**: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the interpretation of chest X-ray (CXR) images by providing robust tools for disease diagnosis. However, the effectiveness of these AI models is often limited by their reliance on large amounts of task-specific labeled data and their inability to generalize across diverse clinical settings. To address these challenges, we introduce CXRBase, a foundational model designed to learn versatile representations from unlabelled CXR images, facilitating efficient adaptation to various clinical tasks. CXRBase is initially trained on a substantial dataset of 1.04 million unlabelled CXR images using self-supervised learning methods. This approach allows the model to discern meaningful patterns without the need for explicit labels. After this initial phase, CXRBase is fine-tuned with labeled data to enhance its performance in disease detection, enabling accurate classification of chest diseases. CXRBase provides a generalizable solution to improve model performance and alleviate the annotation workload of experts to enable broad clinical AI applications from chest imaging.

In this paper, we leverage deep learning techniques to tackle the complexities of Q-distribution prediction. Specifically, we explore multimodal fusion methods in computer vision, integrating 2D line image data with the original 1D data to form a bimodal input. Additionally, we employ the Transformer's attention mechanism for feature extraction and the interactive fusion of bimodal information. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly reducing prediction errors in Q-distribution.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in foundation models show promising capability in graphic design generation. Several studies have started employing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to evaluate graphic designs, assuming that LMMs can properly assess their quality, but it is unclear if the evaluation is reliable. One way to evaluate the quality of graphic design is to assess whether the design adheres to fundamental graphic design principles, which are the designer's common practice. In this paper, we compare the behavior of GPT-based evaluation and heuristic evaluation based on design principles using human annotations collected from 60 subjects. Our experiments reveal that, while GPTs cannot distinguish small details, they have a reasonably good correlation with human annotation and exhibit a similar tendency to heuristic metrics based on design principles, suggesting that they are indeed capable of assessing the quality of graphic design.

- **Summary**: Cache-based approaches stand out as both effective and efficient for adapting vision-language models (VLMs). Nonetheless, the existing cache model overlooks three crucial aspects. 1) Pre-trained VLMs are mainly optimized for image-text similarity, neglecting the importance of image-image similarity, leading to a gap between pre-training and adaptation. 2) The current cache model is based on the Nadaraya-Watson (N-W) estimator, which disregards the intricate relationships among training samples while constructing weight function. 3) Under the condition of limited samples, the logits generated by cache model are of high uncertainty, directly using these logits without accounting for the confidence could be problematic. This work presents three calibration modules aimed at addressing the above challenges. Similarity Calibration refines the image-image similarity by using unlabeled images. We add a learnable projection layer with residual connection on top of the pre-trained image encoder of CLIP and optimize the parameters by minimizing self-supervised contrastive loss. Weight Calibration introduces a precision matrix into the weight function to adequately model the relation between training samples, transforming the existing cache model to a Gaussian Process (GP) regressor, which could be more accurate than N-W estimator. Confidence Calibration leverages the predictive variances computed by GP Regression to dynamically re-scale the logits of cache model, ensuring that the cache model's outputs are appropriately adjusted based on their confidence levels. Besides, to reduce the high complexity of GPs, we further propose a group-based learning strategy. Integrating the above designs, we propose both training-free and training-required variants. Extensive experiments on 11 few-shot classification datasets validate that the proposed methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Hyperparameter selection is an essential aspect of the machine learning pipeline, profoundly impacting models' robustness, stability, and generalization capabilities. Given the complex hyperparameter spaces associated with Neural Networks and the constraints of computational resources and time, optimizing all hyperparameters becomes impractical. In this context, leveraging hyperparameter importance assessment (HIA) can provide valuable guidance by narrowing down the search space. This enables machine learning practitioners to focus their optimization efforts on the hyperparameters with the most significant impact on model performance while conserving time and resources. This paper aims to quantify the importance weights of some hyperparameters in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with an algorithm called N-RReliefF, laying the groundwork for applying HIA methodologies in the Deep Learning field. We conduct an extensive study by training over ten thousand CNN models across ten popular image classification datasets, thereby acquiring a comprehensive dataset containing hyperparameter configuration instances and their corresponding performance metrics. It is demonstrated that among the investigated hyperparameters, the top five important hyperparameters of the CNN model are the number of convolutional layers, learning rate, dropout rate, optimizer and epoch.

- **Summary**: Prototype Learning methods provide an interpretable alternative to black-box deep learning models. Approaches such as ProtoPNet learn, which part of a test image "look like" known prototypical parts from training images, combining predictive power with the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning. However, existing approaches have two main drawbacks: A) They rely solely on deterministic similarity scores without statistical confidence. B) The prototypes are learned in a black-box manner without human input. This work introduces HyperPg, a new prototype representation leveraging Gaussian distributions on a hypersphere in latent space, with learnable mean and variance. HyperPg prototypes adapt to the spread of clusters in the latent space and output likelihood scores. The new architecture, HyperPgNet, leverages HyperPg to learn prototypes aligned with human concepts from pixel-level annotations. Consequently, each prototype represents a specific concept such as color, image texture, or part of the image subject. A concept extraction pipeline built on foundation models provides pixel-level annotations, significantly reducing human labeling effort. Experiments on CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets demonstrate that HyperPgNet outperforms other prototype learning architectures while using fewer parameters and training steps. Additionally, the concept-aligned HyperPg prototypes are learned transparently, enhancing model interpretability.

- **Summary**: We explore the transformative potential of SAM 2, a vision foundation model, in advancing gaze estimation and eye tracking technologies. By significantly reducing annotation time, lowering technical barriers through its ease of deployment, and enhancing segmentation accuracy, SAM 2 addresses critical challenges faced by researchers and practitioners. Utilizing its zero-shot segmentation capabilities with minimal user input-a single click per video-we tested SAM 2 on over 14 million eye images from diverse datasets, including virtual reality setups and the world's largest unified dataset recorded using wearable eye trackers. Remarkably, in pupil segmentation tasks, SAM 2 matches the performance of domain-specific models trained solely on eye images, achieving competitive mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) scores of up to 93% without fine-tuning. Additionally, we provide our code and segmentation masks for these widely used datasets to promote further research.

- **Summary**: Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting has gained attention for its capability to generate high-fidelity rendering results. At the same time, most applications such as games, animation, and AR/VR use mesh-based representations to represent and render 3D scenes. We propose a novel approach that integrates mesh representation with 3D Gaussian splats to perform high-quality rendering of reconstructed real-world scenes. In particular, we introduce a distance-based Gaussian splatting technique to align the Gaussian splats with the mesh surface and remove redundant Gaussian splats that do not contribute to the rendering. We consider the distance between each Gaussian splat and the mesh surface to distinguish between tightly-bound and loosely-bound Gaussian splats. The tightly-bound splats are flattened and aligned well with the mesh geometry. The loosely-bound Gaussian splats are used to account for the artifacts in reconstructed 3D meshes in terms of rendering. We present a training strategy of binding Gaussian splats to the mesh geometry, and take into account both types of splats. In this context, we introduce several regularization techniques aimed at precisely aligning tightly-bound Gaussian splats with the mesh surface during the training process. We validate the effectiveness of our method on large and unbounded scene from mip-NeRF 360 and Deep Blending datasets. Our method surpasses recent mesh-based neural rendering techniques by achieving a 2dB higher PSNR, and outperforms mesh-based Gaussian splatting methods by 1.3 dB PSNR, particularly on the outdoor mip-NeRF 360 dataset, demonstrating better rendering quality. We provide analyses for each type of Gaussian splat and achieve a reduction in the number of Gaussian splats by 30% compared to the original 3D Gaussian splatting.

- **Summary**: Understanding land cover holds considerable potential for a myriad of practical applications, particularly as data accessibility transitions from being exclusive to governmental and commercial entities to now including the broader research community. Nevertheless, although the data is accessible to any community member interested in exploration, there exists a formidable learning curve and no standardized process for accessing, pre-processing, and leveraging the data for subsequent tasks. In this study, we democratize this data by presenting a flexible and efficient end to end pipeline for working with the Dynamic World dataset, a cutting-edge near-real-time land use/land cover (LULC) dataset. This includes a pre-processing and representation framework which tackles noise removal, efficient extraction of large amounts of data, and re-representation of LULC data in a format well suited for several downstream tasks. To demonstrate the power of our pipeline, we use it to extract data for an urbanization prediction problem and build a suite of machine learning models with excellent performance. This task is easily generalizable to the prediction of any type of land cover and our pipeline is also compatible with a series of other downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Many image processing applications rely on partitioning an image into disjoint regions whose pixels are 'similar.' The watershed and waterfall transforms are established mathematical morphology pixel clustering techniques. They are both relevant to modern applications where groups of pixels are to be decided upon in one go, or where adjacency information is relevant. We introduce three new parallel partitioning algorithms for GPUs. By repeatedly applying watershed algorithms, we produce waterfall results which form a hierarchy of partition regions over an input image. Our watershed algorithms attain competitive execution times in both 2D and 3D, processing an 800 megavoxel image in less than 1.4 sec. We also show how to use this fully deterministic image partitioning as a pre-processing step to machine learning based semantic segmentation. This replaces the role of superpixel algorithms, and results in comparable accuracy and faster training times.

- **Summary**: We propose new algorithms to efficiently average a collection of points on a Grassmannian manifold in both the centralized and decentralized settings. Grassmannian points are used ubiquitously in machine learning, computer vision, and signal processing to represent data through (often low-dimensional) subspaces. While averaging these points is crucial to many tasks (especially in the decentralized setting), existing methods unfortunately remain computationally expensive due to the non-Euclidean geometry of the manifold. Our proposed algorithms, Rapid Grassmannian Averaging (RGrAv) and Decentralized Rapid Grassmannian Averaging (DRGrAv), overcome this challenge by leveraging the spectral structure of the problem to rapidly compute an average using only small matrix multiplications and QR factorizations. We provide a theoretical guarantee of optimality and present numerical experiments which demonstrate that our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art methods in providing high accuracy solutions in minimal time. Additional experiments showcase the versatility of our algorithms to tasks such as K-means clustering on video motion data, establishing RGrAv and DRGrAv as powerful tools for generic Grassmannian averaging.

- **Summary**: Learning-based simulators show great potential for simulating particle dynamics when 3D groundtruth is available, but per-particle correspondences are not always accessible. The development of neural rendering presents a new solution to this field to learn 3D dynamics from 2D images by inverse rendering. However, existing approaches still suffer from ill-posed natures resulting from the 2D to 3D uncertainty, for example, specific 2D images can correspond with various 3D particle distributions. To mitigate such uncertainty, we consider a conventional, mechanically interpretable framework as the physical priors and extend it to a learning-based version. In brief, we incorporate the learnable graph kernels into the classic Discrete Element Analysis (DEA) framework to implement a novel mechanics-integrated learning system. In this case, the graph network kernels are only used for approximating some specific mechanical operators in the DEA framework rather than the whole dynamics mapping. By integrating the strong physics priors, our methods can effectively learn the dynamics of various materials from the partial 2D observations in a unified manner. Experiments show that our approach outperforms other learned simulators by a large margin in this context and is robust to different renderers, fewer training samples, and fewer camera views.

- **Summary**: Domain adaptive object detection (DAOD) aims to generalize detectors trained on an annotated source domain to an unlabelled target domain. As the visual-language models (VLMs) can provide essential general knowledge on unseen images, freezing the visual encoder and inserting a domain-agnostic adapter can learn domain-invariant knowledge for DAOD. However, the domain-agnostic adapter is inevitably biased to the source domain. It discards some beneficial knowledge discriminative on the unlabelled domain, i.e., domain-specific knowledge of the target domain. To solve the issue, we propose a novel Domain-Aware Adapter (DA-Ada) tailored for the DAOD task. The key point is exploiting domain-specific knowledge between the essential general knowledge and domain-invariant knowledge. DA-Ada consists of the Domain-Invariant Adapter (DIA) for learning domain-invariant knowledge and the Domain-Specific Adapter (DSA) for injecting the domain-specific knowledge from the information discarded by the visual encoder. Comprehensive experiments over multiple DAOD tasks show that DA-Ada can efficiently infer a domain-aware visual encoder for boosting domain adaptive object detection.

- **Summary**: Generating high-quality 3D assets from textual descriptions remains a pivotal challenge in computer graphics and vision research. Due to the scarcity of 3D data, state-of-the-art approaches utilize pre-trained 2D diffusion priors, optimized through Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). Despite progress, crafting complex 3D scenes featuring multiple objects or intricate interactions is still difficult. To tackle this, recent methods have incorporated box or layout guidance. However, these layout-guided compositional methods often struggle to provide fine-grained control, as they are generally coarse and lack expressiveness. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel SDS approach, Semantic Score Distillation Sampling (SemanticSDS), designed to effectively improve the expressiveness and accuracy of compositional text-to-3D generation. Our approach integrates new semantic embeddings that maintain consistency across different rendering views and clearly differentiate between various objects and parts. These embeddings are transformed into a semantic map, which directs a region-specific SDS process, enabling precise optimization and compositional generation. By leveraging explicit semantic guidance, our method unlocks the compositional capabilities of existing pre-trained diffusion models, thereby achieving superior quality in 3D content generation, particularly for complex objects and scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that our SemanticSDS framework is highly effective for generating state-of-the-art complex 3D content. Code: https://github.com/YangLing0818/SemanticSDS-3D

- **Summary**: Estimating rigid objects' poses is one of the fundamental problems in computer vision, with a range of applications across automation and augmented reality. Most existing approaches adopt one network per object class strategy, depend heavily on objects' 3D models, depth data, and employ a time-consuming iterative refinement, which could be impractical for some applications. This paper presents a novel approach, CVAM-Pose, for multi-object monocular pose estimation that addresses these limitations. The CVAM-Pose method employs a label-embedded conditional variational autoencoder network, to implicitly abstract regularised representations of multiple objects in a single low-dimensional latent space. This autoencoding process uses only images captured by a projective camera and is robust to objects' occlusion and scene clutter. The classes of objects are one-hot encoded and embedded throughout the network. The proposed label-embedded pose regression strategy interprets the learnt latent space representations utilising continuous pose representations. Ablation tests and systematic evaluations demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of the CVAM-Pose method for multi-object scenarios. The proposed CVAM-Pose outperforms competing latent space approaches. For example, it is respectively 25% and 20% better than AAE and Multi-Path methods, when evaluated using the $\mathrm{AR_{VSD}}$ metric on the Linemod-Occluded dataset. It also achieves results somewhat comparable to methods reliant on 3D models reported in BOP challenges. Code available: https://github.com/JZhao12/CVAM-Pose

- **Summary**: Millions of abandoned oil and gas wells are scattered across the world, leaching methane into the atmosphere and toxic compounds into the groundwater. Many of these locations are unknown, preventing the wells from being plugged and their polluting effects averted. Remote sensing is a relatively unexplored tool for pinpointing abandoned wells at scale. We introduce the first large-scale benchmark dataset for this problem, leveraging medium-resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery from Planet Labs. Our curated dataset comprises over 213,000 wells (abandoned, suspended, and active) from Alberta, a region with especially high well density, sourced from the Alberta Energy Regulator and verified by domain experts. We evaluate baseline algorithms for well detection and segmentation, showing the promise of computer vision approaches but also significant room for improvement.

- **Summary**: The remarkable development of text-to-image generation models has raised notable security concerns, such as the infringement of portrait rights and the generation of inappropriate content. Concept erasure has been proposed to remove the model's knowledge about protected and inappropriate concepts. Although many methods have tried to balance the efficacy (erasing target concepts) and specificity (retaining irrelevant concepts), they can still generate abundant erasure concepts under the steering of semantically related inputs. In this work, we propose RealEra to address this "concept residue" issue. Specifically, we first introduce the mechanism of neighbor-concept mining, digging out the associated concepts by adding random perturbation into the embedding of erasure concept, thus expanding the erasing range and eliminating the generations even through associated concept inputs. Furthermore, to mitigate the negative impact on the generation of irrelevant concepts caused by the expansion of erasure scope, RealEra preserves the specificity through the beyond-concept regularization. This makes irrelevant concepts maintain their corresponding spatial position, thereby preserving their normal generation performance. We also employ the closed-form solution to optimize weights of U-Net for the cross-attention alignment, as well as the prediction noise alignment with the LoRA module. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that RealEra outperforms previous concept erasing methods in terms of superior erasing efficacy, specificity, and generality.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of inflammatory or misleading "fake" news content has become increasingly common in recent years. Simultaneously, it has become easier than ever to use AI tools to generate photorealistic images depicting any scene imaginable. Combining these two -- AI-generated fake news content -- is particularly potent and dangerous. To combat the spread of AI-generated fake news, we propose the MiRAGeNews Dataset, a dataset of 12,500 high-quality real and AI-generated image-caption pairs from state-of-the-art generators. We find that our dataset poses a significant challenge to humans (60% F-1) and state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs (< 24% F-1). Using our dataset we train a multi-modal detector (MiRAGe) that improves by +5.1% F-1 over state-of-the-art baselines on image-caption pairs from out-of-domain image generators and news publishers. We release our code and data to aid future work on detecting AI-generated content.

- **Summary**: The creation of complex 3D scenes tailored to user specifications has been a tedious and challenging task with traditional 3D modeling tools. Although some pioneering methods have achieved automatic text-to-3D generation, they are generally limited to small-scale scenes with restricted control over the shape and texture. We introduce SceneCraft, a novel method for generating detailed indoor scenes that adhere to textual descriptions and spatial layout preferences provided by users. Central to our method is a rendering-based technique, which converts 3D semantic layouts into multi-view 2D proxy maps. Furthermore, we design a semantic and depth conditioned diffusion model to generate multi-view images, which are used to learn a neural radiance field (NeRF) as the final scene representation. Without the constraints of panorama image generation, we surpass previous methods in supporting complicated indoor space generation beyond a single room, even as complicated as a whole multi-bedroom apartment with irregular shapes and layouts. Through experimental analysis, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in complex indoor scene generation with diverse textures, consistent geometry, and realistic visual quality.

- **Summary**: Chick sexing, the process of determining the gender of day-old chicks, is a critical task in the poultry industry due to the distinct roles that each gender plays in production. While effective traditional methods achieve high accuracy, color, and wing feather sexing is exclusive to specific breeds, and vent sexing is invasive and requires trained experts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach inspired by facial gender classification techniques in humans: facial chick sexing. This new method does not require expert knowledge and aims to reduce training time while enhancing animal welfare by minimizing chick manipulation. We develop a comprehensive system for training and inference that includes data collection, facial and keypoint detection, facial alignment, and classification. We evaluate our model on two sets of images: Cropped Full Face and Cropped Middle Face, both of which maintain essential facial features of the chick for further analysis. Our experiment demonstrates the promising viability, with a final accuracy of 81.89%, of this approach for future practices in chick sexing by making them more universally applicable.

- **Summary**: In this study, we investigate the performance of few-shot classification models across different domains, specifically natural images and histopathological images. We first train several few-shot classification models on natural images and evaluate their performance on histopathological images. Subsequently, we train the same models on histopathological images and compare their performance. We incorporated four histopathology datasets and one natural images dataset and assessed performance across 5-way 1-shot, 5-way 5-shot, and 5-way 10-shot scenarios using a selection of state-of-the-art classification techniques. Our experimental results reveal insights into the transferability and generalization capabilities of few-shot classification models between diverse image domains. We analyze the strengths and limitations of these models in adapting to new domains and provide recommendations for optimizing their performance in cross-domain scenarios. This research contributes to advancing our understanding of few-shot learning in the context of image classification across diverse domains.

- **Summary**: Manual annotation of 3D medical images for segmentation tasks is tedious and time-consuming. Moreover, data privacy limits the applicability of crowd sourcing to perform data annotation in medical domains. As a result, training deep neural networks for medical image segmentation can be challenging. We introduce a new source-free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) method to address this problem. Our idea is based on estimating the internally learned distribution of a relevant source domain by a base model and then generating pseudo-labels that are used for enhancing the model refinement through self-training. We demonstrate that our approach leads to SOTA performance on a real-world 3D medical dataset.

- **Summary**: The Karhunen-Lo\`eve transform (KLT) stands as a well-established discrete transform, demonstrating optimal characteristics in data decorrelation and dimensionality reduction. Its ability to condense energy compression into a select few main components has rendered it instrumental in various applications within image compression frameworks. However, computing the KLT depends on the covariance matrix of the input data, which makes it difficult to develop fast algorithms for its implementation. Approximations for the KLT, utilizing specific rounding functions, have been introduced to reduce its computational complexity. Therefore, our paper introduces a category of low-complexity, data-independent KLT approximations, employing a range of round-off functions. The design methodology of the approximate transform is defined for any block-length $N$, but emphasis is given to transforms of $N = 8$ due to its wide use in image and video compression. The proposed transforms perform well when compared to the exact KLT and approximations considering classical performance measures. For particular scenarios, our proposed transforms demonstrated superior performance when compared to KLT approximations documented in the literature. We also developed fast algorithms for the proposed transforms, further reducing the arithmetic cost associated with their implementation. Evaluation of field programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware implementation metrics was conducted. Practical applications in image encoding showed the relevance of the proposed transforms. In fact, we showed that one of the proposed transforms outperformed the exact KLT given certain compression ratios.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in deep learning for processing point clouds hold increased interest in Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL) for 3D computer vision. This paper introduces a new method to tackle the Few-Shot Continual Incremental Learning (FSCIL) problem in 3D point cloud environments. We leverage a foundational 3D model trained extensively on point cloud data. Drawing from recent improvements in foundation models, known for their ability to work well across different tasks, we propose a novel strategy that does not require additional training to adapt to new tasks. Our approach uses a dual cache system: first, it uses previous test samples based on how confident the model was in its predictions to prevent forgetting, and second, it includes a small number of new task samples to prevent overfitting. This dynamic adaptation ensures strong performance across different learning tasks without needing lots of fine-tuning. We tested our approach on datasets like ModelNet, ShapeNet, ScanObjectNN, and CO3D, showing that it outperforms other FSCIL methods and demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

- **Summary**: Despite recent progress, Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) continues to face significant challenges, particularly its dependence on prior knowledge and predefined categories, complicating the tracking of unfamiliar objects. Generic Multiple Object Tracking (GMOT) emerges as a promising solution, requiring less prior information. Nevertheless, existing GMOT methods, primarily designed as OneShot-GMOT, rely heavily on initial bounding boxes and often struggle with variations in viewpoint, lighting, occlusion, and scale. To overcome the limitations inherent in both MOT and GMOT when it comes to tracking objects with specific generic attributes, we introduce Grounded-GMOT, an innovative tracking paradigm that enables users to track multiple generic objects in videos through natural language descriptors.   Our contributions begin with the introduction of the G2MOT dataset, which includes a collection of videos featuring a wide variety of generic objects, each accompanied by detailed textual descriptions of their attributes. Following this, we propose a novel tracking method, KAM-SORT, which not only effectively integrates visual appearance with motion cues but also enhances the Kalman filter. KAM-SORT proves particularly advantageous when dealing with objects of high visual similarity from the same generic category in GMOT scenarios. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that Grounded-GMOT outperforms existing OneShot-GMOT approaches. Additionally, our extensive comparisons between various trackers highlight KAM-SORT's efficacy in GMOT, further establishing its significance in the field.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation poses challenges due to domain gaps, data modality variations, and dependency on domain knowledge or experts, especially for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Whereas for humans, given a few exemplars (with corresponding labels), we are able to segment different medical images even without exten-sive domain-specific clinical training. In addition, current SAM-based medical segmentation models use fine-grained visual prompts, such as the bounding rectangle generated from manually annotated target segmentation mask, as the bounding box (bbox) prompt during the testing phase. However, in actual clinical scenarios, no such precise prior knowledge is available. Our experimental results also reveal that previous models nearly fail to predict when given coarser bbox prompts. Considering these issues, in this paper, we introduce a domain-aware selective adaptation approach to adapt the general knowledge learned from a large model trained with natural images to the corresponding medical domains/modalities, with access to only a few (e.g. less than 5) exemplars. Our method mitigates the aforementioned limitations, providing an efficient and LMICs-friendly solution. Extensive experimental analysis showcases the effectiveness of our approach, offering potential advancements in healthcare diagnostics and clinical applications in LMICs.

- **Summary**: COVID-19, has led to a global pandemic that strained the healthcare systems. Early and accurate detection is crucial for controlling the spread of the virus. While reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test is the gold standard for diagnosis, it's limited availability, long processing times and extremely high false negative rate, have prompted the exploration of alternative methods. Chest Xray imaging has emerged as a valuable, non invasive tool for identifying COVID-19 related lung abnormalities. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve impressive accuracy, but there is a need for more robust solutions to minimize false positives and negatives in critical medical applications. Thus We introduce the MOZART framework, an ensemble learning approach that enhances the virus detection. We trained three CNN architectures InceptionV3, Xception, and ResNet50 on a balanced chest X-ray dataset of 3,616 COVID-19 and 3,616 healthy images. Each model underwent a separate preprocessing pipeline, such as normalizing inputs to a range of -1 to 1. The dataset was split into 70% for training, 20% for validation, and 10% for testing, after training the individual models, we trained a shallow neural network on the predictions and to provide a us with the final predictions. Our results show that the MOZART framework with it's sub-experiments MOZART1 and MOZART2 outperforms individual CNN models in key metrics. It achieved an accuracy of 99.17% and an F1 score of 99.16%. MOZART1 excels at minimizing false positives, while MOZART2 is better for reducing false negatives. This work suggests that the MOZART framework can improve reliability in AI-driven medical imaging tasks and should be explored further for other lung diseases.

- **Summary**: Accurate 3D reconstruction of dynamic surgical scenes from endoscopic video is essential for robotic-assisted surgery. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have shown promise in achieving high-quality reconstructions with fast rendering speeds, their use of inverse depth loss functions compresses depth variations. This can lead to a loss of fine geometric details, limiting their ability to capture precise 3D geometry and effectiveness in intraoperative application. To address these challenges, we present SurgicalGS, a dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting framework specifically designed for surgical scene reconstruction with improved geometric accuracy. Our approach first initialises a Gaussian point cloud using depth priors, employing binary motion masks to identify pixels with significant depth variations and fusing point clouds from depth maps across frames for initialisation. We use the Flexible Deformation Model to represent dynamic scene and introduce a normalised depth regularisation loss along with an unsupervised depth smoothness constraint to ensure more accurate geometric reconstruction. Extensive experiments on two real surgical datasets demonstrate that SurgicalGS achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, especially in terms of accurate geometry, advancing the usability of 3D Gaussian Splatting in robotic-assisted surgery.

- **Summary**: Over recent years, deep learning based image registration has achieved impressive accuracy in many domains, including medical imaging and, specifically, human neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the uncertainty estimation associated with these methods has been largely limited to the application of generic techniques (e.g., Monte Carlo dropout) that do not exploit the peculiarities of the problem domain, particularly spatial modeling. Here, we propose a principled way to propagate uncertainties (epistemic or aleatoric) estimated at the level of spatial location by these methods, to the level of global transformation models, and further to downstream tasks. Specifically, we justify the choice of a Gaussian distribution for the local uncertainty modeling, and then propose a framework where uncertainties spread across hierarchical levels, depending on the choice of transformation model. Experiments on publicly available data sets show that Monte Carlo dropout correlates very poorly with the reference registration error, whereas our uncertainty estimates correlate much better. % with the reference registration error. Crucially, the results also show that uncertainty-aware fitting of transformations improves the registration accuracy of brain MRI scans. Finally, we illustrate how sampling from the posterior distribution of the transformations can be used to propagate uncertainties to downstream neuroimaging tasks.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as highly effective techniques for inpainting, however, they remain constrained by slow sampling rates. While recent advances have enhanced generation quality, they have also increased sampling time, thereby limiting scalability in real-world applications. We investigate the generative sampling process of diffusion-based inpainting models and observe that these models make minimal use of the input condition during the initial sampling steps. As a result, the sampling trajectory deviates from the data manifold, requiring complex synchronization mechanisms to realign the generation process. To address this, we propose Time-aware Diffusion Paint (TD-Paint), a novel approach that adapts the diffusion process by modeling variable noise levels at the pixel level. This technique allows the model to efficiently use known pixel values from the start, guiding the generation process toward the target manifold. By embedding this information early in the diffusion process, TD-Paint significantly accelerates sampling without compromising image quality. Unlike conventional diffusion-based inpainting models, which require a dedicated architecture or an expensive generation loop, TD-Paint achieves faster sampling times without architectural modifications. Experimental results across three datasets show that TD-Paint outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models while maintaining lower complexity.
