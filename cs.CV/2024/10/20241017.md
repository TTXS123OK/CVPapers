- **Summary**: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have precipitated a paradigm shift in medical imaging, particularly revolutionizing the domain of brain imaging. This paper systematically investigates the integration of deep learning -- a principal branch of AI -- into the semantic segmentation of brain images. Semantic segmentation serves as an indispensable technique for the delineation of discrete anatomical structures and the identification of pathological markers, essential for the diagnosis of complex neurological disorders. Historically, the reliance on manual interpretation by radiologists, while noteworthy for its accuracy, is plagued by inherent subjectivity and inter-observer variability. This limitation becomes more pronounced with the exponential increase in imaging data, which traditional methods struggle to process efficiently and effectively. In response to these challenges, this study introduces the application of adversarial neural networks, a novel AI approach that not only automates but also refines the semantic segmentation process. By leveraging these advanced neural networks, our approach enhances the precision of diagnostic outputs, reducing human error and increasing the throughput of imaging data analysis. The paper provides a detailed discussion on how adversarial neural networks facilitate a more robust, objective, and scalable solution, thereby significantly improving diagnostic accuracies in neurological evaluations. This exploration highlights the transformative impact of AI on medical imaging, setting a new benchmark for future research and clinical practice in neurology.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often generate plausible but incorrect responses to visual queries. However, reliably quantifying the effect of such hallucinations in free-form responses to open-ended queries is challenging as it requires visually verifying each claim within the response. We propose Programmatic VLM Evaluation (PROVE), a new benchmarking paradigm for evaluating VLM responses to open-ended queries. To construct PROVE, we provide a large language model (LLM) with a high-fidelity scene-graph representation constructed from a hyper-detailed image caption, and prompt it to generate diverse question-answer (QA) pairs, as well as programs that can be executed over the scene graph object to verify each QA pair. We thus construct a benchmark of 10.5k challenging but visually grounded QA pairs. Next, to evaluate free-form model responses to queries in PROVE, we propose a programmatic evaluation strategy that measures both the helpfulness and truthfulness of a response within a unified scene graph-based framework. We benchmark the helpfulness-truthfulness trade-offs of a range of VLMs on PROVE, finding that very few are in-fact able to achieve a good balance between the two.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel framework, Stable Diffusion-based Momentum Integrated Adversarial Examples (SD-MIAE), for generating adversarial examples that can effectively mislead neural network classifiers while maintaining visual imperceptibility and preserving the semantic similarity to the original class label. Our method leverages the text-to-image generation capabilities of the Stable Diffusion model by manipulating token embeddings corresponding to the specified class in its latent space. These token embeddings guide the generation of adversarial images that maintain high visual fidelity. The SD-MIAE framework consists of two phases: (1) an initial adversarial optimization phase that modifies token embeddings to produce misclassified yet natural-looking images and (2) a momentum-based optimization phase that refines the adversarial perturbations. By introducing momentum, our approach stabilizes the optimization of perturbations across iterations, enhancing both the misclassification rate and visual fidelity of the generated adversarial examples. Experimental results demonstrate that SD-MIAE achieves a high misclassification rate of 79%, improving by 35% over the state-of-the-art method while preserving the imperceptibility of adversarial perturbations and the semantic similarity to the original class label, making it a practical method for robust adversarial evaluation.

- **Summary**: Masked generative models (MGMs) have shown impressive generative ability while providing an order of magnitude efficient sampling steps compared to continuous diffusion models. However, MGMs still underperform in image synthesis compared to recent well-developed continuous diffusion models with similar size in terms of quality and diversity of generated samples. A key factor in the performance of continuous diffusion models stems from the guidance methods, which enhance the sample quality at the expense of diversity. In this paper, we extend these guidance methods to generalized guidance formulation for MGMs and propose a self-guidance sampling method, which leads to better generation quality. The proposed approach leverages an auxiliary task for semantic smoothing in vector-quantized token space, analogous to the Gaussian blur in continuous pixel space. Equipped with the parameter-efficient fine-tuning method and high-temperature sampling, MGMs with the proposed self-guidance achieve a superior quality-diversity trade-off, outperforming existing sampling methods in MGMs with more efficient training and sampling costs. Extensive experiments with the various sampling hyperparameters confirm the effectiveness of the proposed self-guidance.

- **Summary**: This work presents ARD2, a framework that enables real-time through-wall surveillance using two aerial drones and an augmented reality (AR) device. ARD2 consists of two main steps: target direction estimation and contour reconstruction. In the first stage, ARD2 leverages geometric relationships between the drones, the user, and the target to project the target's direction onto the user's AR display. In the second stage, images from the drones are synthesized to reconstruct the target's contour, allowing the user to visualize the target behind walls. Experimental results demonstrate the system's accuracy in both direction estimation and contour reconstruction.

- **Summary**: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) gain widespread use, their fairness remains under-explored. In this paper, we analyze demographic biases across five models and six datasets. We find that portrait datasets like UTKFace and CelebA are the best tools for bias detection, finding gaps in performance and fairness between LLaVa and CLIP models. However, scene based datasets like PATA, VLStereoSet fail to be useful benchmarks for bias due to their construction. As for pronoun based datasets like VisoGender, we receive mixed signals as only some subsets of the data are useful in providing insights. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a more difficult version of VisoGender to serve as a more rigorous evaluation. Based on these results, we call for more effective and carefully designed datasets to ensure VLMs are both fair and reliable.

- **Summary**: Molecule optimization is a critical task in drug discovery to optimize desired properties of a given molecule through chemical modification. Despite Large Language Models (LLMs) holding the potential to efficiently simulate this task by using natural language to direct the optimization, straightforwardly utilizing shows limited performance. In this work, we facilitate utilizing LLMs in an iterative paradigm by proposing a simple yet highly effective domain feedback provider, namely $\text{Re}^2$DF. In detail, $\text{Re}^2$DF harnesses an external toolkit, RDKit, to handle the molecule hallucination, if the modified molecule is chemically invalid. Otherwise, its desired properties are computed and compared to the original one, establishing reliable domain feedback with correct direction and distance towards the objective, followed by a retrieved example, to explicitly guide the LLM to refine the modified molecule. We conduct experiments across both single- and multi-property objectives with 2 thresholds, where $\text{Re}^2$DF shows significant improvements. Particularly, for 20 single-property objectives, $\text{Re}^2$DF enhances the Hit ratio by 16.95\% and 20.76\% under loose and strict thresholds, respectively. For 32 multi-property objectives, $\text{Re}^2$DF enhances the Hit ratio by 6.04\% and 5.25\%.

- **Summary**: The explosive growth of generative AI has saturated the internet with AI-generated images, raising security concerns and increasing the need for reliable detection methods. The primary requirement for such detection is generalizability, typically achieved by training on numerous fake images from various models. However, practical limitations, such as closed-source models and restricted access, often result in limited training samples. Therefore, training a general detector with few-shot samples is essential for modern detection mechanisms. To address this challenge, we propose FAMSeC, a general AI-generated image detection method based on LoRA-based Forgery Awareness Module and Semantic feature-guided Contrastive learning strategy. To effectively learn from limited samples and prevent overfitting, we developed a Forgery Awareness Module (FAM) based on LoRA, maintaining the generalization of pre-trained features. Additionally, to cooperate with FAM, we designed a Semantic feature-guided Contrastive learning strategy (SeC), making the FAM focus more on the differences between real/fake image than on the features of the samples themselves. Experiments show that FAMSeC outperforms state-of-the-art method, enhancing classification accuracy by 14.55% with just 0.56% of the training samples.

- **Summary**: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical imaging has advanced clinical diagnostics but poses challenges in managing model drift and ensuring long-term reliability. To address these challenges, we develop MMC+, an enhanced framework for scalable drift monitoring, building upon the CheXstray framework that introduced real-time drift detection for medical imaging AI models using multi-modal data concordance. This work extends the original framework's methodologies, providing a more scalable and adaptable solution for real-world healthcare settings and offers a reliable and cost-effective alternative to continuous performance monitoring addressing limitations of both continuous and periodic monitoring methods. MMC+ introduces critical improvements to the original framework, including more robust handling of diverse data streams, improved scalability with the integration of foundation models like MedImageInsight for high-dimensional image embeddings without site-specific training, and the introduction of uncertainty bounds to better capture drift in dynamic clinical environments. Validated with real-world data from Massachusetts General Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic, MMC+ effectively detects significant data shifts and correlates them with model performance changes. While not directly predicting performance degradation, MMC+ serves as an early warning system, indicating when AI systems may deviate from acceptable performance bounds and enabling timely interventions. By emphasizing the importance of monitoring diverse data streams and evaluating data shifts alongside model performance, this work contributes to the broader adoption and integration of AI solutions in clinical settings.

- **Summary**: Many machine learning (ML) classifiers are claimed to outperform humans, but they still make mistakes that humans do not. The most notorious examples of such mistakes are adversarial visual metamers. This paper aims to define and investigate the phenomenon of adversarial Doppelgangers (AD), which includes adversarial visual metamers, and to compare the performance and robustness of ML classifiers to human performance.   We find that AD are inputs that are close to each other with respect to a perceptual metric defined in this paper. AD are qualitatively different from the usual adversarial examples. The vast majority of classifiers are vulnerable to AD and robustness-accuracy trade-offs may not improve them. Some classification problems may not admit any AD robust classifiers because the underlying classes are ambiguous. We provide criteria that can be used to determine whether a classification problem is well defined or not; describe the structure and attributes of an AD-robust classifier; introduce and explore the notions of conceptual entropy and regions of conceptual ambiguity for classifiers that are vulnerable to AD attacks, along with methods to bound the AD fooling rate of an attack. We define the notion of classifiers that exhibit hypersensitive behavior, that is, classifiers whose only mistakes are adversarial Doppelgangers. Improving the AD robustness of hyper-sensitive classifiers is equivalent to improving accuracy. We identify conditions guaranteeing that all classifiers with sufficiently high accuracy are hyper-sensitive.   Our findings are aimed at significant improvements in the reliability and security of machine learning systems.



### UniG: Modelling Unitary 3D Gaussians for View-consistent 3D Reconstruction

- **Summary**: In this work, we present UniG, a view-consistent 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis model that generates a high-fidelity representation of 3D Gaussians from sparse images. Existing 3D Gaussians-based methods usually regress Gaussians per-pixel of each view, create 3D Gaussians per view separately, and merge them through point concatenation. Such a view-independent reconstruction approach often results in a view inconsistency issue, where the predicted positions of the same 3D point from different views may have discrepancies. To address this problem, we develop a DETR (DEtection TRansformer)-like framework, which treats 3D Gaussians as decoder queries and updates their parameters layer by layer by performing multi-view cross-attention (MVDFA) over multiple input images. In this way, multiple views naturally contribute to modeling a unitary representation of 3D Gaussians, thereby making 3D reconstruction more view-consistent. Moreover, as the number of 3D Gaussians used as decoder queries is irrespective of the number of input views, allow an arbitrary number of input images without causing memory explosion. Extensive experiments validate the advantages of our approach, showcasing superior performance over existing methods quantitatively (improving PSNR by 4.2 dB when trained on Objaverse and tested on the GSO benchmark) and qualitatively. The code will be released at https://github.com/jwubz123/UNIG.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a Video Quality Assessment (VQA) problem that has received little attention in the literature, called the latent resolution prediction problem. The problem arises when images or videos are upscaled from their native resolution and are reported as having a higher resolution than their native resolution. This paper formulates the problem, constructs a dataset for training and evaluation, and introduces several machine learning algorithms, including two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to address this problem. Experiments indicate that some proposed methods can predict the latent video resolution with about 95% accuracy.

- **Summary**: Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring retinal vascular issues but is limited by its invasive nature and restricted accessibility compared to color fundus (CF) imaging. Existing methods that convert CF images to FFA are confined to static image generation, missing the dynamic lesional changes. We introduce Fundus2Video, an autoregressive generative adversarial network (GAN) model that generates dynamic FFA videos from single CF images. Fundus2Video excels in video generation, achieving an FVD of 1497.12 and a PSNR of 11.77. Clinical experts have validated the fidelity of the generated videos. Additionally, the model's generator demonstrates remarkable downstream transferability across ten external public datasets, including blood vessel segmentation, retinal disease diagnosis, systemic disease prediction, and multimodal retrieval, showcasing impressive zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. These findings position Fundus2Video as a powerful, non-invasive alternative to FFA exams and a versatile retinal generative foundation model that captures both static and temporal retinal features, enabling the representation of complex inter-modality relationships.

- **Summary**: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), as a versatile representation paradigm, have achieved success in various computer vision tasks. Due to the spectral bias of the vanilla multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), existing methods focus on designing MLPs with sophisticated architectures or repurposing training techniques for highly accurate INRs. In this paper, we delve into the linear dynamics model of MLPs and theoretically identify the empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (eNTK) matrix as a reliable link between spectral bias and training dynamics. Based on eNTK matrix, we propose a practical inductive gradient adjustment method, which could purposefully improve the spectral bias via inductive generalization of eNTK-based gradient transformation matrix. We evaluate our method on different INRs tasks with various INR architectures and compare to existing training techniques. The superior representation performance clearly validates the advantage of our proposed method. Armed with our gradient adjustment method, better INRs with more enhanced texture details and sharpened edges can be learned from data by tailored improvements on spectral bias.

- **Summary**: Novel view synthesis has made significant progress in the field of 3D computer vision. However, the rendering of view-consistent novel views from imperfect camera poses remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid bundle-adjusting 3D Gaussians model that enables view-consistent rendering with pose optimization. This model jointly extract image-based and neural 3D representations to simultaneously generate view-consistent images and camera poses within forward-facing scenes. The effective of our model is demonstrated through extensive experiments conducted on both real and synthetic datasets. These experiments clearly illustrate that our model can effectively optimize neural scene representations while simultaneously resolving significant camera pose misalignments.

- **Summary**: We tackle the generalized category discovery (GCD) problem, which aims to discover novel classes in unlabeled datasets by leveraging the knowledge of known classes. Previous works utilize the known class knowledge through shared representation spaces. Despite their progress, our analysis experiments show that novel classes can achieve impressive clustering results on the feature space of a known class pre-trained model, suggesting that existing methods may not fully utilize known class knowledge. To address it, we introduce a novel concept learning framework for GCD, named ConceptGCD, that categorizes concepts into two types: derivable and underivable from known class concepts, and adopts a stage-wise learning strategy to learn them separately. Specifically, our framework first extracts known class concepts by a known class pre-trained model and then produces derivable concepts from them by a generator layer with a covariance-augmented loss. Subsequently, we expand the generator layer to learn underivable concepts in a balanced manner ensured by a concept score normalization strategy and integrate a contrastive loss to preserve previously learned concepts. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the previous state-of-the-art methods. Code will be available soon.

- **Summary**: Referring 3D Segmentation is a visual-language task that segments all points of the specified object from a 3D point cloud described by a sentence of query. Previous works perform a two-stage paradigm, first conducting language-agnostic instance segmentation then matching with given text query. However, the semantic concepts from text query and visual cues are separately interacted during the training, and both instance and semantic labels for each object are required, which is time consuming and human-labor intensive. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel Referring 3D Segmentation pipeline, Label-Efficient and Single-Stage, dubbed LESS, which is only under the supervision of efficient binary mask. Specifically, we design a Point-Word Cross-Modal Alignment module for aligning the fine-grained features of points and textual embedding. Query Mask Predictor module and Query-Sentence Alignment module are introduced for coarse-grained alignment between masks and query. Furthermore, we propose an area regularization loss, which coarsely reduces irrelevant background predictions on a large scale. Besides, a point-to-point contrastive loss is proposed concentrating on distinguishing points with subtly similar features. Through extensive experiments, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on ScanRefer dataset by surpassing the previous methods about 3.7% mIoU using only binary labels.

- **Summary**: For the 3D localization problem using point spread function (PSF) engineering, we propose a novel enhancement of our previously introduced localization neural network, LocNet. The improved network is a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that we call PiLocNet. Previous works on the localization problem may be categorized separately into model-based optimization and neural network approaches. Our PiLocNet combines the unique strengths of both approaches by incorporating forward-model-based information into the network via a data-fitting loss term that constrains the neural network to yield results that are physically sensible. We additionally incorporate certain regularization terms from the variational method, which further improves the robustness of the network in the presence of image noise, as we show for the Poisson and Gaussian noise models. This framework accords interpretability to the neural network, and the results we obtain show its superiority. Although the paper focuses on the use of single-lobe rotating PSF to encode the full 3D source location, we expect the method to be widely applicable to other PSFs and imaging problems that are constrained by known forward processes.

- **Summary**: Extracting fine-grained OCR text from aged documents in diacritic languages remains challenging due to unexpected artifacts, time-induced degradation, and lack of datasets. While standalone spell correction approaches have been proposed, they show limited performance for historical documents due to numerous possible OCR error combinations and differences between modern and classical corpus distributions. We propose a method utilizing available content-focused ebooks as a reference base to correct imperfect OCR-generated text, supported by large language models. This technique generates high-precision pseudo-page-to-page labels for diacritic languages, where small strokes pose significant challenges in historical conditions. The pipeline eliminates various types of noise from aged documents and addresses issues such as missing characters, words, and disordered sequences. Our post-processing method, which generated a large OCR dataset of classical Vietnamese books, achieved a mean grading score of 8.72 on a 10-point scale. This outperformed the state-of-the-art transformer-based Vietnamese spell correction model, which scored 7.03 when evaluated on a sampled subset of the dataset. We also trained a baseline OCR model to assess and compare it with well-known engines. Experimental results demonstrate the strength of our baseline model compared to widely used open-source solutions. The resulting dataset will be released publicly to support future studies.

- **Summary**: Dataset Distillation (DD) seeks to create a condensed dataset that, when used to train a model, enables the model to achieve performance similar to that of a model trained on the entire original dataset. It relieves the model training from processing massive data and thus reduces the computation resources, storage, and time costs. This paper illustrates our solution that ranks 1st in the ECCV-2024 Data Distillation Challenge (track 1). Our solution, Modified Difficulty-Aligned Trajectory Matching (M-DATM), introduces two key modifications to the original state-of-the-art method DATM: (1) the soft labels learned by DATM do not achieve one-to-one correspondence with the counterparts generated by the official evaluation script, so we remove the soft labels technique to alleviate such inconsistency; (2) since the removal of soft labels makes it harder for the synthetic dataset to learn late trajectory information, particularly on Tiny ImageNet, we reduce the matching range, allowing the synthetic data to concentrate more on the easier patterns. In the final evaluation, our M-DATM achieved accuracies of 0.4061 and 0.1831 on the CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets, ranking 1st in the Fixed Images Per Class (IPC) Track.

- **Summary**: Short-term precipitation forecasting remains challenging due to the difficulty in capturing long-term spatiotemporal dependencies. Current deep learning methods fall short in establishing effective dependencies between conditions and forecast results, while also lacking interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a Precipitation Nowcasting Using Diffusion Transformer with Causal Attention model. Our model leverages Transformer and combines causal attention mechanisms to establish spatiotemporal queries between conditional information (causes) and forecast results (results). This design enables the model to effectively capture long-term dependencies, allowing forecast results to maintain strong causal relationships with input conditions over a wide range of time and space. We explore four variants of spatiotemporal information interactions for DTCA, demonstrating that global spatiotemporal labeling interactions yield the best performance. In addition, we introduce a Channel-To-Batch shift operation to further enhance the model's ability to represent complex rainfall dynamics. We conducted experiments on two datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art U-Net-based methods, our approach improved the CSI (Critical Success Index) for predicting heavy precipitation by approximately 15% and 8% respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Road markings were reported as critical road safety features, equally needed for both human drivers and for machine vision technologies utilised by advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and in driving automation. Visibility of road markings is achieved because of their colour contrasting with the roadway surface. During recent testing of an open-source camera-based ADAS under several visibility conditions (day, night, rain, glare), significant failures in trajectory planning were recorded and quantified. Consistently, better ADAS reliability under poor visibility conditions was achieved with Type II road markings (i.e. structured markings, facilitating moisture drainage) as compared to Type I road marking (i.e. flat lines). To further understand these failures, analysis of contrast ratio of road markings, which the tested ADAS was detecting for traffic lane recognition, was performed. The highest contrast ratio (greater than 0.5, calculated per Michelson equation) was measured at night in the absence of confounding factors, with statistically significant difference of 0.1 in favour of Type II road markings over Type I. Under daylight conditions, contrast ratio was reduced, with slightly higher values measured with Type I. The presence of rain or wet roads caused the deterioration of the contrast ratio, with Type II road markings exhibiting significantly higher contrast ratio than Type I, even though the values were low (less than 0.1). These findings matched the output of the ADAS related to traffic lane detection and underlined the importance of road marking visibility. Inadequate lane recognition by ADAS was associated with very low contrast ratio of road markings indeed. Importantly, specific minimum contrast ratio value could not be found, which was due to the complexity of ADAS algorithms...

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in generating detailed and coherent responses from visual inputs. However, they are prone to generate hallucinations due to an over-reliance on language priors. To address this issue, we investigate the language priors in LVLMs and make two key observations: (1) Even when predicting the tokens associated with image-related part-of-speech (POS), models increasingly rely on linguistic priors as the token sequences grow, thereby amplifying hallucinations. (2) Methods that directly calibrate LVLM's output distribution to mitigate language priors can lead to a degradation in text quality or even exacerbate hallucinations. Based on these findings, we propose a novel method, Summary-Guided Decoding (SGD). This method naturally encourages the model to focus more on image information by reducing the text context through summaries, while controlling only the image-related POS tokens to maintain text quality. Through experiments, we demonstrate that SGD achieves state-of-the-art performance on object hallucination benchmarks. Furthermore, in terms of the trade-off between precision and recall, SGD achieves Pareto optimality among the existing methods. Lastly, we observe that although existing methods struggle to balance the reduction of object hallucinations with maintaining text quality, SGD demonstrates robustness in handling this challenge.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing objects from posed images is a crucial and complex task in computer graphics and computer vision. While NeRF-based neural reconstruction methods have exhibited impressive reconstruction ability, they tend to be time-comsuming. Recent strategies have adopted 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) for inverse rendering, which have led to quick and effective outcomes. However, these techniques generally have difficulty in producing believable geometries and materials for glossy objects, a challenge that stems from the inherent ambiguities of inverse rendering. To address this, we introduce GlossyGS, an innovative 3D-GS-based inverse rendering framework that aims to precisely reconstruct the geometry and materials of glossy objects by integrating material priors. The key idea is the use of micro-facet geometry segmentation prior, which helps to reduce the intrinsic ambiguities and improve the decomposition of geometries and materials. Additionally, we introduce a normal map prefiltering strategy to more accurately simulate the normal distribution of reflective surfaces. These strategies are integrated into a hybrid geometry and material representation that employs both explicit and implicit methods to depict glossy objects. We demonstrate through quantitative analysis and qualitative visualization that the proposed method is effective to reconstruct high-fidelity geometries and materials of glossy objects, and performs favorably against state-of-the-arts.

- **Summary**: Scene flow estimation aims to generate the 3D motion field of points between two consecutive frames of point clouds, which has wide applications in various fields. Existing point-based methods ignore the irregularity of point clouds and have difficulty capturing long-range dependencies due to the inefficiency of point-level computation. Voxel-based methods suffer from the loss of detail information. In this paper, we propose a point-voxel fusion method, where we utilize a voxel branch based on sparse grid attention and the shifted window strategy to capture long-range dependencies and a point branch to capture fine-grained features to compensate for the information loss in the voxel branch. In addition, since xyz coordinates are difficult to describe the geometric structure of complex 3D objects in the scene, we explicitly encode the local surface information of the point cloud through the umbrella surface feature extraction (USFE) module. We verify the effectiveness of our method by conducting experiments on the Flyingthings3D and KITTI datasets. Our method outperforms all other self-supervised methods and achieves highly competitive results compared to fully supervised methods. We achieve improvements in all metrics, especially EPE, which is reduced by 8.51% and 10.52% on the KITTIo and KITTIs datasets, respectively.

- **Summary**: The development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as general assistants. However, lack of user-specific knowledge still restricts their application in human's daily life. In this paper, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Personalization (RAP) framework for MLLMs' personalization. Starting from a general MLLM, we turn it into a personalized assistant in three steps. (a) Remember: We design a key-value database to store user-related information, e.g., user's name, avatar and other attributes. (b) Retrieve: When the user initiates a conversation, RAP will retrieve relevant information from the database using a multimodal retriever. (c) Generate: The input query and retrieved concepts' information are fed into MLLMs to generate personalized, knowledge-augmented responses. Unlike previous methods, RAP allows real-time concept editing via updating the external database. To further improve generation quality and alignment with user-specific information, we design a pipeline for data collection and create a specialized dataset for personalized training of MLLMs. Based on the dataset, we train a series of MLLMs as personalized multimodal assistants. By pretraining on large-scale dataset, RAP-MLLMs can generalize to infinite visual concepts without additional finetuning. Our models demonstrate outstanding flexibility and generation quality across a variety of tasks, such as personalized image captioning, question answering and visual recognition. The code, data and models are available at https://github.com/Hoar012/RAP-MLLM.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled the creation of high-quality images from text prompts, but they still struggle to generate images with precise control over specific visual concepts. Existing approaches can replicate a given concept by learning from reference images, yet they lack the flexibility for fine-grained customization of the individual component within the concept. In this paper, we introduce component-controllable personalization, a novel task that pushes the boundaries of T2I models by allowing users to reconfigure specific components when personalizing visual concepts. This task is particularly challenging due to two primary obstacles: semantic pollution, where unwanted visual elements corrupt the personalized concept, and semantic imbalance, which causes disproportionate learning of the concept and component. To overcome these challenges, we design MagicTailor, an innovative framework that leverages Dynamic Masked Degradation (DM-Deg) to dynamically perturb undesired visual semantics and Dual-Stream Balancing (DS-Bal) to establish a balanced learning paradigm for desired visual semantics. Extensive comparisons, ablations, and analyses demonstrate that MagicTailor not only excels in this challenging task but also holds significant promise for practical applications, paving the way for more nuanced and creative image generation.

- **Summary**: Camera calibration is a critical process in 3D vision, im pacting applications in autonomous driving, robotics, ar chitecture, and so on. This paper focuses on enhancing feature extraction for chessboard corner detection, a key step in calibration. We analyze existing methods, high lighting their limitations and propose a novel sub-pixel refinement approach based on symmetry, which signifi cantly improves accuracy for visible light cameras. Un like prior symmetry based method that assume a contin uous physical pattern, our approach accounts for abrupt changes in visible light camera images and defocus ef fects. We introduce a simplified objective function that reduces computation time and mitigates overfitting risks. Furthermore, we derive an explicit expression for the pixel value of a blurred edge, providing insights into the relationship between pixel value and center intensity. Our method demonstrates superior performance, achiev ing substantial accuracy improvements over existing tech niques, particularly in the context of visible light cam era calibration.

- **Summary**: Automated vehicles rely on an accurate and robust perception of the environment. Similarly to automated cars, highly automated trains require an environmental perception. Although there is a lot of research based on either camera or LiDAR sensors in the automotive domain, very few contributions for this task exist yet for automated trains. Additionally, no public dataset or described approach for a 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation in the railway environment exists yet. Thus, we propose an approach for a point-wise 3D semantic segmentation based on the 2DPass network architecture using scans and images jointly. In addition, we present a semi-automated intelligent data annotation approach, which we use to efficiently and accurately label the required dataset recorded on a railway track in Germany. To improve performance despite a still small number of labeled scans, we apply an active learning approach to intelligently select scans for the training dataset. Our contributions are threefold: We annotate rail data including camera and LiDAR data from the railway environment, transfer label the raw LiDAR point clouds using an image segmentation network, and train a state-of-the-art 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation network efficiently leveraging active learning. The trained network achieves good segmentation results with a mean IoU of 71.48% of 9 classes.

- **Summary**: Current methods for disaster scene interpretation in remote sensing images (RSIs) mostly focus on isolated tasks such as segmentation, detection, or visual question-answering (VQA). However, current interpretation methods often fail at tasks that require the combination of multiple perception methods and specialized tools. To fill this gap, this paper introduces Adaptive Disaster Interpretation (ADI), a novel task designed to solve requests by planning and executing multiple sequentially correlative interpretation tasks to provide a comprehensive analysis of disaster scenes. To facilitate research and application in this area, we present a new dataset named RescueADI, which contains high-resolution RSIs with annotations for three connected aspects: planning, perception, and recognition. The dataset includes 4,044 RSIs, 16,949 semantic masks, 14,483 object bounding boxes, and 13,424 interpretation requests across nine challenging request types. Moreover, we propose a new disaster interpretation method employing autonomous agents driven by large language models (LLMs) for task planning and execution, proving its efficacy in handling complex disaster interpretations. The proposed agent-based method solves various complex interpretation requests such as counting, area calculation, and path-finding without human intervention, which traditional single-task approaches cannot handle effectively. Experimental results on RescueADI demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed task and show that our method achieves an accuracy 9% higher than existing VQA methods, highlighting its advantages over conventional disaster interpretation approaches. The dataset will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Data embeddings with CLIP and ImageBind provide powerful features for the analysis of multimedia and/or multimodal data. We assess their performance here for classification using a Gaussian Mixture models (GMMs) based layer as an alternative to the standard Softmax layer. GMMs based classifiers have recently been shown to have interesting performances as part of deep learning pipelines trained end-to-end. Our first contribution is to investigate GMM based classification performance taking advantage of the embedded spaces CLIP and ImageBind. Our second contribution is in proposing our own GMM based classifier with a lower parameters count than previously proposed. Our findings are, that in most cases, on these tested embedded spaces, one gaussian component in the GMMs is often enough for capturing each class, and we hypothesize that this may be due to the contrastive loss used for training these embedded spaces that naturally concentrates features together for each class. We also observed that ImageBind often provides better performance than CLIP for classification of image datasets even when these embedded spaces are compressed using PCA.

- **Summary**: The skull segmentation from CT scans can be seen as an already solved problem. However, in MR this task has a significantly greater complexity due to the presence of soft tissues rather than bones. Capturing the bone structures from MR images of the head, where the main visualization objective is the brain, is very demanding. The attempts that make use of skull stripping seem to not be well suited for this task and fail to work in many cases. On the other hand, supervised approaches require costly and time-consuming skull annotations. To overcome the difficulties we propose a fully unsupervised approach, where we do not perform the segmentation directly on MR images, but we rather perform a synthetic CT data generation via MR-to-CT translation and perform the segmentation there. We address many issues associated with unsupervised skull segmentation including the unpaired nature of MR and CT datasets (contrastive learning), low resolution and poor quality (super-resolution), and generalization capabilities. The research has a significant value for downstream tasks requiring skull segmentation from MR volumes such as craniectomy or surgery planning and can be seen as an important step towards the utilization of synthetic data in medical imaging.

- **Summary**: Referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) is an emerging cross-modal task that aims to locate an arbitrary number of target objects and maintain their identities referred by a language expression in a video. This intricate task involves the reasoning of linguistic and visual modalities, along with the temporal association of target objects. However, the seminal work employs only loose feature fusion and overlooks the utilization of long-term information on tracked objects. In this study, we introduce a compact Transformer-based method, termed TenRMOT. We conduct feature fusion at both encoding and decoding stages to fully exploit the advantages of Transformer architecture. Specifically, we incrementally perform cross-modal fusion layer-by-layer during the encoding phase. In the decoding phase, we utilize language-guided queries to probe memory features for accurate prediction of the desired objects. Moreover, we introduce a query update module that explicitly leverages temporal prior information of the tracked objects to enhance the consistency of their trajectories. In addition, we introduce a novel task called Referring Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation (RMOTS) and construct a new dataset named Ref-KITTI Segmentation. Our dataset consists of 18 videos with 818 expressions, and each expression averages 10.7 masks, which poses a greater challenge compared to the typical single mask in most existing referring video segmentation datasets. TenRMOT demonstrates superior performance on both the referring multi-object tracking and the segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: Supervised contrastive learning has been explored in making use of label information for multi-label classification, but determining positive samples in multi-label scenario remains challenging. Previous studies have examined strategies for identifying positive samples, considering label overlap proportion between anchors and samples. However, they ignore various relations between given anchors and samples, as well as how to dynamically adjust the weights in contrastive loss functions based on different relations, leading to great ambiguity. In this paper, we introduce five distinct relations between multi-label samples and propose a Similarity-Dissimilarity Loss with contrastive learning for multi-label classification. Our loss function re-weights the loss by computing the similarity and dissimilarity between positive samples and a given anchor based on the introduced relations. We mainly conduct experiments for multi-label text classification on MIMIC datasets, then further extend the evaluation on MS-COCO. The Experimental results show that our proposed loss effectively improves the performance on all encoders under supervised contrastive learning paradigm, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

- **Summary**: Automated data augmentation methods have significantly improved the performance and generalization capability of deep learning models in image classification. Yet, most state-of-the-art methods are optimized on common benchmark datasets, limiting their applicability to more diverse or domain-specific data, such as medical datasets. In this paper, we propose a strategy that uses large language models to automatically generate efficient augmentation policies, customized to fit the specific characteristics of any dataset and model architecture. The proposed method iteratively interacts with an LLM to obtain and refine the augmentation policies on model performance feedback, creating a dataset-agnostic data augmentation pipeline. The proposed method was evaluated on medical imaging datasets, showing a clear improvement over state-of-the-art methods. The proposed approach offers an adaptive and scalable solution. Although it increases computational cost, it significantly boosts model robustness, automates the process, and minimizes the need for human involvement during model development.

- **Summary**: Object pose estimation is a prominent task in computer vision. The object pose gives the orientation and translation of the object in real-world space, which allows various applications such as manipulation, augmented reality, etc. Various objects exhibit different properties with light, such as reflections, absorption, etc. This makes it challenging to understand the object's structure in RGB and depth channels. Recent research has been moving toward learning-based methods, which provide a more flexible and generalizable approach to object pose estimation utilizing deep learning. One such approach is the render-and-compare method, which renders the object from multiple views and compares it against the given 2D image, which often requires an object representation in the form of a CAD model. We reason that the synthetic texture of the CAD model may not be ideal for rendering and comparing operations. We showed that if the object is represented as an implicit (neural) representation in the form of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), it exhibits a more realistic rendering of the actual scene and retains the crucial spatial features, which makes the comparison more versatile. We evaluated our NeRF implementation of the render-and-compare method on transparent datasets and found that it surpassed the current state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images is a challenging task with significant potential across various applications. Deep learning, especially supervised learning with large-scale labeled datasets, has greatly advanced this field. However, acquiring high-quality labeled data is expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, variations in ground sampling distance (GSD), imaging equipment, and geographic diversity contribute to domain shifts between datasets, which pose significant challenges to models trained solely on source domain data, leading to poor cross-domain performance. Domain shift is well-known for undermining a model's generalization ability in the target domain. To address this, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling models to learn from unlabeled target domain data while training on labeled source domain data. Recent advancements, particularly in self-supervised learning via pseudo-label generation, have shown potential in mitigating domain discrepancies. Strategies combining source and target domain images with their true and pseudo labels for self-supervised training have been effective in addressing domain bias. Despite progress in computer vision, the application of pseudo-labeling methods to RS image segmentation remains underexplored.

- **Summary**: Distribution shifts widely exist in medical images acquired from different medical centers, hindering the deployment of semantic segmentation models trained on data from one center (source domain) to another (target domain). While unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has shown significant promise in mitigating these shifts, it poses privacy risks due to sharing data between centers. To facilitate adaptation while preserving data privacy, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) and test-time adaptation (TTA) have emerged as effective paradigms, relying solely on target domain data. However, the scenarios currently addressed by SFDA and TTA are limited, making them less suitable for clinical applications. In a more realistic clinical scenario, the pre-trained model is deployed in a medical centre to assist with clinical tasks during the day and rest at night. During the daytime process, TTA can be employed to enhance inference performance. During the nighttime process, after collecting the test data from the day, the model can be fine-tuned utilizing SFDA to further adapt to the target domain. With above insights, we propose a novel adaptation framework called Day-Night Adaptation (DyNA). This framework adapts the model to the target domain through day-night loops without requiring access to source data. Specifically, we implement distinct adaptation strategies for daytime and nighttime to better meet the demands of clinical settings. During the daytime, model parameters are frozen, and a specific low-frequency prompt is trained for each test sample. Additionally, we construct a memory bank for prompt initialization and develop a warm-up mechanism to enhance prompt training. During nighttime, we integrate a global student model into the traditional teacher-student self-training paradigm to fine-tune the model while ensuring training stability...

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) for medical image segmentation is a challenging yet highly practical task, which reduces reliance on large-scale labeled dataset by leveraging unlabeled samples. Among SSL techniques, the weak-to-strong consistency framework, popularized by FixMatch, has emerged as a state-of-the-art method in classification tasks. Notably, such a simple pipeline has also shown competitive performance in medical image segmentation. However, two key limitations still persist, impeding its efficient adaptation: (1) the neglect of contextual dependencies results in inconsistent predictions for similar semantic features, leading to incomplete object segmentation; (2) the lack of exploitation of semantic similarity between labeled and unlabeled data induces considerable class-distribution discrepancy. To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised framework based on FixMatch, named SemSim, powered by two appealing designs from semantic similarity perspective: (1) rectifying pixel-wise prediction by reasoning about the intra-image pair-wise affinity map, thus integrating contextual dependencies explicitly into the final prediction; (2) bridging labeled and unlabeled data via a feature querying mechanism for compact class representation learning, which fully considers cross-image anatomical similarities. As the reliable semantic similarity extraction depends on robust features, we further introduce an effective spatial-aware fusion module (SFM) to explore distinctive information from multiple scales. Extensive experiments show that SemSim yields consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art methods across three public segmentation benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Stereo estimation has made many advancements in recent years with the introduction of deep-learning. However the traditional supervised approach to deep-learning requires the creation of accurate and plentiful ground-truth data, which is expensive to create and not available in many situations. This is especially true for remote sensing applications, where there is an excess of available data without proper ground truth. To tackle this problem, we propose a self-supervised CNN with self-improving adaptive abilities. In the first iteration, the created disparity map is inaccurate and noisy. Leveraging the left-right consistency check, we get a sparse but more accurate disparity map which is used as an initial pseudo ground-truth. This pseudo ground-truth is then adapted and updated after every epoch in the training step of the network. We use the sum of inconsistent points in order to track the network convergence.

- **Summary**: Geometry problem-solving demands advanced reasoning abilities to process multimodal inputs and employ mathematical knowledge effectively. Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in various multimodal tasks. Yet, they still struggle with geometry problems and are significantly limited by their inability to perform mathematical operations not seen during pre-training, such as calculating the cosine of an arbitrary angle, and by difficulties in correctly applying relevant geometry formulas. To overcome these challenges, we present GeoCoder, which leverages modular code-finetuning to generate and execute code using a predefined geometry function library. By executing the code, we achieve accurate and deterministic calculations, contrasting the stochastic nature of autoregressive token prediction, while the function library minimizes errors in formula usage. We also propose a multimodal retrieval-augmented variant of GeoCoder, named RAG-GeoCoder, which incorporates a non-parametric memory module for retrieving functions from the geometry library, thereby reducing reliance on parametric memory. Our modular code-finetuning approach enhances the geometric reasoning capabilities of VLMs, yielding an average improvement of over 16% across various question complexities on the GeomVerse dataset compared to other finetuning methods.

- **Summary**: Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (MedVLP) has made significant progress in enabling zero-shot tasks for medical image understanding. However, training MedVLP models typically requires large-scale datasets with paired, high-quality image-text data, which are scarce in the medical domain. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models have made it possible to generate large-scale synthetic image-text pairs. This raises the question: *Can MedVLP succeed using purely synthetic data?* To address this, we use off-the-shelf generative models to create synthetic radiology reports and paired Chest X-ray (CXR) images, and propose an automated pipeline to build a diverse, high-quality synthetic dataset, enabling a rigorous study that isolates model and training settings, focusing entirely from the data perspective. Our results show that MedVLP models trained *exclusively on synthetic data* outperform those trained on real data by **3.8%** in averaged AUC on zero-shot classification. Moreover, using a combination of synthetic and real data leads to a further improvement of **9.07%**. Additionally, MedVLP models trained on synthetic or mixed data consistently outperform those trained on real data in zero-shot grounding, as well as in fine-tuned classification and segmentation tasks. Our analysis suggests MedVLP trained on well-designed synthetic data can outperform models trained on real datasets, which may be limited by low-quality samples and long-tailed distributions.

- **Summary**: For the validation and verification of automotive radars, datasets of realistic traffic scenarios are required, which, how ever, are laborious to acquire. In this paper, we introduce radar scene synthesis using GANs as an alternative to the real dataset acquisition and simulation-based approaches. We train a PointNet++ based GAN model to generate realistic radar point cloud scenes and use a binary classifier to evaluate the performance of scenes generated using this model against a test set of real scenes. We demonstrate that our GAN model achieves similar performance (~87%) to the real scenes test set.

- **Summary**: We propose L3DG, the first approach for generative 3D modeling of 3D Gaussians through a latent 3D Gaussian diffusion formulation. This enables effective generative 3D modeling, scaling to generation of entire room-scale scenes which can be very efficiently rendered. To enable effective synthesis of 3D Gaussians, we propose a latent diffusion formulation, operating in a compressed latent space of 3D Gaussians. This compressed latent space is learned by a vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), for which we employ a sparse convolutional architecture to efficiently operate on room-scale scenes. This way, the complexity of the costly generation process via diffusion is substantially reduced, allowing higher detail on object-level generation, as well as scalability to large scenes. By leveraging the 3D Gaussian representation, the generated scenes can be rendered from arbitrary viewpoints in real-time. We demonstrate that our approach significantly improves visual quality over prior work on unconditional object-level radiance field synthesis and showcase its applicability to room-scale scene generation.

- **Summary**: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing is widely applied in fields such as emergency response, owing to its advantages of rapid information acquisition and low cost. However, due to the effects of shooting distance and imaging mechanisms, the objects in the images present challenges such as small size, dense distribution, and low inter-class differentiation. To this end, we propose a multimodal remote sensing detection network that employs a quad-directional selective scanning fusion strategy called RemoteDet-Mamba. RemoteDet-Mamba simultaneously facilitates the learning of single-modal local features and the integration of patch-level global features across modalities, enhancing the distinguishability for small objects and utilizing local information to improve discrimination between different classes. Additionally, the use of Mamba's serial processing significantly increases detection speed. Experimental results on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of RemoteDet-Mamba, which achieves superior detection accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational efficiency and parameter count.

- **Summary**: Generative models have become a powerful tool for image editing tasks, including object insertion. However, these methods often lack spatial awareness, generating objects with unrealistic locations and scales, or unintentionally altering the scene background. A key challenge lies in maintaining visual coherence, which requires both a geometrically suitable object location and a high-quality image edit. In this paper, we focus on the former, creating a location model dedicated to identifying realistic object locations. Specifically, we train an autoregressive model that generates bounding box coordinates, conditioned on the background image and the desired object class. This formulation allows to effectively handle sparse placement annotations and to incorporate implausible locations into a preference dataset by performing direct preference optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our generative location model, when paired with an inpainting method, substantially outperforms state-of-the-art instruction-tuned models and location modeling baselines in object insertion tasks, delivering accurate and visually coherent results.

- **Summary**: Recent illumination estimation methods have focused on enhancing the resolution and improving the quality and diversity of the generated textures. However, few have explored tailoring the neural network architecture to the Equirectangular Panorama (ERP) format utilised in image-based lighting. Consequently, high dynamic range images (HDRI) results usually exhibit a seam at the side borders and textures or objects that are warped at the poles. To address this shortcoming we propose a novel architecture, 360U-Former, based on a U-Net style Vision-Transformer which leverages the work of PanoSWIN, an adapted shifted window attention tailored to the ERP format. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first purely Vision-Transformer model used in the field of illumination estimation. We train 360U-Former as a GAN to generate HDRI from a limited field of view low dynamic range image (LDRI). We evaluate our method using current illumination estimation evaluation protocols and datasets, demonstrating that our approach outperforms existing and state-of-the-art methods without the artefacts typically associated with the use of the ERP format.

- **Summary**: Cloth-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID), also known as Long-Term Person Re-Identification (LT-ReID) is a critical and challenging research topic in computer vision that has recently garnered significant attention. However, due to the high cost of constructing CC-ReID data, the existing data-driven models are hard to train efficiently on limited data, causing overfitting issue. To address this challenge, we propose a low-cost and efficient pipeline for generating controllable and high-quality synthetic data simulating the surveillance of real scenarios specific to the CC-ReID task. Particularly, we construct a new self-annotated CC-ReID dataset named Cloth-Changing Unreal Person (CCUP), containing 6,000 IDs, 1,179,976 images, 100 cameras, and 26.5 outfits per individual. Based on this large-scale dataset, we introduce an effective and scalable pretrain-finetune framework for enhancing the generalization capabilities of the traditional CC-ReID models. The extensive experiments demonstrate that two typical models namely TransReID and FIRe^2, when integrated into our framework, outperform other state-of-the-art models after pretraining on CCUP and finetuning on the benchmarks such as PRCC, VC-Clothes and NKUP.

- **Summary**: This study investigates the reconstruction of hyperspectral signatures from RGB data to enhance surgical imaging, utilizing the publicly available HeiPorSPECTRAL dataset from porcine surgery and an in-house neurosurgery dataset. Various architectures based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer models are evaluated using comprehensive metrics. Transformer models exhibit superior performance in terms of RMSE, SAM, PSNR and SSIM by effectively integrating spatial information to predict accurate spectral profiles, encompassing both visible and extended spectral ranges. Qualitative assessments demonstrate the capability to predict spectral profiles critical for informed surgical decision-making during procedures. Challenges associated with capturing both the visible and extended hyperspectral ranges are highlighted using the MAE, emphasizing the complexities involved. The findings open up the new research direction of hyperspectral reconstruction for surgical applications and clinical use cases in real-time surgical environments.

- **Summary**: Closed-loop simulation is essential for advancing end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Contemporary sensor simulation methods, such as NeRF and 3DGS, rely predominantly on conditions closely aligned with training data distributions, which are largely confined to forward-driving scenarios. Consequently, these methods face limitations when rendering complex maneuvers (e.g., lane change, acceleration, deceleration). Recent advancements in autonomous-driving world models have demonstrated the potential to generate diverse driving videos. However, these approaches remain constrained to 2D video generation, inherently lacking the spatiotemporal coherence required to capture intricacies of dynamic driving environments. In this paper, we introduce \textit{DriveDreamer4D}, which enhances 4D driving scene representation leveraging world model priors. Specifically, we utilize the world model as a data machine to synthesize novel trajectory videos based on real-world driving data. Notably, we explicitly leverage structured conditions to control the spatial-temporal consistency of foreground and background elements, thus the generated data adheres closely to traffic constraints. To our knowledge, \textit{DriveDreamer4D} is the first to utilize video generation models for improving 4D reconstruction in driving scenarios. Experimental results reveal that \textit{DriveDreamer4D} significantly enhances generation quality under novel trajectory views, achieving a relative improvement in FID by 24.5\%, 39.0\%, and 10.5\% compared to PVG, $\text{S}^3$Gaussian, and Deformable-GS. Moreover, \textit{DriveDreamer4D} markedly enhances the spatiotemporal coherence of driving agents, which is verified by a comprehensive user study and the relative increases of 20.3\%, 42.0\%, and 13.7\% in the NTA-IoU metric.

- **Summary**: This work proposes a novel method for object co-segmentation, i.e. pixel-level localization of a common object in a set of images, that uses no pixel-level supervision for training. Two pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) models are exploited: ImageNet classification-trained ViT, whose features are used to estimate rough object localization through intra-class token relevance, and a self-supervised DINO-ViT for intra-image token relevance. On recent challenging benchmarks, the method achieves state-of-the-art performance among methods trained with the same level of supervision (image labels) while being competitive with methods trained with pixel-level supervision (binary masks). The benefits of the proposed co-segmentation method are further demonstrated in the task of large-scale sketch recognition, that is, the classification of sketches into a wide range of categories. The limited amount of hand-drawn sketch training data is leveraged by exploiting readily available image-level-annotated datasets of natural images containing a large number of classes. To bridge the domain gap, the classifier is trained on a sketch-like proxy domain derived from edges detected on natural images. We show that sketch recognition significantly benefits when the classifier is trained on sketch-like structures extracted from the co-segmented area rather than from the full image.

- **Summary**: Multi-camera systems are indispensable in movies, TV shows, and other media. Selecting the appropriate camera at every timestamp has a decisive impact on production quality and audience preferences. Learning-based view recommendation frameworks can assist professionals in decision-making. However, they often struggle outside of their training domains. The scarcity of labeled multi-camera view recommendation datasets exacerbates the issue. Based on the insight that many videos are edited from the original multi-camera videos, we propose transforming regular videos into pseudo-labeled multi-camera view recommendation datasets. Promisingly, by training the model on pseudo-labeled datasets stemming from videos in the target domain, we achieve a 68% relative improvement in the model's accuracy in the target domain and bridge the accuracy gap between in-domain and never-before-seen domains.

- **Summary**: This study addresses the challenge of analyzing the growth kinetics of carbon nanotubes using in-situ homodyne polarization microscopy (HPM) by developing an automated deep learning (DL) approach. A Mask-RCNN architecture, enhanced with a ResNet-50 backbone, was employed to recognize and track individual nanotubes in microscopy videos, significantly improving the efficiency and reproducibility of kinetic data extraction. The method involves a series of video processing steps to enhance contrast and used differential treatment techniques to manage low signal and fast kinetics. The DL model demonstrates consistency with manual measurements and increased throughput, laying the foundation for statistical studies of nanotube growth. The approach can be adapted for other types of in-situ microscopy studies, emphasizing the importance of automation in high-throughput data acquisition for research on individual nano-objects.

- **Summary**: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to identify visual frames in a video clip that match text queries. Recent studies in VTG employ cross-attention to correlate visual frames and text queries as individual token sequences. However, these approaches overlook a crucial aspect of the problem: a holistic understanding of the query sentence. A model may capture correlations between individual word tokens and arbitrary visual frames while possibly missing out on the global meaning. To address this, we introduce two primary contributions: (1) a visual frame-level gate mechanism that incorporates holistic textual information, (2) cross-modal alignment loss to learn the fine-grained correlation between query and relevant frames. As a result, we regularize the effect of individual word tokens and suppress irrelevant visual frames. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in VTG benchmarks, indicating that holistic text understanding guides the model to focus on the semantically important parts within the video.

- **Summary**: Dynamic scenes rendering is an intriguing yet challenging problem. Although current methods based on NeRF have achieved satisfactory performance, they still can not reach real-time levels. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gar?nered researchers attention due to their outstanding rendering quality and real?time speed. Therefore, a new paradigm has been proposed: defining a canonical 3D gaussians and deforming it to individual frames in deformable fields. How?ever, since the coordinates of canonical 3D gaussians are filled with noise, which can transfer noise into the deformable fields, and there is currently no method that adequately considers the aggregation of 4D information. Therefore, we pro?pose Denoised Deformable Network with Temporal-Spatial Aggregation for Dy?namic Scene Rendering (DN-4DGS). Specifically, a Noise Suppression Strategy is introduced to change the distribution of the coordinates of the canonical 3D gaussians and suppress noise. Additionally, a Decoupled Temporal-Spatial Ag?gregation Module is designed to aggregate information from adjacent points and frames. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality under a real-time level.

- **Summary**: Smaller vision-language models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly important for privacy-focused, on-device applications due to their ability to run efficiently on consumer hardware for processing enterprise commercial documents and images. These models require strong language understanding and visual capabilities to enhance human-machine interaction. To address this need, we present H2OVL-Mississippi, a pair of small VLMs trained on 37 million image-text pairs using 240 hours of compute on 8 x H100 GPUs. H2OVL-Mississippi-0.8B is a tiny model with 0.8 billion parameters that specializes in text recognition, achieving state of the art performance on the Text Recognition portion of OCRBench and surpassing much larger models in this area. Additionally, we are releasing H2OVL-Mississippi-2B, a 2 billion parameter model for general use cases, exhibiting highly competitive metrics across various academic benchmarks. Both models build upon our prior work with H2O-Danube language models, extending their capabilities into the visual domain. We release them under the Apache 2.0 license, making VLMs accessible to everyone, democratizing document AI and visual LLMs.

- **Summary**: 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) has recently emerged as a promising technique for capturing complex dynamic 3D scenes with high fidelity. It utilizes a 4D Gaussian representation and a GPU-friendly rasterizer, enabling rapid rendering speeds. Despite its advantages, 4DGS faces significant challenges, notably the requirement of millions of 4D Gaussians, each with extensive associated attributes, leading to substantial memory and storage cost. This paper introduces a memory-efficient framework for 4DGS. We streamline the color attribute by decomposing it into a per-Gaussian direct color component with only 3 parameters and a shared lightweight alternating current color predictor. This approach eliminates the need for spherical harmonics coefficients, which typically involve up to 144 parameters in classic 4DGS, thereby creating a memory-efficient 4D Gaussian representation. Furthermore, we introduce an entropy-constrained Gaussian deformation technique that uses a deformation field to expand the action range of each Gaussian and integrates an opacity-based entropy loss to limit the number of Gaussians, thus forcing our model to use as few Gaussians as possible to fit a dynamic scene well. With simple half-precision storage and zip compression, our framework achieves a storage reduction by approximately 190$\times$ and 125$\times$ on the Technicolor and Neural 3D Video datasets, respectively, compared to the original 4DGS. Meanwhile, it maintains comparable rendering speeds and scene representation quality, setting a new standard in the field.

- **Summary**: The world is abundant with diverse materials, each possessing unique surface appearances that play a crucial role in our daily perception and understanding of their properties. Despite advancements in technology enabling the capture and realistic reproduction of material appearances for visualization and quality control, the interoperability of material property information across various measurement representations and software platforms remains a complex challenge. A key to overcoming this challenge lies in the automatic identification of materials' perceptual features, enabling intuitive differentiation of properties stored in disparate material data representations. We reasoned that for many practical purposes, a compact representation of the perceptual appearance is more useful than an exhaustive physical description.This paper introduces a novel approach to material identification by encoding perceptual features obtained from dynamic visual stimuli. We conducted a psychophysical experiment to select and validate 16 particularly significant perceptual attributes obtained from videos of 347 materials. We then gathered attribute ratings from over twenty participants for each material, creating a 'material fingerprint' that encodes the unique perceptual properties of each material. Finally, we trained a multi-layer perceptron model to predict the relationship between statistical and deep learning image features and their corresponding perceptual properties. We demonstrate the model's performance in material retrieval and filtering according to individual attributes. This model represents a significant step towards simplifying the sharing and understanding of material properties in diverse digital environments regardless of their digital representation, enhancing both the accuracy and efficiency of material identification.

- **Summary**: The rapid growth of model scale has necessitated substantial computational resources for fine-tuning. Existing approach such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has sought to address the problem of handling the large updated parameters in full fine-tuning. However, LoRA utilize random initialization and optimization of low-rank matrices to approximate updated weights, which can result in suboptimal convergence and an accuracy gap compared to full fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose LoLDU, a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach that significantly reduces trainable parameters by 2600 times compared to regular PEFT methods while maintaining comparable performance. LoLDU leverages Lower-Diag-Upper Decomposition (LDU) to initialize low-rank matrices for faster convergence and orthogonality. We focus on optimizing the diagonal matrix for scaling transformations. To the best of our knowledge, LoLDU has the fewest parameters among all PEFT approaches. We conducted extensive experiments across 4 instruction-following datasets, 6 natural language understanding (NLU) datasets, 8 image classification datasets, and image generation datasets with multiple model types (LLaMA2, RoBERTa, ViT, and Stable Diffusion), providing a comprehensive and detailed analysis.

- **Summary**: This work proposes a novel approach beyond supervised learning for effective pathological image analysis, addressing the challenge of limited robust labeled data. Pathological diagnosis of diseases like cancer has conventionally relied on the evaluation of morphological features by physicians and pathologists. However, recent advancements in compute-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are gaining significant attention as diagnostic support tools. Although the advancement of deep learning has improved CAD significantly, segmentation models typically require large pixel-level annotated dataset, and such labeling is expensive. Existing studies not based on supervised approaches still struggle with limited generalization, and no practical approach has emerged yet. To address this issue, we present a weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) model by combining class activation map and Segment Anything Model (SAM)-based pseudo-labeling. For effective pretraining, we adopt the SAM-a foundation model that is pretrained on large datasets and operates in zero-shot configurations using only coarse prompts. The proposed approach transfer enhanced Attention Dropout Layer's knowledge to SAM, thereby generating pseudo-labels. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, experimental studies are conducted on histopathological breast cancer datasets. The proposed method outperformed other WSSS methods across three datasets, demonstrating its efficiency by achieving this with only 12GB of GPU memory during training.

- **Summary**: An ability to learn about new objects from a small amount of visual data and produce convincing linguistic justification about the presence/absence of certain concepts (that collectively compose the object) in novel scenarios is an important characteristic of human cognition. This is possible due to abstraction of attributes/properties that an object is composed of e.g. an object `bird' can be identified by the presence of a beak, feathers, legs, wings, etc. Inspired by this aspect of human reasoning, in this work, we present a zero-shot framework for fine-grained visual concept learning by leveraging large language model and Visual Question Answering (VQA) system. Specifically, we prompt GPT-3 to obtain a rich linguistic description of visual objects in the dataset. We convert the obtained concept descriptions into a set of binary questions. We pose these questions along with the query image to a VQA system and aggregate the answers to determine the presence or absence of an object in the test images. Our experiments demonstrate comparable performance with existing zero-shot visual classification methods and few-shot concept learning approaches, without substantial computational overhead, yet being fully explainable from the reasoning perspective.

- **Summary**: Humans observe various actions being performed by other humans (physically or in videos/images) and can draw a wide range of inferences about it beyond what they can visually perceive. Such inferences include determining the aspects of the world that make action execution possible (e.g. liquid objects can undergo pouring), predicting how the world will change as a result of the action (e.g. potatoes being golden and crispy after frying), high-level goals associated with the action (e.g. beat the eggs to make an omelet) and reasoning about actions that possibly precede or follow the current action (e.g. crack eggs before whisking or draining pasta after boiling). Similar reasoning ability is highly desirable in autonomous systems that would assist us in performing everyday tasks. To that end, we propose a multi-modal task to learn aforementioned concepts about actions being performed in images. We develop a dataset consisting of 8.5k images and 59.3k inferences about actions grounded in those images, collected from an annotated cooking-video dataset. We propose ActionCOMET, a zero-shot framework to discern knowledge present in language models specific to the provided visual input. We present baseline results of ActionCOMET over the collected dataset and compare them with the performance of the best existing VQA approaches.

- **Summary**: The integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with artificial intelligence (AI) models for aerial imagery processing in disaster assessment, necessitates models that demonstrate exceptional accuracy, computational efficiency, and real-time processing capabilities. Traditionally Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), demonstrate efficiency in local feature extraction but are limited by their potential for global context interpretation. On the other hand, Vision Transformers (ViTs) show promise for improved global context interpretation through the use of attention mechanisms, although they still remain underinvestigated in UAV-based disaster response applications. Bridging this research gap, we introduce DiRecNetV2, an improved hybrid model that utilizes convolutional and transformer layers. It merges the inductive biases of CNNs for robust feature extraction with the global context understanding of Transformers, maintaining a low computational load ideal for UAV applications. Additionally, we introduce a new, compact multi-label dataset of disasters, to set an initial benchmark for future research, exploring how models trained on single-label data perform in a multi-label test set. The study assesses lightweight CNNs and ViTs on the AIDERSv2 dataset, based on the frames per second (FPS) for efficiency and the weighted F1 scores for classification performance. DiRecNetV2 not only achieves a weighted F1 score of 0.964 on a single-label test set but also demonstrates adaptability, with a score of 0.614 on a complex multi-label test set, while functioning at 176.13 FPS on the Nvidia Orin Jetson device.

- **Summary**: Deriving inference from heterogeneous inputs (such as images, text, and audio) is an important skill for humans to perform day-to-day tasks. A similar ability is desirable for the development of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. While state-of-the-art models are rapidly closing the gap with human-level performance on diverse computer vision and NLP tasks separately, they struggle to solve tasks that require joint reasoning over visual and textual modalities. Inspired by GLUE (Wang et. al., 2018)- a multitask benchmark for natural language understanding, we propose VL-GLUE in this paper. VL-GLUE consists of over 100k samples spanned across seven different tasks, which at their core require visuo-linguistic reasoning. Moreover, our benchmark comprises of diverse image types (from synthetically rendered figures, and day-to-day scenes to charts and complex diagrams) and includes a broad variety of domain-specific text (from cooking, politics, and sports to high-school curricula), demonstrating the need for multi-modal understanding in the real-world. We show that this benchmark is quite challenging for existing large-scale vision-language models and encourage development of systems that possess robust visuo-linguistic reasoning capabilities.

- **Summary**: Low-quality or scarce data has posed significant challenges for training deep neural networks in practice. While classical data augmentation cannot contribute very different new data, diffusion models opens up a new door to build self-evolving AI by generating high-quality and diverse synthetic data through text-guided prompts. However, text-only guidance cannot control synthetic images' proximity to the original images, resulting in out-of-distribution data detrimental to the model performance. To overcome the limitation, we study image guidance to achieve a spectrum of interpolations between synthetic and real images. With stronger image guidance, the generated images are similar to the training data but hard to learn. While with weaker image guidance, the synthetic images will be easier for model but contribute to a larger distribution gap with the original data. The generated full spectrum of data enables us to build a novel "Diffusion Curriculum (DisCL)". DisCL adjusts the image guidance level of image synthesis for each training stage: It identifies and focuses on hard samples for the model and assesses the most effective guidance level of synthetic images to improve hard data learning. We apply DisCL to two challenging tasks: long-tail (LT) classification and learning from low-quality data. It focuses on lower-guidance images of high-quality to learn prototypical features as a warm-up of learning higher-guidance images that might be weak on diversity or quality. Extensive experiments showcase a gain of 2.7% and 2.1% in OOD and ID macro-accuracy when applying DisCL to iWildCam dataset. On ImageNet-LT, DisCL improves the base model's tail-class accuracy from 4.4% to 23.64% and leads to a 4.02% improvement in all-class accuracy.

- **Summary**: We introduce a method for transferring the signer's appearance in sign language skeletal poses while preserving the sign content. Using estimated poses, we transfer the appearance of one signer to another, maintaining natural movements and transitions. This approach improves pose-based rendering and sign stitching while obfuscating identity. Our experiments show that while the method reduces signer identification accuracy, it slightly harms sign recognition performance, highlighting a tradeoff between privacy and utility.

- **Summary**: Assessing the quality of bovine satellite cells (BSCs) is essential for the cultivated meat industry, which aims to address global food sustainability challenges. This study aims to develop a label-free method for predicting fluorescence markers in isolated BSCs using deep learning. We employed a U-Net-based CNN model to predict multiple fluorescence signals from a single bright-field microscopy image of cell culture. Two key biomarkers, DAPI and Pax7, were used to determine the abundance and quality of BSCs. The image pre-processing pipeline included fluorescence denoising to improve prediction performance and consistency. A total of 48 biological replicates were used, with statistical performance metrics such as Pearson correlation coefficient and SSIM employed for model evaluation. The model exhibited better performance with DAPI predictions due to uniform staining. Pax7 predictions were more variable, reflecting biological heterogeneity. Enhanced visualization techniques, including color mapping and image overlay, improved the interpretability of the predictions by providing better contextual and perceptual information. The findings highlight the importance of data pre-processing and demonstrate the potential of deep learning to advance non-invasive, label-free assessment techniques in the cultivated meat industry, paving the way for reliable and actionable AI-driven evaluations.

- **Summary**: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capability of understanding the video semantics on various downstream tasks. Despite the advancements, there is still a lack of systematic research on visual context representation, which refers to the scheme to select frames from a video and further select the tokens from a frame. In this paper, we explore the design space for visual context representation, and aim to improve the performance of video MLLMs by finding more effective representation schemes. Firstly, we formulate the task of visual context representation as a constrained optimization problem, and model the language modeling loss as a function of the number of frames and the number of embeddings (or tokens) per frame, given the maximum visual context window size. Then, we explore the scaling effects in frame selection and token selection respectively, and fit the corresponding function curve by conducting extensive empirical experiments. We examine the effectiveness of typical selection strategies and present empirical findings to determine the two factors. Furthermore, we study the joint effect of frame selection and token selection, and derive the optimal formula for determining the two factors. We demonstrate that the derived optimal settings show alignment with the best-performed results of empirical experiments.

- **Summary**: We present Movie Gen, a cast of foundation models that generates high-quality, 1080p HD videos with different aspect ratios and synchronized audio. We also show additional capabilities such as precise instruction-based video editing and generation of personalized videos based on a user's image. Our models set a new state-of-the-art on multiple tasks: text-to-video synthesis, video personalization, video editing, video-to-audio generation, and text-to-audio generation. Our largest video generation model is a 30B parameter transformer trained with a maximum context length of 73K video tokens, corresponding to a generated video of 16 seconds at 16 frames-per-second. We show multiple technical innovations and simplifications on the architecture, latent spaces, training objectives and recipes, data curation, evaluation protocols, parallelization techniques, and inference optimizations that allow us to reap the benefits of scaling pre-training data, model size, and training compute for training large scale media generation models. We hope this paper helps the research community to accelerate progress and innovation in media generation models.

- **Summary**: Talking head generation intends to produce vivid and realistic talking head videos from a single portrait and speech audio clip. Although significant progress has been made in diffusion-based talking head generation, almost all methods rely on autoregressive strategies, which suffer from limited context utilization beyond the current generation step, error accumulation, and slower generation speed. To address these challenges, we present DAWN (Dynamic frame Avatar With Non-autoregressive diffusion), a framework that enables all-at-once generation of dynamic-length video sequences. Specifically, it consists of two main components: (1) audio-driven holistic facial dynamics generation in the latent motion space, and (2) audio-driven head pose and blink generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates authentic and vivid videos with precise lip motions, and natural pose/blink movements. Additionally, with a high generation speed, DAWN possesses strong extrapolation capabilities, ensuring the stable production of high-quality long videos. These results highlight the considerable promise and potential impact of DAWN in the field of talking head video generation. Furthermore, we hope that DAWN sparks further exploration of non-autoregressive approaches in diffusion models. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Hanbo-Cheng/DAWN-pytorch.

- **Summary**: We focus on improving the visual understanding capability for boosting the vision-language models. We propose \textbf{Arcana}, a multiModal language model, which introduces two crucial techniques. First, we present Multimodal LoRA (MM-LoRA), a module designed to enhance the decoder. Unlike traditional language-driven decoders, MM-LoRA consists of two parallel LoRAs -- one for vision and one for language -- each with its own parameters. This disentangled parameters design allows for more specialized learning in each modality and better integration of multimodal information. Second, we introduce the Query Ladder adapter (QLadder) to improve the visual encoder. QLadder employs a learnable ``\textit{ladder}'' structure to deeply aggregates the intermediate representations from the frozen pretrained visual encoder (e.g., CLIP image encoder). This enables the model to learn new and informative visual features, as well as remaining the powerful capabilities of the pretrained visual encoder. These techniques collectively enhance Arcana's visual perception power, enabling it to leverage improved visual information for more accurate and contextually relevant outputs across various multimodal scenarios. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our Arcana. The code and re-annotated data are available at \url{https://arcana-project-page.github.io}.

- **Summary**: Eyelid shape is integral to identity and likeness in human facial modeling. Human eyelids are diverse in appearance with varied skin fold and epicanthal fold morphology between individuals. Existing parametric face models express eyelid shape variation to an extent, but do not preserve sufficient likeness across a diverse range of individuals. We propose a new definition of eyelid fold consistency and implement geometric processing techniques to model diverse eyelid shapes in a unified topology. Using this method we reprocess data used to train a parametric face model and demonstrate significant improvements in face-related machine learning tasks.

- **Summary**: The increasing availability of public models begs the question: can we train neural networks that use other networks as input? This paper learns to represent models within a joint space that embeds both model weights and language. However, machine learning on model weights is challenging as model weights often exhibit significant variation unrelated to the models' semantic properties (nuisance variation). We identify a key property of real-world models: most public models belong to a small set of Model Trees, where all models within a tree are fine-tuned from a common ancestor (e.g., a foundation model). Importantly, we find that within each tree there is less nuisance variation between models. For example, while classifying models according to their training dataset generally requires complex architectures, in our case, even a linear classifier trained on a single layer is often effective. While effective, linear layers are computationally expensive as model weights are very high dimensional. To address this, we introduce Probing Experts (ProbeX), a theoretically motivated, lightweight probing method. Notably, ProbeX is the first probing method designed to learn from the weights of just a single model layer. We also construct and release a dataset that simulates the structure of public model repositories. Our results show that ProbeX can effectively map the weights of large models into a shared weight-language embedding space. Furthermore, we demonstrate the impressive generalization of our method, achieving zero-shot model classification and retrieval.

- **Summary**: Speech-driven gesture generation aims at synthesizing a gesture sequence synchronized with the input speech signal. Previous methods leverage neural networks to directly map a compact audio representation to the gesture sequence, ignoring the semantic association of different modalities and failing to deal with salient gestures. In this paper, we propose a novel speech-driven gesture generation method by emphasizing the semantic consistency of salient posture. Specifically, we first learn a joint manifold space for the individual representation of audio and body pose to exploit the inherent semantic association between two modalities, and propose to enforce semantic consistency via a consistency loss. Furthermore, we emphasize the semantic consistency of salient postures by introducing a weakly-supervised detector to identify salient postures, and reweighting the consistency loss to focus more on learning the correspondence between salient postures and the high-level semantics of speech content. In addition, we propose to extract audio features dedicated to facial expression and body gesture separately, and design separate branches for face and body gesture synthesis. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we tackle the problem of how to build and benchmark a large motion model (LMM). The ultimate goal of LMM is to serve as a foundation model for versatile motion-related tasks, e.g., human motion generation, with interpretability and generalizability. Though advanced, recent LMM-related works are still limited by small-scale motion data and costly text descriptions. Besides, previous motion benchmarks primarily focus on pure body movements, neglecting the ubiquitous motions in context, i.e., humans interacting with humans, objects, and scenes. To address these limitations, we consolidate large-scale video action datasets as knowledge banks to build MotionBank, which comprises 13 video action datasets, 1.24M motion sequences, and 132.9M frames of natural and diverse human motions. Different from laboratory-captured motions, in-the-wild human-centric videos contain abundant motions in context. To facilitate better motion text alignment, we also meticulously devise a motion caption generation algorithm to automatically produce rule-based, unbiased, and disentangled text descriptions via the kinematic characteristics for each motion. Extensive experiments show that our MotionBank is beneficial for general motion-related tasks of human motion generation, motion in-context generation, and motion understanding. Video motions together with the rule-based text annotations could serve as an efficient alternative for larger LMMs. Our dataset, codes, and benchmark will be publicly available at https://github.com/liangxuy/MotionBank.

- **Summary**: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) aims at restoring high-quality (HQ) images from low-quality (LQ) inputs corrupted by unknown and complex degradations. In particular, pretrained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models provide strong generative priors to reconstruct credible and intricate details. However, T2I generation focuses on semantic consistency while Real-ISR emphasizes pixel-level reconstruction, which hinders existing methods from fully exploiting diffusion priors. To address this challenge, we introduce ConsisSR to handle both semantic and pixel-level consistency. Specifically, compared to coarse-grained text prompts, we exploit the more powerful CLIP image embedding and effectively leverage both modalities through our Hybrid Prompt Adapter (HPA) for semantic guidance. Secondly, we introduce Time-aware Latent Augmentation (TALA) to mitigate the inherent gap between T2I generation and Real-ISR consistency requirements. By randomly mixing LQ and HQ latent inputs, our model not only handle timestep-specific diffusion noise but also refine the accumulated latent representations. Last but not least, our GAN-Embedding strategy employs the pretrained Real-ESRGAN model to refine the diffusion start point. This accelerates the inference process to 10 steps while preserving sampling quality, in a training-free manner. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance among both full-scale and accelerated models. The code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: The diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, which relies on fundus images, faces challenges in achieving transparency and interpretability when using a global classification approach. However, segmentation-based databases are significantly more expensive to acquire and combining them is often problematic. This paper introduces a novel method, termed adversarial style conversion, to address the lack of standardization in annotation styles across diverse databases. By training a single architecture on combined databases, the model spontaneously modifies its segmentation style depending on the input, demonstrating the ability to convert among different labeling styles. The proposed methodology adds a linear probe to detect dataset origin based on encoder features and employs adversarial attacks to condition the model's segmentation style. Results indicate significant qualitative and quantitative through dataset combination, offering avenues for improved model generalization, uncertainty estimation and continuous interpolation between annotation styles. Our approach enables training a segmentation model with diverse databases while controlling and leveraging annotation styles for improved retinopathy diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Deep generative models have significantly advanced medical imaging analysis by enhancing dataset size and quality. Beyond mere data augmentation, our research in this paper highlights an additional, significant capacity of deep generative models: their ability to reveal and demonstrate patterns in medical images. We employ a generative structure with hybrid conditions, combining clinical data and segmentation masks to guide the image synthesis process. Furthermore, we innovatively transformed the tabular clinical data into textual descriptions. This approach simplifies the handling of missing values and also enables us to leverage large pre-trained vision-language models that investigate the relations between independent clinical entries and comprehend general terms, such as gender and smoking status. Our approach differs from and presents a more challenging task than traditional medical report-guided synthesis due to the less visual correlation of our clinical information with the images. To overcome this, we introduce a text-visual embedding mechanism that strengthens the conditions, ensuring the network effectively utilizes the provided information. Our pipeline is generalizable to both GAN-based and diffusion models. Experiments on chest CT, particularly focusing on the smoking status, demonstrated a consistent intensity shift in the lungs which is in agreement with clinical observations, indicating the effectiveness of our method in capturing and visualizing the impact of specific attributes on medical image patterns. Our methods offer a new avenue for the early detection and precise visualization of complex clinical conditions with deep generative models. All codes are https://github.com/junzhin/DGM-VLC.

- **Summary**: Text-rich visual understanding-the ability to process environments where dense textual content is integrated with visuals-is crucial for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to interact effectively with structured environments. To enhance this capability, we propose synthesizing general multimodal instructions from webpage UIs using text-based large language models (LLMs). Despite lacking direct visual input, text-based LLMs are able to process structured text representations from webpage accessibility trees. These instructions are then paired with UI screenshots to train multimodal models. We introduce MultiUI, a dataset containing 7.3 million samples from 1 million websites, covering diverse multimodal tasks and UI layouts. Models trained on MultiUI not only excel in web UI tasks-achieving up to a 48% improvement on VisualWebBench and a 19.1% boost in element accuracy on a web agent dataset Mind2Web-but also generalize surprisingly well to non-web UI tasks and even to non-UI domains, such as document understanding, OCR, and chart interpretation. These results highlight the broad applicability of web UI data for advancing text-rich visual understanding across various scenarios.

- **Summary**: With models getting stronger, evaluations have grown more complex, testing multiple skills in one benchmark and even in the same instance at once. However, skill-wise performance is obscured when inspecting aggregate accuracy, under-utilizing the rich signal modern benchmarks contain. We propose an automatic approach to recover the underlying skills relevant for any evaluation instance, by way of inspecting model-generated rationales. After validating the relevance of rationale-parsed skills and inferring skills for $46$k instances over $12$ benchmarks, we observe many skills to be common across benchmarks, resulting in the curation of hundreds of skill-slices (i.e. sets of instances testing a common skill). Inspecting accuracy over these slices yields novel insights on model trade-offs: e.g., compared to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, on average, Gemini 1.5 Pro is $18\%$ more accurate in "computing molar mass", but $19\%$ less accurate in "applying constitutional law", despite the overall accuracies of the three models differing by a mere $0.4\%$. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach by showing that insights derived from skill slice analysis can generalize to held-out instances: when routing each instance to the model strongest on the relevant skills, we see a $3\%$ accuracy improvement over our $12$ dataset corpus. Our skill-slices and framework open a new avenue in model evaluation, leveraging skill-specific analyses to unlock a more granular and actionable understanding of model capabilities.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in customized video generation have enabled users to create videos tailored to both specific subjects and motion trajectories. However, existing methods often require complicated test-time fine-tuning and struggle with balancing subject learning and motion control, limiting their real-world applications. In this paper, we present DreamVideo-2, a zero-shot video customization framework capable of generating videos with a specific subject and motion trajectory, guided by a single image and a bounding box sequence, respectively, and without the need for test-time fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce reference attention, which leverages the model's inherent capabilities for subject learning, and devise a mask-guided motion module to achieve precise motion control by fully utilizing the robust motion signal of box masks derived from bounding boxes. While these two components achieve their intended functions, we empirically observe that motion control tends to dominate over subject learning. To address this, we propose two key designs: 1) the masked reference attention, which integrates a blended latent mask modeling scheme into reference attention to enhance subject representations at the desired positions, and 2) a reweighted diffusion loss, which differentiates the contributions of regions inside and outside the bounding boxes to ensure a balance between subject and motion control. Extensive experimental results on a newly curated dataset demonstrate that DreamVideo-2 outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both subject customization and motion control. The dataset, code, and models will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Panoramic image stitching provides a unified, wide-angle view of a scene that extends beyond the camera's field of view. Stitching frames of a panning video into a panoramic photograph is a well-understood problem for stationary scenes, but when objects are moving, a still panorama cannot capture the scene. We present a method for synthesizing a panoramic video from a casually-captured panning video, as if the original video were captured with a wide-angle camera. We pose panorama synthesis as a space-time outpainting problem, where we aim to create a full panoramic video of the same length as the input video. Consistent completion of the space-time volume requires a powerful, realistic prior over video content and motion, for which we adapt generative video models. Existing generative models do not, however, immediately extend to panorama completion, as we show. We instead apply video generation as a component of our panorama synthesis system, and demonstrate how to exploit the strengths of the models while minimizing their limitations. Our system can create video panoramas for a range of in-the-wild scenes including people, vehicles, and flowing water, as well as stationary background features.

- **Summary**: We introduce D-FINE, a powerful real-time object detector that achieves outstanding localization precision by redefining the bounding box regression task in DETR models. D-FINE comprises two key components: Fine-grained Distribution Refinement (FDR) and Global Optimal Localization Self-Distillation (GO-LSD). FDR transforms the regression process from predicting fixed coordinates to iteratively refining probability distributions, providing a fine-grained intermediate representation that significantly enhances localization accuracy. GO-LSD is a bidirectional optimization strategy that transfers localization knowledge from refined distributions to shallower layers through self-distillation, while also simplifying the residual prediction tasks for deeper layers. Additionally, D-FINE incorporates lightweight optimizations in computationally intensive modules and operations, achieving a better balance between speed and accuracy. Specifically, D-FINE-L / X achieves 54.0% / 55.8% AP on the COCO dataset at 124 / 78 FPS on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. When pretrained on Objects365, D-FINE-L / X attains 57.1% / 59.3% AP, surpassing all existing real-time detectors. Furthermore, our method significantly enhances the performance of a wide range of DETR models by up to 5.3% AP with negligible extra parameters and training costs.

Prior research often relies on a single visual encoder for both tasks, such as Chameleon. However, due to the differing levels of information granularity required by multimodal understanding and generation, this approach can lead to suboptimal performance, particularly in multimodal understanding. To address this issue, we decouple visual encoding into separate pathways, while still leveraging a single, unified transformer architecture for processing. The decoupling not only alleviates the conflict between the visual encoder's roles in understanding and generation, but also enhances the framework's flexibility. For instance, both the multimodal understanding and generation components can independently select their most suitable encoding methods. Experiments show that Janus surpasses previous unified model and matches or exceeds the performance of task-specific models. The simplicity, high flexibility, and effectiveness of Janus make it a strong candidate for next-generation unified multimodal models.

- **Summary**: Vision foundation models trained on massive amounts of visual data have shown unprecedented reasoning and planning skills in open-world settings. A key challenge in applying them to robotic tasks is the modality gap between visual data and action data. We introduce differentiable robot rendering, a method allowing the visual appearance of a robot body to be directly differentiable with respect to its control parameters. Our model integrates a kinematics-aware deformable model and Gaussians Splatting and is compatible with any robot form factors and degrees of freedom. We demonstrate its capability and usage in applications including reconstruction of robot poses from images and controlling robots through vision language models. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our differentiable rendering model provides effective gradients for robotic control directly from pixels, setting the foundation for the future applications of vision foundation models in robotics.

- **Summary**: Multi-turn interactions between large language models (LLMs) and users naturally include implicit feedback signals. If an LLM responds in an unexpected way to an instruction, the user is likely to signal it by rephrasing the request, expressing frustration, or pivoting to an alternative task. Such signals are task-independent and occupy a relatively constrained subspace of language, allowing the LLM to identify them even if it fails on the actual task. This creates an avenue for continually learning from interactions without additional annotations. We introduce ReSpect, a method to learn from such signals in past interactions via retrospection. We deploy ReSpect in a new multimodal interaction scenario, where humans instruct an LLM to solve an abstract reasoning task with a combinatorial solution space. Through thousands of interactions with humans, we show how ReSpect gradually improves task completion rate from 31% to 82%, all without any external annotation.

- **Summary**: As the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to improve, the need for higher-order capability evaluation of MLLMs is increasing. However, there is a lack of work evaluating MLLM for higher-order perception and understanding of Chinese visual content. To fill the gap, we introduce the **C**hinese **I**mage **I**mplication understanding **Bench**mark, **CII-Bench**, which aims to assess the higher-order perception and understanding capabilities of MLLMs for Chinese images. CII-Bench stands out in several ways compared to existing benchmarks. Firstly, to ensure the authenticity of the Chinese context, images in CII-Bench are sourced from the Chinese Internet and manually reviewed, with corresponding answers also manually crafted. Additionally, CII-Bench incorporates images that represent Chinese traditional culture, such as famous Chinese traditional paintings, which can deeply reflect the model's understanding of Chinese traditional culture. Through extensive experiments on CII-Bench across multiple MLLMs, we have made significant findings. Initially, a substantial gap is observed between the performance of MLLMs and humans on CII-Bench. The highest accuracy of MLLMs attains 64.4%, where as human accuracy averages 78.2%, peaking at an impressive 81.0%. Subsequently, MLLMs perform worse on Chinese traditional culture images, suggesting limitations in their ability to understand high-level semantics and lack a deep knowledge base of Chinese traditional culture. Finally, it is observed that most models exhibit enhanced accuracy when image emotion hints are incorporated into the prompts. We believe that CII-Bench will enable MLLMs to gain a better understanding of Chinese semantics and Chinese-specific images, advancing the journey towards expert artificial general intelligence (AGI).

- **Summary**: Despite the significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their high computational cost remains a barrier to real-world deployment. Inspired by the mixture of depths (MoDs) in natural language processing, we aim to address this limitation from the perspective of ``activated tokens''. Our key insight is that if most tokens are redundant for the layer computation, then can be skipped directly via the MoD layer. However, directly converting the dense layers of MLLMs to MoD layers leads to substantial performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose an innovative MoD adaptation strategy for existing MLLMs called $\gamma$-MoD. In $\gamma$-MoD, a novel metric is proposed to guide the deployment of MoDs in the MLLM, namely rank of attention maps (ARank). Through ARank, we can effectively identify which layer is redundant and should be replaced with the MoD layer. Based on ARank, we further propose two novel designs to maximize the computational sparsity of MLLM while maintaining its performance, namely shared vision-language router and masked routing learning. With these designs, more than 90% dense layers of the MLLM can be effectively converted to the MoD ones. To validate our method, we apply it to three popular MLLMs, and conduct extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets. Experimental results not only validate the significant efficiency benefit of $\gamma$-MoD to existing MLLMs but also confirm its generalization ability on various MLLMs. For example, with a minor performance drop, i.e., -1.5%, $\gamma$-MoD can reduce the training and inference time of LLaVA-HR by 31.0% and 53.2%, respectively.

  grounding framework based solely on 2D images
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: 3D visual grounding is crucial for robots, requiring integration of natural language and 3D scene understanding. Traditional methods depending on supervised learning with 3D point clouds are limited by scarce datasets. Recently zero-shot methods leveraging LLMs have been proposed to address the data issue. While effective, these methods only use object-centric information, limiting their ability to handle complex queries. In this work, we present VLM-Grounder, a novel framework using vision-language models (VLMs) for zero-shot 3D visual grounding based solely on 2D images. VLM-Grounder dynamically stitches image sequences, employs a grounding and feedback scheme to find the target object, and uses a multi-view ensemble projection to accurately estimate 3D bounding boxes. Experiments on ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets show VLM-Grounder outperforms previous zero-shot methods, achieving 51.6% Acc@0.25 on ScanRefer and 48.0% Acc on Nr3D, without relying on 3D geometry or object priors.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in multimodal foundation models have yielded significant progress in vision-language understanding. Initial attempts have also explored the potential of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for visual content generation. However, existing works have insufficiently addressed the varying granularity demands of different image generation tasks within a unified MLLM paradigm - from the diversity required in text-to-image generation to the precise controllability needed in image manipulation. In this work, we propose PUMA, emPowering Unified MLLM with Multi-grAnular visual generation. PUMA unifies multi-granular visual features as both inputs and outputs of MLLMs, elegantly addressing the different granularity requirements of various image generation tasks within a unified MLLM framework. Following multimodal pretraining and task-specific instruction tuning, PUMA demonstrates proficiency in a wide range of multimodal tasks. This work represents a significant step towards a truly unified MLLM capable of adapting to the granularity demands of various visual tasks. The code and model will be released in https://github.com/rongyaofang/PUMA.

- **Summary**: Gaussian splatting and single/multi-view depth estimation are typically studied in isolation. In this paper, we present DepthSplat to connect Gaussian splatting and depth estimation and study their interactions. More specifically, we first contribute a robust multi-view depth model by leveraging pre-trained monocular depth features, leading to high-quality feed-forward 3D Gaussian splatting reconstructions. We also show that Gaussian splatting can serve as an unsupervised pre-training objective for learning powerful depth models from large-scale unlabelled datasets. We validate the synergy between Gaussian splatting and depth estimation through extensive ablation and cross-task transfer experiments. Our DepthSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet, RealEstate10K and DL3DV datasets in terms of both depth estimation and novel view synthesis, demonstrating the mutual benefits of connecting both tasks. Our code, models, and video results are available at https://haofeixu.github.io/depthsplat/.

- **Summary**: Scaling up autoregressive models in vision has not proven as beneficial as in large language models. In this work, we investigate this scaling problem in the context of text-to-image generation, focusing on two critical factors: whether models use discrete or continuous tokens, and whether tokens are generated in a random or fixed raster order using BERT- or GPT-like transformer architectures. Our empirical results show that, while all models scale effectively in terms of validation loss, their evaluation performance -- measured by FID, GenEval score, and visual quality -- follows different trends. Models based on continuous tokens achieve significantly better visual quality than those using discrete tokens. Furthermore, the generation order and attention mechanisms significantly affect the GenEval score: random-order models achieve notably better GenEval scores compared to raster-order models. Inspired by these findings, we train Fluid, a random-order autoregressive model on continuous tokens. Fluid 10.5B model achieves a new state-of-the-art zero-shot FID of 6.16 on MS-COCO 30K, and 0.69 overall score on the GenEval benchmark. We hope our findings and results will encourage future efforts to further bridge the scaling gap between vision and language models.

- **Summary**: Vision-centric autonomous driving has demonstrated excellent performance with economical sensors. As the fundamental step, 3D perception aims to infer 3D information from 2D images based on 3D-2D projection. This makes driving perception models susceptible to sensor configuration (e.g., camera intrinsics and extrinsics) variations. However, generalizing across camera configurations is important for deploying autonomous driving models on different car models. In this paper, we present UniDrive, a novel framework for vision-centric autonomous driving to achieve universal perception across camera configurations. We deploy a set of unified virtual cameras and propose a ground-aware projection method to effectively transform the original images into these unified virtual views. We further propose a virtual configuration optimization method by minimizing the expected projection error between original cameras and virtual cameras. The proposed virtual camera projection can be applied to existing 3D perception methods as a plug-and-play module to mitigate the challenges posed by camera parameter variability, resulting in more adaptable and reliable driving perception models. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we collect a dataset on Carla by driving the same routes while only modifying the camera configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method trained on one specific camera configuration can generalize to varying configurations with minor performance degradation.
