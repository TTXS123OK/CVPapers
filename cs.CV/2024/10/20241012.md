- **Summary**: High runtime memory and high latency puts significant constraint on Vision Transformer training and inference, especially on edge devices. Token pruning reduces the number of input tokens to the ViT based on importance criteria of each token. We present a Background Aware Vision Transformer (BAViT) model, a pre-processing block to object detection models like DETR/YOLOS aimed to reduce runtime memory and increase throughput by using a novel approach to identify background tokens in the image. The background tokens can be pruned completely or partially before feeding to a ViT based object detector. We use the semantic information provided by segmentation map and/or bounding box annotation to train a few layers of ViT to classify tokens to either foreground or background. Using 2 layers and 10 layers of BAViT, background and foreground tokens can be separated with 75% and 88% accuracy on VOC dataset and 71% and 80% accuracy on COCO dataset respectively. We show a 2 layer BAViT-small model as pre-processor to YOLOS can increase the throughput by 30% - 40% with a mAP drop of 3% without any sparse fine-tuning and 2% with sparse fine-tuning. Our approach is specifically targeted for Edge AI use cases.

- **Summary**: Deep learning and advancements in contactless sensors have significantly enhanced our ability to understand complex human activities in healthcare settings. In particular, deep learning models utilizing computer vision have been developed to enable detailed analysis of human gesture recognition, especially repetitive gestures which are commonly observed behaviors in children with autism. This research work aims to identify repetitive behaviors indicative of autism by analyzing videos captured in natural settings as children engage in daily activities. The focus is on accurately categorizing real-time repetitive gestures such as spinning, head banging, and arm flapping. To this end, we utilize the publicly accessible Self-Stimulatory Behavior Dataset (SSBD) to classify these stereotypical movements. A key component of the proposed methodology is the use of \textbf{VideoMAE}, a model designed to improve both spatial and temporal analysis of video data through a masking and reconstruction mechanism. This model significantly outperformed traditional methods, achieving an accuracy of 97.7\%, a 14.7\% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a critical technique for enhancing the sample quality of visual generative models. However, in autoregressive (AR) multi-modal generation, CFG introduces design inconsistencies between language and visual content, contradicting the design philosophy of unifying different modalities for visual AR. Motivated by language model alignment methods, we propose \textit{Condition Contrastive Alignment} (CCA) to facilitate guidance-free AR visual generation with high performance and analyze its theoretical connection with guided sampling methods. Unlike guidance methods that alter the sampling process to achieve the ideal sampling distribution, CCA directly fine-tunes pretrained models to fit the same distribution target. Experimental results show that CCA can significantly enhance the guidance-free performance of all tested models with just one epoch of fine-tuning ($\sim$ 1\% of pretraining epochs) on the pretraining dataset, on par with guided sampling methods. This largely removes the need for guided sampling in AR visual generation and cuts the sampling cost by half. Moreover, by adjusting training parameters, CCA can achieve trade-offs between sample diversity and fidelity similar to CFG. This experimentally confirms the strong theoretical connection between language-targeted alignment and visual-targeted guidance methods, unifying two previously independent research fields.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have exhibited remarkable performance across various downstream tasks by aligning text and images in a unified embedding space. However, due to the imbalanced distribution of pre-trained datasets, CLIP suffers from the bias problem in real-world applications. Existing debiasing methods struggle to obtain sufficient image samples for minority groups and incur high costs for group labeling. To address the limitations, we propose a Text-Only Debiasing framework called TOD, leveraging a text-as-image training paradigm to mitigate visual biases. Specifically, this approach repurposes the text encoder to function as an image encoder, thereby eliminating the need for image data. Simultaneously, it utilizes a large language model (LLM) to generate a balanced text dataset, which is then used for prompt tuning. However, we observed that the model overfits to the text modality because label names, serving as supervision signals, appear explicitly in the texts. To address this issue, we further introduce a Multi-Target Prediction (MTP) task that motivates the model to focus on complex contexts and distinguish between target and biased information. Extensive experiments on the Waterbirds and CelebA datasets show that our method significantly improves group robustness, achieving state-of-the-art results among image-free methods and even competitive performance compared to image-supervised methods. Furthermore, the proposed method can be adapted to challenging scenarios with multiple or unknown bias attributes, demonstrating its strong generalization and robustness.



### ESVO2: Direct Visual-Inertial Odometry with Stereo Event Cameras

- **Summary**: Event-based visual odometry is a specific branch of visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, which aims at solving tracking and mapping sub-problems in parallel by exploiting the special working principles of neuromorphic (ie, event-based) cameras. Due to the motion-dependent nature of event data, explicit data association ie, feature matching under large-baseline view-point changes is hardly established, making direct methods a more rational choice. However, state-of-the-art direct methods are limited by the high computational complexity of the mapping sub-problem and the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in certain degrees of freedom (DoF) in rotation. In this paper, we resolve these issues by building an event-based stereo visual-inertial odometry system on top of our previous direct pipeline Event-based Stereo Visual Odometry. Specifically, to speed up the mapping operation, we propose an efficient strategy for sampling contour points according to the local dynamics of events. The mapping performance is also improved in terms of structure completeness and local smoothness by merging the temporal stereo and static stereo results. To circumvent the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in recovering the pitch and yaw components of general six-DoF motion, we introduce IMU measurements as motion priors via pre-integration. To this end, a compact back-end is proposed for continuously updating the IMU bias and predicting the linear velocity, enabling an accurate motion prediction for camera pose tracking. The resulting system scales well with modern high-resolution event cameras and leads to better global positioning accuracy in large-scale outdoor environments. Extensive evaluations on five publicly available datasets featuring different resolutions and scenarios justify the superior performance of the proposed system against five state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Video Paragraph Captioning (VPC) aims to generate paragraph captions that summarises key events within a video. Despite recent advancements, challenges persist, notably in effectively utilising multimodal signals inherent in videos and addressing the long-tail distribution of words. The paper introduces a novel multimodal integrated caption generation framework for VPC that leverages information from various modalities and external knowledge bases. Our framework constructs two graphs: a 'video-specific' temporal graph capturing major events and interactions between multimodal information and commonsense knowledge, and a 'theme graph' representing correlations between words of a specific theme. These graphs serve as input for a transformer network with a shared encoder-decoder architecture. We also introduce a node selection module to enhance decoding efficiency by selecting the most relevant nodes from the graphs. Our results demonstrate superior performance across benchmark datasets.



### Multi-granularity Contrastive Cross-modal Collaborative Generation for End-to-End Long-term Video Question Answering

- **Summary**: Long-term Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is a challenging vision-and-language bridging task focusing on semantic understanding of untrimmed long-term videos and diverse free-form questions, simultaneously emphasizing comprehensive cross-modal reasoning to yield precise answers. The canonical approaches often rely on off-the-shelf feature extractors to detour the expensive computation overhead, but often result in domain-independent modality-unrelated representations. Furthermore, the inherent gradient blocking between unimodal comprehension and cross-modal interaction hinders reliable answer generation. In contrast, recent emerging successful video-language pre-training models enable cost-effective end-to-end modeling but fall short in domain-specific ratiocination and exhibit disparities in task formulation. Toward this end, we present an entirely end-to-end solution for long-term VideoQA: Multi-granularity Contrastive cross-modal collaborative Generation (MCG) model. To derive discriminative representations possessing high visual concepts, we introduce Joint Unimodal Modeling (JUM) on a clip-bone architecture and leverage Multi-granularity Contrastive Learning (MCL) to harness the intrinsically or explicitly exhibited semantic correspondences. To alleviate the task formulation discrepancy problem, we propose a Cross-modal Collaborative Generation (CCG) module to reformulate VideoQA as a generative task instead of the conventional classification scheme, empowering the model with the capability for cross-modal high-semantic fusion and generation so as to rationalize and answer. Extensive experiments conducted on six publicly available VideoQA datasets underscore the superiority of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) represents a crucial intersection between video understanding and language processing, requiring both discriminative unimodal comprehension and sophisticated cross-modal interaction for accurate inference. Despite advancements in multi-modal pre-trained models and video-language foundation models, these systems often struggle with domain-specific VideoQA due to their generalized pre-training objectives. Addressing this gap necessitates bridging the divide between broad cross-modal knowledge and the specific inference demands of VideoQA tasks. To this end, we introduce HeurVidQA, a framework that leverages domain-specific entity-action heuristics to refine pre-trained video-language foundation models. Our approach treats these models as implicit knowledge engines, employing domain-specific entity-action prompters to direct the model's focus toward precise cues that enhance reasoning. By delivering fine-grained heuristics, we improve the model's ability to identify and interpret key entities and actions, thereby enhancing its reasoning capabilities. Extensive evaluations across multiple VideoQA datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing models, underscoring the importance of integrating domain-specific knowledge into video-language models for more accurate and context-aware VideoQA.



### CLIP-SCGI: Synthesized Caption-Guided Inversion for Person Re-Identification

- **Summary**: Person re-identification (ReID) has recently benefited from large pretrained vision-language models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP). However, the absence of concrete descriptions necessitates the use of implicit text embeddings, which demand complicated and inefficient training strategies. To address this issue, we first propose one straightforward solution by leveraging existing image captioning models to generate pseudo captions for person images, and thereby boost person re-identification with large vision language models. Using models like the Large Language and Vision Assistant (LLAVA), we generate high-quality captions based on fixed templates that capture key semantic attributes such as gender, clothing, and age. By augmenting ReID training sets from uni-modality (image) to bi-modality (image and text), we introduce CLIP-SCGI, a simple yet effective framework that leverages synthesized captions to guide the learning of discriminative and robust representations. Built on CLIP, CLIP-SCGI fuses image and text embeddings through two modules to enhance the training process. To address quality issues in generated captions, we introduce a caption-guided inversion module that captures semantic attributes from images by converting relevant visual information into pseudo-word tokens based on the descriptions. This approach helps the model better capture key information and focus on relevant regions. The extracted features are then utilized in a cross-modal fusion module, guiding the model to focus on regions semantically consistent with the caption, thereby facilitating the optimization of the visual encoder to extract discriminative and robust representations. Extensive experiments on four popular ReID benchmarks demonstrate that CLIP-SCGI outperforms the state-of-the-art by a significant margin.

- **Summary**: Existing gesture generation methods primarily focus on upper body gestures based on audio features, neglecting speech content, emotion, and locomotion. These limitations result in stiff, mechanical gestures that fail to convey the true meaning of audio content. We introduce ExpGest, a novel framework leveraging synchronized text and audio information to generate expressive full-body gestures. Unlike AdaIN or one-hot encoding methods, we design a noise emotion classifier for optimizing adversarial direction noise, avoiding melody distortion and guiding results towards specified emotions. Moreover, aligning semantic and gestures in the latent space provides better generalization capabilities. ExpGest, a diffusion model-based gesture generation framework, is the first attempt to offer mixed generation modes, including audio-driven gestures and text-shaped motion. Experiments show that our framework effectively learns from combined text-driven motion and audio-induced gesture datasets, and preliminary results demonstrate that ExpGest achieves more expressive, natural, and controllable global motion in speakers compared to state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the generalizability of models. However, existing mainstream TTA methods, predominantly operating at batch level, often exhibit suboptimal performance in complex real-world scenarios, particularly when confronting outliers or mixed distributions. This phenomenon stems from a pronounced over-reliance on statistical patterns over the distinct characteristics of individual instances, resulting in a divergence between the distribution captured by the model and data characteristics. To address this challenge, we propose Meet-In-The-Middle based Test-Time Adaptation ($\textbf{MITA}$), which introduces energy-based optimization to encourage mutual adaptation of the model and data from opposing directions, thereby meeting in the middle. MITA pioneers a significant departure from traditional approaches that focus solely on aligning the model to the data, facilitating a more effective bridging of the gap between model's distribution and data characteristics. Comprehensive experiments with MITA across three distinct scenarios (Outlier, Mixture, and Pure) demonstrate its superior performance over SOTA methods, highlighting its potential to significantly enhance generalizability in practical applications.

- **Summary**: Recently, large-scale diffusion models have made impressive progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation. To further equip these T2I models with fine-grained spatial control, approaches like ControlNet introduce an extra network that learns to follow a condition image. However, for every single condition type, ControlNet requires independent training on millions of data pairs with hundreds of GPU hours, which is quite expensive and makes it challenging for ordinary users to explore and develop new types of conditions. To address this problem, we propose the CtrLoRA framework, which trains a Base ControlNet to learn the common knowledge of image-to-image generation from multiple base conditions, along with condition-specific LoRAs to capture distinct characteristics of each condition. Utilizing our pretrained Base ControlNet, users can easily adapt it to new conditions, requiring as few as 1,000 data pairs and less than one hour of single-GPU training to obtain satisfactory results in most scenarios. Moreover, our CtrLoRA reduces the learnable parameters by 90% compared to ControlNet, significantly lowering the threshold to distribute and deploy the model weights. Extensive experiments on various types of conditions demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method. Codes and model weights will be released at https://github.com/xyfJASON/ctrlora.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of scientific progress requires innovative tools that can accelerate discovery. While recent AI methods, particularly large language models (LLMs), have shown promise in tasks such as hypothesis generation and experimental design, they fall short in replicating the collaborative nature of real-world scientific practices, where diverse teams of experts work together to tackle complex problems. To address the limitation, we propose an LLM-based multi-agent system, i.e., Virtual Scientists (VirSci), designed to mimic the teamwork inherent in scientific research. VirSci organizes a team of agents to collaboratively generate, evaluate, and refine research ideas. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that this multi-agent approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method in producing novel and impactful scientific ideas, showing potential in aligning with key insights in the Science of Science field. Our findings suggest that integrating collaborative agents can lead to more innovative scientific outputs, offering a robust system for autonomous scientific discovery.

- **Summary**: Road crack segmentation is critical for robotic systems tasked with the inspection, maintenance, and monitoring of road infrastructures. Existing deep learning-based methods for crack segmentation are typically trained on specific datasets, which can lead to significant performance degradation when applied to unseen real-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce the SAM-Adapter, which incorporates the general knowledge of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into crack segmentation, demonstrating enhanced performance and generalization capabilities. However, the effectiveness of the SAM-Adapter is constrained by noisy labels within small-scale training sets, including omissions and mislabeling of cracks. In this paper, we present an innovative joint learning framework that utilizes distribution-aware domain-specific semantic knowledge to guide the discriminative learning process of the SAM-Adapter. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that effectively minimizes the adverse effects of noisy labels on the supervised learning of the SAM-Adapter. Our experimental results on two public pavement crack segmentation datasets confirm that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, evaluations on the completely unseen CFD dataset demonstrate the high cross-domain generalization capability of our model, underscoring its potential for practical applications in crack segmentation.

- **Summary**: This study evaluates the capability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in image data annotation by comparing their performance on the CelebA dataset in terms of quality and cost-effectiveness against manual annotation. Annotations from the state-of-the-art LLaVA-NeXT model on 1000 CelebA images are in 79.5% agreement with the original human annotations. Incorporating re-annotations of disagreed cases into a majority vote boosts AI annotation consistency to 89.1% and even higher for more objective labels. Cost assessments demonstrate that AI annotation significantly reduces expenditures compared to traditional manual methods -- representing less than 1% of the costs for manual annotation in the CelebA dataset. These findings support the potential of VLMs as a viable, cost-effective alternative for specific annotation tasks, reducing both financial burden and ethical concerns associated with large-scale manual data annotation. The AI annotations and re-annotations utilized in this study are available on https://github.com/evev2024/EVEV2024_CelebA.

- **Summary**: We present an elastic simulator for domains defined as evolving implicit functions, which is efficient, robust, and differentiable with respect to both shape and material. This simulator is motivated by applications in 3D reconstruction: it is increasingly effective to recover geometry from observed images as implicit functions, but physical applications require accurately simulating and optimizing-for the behavior of such shapes under deformation, which has remained challenging. Our key technical innovation is to train a small neural network to fit quadrature points for robust numerical integration on implicit grid cells. When coupled with a Mixed Finite Element formulation, this yields a smooth, fully differentiable simulation model connecting the evolution of the underlying implicit surface to its elastic response. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on forward simulation of implicits, direct simulation of 3D shapes during editing, and novel physics-based shape and topology optimizations in conjunction with differentiable rendering.

- **Summary**: As large vision-language models (LVLMs) evolve rapidly, the demand for high-quality and diverse data to align these models becomes increasingly crucial. However, the creation of such data with human supervision proves costly and time-intensive. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of AI feedback to scale supervision for aligning LVLMs. We introduce VLFeedback, the first large-scale vision-language feedback dataset, comprising over 82K multi-modal instructions and comprehensive rationales generated by off-the-shelf models without human annotations. To evaluate the effectiveness of AI feedback for vision-language alignment, we train Silkie, an LVLM fine-tuned via direct preference optimization on VLFeedback. Silkie showcases exceptional performance regarding helpfulness, visual faithfulness, and safety metrics. It outperforms its base model by 6.9\% and 9.5\% in perception and cognition tasks, reduces hallucination issues on MMHal-Bench, and exhibits enhanced resilience against red-teaming attacks. Furthermore, our analysis underscores the advantage of AI feedback, particularly in fostering preference diversity to deliver more comprehensive improvements. Our dataset, training code and models are available at https://vlf-silkie.github.io.

- **Summary**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a popular technique for efficient fine-tuning of foundation models. However, applying LoRA in federated learning environments, where data is distributed across multiple clients, presents unique challenges. Existing methods rely on traditional federated averaging of LoRA adapters, resulting in inexact updates. To address this, we propose Federated Exact LoRA, or FedEx-LoRA, which adds a residual error term to the pretrained frozen weight matrix. Our approach achieves exact updates with minimal computational and communication overhead, preserving LoRA's efficiency. We evaluate the method on various Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, showing consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art methods across multiple settings. Through extensive analysis, we quantify that the deviations in updates from the ideal solution are significant, highlighting the need for exact aggregation. Our method's simplicity, efficiency, and broad applicability position it as a promising solution for accurate and effective federated fine-tuning of foundation models.

- **Summary**: Ensuring thermal comfort is essential for the well-being and productivity of individuals in built environments. Of the various thermal comfort indicators, the mean radiant temperature (MRT) is very challenging to measure. Most common measurement methodologies are time-consuming and not user-friendly. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel MRT measurement framework that uses visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and semantic segmentation techniques. The proposed approach follows the rule of thumb of the traditional MRT calculation method using surface temperature and view factors. However, it employs visual SLAM and creates a 3D thermal point cloud with enriched surface temperature information. The framework then implements Grounded SAM, a new object detection and segmentation tool to extract features with distinct temperature profiles on building surfaces. The detailed segmentation of thermal features not only reduces potential errors in the calculation of the MRT but also provides an efficient reconstruction of the spatial MRT distribution in the indoor environment. We also validate the calculation results with the reference measurement methodology. This data-driven framework offers faster and more efficient MRT measurements and spatial mapping than conventional methods. It can enable the direct engagement of researchers and practitioners in MRT measurements and contribute to research on thermal comfort and radiant cooling and heating systems.

- **Summary**: For the diagnosis of diabetes retinopathy (DR) images, this paper proposes a classification method based on artificial intelligence. The core lies in a new data augmentation method, GreenBen, which first extracts the green channel grayscale image from the retinal image and then performs Ben enhancement. Considering that diabetes macular edema (DME) is a complication closely related to DR, this paper constructs a joint classification framework of DR and DME based on multi task learning and attention module, and uses GreenBen to enhance its data to reduce the difference of DR images and improve the accuracy of model classification. We conducted extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets, and our method achieved the best results. For GreenBen, whether based on the ResNet50 network or the Swin Transformer network, whether for individual classification or joint DME classification, compared with other data augmentation methods, GreenBen achieved stable and significant improvements in DR classification results, with an accuracy increase of 10%.

- **Summary**: In the field of industrial inspection, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have a high potential to renew the paradigms in practical applications due to their robust language capabilities and generalization abilities. However, despite their impressive problem-solving skills in many domains, MLLMs' ability in industrial anomaly detection has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we present MMAD, the first-ever full-spectrum MLLMs benchmark in industrial Anomaly Detection. We defined seven key subtasks of MLLMs in industrial inspection and designed a novel pipeline to generate the MMAD dataset with 39,672 questions for 8,366 industrial images. With MMAD, we have conducted a comprehensive, quantitative evaluation of various state-of-the-art MLLMs. The commercial models performed the best, with the average accuracy of GPT-4o models reaching 74.9%. However, this result falls far short of industrial requirements. Our analysis reveals that current MLLMs still have significant room for improvement in answering questions related to industrial anomalies and defects. We further explore two training-free performance enhancement strategies to help models improve in industrial scenarios, highlighting their promising potential for future research.

- **Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in both textual and multimodal domains. However, this success often comes with substantial computational costs, particularly when handling lengthy sequences of multimodal inputs. This has sparked many efforts focusing on enhancing efficiency during training and inference. In this study, we investigate the computation redundancy in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) during inference. We propose different methods to skip computations, such as skipping entire blocks, FFN or self-attention (SA) layers. Additionally, we explore parallelizing certain layers, such as FFN and SA layers. Our findings validate that (1) significant amount of computations can be avoided at inference time, especially for tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). (2) Skipping computations during training can recover 97% of the original performance, even when skipping half of the blocks or removing 70% of the weights. Alternatively, (3) properly training with smaller LLMs can yield comparable performance to LLMs 2 or 3 times larger. To conclude, we extend our investigation to recent MLLMs, such as LLaVA-1.5, showing similar observations. Our work show that there is redundant computations inside MLLMs and thus the potential for significantly improving inference costs without sacrificing performance.

- **Summary**: 3D object generation from a single image involves estimating the full 3D geometry and texture of unseen views from an unposed RGB image captured in the wild. Accurately reconstructing an object's complete 3D structure and texture has numerous applications in real-world scenarios, including robotic manipulation, grasping, 3D scene understanding, and AR/VR. Recent advancements in 3D object generation have introduced techniques that reconstruct an object's 3D shape and texture by optimizing the efficient representation of Gaussian Splatting, guided by pre-trained 2D or 3D diffusion models. However, a notable disparity exists between the training datasets of these models, leading to distinct differences in their outputs. While 2D models generate highly detailed visuals, they lack cross-view consistency in geometry and texture. In contrast, 3D models ensure consistency across different views but often result in overly smooth textures. We propose bridging the gap between 2D and 3D diffusion models to address this limitation by integrating a two-stage frequency-based distillation loss with Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, we leverage geometric priors in the low-frequency spectrum from a 3D diffusion model to maintain consistent geometry and use a 2D diffusion model to refine the fidelity and texture in the high-frequency spectrum of the generated 3D structure, resulting in more detailed and fine-grained outcomes. Our approach enhances geometric consistency and visual quality, outperforming the current SOTA. Additionally, we demonstrate the easy adaptability of our method for efficient object pose estimation and tracking.

- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely used to transfer knowledge from large, accurate models (teachers) to smaller, efficient ones (students). Recent methods have explored enforcing consistency by incorporating causal interpretations to distill invariant representations. In this work, we extend this line of research by introducing a dual augmentation strategy to promote invariant feature learning in both teacher and student models. Our approach leverages different augmentations applied to both models during distillation, pushing the student to capture robust, transferable features. This dual augmentation strategy complements invariant causal distillation by ensuring that the learned representations remain stable across a wider range of data variations and transformations. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, achieving competitive results in same-architecture KD.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of urban underground rail vehicles,subway positioning, which plays a fundamental role in the traffic navigation and collision avoidance systems, has become a research hot-spot these years. Most current subway positioning methods rely on localization beacons densely pre-installed alongside the railway tracks, requiring massive costs for infrastructure and maintenance, while commonly lacking flexibility and anti-interference ability. In this paper, we propose a low-cost and real-time visual-assisted self-localization framework to address the robust and convenient positioning problem for subways. Firstly, we perform aerial view rail sleeper detection based on the fast and efficient YOLOv8n network. The detection results are then used to achieve real-time correction of mileage values combined with geometric positioning information, obtaining precise subway locations. Front camera Videos for subway driving scenes along a 6.9 km route are collected and annotated from the simulator for validation of the proposed method. Experimental results show that our aerial view sleeper detection algorithm can efficiently detect sleeper positions with F1-score of 0.929 at 1111 fps, and that the proposed positioning framework achieves a mean percentage error of 0.1\%, demonstrating its continuous and high-precision self-localization capability.

- **Summary**: Advances in image compression, storage, and display technologies have made high-quality images and videos widely accessible. At this level of quality, distinguishing between compressed and original content becomes difficult, highlighting the need for assessment methodologies that are sensitive to even the smallest visual quality differences. Conventional subjective visual quality assessments often use absolute category rating scales, ranging from ``excellent'' to ``bad''. While suitable for evaluating more pronounced distortions, these scales are inadequate for detecting subtle visual differences. The JPEG standardization project AIC is currently developing a subjective image quality assessment methodology for high-fidelity images. This paper presents the proposed assessment methods, a dataset of high-quality compressed images, and their corresponding crowdsourced visual quality ratings. It also outlines a data analysis approach that reconstructs quality scale values in just noticeable difference (JND) units. The assessment method uses boosting techniques on visual stimuli to help observers detect compression artifacts more clearly. This is followed by a rescaling process that adjusts the boosted quality values back to the original perceptual scale. This reconstruction yields a fine-grained, high-precision quality scale in JND units, providing more informative results for practical applications. The dataset and code to reproduce the results will be available at https://github.com/jpeg-aic/dataset-BTC-PTC-24.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised pre-training has achieved remarkable success in NLP and 2D vision. However, these advances have yet to translate to 3D data. Techniques like masked reconstruction face inherent challenges on unstructured point clouds, while many contrastive learning tasks lack in complexity and informative value. In this paper, we present Pic@Point, an effective contrastive learning method based on structural 2D-3D correspondences. We leverage image cues rich in semantic and contextual knowledge to provide a guiding signal for point cloud representations at various abstraction levels. Our lightweight approach outperforms state-of-the-art pre-training methods on several 3D benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Photo restoration technology enables preserving visual memories in photographs. However, physical prints are vulnerable to various forms of deterioration, ranging from physical damage to loss of image quality, etc. While restoration by human experts can improve the quality of outcomes, it often comes at a high price in terms of cost and time for restoration. In this work, we present the AI-based photo restoration framework composed of multiple stages, where each stage is tailored to enhance and restore specific types of photo damage, accelerating and automating the photo restoration process. By integrating these techniques into a unified architecture, our framework aims to offer a one-stop solution for restoring old and deteriorated photographs. Furthermore, we present a novel old photo restoration dataset because we lack a publicly available dataset for our evaluation.

- **Summary**: Visual correspondence is a crucial step in key computer vision tasks, including camera localization, image registration, and structure from motion. The most effective techniques for matching keypoints currently involve using learned sparse or dense matchers, which need pairs of images. These neural networks have a good general understanding of features from both images, but they often struggle to match points from different semantic areas. This paper presents a new method that uses semantic cues from foundation vision model features (like DINOv2) to enhance local feature matching by incorporating semantic reasoning into existing descriptors. Therefore, the learned descriptors do not require image pairs at inference time, allowing feature caching and fast matching using similarity search, unlike learned matchers. We present adapted versions of six existing descriptors, with an average increase in performance of 29% in camera localization, with comparable accuracy to existing matchers as LightGlue and LoFTR in two existing benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Change Detection (CD) enables the identification of alterations between images of the same area captured at different times. However, existing CD methods still struggle to address pseudo changes resulting from domain information differences in multi-temporal images and instances of detail errors caused by the loss and contamination of detail features during the upsampling process in the network. To address this, we propose a bi-temporal Gaussian distribution feature-dependent network (BGFD). Specifically, we first introduce the Gaussian noise domain disturbance (GNDD) module, which approximates distribution using image statistical features to characterize domain information, samples noise to perturb the network for learning redundant domain information, addressing domain information differences from a more fundamental perspective. Additionally, within the feature dependency facilitation (FDF) module, we integrate a novel mutual information difference loss ($L_{MI}$) and more sophisticated attention mechanisms to enhance the capabilities of the network, ensuring the acquisition of essential domain information. Subsequently, we have designed a novel detail feature compensation (DFC) module, which compensates for detail feature loss and contamination introduced during the upsampling process from the perspectives of enhancing local features and refining global features. The BGFD has effectively reduced pseudo changes and enhanced the detection capability of detail information. It has also achieved state-of-the-art performance on four publicly available datasets - DSIFN-CD, SYSU-CD, LEVIR-CD, and S2Looking, surpassing baseline models by +8.58%, +1.28%, +0.31%, and +3.76% respectively, in terms of the F1-Score metric.

- **Summary**: Maritime vessel maneuvers, characterized by their inherent complexity and indeterminacy, requires vessel trajectory prediction system capable of modeling the multi-modality nature of future motion states. Conventional stochastic trajectory prediction methods utilize latent variables to represent the multi-modality of vessel motion, however, tends to overlook the complexity and dynamics inherent in maritime behavior. In contrast, we explicitly simulate the transition of vessel motion from uncertainty towards a state of certainty, effectively handling future indeterminacy in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we present a novel framework (\textit{DiffuTraj}) to conceptualize the trajectory prediction task as a guided reverse process of motion pattern uncertainty diffusion, in which we progressively remove uncertainty from maritime regions to delineate the intended trajectory. Specifically, we encode the previous states of the target vessel, vessel-vessel interactions, and the environment context as guiding factors for trajectory generation. Subsequently, we devise a transformer-based conditional denoiser to capture spatio-temporal dependencies, enabling the generation of trajectories better aligned for particular maritime environment. Comprehensive experiments on vessel trajectory prediction benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method.

- **Summary**: In the domain of computer vision, optical flow stands as a cornerstone for unraveling dynamic visual scenes. However, the challenge of accurately estimating optical flow under conditions of large nonlinear motion patterns remains an open question. The image flow constraint is vulnerable to substantial displacements, and rapid spatial transformations. Inaccurate approximations inherent in numerical differentiation techniques can further amplify such intricacies. In response, this research proposes an innovative algorithm for optical flow computation, utilizing the higher precision of second-order Taylor series approximation within the differential estimation framework. By embracing this mathematical underpinning, the research seeks to extract more information about the behavior of the function under complex real-world scenarios and estimate the motion of areas with a lack of texture. An impressive showcase of the algorithm's capabilities emerges through its performance on renowned optical flow benchmarks such as KITTI (2015) and Middlebury. The average endpoint error (AEE), which computes the Euclidian distance between the calculated flow field and the ground truth flow field, stands notably diminished, validating the effectiveness of the algorithm in handling complex motion patterns.

- **Summary**: Image style transfer has attracted widespread attention in the past few years. Despite its remarkable results, it requires additional style images available as references, making it less flexible and inconvenient. Using text is the most natural way to describe the style. More importantly, text can describe implicit abstract styles, like styles of specific artists or art movements. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive Learning for Artistic Style Transfer (CLAST) that leverages advanced image-text encoders to control arbitrary style transfer. We introduce a supervised contrastive training strategy to effectively extract style descriptions from the image-text model (i.e., CLIP), which aligns stylization with the text description. To this end, we also propose a novel and efficient adaLN based state space models that explore style-content fusion. Finally, we achieve a text-driven image style transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in artistic style transfer. More importantly, it does not require online fine-tuning and can render a 512x512 image in 0.03s.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces reconstructive visual instruction tuning (ROSS), a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that exploit vision-centric supervision signals. In contrast to conventional visual instruction tuning approaches that exclusively supervise text outputs, ROSS prompts LMMs to supervise visual outputs via reconstructing input images. By doing so, it capitalizes on the inherent richness and detail present within input images themselves, which are often lost in pure text supervision. However, producing meaningful feedback from natural images is challenging due to the heavy spatial redundancy of visual signals. To address this issue, ROSS employs a denoising objective to reconstruct latent representations of input images, avoiding directly regressing exact raw RGB values. This intrinsic activation design inherently encourages LMMs to maintain image detail, thereby enhancing their fine-grained comprehension capabilities and reducing hallucinations. Empirically, ROSS consistently brings significant improvements across different visual encoders and language models. In comparison with extrinsic assistance state-of-the-art alternatives that aggregate multiple visual experts, ROSS delivers competitive performance with a single SigLIP visual encoder, demonstrating the efficacy of our vision-centric supervision tailored for visual outputs.

- **Summary**: 3D biometric techniques on finger traits have become a new trend and have demonstrated a powerful ability for recognition and anti-counterfeiting. Existing methods follow an explicit 3D pipeline that reconstructs the models first and then extracts features from 3D models. However, these explicit 3D methods suffer from the following problems: 1) Inevitable information dropping during 3D reconstruction; 2) Tight coupling between specific hardware and algorithm for 3D reconstruction. It leads us to a question: Is it indispensable to reconstruct 3D information explicitly in recognition tasks? Hence, we consider this problem in an implicit manner, leaving the nerve-wracking 3D reconstruction problem for learnable neural networks with the help of neural radiance fields (NeRFs). We propose FingerNeRF, a novel generalizable NeRF for 3D finger biometrics. To handle the shape-radiance ambiguity problem that may result in incorrect 3D geometry, we aim to involve extra geometric priors based on the correspondence of binary finger traits like fingerprints or finger veins. First, we propose a novel Trait Guided Transformer (TGT) module to enhance the feature correspondence with the guidance of finger traits. Second, we involve extra geometric constraints on the volume rendering loss with the proposed Depth Distillation Loss and Trait Guided Rendering Loss. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method on different modalities, we collect two new datasets: SCUT-Finger-3D with finger images and SCUT-FingerVein-3D with finger vein images. Moreover, we also utilize the UNSW-3D dataset with fingerprint images for evaluation. In experiments, our FingerNeRF can achieve 4.37% EER on SCUT-Finger-3D dataset, 8.12% EER on SCUT-FingerVein-3D dataset, and 2.90% EER on UNSW-3D dataset, showing the superiority of the proposed implicit method in 3D finger biometrics.

- **Summary**: Achieving a balance between accuracy and efficiency is a critical challenge in facial landmark detection (FLD). This paper introduces the Parallel Optimal Position Search (POPoS), a high-precision encoding-decoding framework designed to address the fundamental limitations of traditional FLD methods. POPoS employs three key innovations: (1) Pseudo-range multilateration is utilized to correct heatmap errors, enhancing the precision of landmark localization. By integrating multiple anchor points, this approach minimizes the impact of individual heatmap inaccuracies, leading to robust overall positioning. (2) To improve the pseudo-range accuracy of selected anchor points, a new loss function, named multilateration anchor loss, is proposed. This loss function effectively enhances the accuracy of the distance map, mitigates the risk of local optima, and ensures optimal solutions. (3) A single-step parallel computation algorithm is introduced, significantly enhancing computational efficiency and reducing processing time. Comprehensive evaluations across five benchmark datasets demonstrate that POPoS consistently outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in low-resolution scenarios with minimal computational overhead. These features establish POPoS as a highly efficient and accurate tool for FLD, with broad applicability in real-world scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/teslatasy/PoPoS

- **Summary**: Despite recent advancements in 3D generation methods, achieving controllability still remains a challenging issue. Current approaches utilizing score-distillation sampling are hindered by laborious procedures that consume a significant amount of time. Furthermore, the process of first generating 2D representations and then mapping them to 3D lacks internal alignment between the two forms of representation. To address these challenges, we introduce ControLRM, an end-to-end feed-forward model designed for rapid and controllable 3D generation using a large reconstruction model (LRM). ControLRM comprises a 2D condition generator, a condition encoding transformer, and a triplane decoder transformer. Instead of training our model from scratch, we advocate for a joint training framework. In the condition training branch, we lock the triplane decoder and reuses the deep and robust encoding layers pretrained with millions of 3D data in LRM. In the image training branch, we unlock the triplane decoder to establish an implicit alignment between the 2D and 3D representations. To ensure unbiased evaluation, we curate evaluation samples from three distinct datasets (G-OBJ, GSO, ABO) rather than relying on cherry-picking manual generation. The comprehensive experiments conducted on quantitative and qualitative comparisons of 3D controllability and generation quality demonstrate the strong generalization capacity of our proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Deformable image registration remains a fundamental task in clinical practice, yet solving registration problems involving complex deformations remains challenging. Current deep learning-based registration methods employ continuous deformation to model large deformations, which often suffer from accumulated registration errors and interpolation inaccuracies. Moreover, achieving satisfactory results with these frameworks typically requires a large number of cascade stages, demanding substantial computational resources. Therefore, we propose a novel approach, the field refinement framework (FiRework), tailored for unsupervised deformable registration, aiming to address these challenges. In FiRework, we redesign the continuous deformation framework to mitigate the aforementioned errors. Notably, our FiRework requires only one level of recursion during training and supports continuous inference, offering improved efficacy compared to continuous deformation frameworks. We conducted experiments on two brain MRI datasets, enhancing two existing deformable registration networks with FiRework. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework in deformable registration. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ZAX130/FiRework.

- **Summary**: Ensuring obstacle avoidance on the rail surface is crucial for the safety of autonomous driving trains and its first step is to segment the regions of the rail. We chose to build upon Yolact for our work. To address the issue of rough edge in the rail masks predicted by the model, we incorporated the edge information extracted by edge operator into the original Yolact's loss function to emphasize the model's focus on rail edges. Additionally, we applied box filter to smooth the jagged ground truth mask edges cause by linear interpolation. Since the integration of edge information and smooth process only occurred during the training process, the inference speed of the model remained unaffected. The experiments results on our custom rail dataset demonstrated an improvement in the prediction accuracy. Moreover, the results on Cityscapes showed a 4.1 and 4.6 improvement in $AP$ and $AP_{50}$ , respectively, compared to Yolact.

- **Summary**: Understanding the neural basis of behavior is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. Current research in large-scale neuro-behavioral data analysis often relies on decoding models, which quantify behavioral information in neural data but lack details on behavior encoding. This raises an intriguing scientific question: ``how can we enable in-depth exploration of neural representations in behavioral tasks, revealing interpretable neural dynamics associated with behaviors''. However, addressing this issue is challenging due to the varied behavioral encoding across different brain regions and mixed selectivity at the population level. To tackle this limitation, our approach, named ``BeNeDiff'', first identifies a fine-grained and disentangled neural subspace using a behavior-informed latent variable model. It then employs state-of-the-art generative diffusion models to synthesize behavior videos that interpret the neural dynamics of each latent factor. We validate the method on multi-session datasets containing widefield calcium imaging recordings across the dorsal cortex. Through guiding the diffusion model to activate individual latent factors, we verify that the neural dynamics of latent factors in the disentangled neural subspace provide interpretable quantifications of the behaviors of interest. At the same time, the neural subspace in BeNeDiff demonstrates high disentanglement and neural reconstruction quality.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have achieved unprecedented performance in image generation, yet they suffer from slow inference due to their iterative sampling process. To address this, early-exiting has recently been proposed, where the depth of the denoising network is made adaptive based on the (estimated) difficulty of each sampling step. Here, we discover an interesting "phase transition" in the sampling process of current adaptive diffusion models: the denoising network consistently exits early during the initial sampling steps, until it suddenly switches to utilizing the full network. Based on this, we propose accelerating generation by employing a shallower denoising network in the initial sampling steps and a deeper network in the later steps. We demonstrate empirically that our dual-backbone approach, DuoDiff, outperforms existing early-exit diffusion methods in both inference speed and generation quality. Importantly, DuoDiff is easy to implement and complementary to existing approaches for accelerating diffusion.

- **Summary**: Unique identification of multiple sclerosis (MS) white matter lesions (WMLs) is important to help characterize MS progression. WMLs are routinely identified from magnetic resonance images (MRIs) but the resultant total lesion load does not correlate well with EDSS; whereas mean unique lesion volume has been shown to correlate with EDSS. Our approach builds on prior work by incorporating Hessian matrix computation from lesion probability maps before using the random walker algorithm to estimate the volume of each unique lesion. Synthetic images demonstrate our ability to accurately count the number of lesions present. The takeaways, are: 1) that our method correctly identifies all lesions including many that are missed by previous methods; 2) we can better separate confluent lesions; and 3) we can accurately capture the total volume of WMLs in a given probability map. This work will allow new more meaningful statistics to be computed from WMLs in brain MRIs

- **Summary**: Neuromorphic computing has emerged as a promising energy-efficient alternative to traditional artificial intelligence, predominantly utilizing spiking neural networks (SNNs) implemented on neuromorphic hardware. Significant advancements have been made in SNN-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures. However, their applications in the medical imaging domain remain underexplored. In this study, we introduce EG-SpikeFormer, an SNN architecture designed for clinical tasks that integrates eye-gaze data to guide the model's focus on diagnostically relevant regions in medical images. This approach effectively addresses shortcut learning issues commonly observed in conventional models, especially in scenarios with limited clinical data and high demands for model reliability, generalizability, and transparency. Our EG-SpikeFormer not only demonstrates superior energy efficiency and performance in medical image classification tasks but also enhances clinical relevance. By incorporating eye-gaze data, the model improves interpretability and generalization, opening new directions for the application of neuromorphic computing in healthcare.
