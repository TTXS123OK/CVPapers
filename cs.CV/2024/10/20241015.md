- **Summary**: Time-of-flight (TOF) information provides more accurate location data for annihilation photons, thereby enhancing the quality of PET reconstruction images and reducing noise. List-mode reconstruction has a significant advantage in handling TOF information. However, current advanced TOF PET list-mode reconstruction algorithms still require improvements when dealing with low-count data. Deep learning algorithms have shown promising results in PET image reconstruction. Nevertheless, the incorporation of TOF information poses significant challenges related to the storage space required by deep learning methods, particularly for the advanced deep unrolled methods. In this study, we propose a deep unrolled primal dual network for TOF-PET list-mode reconstruction. The network is unrolled into multiple phases, with each phase comprising a dual network for list-mode domain updates and a primal network for image domain updates. We utilize CUDA for parallel acceleration and computation of the system matrix for TOF list-mode data, and we adopt a dynamic access strategy to mitigate memory consumption. Reconstructed images of different TOF resolutions and different count levels show that the proposed method outperforms the LM-OSEM, LM-EMTV, LM-SPDHG,LM-SPDHG-TV and FastPET method in both visually and quantitative analysis. These results demonstrate the potential application of deep unrolled methods for TOF-PET list-mode data and show better performance than current mainstream TOF-PET list-mode reconstruction algorithms, providing new insights for the application of deep learning methods in TOF list-mode data.

- **Summary**: Multimodal remote sensing data, collected from a variety of sensors, provide a comprehensive and integrated perspective of the Earth's surface. By employing multimodal fusion techniques, semantic segmentation offers more detailed insights into geographic scenes compared to single-modality approaches. Building upon recent advancements in vision foundation models, particularly the Segment Anything Model (SAM), this study introduces a novel Multimodal Adapter-based Network (MANet) for multimodal remote sensing semantic segmentation. At the core of this approach is the development of a Multimodal Adapter (MMAdapter), which fine-tunes SAM's image encoder to effectively leverage the model's general knowledge for multimodal data. In addition, a pyramid-based Deep Fusion Module (DFM) is incorporated to further integrate high-level geographic features across multiple scales before decoding. This work not only introduces a novel network for multimodal fusion, but also demonstrates, for the first time, SAM's powerful generalization capabilities with Digital Surface Model (DSM) data. Experimental results on two well-established fine-resolution multimodal remote sensing datasets, ISPRS Vaihingen and ISPRS Potsdam, confirm that the proposed MANet significantly surpasses current models in the task of multimodal semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: Most previous deepfake detection methods bent their efforts to discriminate artifacts by end-to-end training. However, the learned networks often fail to mine the general face forgery information efficiently due to ignoring the data hardness. In this work, we propose to introduce the sample hardness into the training of deepfake detectors via the curriculum learning paradigm. Specifically, we present a novel simple yet effective strategy, named Dynamic Facial Forensic Curriculum (DFFC), which makes the model gradually focus on hard samples during the training. Firstly, we propose Dynamic Forensic Hardness (DFH) which integrates the facial quality score and instantaneous instance loss to dynamically measure sample hardness during the training. Furthermore, we present a pacing function to control the data subsets from easy to hard throughout the training process based on DFH. Comprehensive experiments show that DFFC can improve both within- and cross-dataset performance of various kinds of end-to-end deepfake detectors through a plug-and-play approach. It indicates that DFFC can help deepfake detectors learn general forgery discriminative features by effectively exploiting the information from hard samples.

- **Summary**: Ensuring that AI-based facial recognition systems produce fair predictions and work equally well across all demographic groups is crucial. Earlier systems often exhibited demographic bias, particularly in gender and racial classification, with lower accuracy for women and individuals with darker skin tones. To tackle this issue and promote fairness in facial recognition, researchers have introduced several bias-mitigation techniques for gender classification and related algorithms. However, many challenges remain, such as data diversity, balancing fairness with accuracy, disparity, and bias measurement. This paper presents a method using a dual attention mechanism with a pre-trained Inception-ResNet V1 model, enhanced by KL-divergence regularization and a cross-entropy loss function. This approach reduces bias while improving accuracy and computational efficiency through transfer learning. The experimental results show significant improvements in both fairness and classification accuracy, providing promising advances in addressing bias and enhancing the reliability of facial recognition systems.

- **Summary**: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for measuring fat and iron content non-invasively in the body via measures known as Proton Density Fat Fraction (PDFF) and $R_2^*$, respectively. However, conventional PDFF and $R_2^*$ quantification methods operate on MR images voxel-wise and require at least three measurements to estimate three quantities: water, fat, and $R_2^*$. Alternatively, the two-point Dixon MRI protocol is widely used and fast because it acquires only two measurements; however, these cannot be used to estimate three quantities voxel-wise. Leveraging the fact that neighboring voxels have similar values, we propose using a generative machine learning approach to learn PDFF and $R_2^*$ from Dixon MRI. We use paired Dixon-IDEAL data from UK Biobank in the liver and a Pix2Pix conditional GAN to demonstrate the first large-scale $R_2^*$ imputation from two-point Dixon MRIs. Using our proposed approach, we synthesize PDFF and $R_2^*$ maps that show significantly greater correlation with ground-truth than conventional voxel-wise baselines.

- **Summary**: A proper scene representation is central to the pursuit of spatial intelligence where agents can robustly reconstruct and efficiently understand 3D scenes. A scene representation is either metric, such as landmark maps in 3D reconstruction, 3D bounding boxes in object detection, or voxel grids in occupancy prediction, or topological, such as pose graphs with loop closures in SLAM or visibility graphs in SfM. In this work, we propose to build Multiview Scene Graphs (MSG) from unposed images, representing a scene topologically with interconnected place and object nodes. The task of building MSG is challenging for existing representation learning methods since it needs to jointly address both visual place recognition, object detection, and object association from images with limited fields of view and potentially large viewpoint changes. To evaluate any method tackling this task, we developed an MSG dataset and annotation based on a public 3D dataset. We also propose an evaluation metric based on the intersection-over-union score of MSG edges. Moreover, we develop a novel baseline method built on mainstream pretrained vision models, combining visual place recognition and object association into one Transformer decoder architecture. Experiments demonstrate our method has superior performance compared to existing relevant baselines.

- **Summary**: GPT-4o, an all-encompassing model, represents a milestone in the development of large multi-modal language models. It can understand visual, auditory, and textual modalities, directly output audio, and support flexible duplex interaction. Models from the open-source community often achieve some functionalities of GPT-4o, such as visual understanding and voice chat. Nevertheless, training a unified model that incorporates all modalities is challenging due to the complexities of multi-modal data, intricate model architectures, and training processes. In this paper, we introduce Mini-Omni2, a visual-audio assistant capable of providing real-time, end-to-end voice responses to visoin and audio queries. By integrating pretrained visual and auditory encoders, Mini-Omni2 maintains performance in individual modalities. We propose a three-stage training process to align modalities, allowing the language model to handle multi-modal inputs and outputs after training on a limited dataset. For interaction, we introduce a command-based interruption mechanism, enabling more flexible interaction with users. To the best of our knowledge, Mini-Omni2 is one of the closest reproductions of GPT-4o, which have similar form of functionality, and we hope it can offer valuable insights for subsequent research.

- **Summary**: Prompt learning has proven effective in adapting vision language models for downstream tasks. However, existing methods usually append learnable prompt tokens solely with the category names to obtain textual features, which fails to fully leverage the rich context indicated in the category name. To address this issue, we propose the Tree of Attributes Prompt learning (TAP), which first instructs LLMs to generate a tree of attributes with a "concept - attribute - description" structure for each category, and then learn the hierarchy with vision and text prompt tokens. Unlike existing methods that merely augment category names with a set of unstructured descriptions, our approach essentially distills structured knowledge graphs associated with class names from LLMs. Furthermore, our approach introduces text and vision prompts designed to explicitly learn the corresponding visual attributes, effectively serving as domain experts. Additionally, the general and diverse descriptions generated based on the class names may be wrong or absent in the specific given images. To address this misalignment, we further introduce a vision-conditional pooling module to extract instance-specific text features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the zero-shot base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, as well as few-shot classification across 11 diverse datasets.



### Adversarially Guided Stateful Defense Against Backdoor Attacks in Federated Deep Learning

- **Summary**: Recent works have shown that Federated Learning (FL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing defenses cluster submitted updates from clients and select the best cluster for aggregation. However, they often rely on unrealistic assumptions regarding client submissions and sampled clients population while choosing the best cluster. We show that in realistic FL settings, state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses struggle to perform well against backdoor attacks in FL. To address this, we highlight that backdoored submissions are adversarially biased and overconfident compared to clean submissions. We, therefore, propose an Adversarially Guided Stateful Defense (AGSD) against backdoor attacks on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in FL scenarios. AGSD employs adversarial perturbations to a small held-out dataset to compute a novel metric, called the trust index, that guides the cluster selection without relying on any unrealistic assumptions regarding client submissions. Moreover, AGSD maintains a trust state history of each client that adaptively penalizes backdoored clients and rewards clean clients. In realistic FL settings, where SOTA defenses mostly fail to resist attacks, AGSD mostly outperforms all SOTA defenses with minimal drop in clean accuracy (5% in the worst-case compared to best accuracy) even when (a) given a very small held-out dataset -- typically AGSD assumes 50 samples (<= 0.1% of the training data) and (b) no heldout dataset is available, and out-of-distribution data is used instead. For reproducibility, our code will be openly available at: https://github.com/hassanalikhatim/AGSD.

- **Summary**: Recent text-to-image personalization methods have shown great promise in teaching a diffusion model user-specified concepts given a few images for reusing the acquired concepts in a novel context. With massive efforts being dedicated to personalized generation, a promising extension is personalized editing, namely to edit an image using personalized concepts, which can provide a more precise guidance signal than traditional textual guidance. To address this, a straightforward solution is to incorporate a personalized diffusion model with a text-driven editing framework. However, such a solution often shows unsatisfactory editability on the source image. To address this, we propose DreamSteerer, a plug-in method for augmenting existing T2I personalization methods. Specifically, we enhance the source image conditioned editability of a personalized diffusion model via a novel Editability Driven Score Distillation (EDSD) objective. Moreover, we identify a mode trapping issue with EDSD, and propose a mode shifting regularization with spatial feature guided sampling to avoid such an issue. We further employ two key modifications to the Delta Denoising Score framework that enable high-fidelity local editing with personalized concepts. Extensive experiments validate that DreamSteerer can significantly improve the editability of several T2I personalization baselines while being computationally efficient.

- **Summary**: Combining LiDAR and Camera-view data has become a common approach for 3D Object Detection. However, previous approaches combine the two input streams at a point-level, throwing away semantic information derived from camera features. In this paper we propose Cross-View Center Point-Fusion, a state-of-the-art model to perform 3D object detection by combining camera and LiDAR-derived features in the BEV space to preserve semantic density from the camera stream while incorporating spacial data from the LiDAR stream. Our architecture utilizes aspects from previously established algorithms, Cross-View Transformers and CenterPoint, and runs their backbones in parallel, allowing efficient computation for real-time processing and application. In this paper we find that while an implicitly calculated depth-estimate may be sufficiently accurate in a 2D map-view representation, explicitly calculated geometric and spacial information is needed for precise bounding box prediction in the 3D world-view space.

- **Summary**: Large-scale datasets have been pivotal to the advancements of deep learning models in recent years, but training on such large datasets invariably incurs substantial storage and computational overhead. Meanwhile, real-world datasets often contain redundant and noisy data, imposing a negative impact on training efficiency and model performance. Data selection has shown promise in identifying the most representative samples from the entire dataset, which aims to minimize the performance gap with reduced training costs. Existing works typically rely on single-modality information to assign importance scores for individual samples, which may lead to inaccurate assessments, especially when dealing with noisy or corrupted samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CLIP-powered data selection framework that leverages multimodal information for more robust and generalizable sample selection. Specifically, our framework consists of three key modules-dataset adaptation, sample scoring, and selection optimization-that together harness extensive pre-trained multimodal knowledge to comprehensively assess sample influence and optimize the selection results through multi-objective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines on various benchmark datasets. Notably, our method effectively removes noisy or damaged samples from the dataset, enabling it to achieve even higher performance with less data. This indicates that it is not only a way to accelerate training but can also improve overall data quality.



### TEOcc: Radar-camera Multi-modal Occupancy Prediction via Temporal Enhancement

- **Summary**: As a novel 3D scene representation, semantic occupancy has gained much attention in autonomous driving. However, existing occupancy prediction methods mainly focus on designing better occupancy representations, such as tri-perspective view or neural radiance fields, while ignoring the advantages of using long-temporal information. In this paper, we propose a radar-camera multi-modal temporal enhanced occupancy prediction network, dubbed TEOcc. Our method is inspired by the success of utilizing temporal information in 3D object detection. Specifically, we introduce a temporal enhancement branch to learn temporal occupancy prediction. In this branch, we randomly discard the t-k input frame of the multi-view camera and predict its 3D occupancy by long-term and short-term temporal decoders separately with the information from other adjacent frames and multi-modal inputs. Besides, to reduce computational costs and incorporate multi-modal inputs, we specially designed 3D convolutional layers for long-term and short-term temporal decoders. Furthermore, since the lightweight occupancy prediction head is a dense classification head, we propose to use a shared occupancy prediction head for the temporal enhancement and main branches. It is worth noting that the temporal enhancement branch is only performed during training and is discarded during inference. Experiment results demonstrate that TEOcc achieves state-of-the-art occupancy prediction on nuScenes benchmarks. In addition, the proposed temporal enhancement branch is a plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated into existing occupancy prediction methods to improve the performance of occupancy prediction. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/VDIGPKU/TEOcc.

- **Summary**: Edge computing has emerged as an alternative to reduce transmission and processing delay and preserve privacy of the video streams. However, the ever-increasing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used in video-based applications (e.g. object detection) exerts pressure on memory-constrained edge devices. Model merging is proposed to reduce the DNNs' memory footprint by keeping only one copy of merged layers' weights in memory. In existing model merging techniques, (i) only architecturally identical layers can be shared; (ii) requires computationally expensive retraining in the cloud; (iii) assumes the availability of ground truth for retraining. The re-evaluation of a merged model's performance, however, requires a validation dataset with ground truth, typically runs at the cloud. Common metrics to guide the selection of shared layers include the size or computational cost of shared layers or representation size. We propose a new model merging scheme by sharing representations (i.e., outputs of layers) at the edge, guided by representation similarity S. We show that S is extremely highly correlated with merged model's accuracy with Pearson Correlation Coefficient |r| > 0.94 than other metrics, demonstrating that representation similarity can serve as a strong validation accuracy indicator without ground truth. We present our preliminary results of the newly proposed model merging scheme with identified challenges, demonstrating a promising research future direction.



### Ctrl-U: Robust Conditional Image Generation via Uncertainty-aware Reward Modeling

- **Summary**: In this paper, we focus on the task of conditional image generation, where an image is synthesized according to user instructions. The critical challenge underpinning this task is ensuring both the fidelity of the generated images and their semantic alignment with the provided conditions. To tackle this issue, previous studies have employed supervised perceptual losses derived from pre-trained models, i.e., reward models, to enforce alignment between the condition and the generated result. However, we observe one inherent shortcoming: considering the diversity of synthesized images, the reward model usually provides inaccurate feedback when encountering newly generated data, which can undermine the training process. To address this limitation, we propose an uncertainty-aware reward modeling, called Ctrl-U, including uncertainty estimation and uncertainty-aware regularization, designed to reduce the adverse effects of imprecise feedback from the reward model. Given the inherent cognitive uncertainty within reward models, even images generated under identical conditions often result in a relatively large discrepancy in reward loss. Inspired by the observation, we explicitly leverage such prediction variance as an uncertainty indicator. Based on the uncertainty estimation, we regularize the model training by adaptively rectifying the reward. In particular, rewards with lower uncertainty receive higher loss weights, while those with higher uncertainty are given reduced weights to allow for larger variability. The proposed uncertainty regularization facilitates reward fine-tuning through consistency construction. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our methodology in improving the controllability and generation quality, as well as its scalability across diverse conditional scenarios. Code will soon be available at https://grenoble-zhang.github.io/Ctrl-U-Page/.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional ability in modeling complex image distributions, making them versatile plug-and-play priors for solving imaging inverse problems. However, their reliance on large-scale clean datasets for training limits their applicability in scenarios where acquiring clean data is costly or impractical. Recent approaches have attempted to learn diffusion models directly from corrupted measurements, but these methods either lack theoretical convergence guarantees or are restricted to specific types of data corruption. In this paper, we propose a principled expectation-maximization (EM) framework that iteratively learns diffusion models from noisy data with arbitrary corruption types. Our framework employs a plug-and-play Monte Carlo method to accurately estimate clean images from noisy measurements, followed by training the diffusion model using the reconstructed images. This process alternates between estimation and training until convergence. We evaluate the performance of our method across various imaging tasks, including inpainting, denoising, and deblurring. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables the learning of high-fidelity diffusion priors from noisy data, significantly enhancing reconstruction quality in imaging inverse problems.

- **Summary**: Visual hallucination (VH) occurs when a multimodal large language model (MLLM) generates responses with incorrect visual details for prompts. Existing methods for generating VH test cases primarily rely on human annotations, typically in the form of triples: (image, question, answer). In this paper, we introduce VHExpansion, the first automated method for expanding VH test cases for MLLMs. Given an initial VH test case, VHExpansion automatically expands it by perturbing the question and answer through negation as well as modifying the image using both common and adversarial perturbations. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation metric, symmetric accuracy, which measures the proportion of correctly answered VH test-case pairs. Each pair consists of a test case and its negated counterpart. Our theoretical analysis shows that symmetric accuracy is an unbiased evaluation metric that remains unaffected by the imbalance of VH testing cases with varying answers when an MLLM is randomly guessing the answers, whereas traditional accuracy is prone to such imbalance. We apply VHExpansion to expand three VH datasets annotated manually and use these expanded datasets to benchmark seven MLLMs. Our evaluation shows that VHExpansion effectively identifies more VH test cases. Moreover, symmetric accuracy, being unbiased, leads to different conclusions about the vulnerability of MLLMs to VH compared to traditional accuracy metric. Finally, we show that fine-tuning MLLMs on the expanded VH dataset generated by VHExpansion mitigates VH more effectively than fine-tuning on the original, manually annotated dataset.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have shown promise in person re-identification (ReID) applications. However, their performance in generalizable person re-identification tasks remains suboptimal. The large-scale and diverse image-text pairs used in CLIP's pre-training may lead to a lack or insufficiency of certain fine-grained features. In light of these challenges, we propose a hard sample mining method called DFGS (Depth-First Graph Sampler), based on depth-first search, designed to offer sufficiently challenging samples to enhance CLIP's ability to extract fine-grained features. DFGS can be applied to both the image encoder and the text encoder in CLIP. By leveraging the powerful cross-modal learning capabilities of CLIP, we aim to apply our DFGS method to extract challenging samples and form mini-batches with high discriminative difficulty, providing the image model with more efficient and challenging samples that are difficult to distinguish, thereby enhancing the model's ability to differentiate between individuals. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over other methods, confirming the effectiveness of DFGS in providing challenging samples that enhance CLIP's performance in generalizable person re-identification.

- **Summary**: Collaborative Perception (CP) is a process in which an ego agent receives and fuses sensor information from surrounding vehicles and infrastructure to enhance its perception capability. To evaluate the need for infrastructure equipped with sensors, extensive and quantitative analysis of the role of infrastructure data in CP is crucial, yet remains underexplored. To address this gap, we first quantitatively assess the importance of infrastructure data in existing vehicle-centric CP, where the ego agent is a vehicle. Furthermore, we compare vehicle-centric CP with infra-centric CP, where the ego agent is now the infrastructure, to evaluate the effectiveness of each approach. Our results demonstrate that incorporating infrastructure data improves 3D detection accuracy by up to 10.87%, and infra-centric CP shows enhanced noise robustness and increases accuracy by up to 42.53% compared with vehicle-centric CP.

- **Summary**: We introduce DynaCLR, a self-supervised framework for modeling cell dynamics via contrastive learning of representations of time-lapse datasets. Live cell imaging of cells and organelles is widely used to analyze cellular responses to perturbations. Human annotation of dynamic cell states captured by time-lapse perturbation datasets is laborious and prone to bias. DynaCLR integrates single-cell tracking with time-aware contrastive learning to map images of cells at neighboring time points to neighboring embeddings. Mapping the morphological dynamics of cells to a temporally regularized embedding space makes the annotation, classification, clustering, or interpretation of the cell states more quantitative and efficient. We illustrate the features and applications of DynaCLR with the following experiments: analyzing the kinetics of viral infection in human cells, detecting transient changes in cell morphology due to cell division, and mapping the dynamics of organelles due to viral infection. Models trained with DynaCLR consistently achieve $>95\%$ accuracy for infection state classification, enable the detection of transient cell states and reliably embed unseen experiments. DynaCLR provides a flexible framework for comparative analysis of cell state dynamics due to perturbations, such as infection, gene knockouts, and drugs. We provide PyTorch-based implementations of the model training and inference pipeline (https://github.com/mehta-lab/viscy) and a user interface (https://github.com/czbiohub-sf/napari-iohub) for the visualization and annotation of trajectories of cells in the real space and the embedding space.

- **Summary**: Scene reconstruction and novel-view synthesis for large, complex, multi-story, indoor scenes is a challenging and time-consuming task. Prior methods have utilized drones for data capture and radiance fields for scene reconstruction, both of which present certain challenges. First, in order to capture diverse viewpoints with the drone's front-facing camera, some approaches fly the drone in an unstable zig-zag fashion, which hinders drone-piloting and generates motion blur in the captured data. Secondly, most radiance field methods do not easily scale to arbitrarily large number of images. This paper proposes an efficient and scalable pipeline for indoor novel-view synthesis from drone-captured 360 videos using 3D Gaussian Splatting. 360 cameras capture a wide set of viewpoints, allowing for comprehensive scene capture under a simple straightforward drone trajectory. To scale our method to large scenes, we devise a divide-and-conquer strategy to automatically split the scene into smaller blocks that can be reconstructed individually and in parallel. We also propose a coarse-to-fine alignment strategy to seamlessly match these blocks together to compose the entire scene. Our experiments demonstrate marked improvement in both reconstruction quality, i.e. PSNR and SSIM, and computation time compared to prior approaches.

- **Summary**: Exploring new knowledge is a fundamental human ability that can be mirrored in the development of deep neural networks, especially in the field of object detection. Open world object detection (OWOD) is an emerging area of research that adapts this principle to explore new knowledge. It focuses on recognizing and learning from objects absent from initial training sets, thereby incrementally expanding its knowledge base when new class labels are introduced. This survey paper offers a thorough review of the OWOD domain, covering essential aspects, including problem definitions, benchmark datasets, source codes, evaluation metrics, and a comparative study of existing methods. Additionally, we investigate related areas like open set recognition (OSR) and incremental learning (IL), underlining their relevance to OWOD. Finally, the paper concludes by addressing the limitations and challenges faced by current OWOD algorithms and proposes directions for future research. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey of the emerging OWOD field with over one hundred references, marking a significant step forward for object detection technology.

- **Summary**: In the study of LLMs, sycophancy represents a prevalent hallucination that poses significant challenges to these models. Specifically, LLMs often fail to adhere to original correct responses, instead blindly agreeing with users' opinions, even when those opinions are incorrect or malicious. However, research on sycophancy in visual language models (VLMs) has been scarce. In this work, we extend the exploration of sycophancy from LLMs to VLMs, introducing the MM-SY benchmark to evaluate this phenomenon. We present evaluation results from multiple representative models, addressing the gap in sycophancy research for VLMs. To mitigate sycophancy, we propose a synthetic dataset for training and employ methods based on prompts, supervised fine-tuning, and DPO. Our experiments demonstrate that these methods effectively alleviate sycophancy in VLMs. Additionally, we probe VLMs to assess the semantic impact of sycophancy and analyze the attention distribution of visual tokens. Our findings indicate that the ability to prevent sycophancy is predominantly observed in higher layers of the model. The lack of attention to image knowledge in these higher layers may contribute to sycophancy, and enhancing image attention at high layers proves beneficial in mitigating this issue.

- **Summary**: Artificial intelligence aids in brain tumor detection via MRI scans, enhancing the accuracy and reducing the workload of medical professionals. However, in scenarios with extremely limited medical images, traditional deep learning approaches tend to fail due to the absence of anomalous images. Anomaly detection also suffers from ineffective feature extraction due to vague training process. Our work introduces a novel two-stage anomaly detection algorithm called CONSULT (CONtrastive Self-sUpervised Learning for few-shot Tumor detection). The first stage of CONSULT fine-tunes a pre-trained feature extractor specifically for MRI brain images, using a synthetic data generation pipeline to create tumor-like data. This process overcomes the lack of anomaly samples and enables the integration of attention mechanisms to focus on anomalous image segments. The first stage is to overcome the shortcomings of current anomaly detection in extracting features in high-variation data by incorporating Context-Aware Contrastive Learning and Self-supervised Feature Adversarial Learning. The second stage of CONSULT uses PatchCore for conventional feature extraction via the fine-tuned weights from the first stage. To summarize, we propose a self-supervised training scheme for anomaly detection, enhancing model performance and data reliability. Furthermore, our proposed contrastive loss, Tritanh Loss, stabilizes learning by offering a unique solution all while enhancing gradient flow. Finally, CONSULT achieves superior performance in few-shot brain tumor detection, demonstrating significant improvements over PatchCore by 9.4%, 12.9%, 10.2%, and 6.0% for 2, 4, 6, and 8 shots, respectively, while training exclusively on healthy images.

- **Summary**: Effective long-term strategies enable AI systems to navigate complex environments by making sequential decisions over extended horizons. Similarly, reinforcement learning (RL) agents optimize decisions across sequences to maximize rewards, even without immediate feedback. To verify that Latent Diffusion-Constrained Q-learning (LDCQ), a prominent diffusion-based offline RL method, demonstrates strong reasoning abilities in multi-step decision-making, we aimed to evaluate its performance on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). However, applying offline RL methodologies to enhance strategic reasoning in AI for solving tasks in ARC is challenging due to the lack of sufficient experience data in the ARC training set. To address this limitation, we introduce an augmented offline RL dataset for ARC, called Synthesized Offline Learning Data for Abstraction and Reasoning (SOLAR), along with the SOLAR-Generator, which generates diverse trajectory data based on predefined rules. SOLAR enables the application of offline RL methods by offering sufficient experience data. We synthesized SOLAR for a simple task and used it to train an agent with the LDCQ method. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the offline RL approach on a simple ARC task, showing the agent's ability to make multi-step sequential decisions and correctly identify answer states. These results highlight the potential of the offline RL approach to enhance AI's strategic reasoning capabilities.

- **Summary**: Multimodal object detection leverages diverse modal information to enhance the accuracy and robustness of detectors. By learning long-term dependencies, Transformer can effectively integrate multimodal features in the feature extraction stage, which greatly improves the performance of multimodal object detection. However, current methods merely stack Transformer-guided fusion techniques without exploring their capability to extract features at various depth layers of network, thus limiting the improvements in detection performance. In this paper, we introduce an accurate and efficient object detection method named SeaDATE. Initially, we propose a novel dual attention Feature Fusion (DTF) module that, under Transformer's guidance, integrates local and global information through a dual attention mechanism, strengthening the fusion of modal features from orthogonal perspectives using spatial and channel tokens. Meanwhile, our theoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrate that the Transformer-guided fusion method, treating images as sequences of pixels for fusion, performs better on shallow features' detail information compared to deep semantic information. To address this, we designed a contrastive learning (CL) module aimed at learning features of multimodal samples, remedying the shortcomings of Transformer-guided fusion in extracting deep semantic features, and effectively utilizing cross-modal information. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the FLIR, LLVIP, and M3FD datasets have proven our method to be effective, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance.

- **Summary**: Perceiving potential ``action possibilities'' (\ie, affordance) regions of images and learning interactive functionalities of objects from human demonstration is a challenging task due to the diversity of human-object interactions. Prevailing affordance learning algorithms often adopt the label assignment paradigm and presume that there is a unique relationship between functional region and affordance label, yielding poor performance when adapting to unseen environments with large appearance variations. In this paper, we propose to leverage interactive affinity for affordance learning, \ie extracting interactive affinity from human-object interaction and transferring it to non-interactive objects. Interactive affinity, which represents the contacts between different parts of the human body and local regions of the target object, can provide inherent cues of interconnectivity between humans and objects, thereby reducing the ambiguity of the perceived action possibilities. To this end, we propose a visual-geometric collaborative guided affordance learning network that incorporates visual and geometric cues to excavate interactive affinity from human-object interactions jointly. Besides, a contact-driven affordance learning (CAL) dataset is constructed by collecting and labeling over 55,047 images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the representative models regarding objective metrics and visual quality.

- **Summary**: Foundation models in computer vision have demonstrated exceptional performance in zero-shot and few-shot tasks by extracting multi-purpose features from large-scale datasets through self-supervised pre-training methods. However, these models often overlook the severe corruption in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images by high-level noises. We introduce DRACO, a Denoising-Reconstruction Autoencoder for CryO-EM, inspired by the Noise2Noise (N2N) approach. By processing cryo-EM movies into odd and even images and treating them as independent noisy observations, we apply a denoising-reconstruction hybrid training scheme. We mask both images to create denoising and reconstruction tasks. For DRACO's pre-training, the quality of the dataset is essential, we hence build a high-quality, diverse dataset from an uncurated public database, including over 270,000 movies or micrographs. After pre-training, DRACO naturally serves as a generalizable cryo-EM image denoiser and a foundation model for various cryo-EM downstream tasks. DRACO demonstrates the best performance in denoising, micrograph curation, and particle picking tasks compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will release the code, pre-trained models, and the curated dataset to stimulate further research.

- **Summary**: The development of vision-language and generative models has significantly advanced text-guided image editing, which seeks \textit{preservation} of core elements in the source image while implementing \textit{modifications} based on the target text. However, in the absence of evaluation metrics specifically tailored for text-guided image editing, existing metrics are limited in balancing the consideration of preservation and modification. Especially, our analysis reveals that CLIPScore, the most commonly used metric, tends to favor modification and ignore core attributes to be preserved, resulting in inaccurate evaluations. To address this problem, we propose \texttt{AugCLIP}, \black{which balances preservation and modification by estimating the representation of an ideal edited image that aligns with the target text with minimum alteration on the source image. We augment detailed textual descriptions on the source image and the target text using a multi-modal large language model, to model a hyperplane that separates CLIP space into source or target. The representation of the ideal edited image is an orthogonal projection of the source image into the hyperplane, which encapsulates the relative importance of each attribute considering the interdependent relationships.} Our extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, encompassing a diverse range of editing scenarios, demonstrate that \texttt{AugCLIP} aligns remarkably well with human evaluation standards compared to existing metrics. The code for evaluation will be open-sourced to contribute to the community.

- **Summary**: Radiance fields represented by 3D Gaussians excel at synthesizing novel views, offering both high training efficiency and fast rendering. However, with sparse input views, the lack of multi-view consistency constraints results in poorly initialized point clouds and unreliable heuristics for optimization and densification, leading to suboptimal performance. Existing methods often incorporate depth priors from dense estimation networks but overlook the inherent multi-view consistency in input images. Additionally, they rely on multi-view stereo (MVS)-based initialization, which limits the efficiency of scene representation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a view synthesis framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, named MCGS, enabling photorealistic scene reconstruction from sparse input views. The key innovations of MCGS in enhancing multi-view consistency are as follows: i) We introduce an initialization method by leveraging a sparse matcher combined with a random filling strategy, yielding a compact yet sufficient set of initial points. This approach enhances the initial geometry prior, promoting efficient scene representation. ii) We develop a multi-view consistency-guided progressive pruning strategy to refine the Gaussian field by strengthening consistency and eliminating low-contribution Gaussians. These modular, plug-and-play strategies enhance robustness to sparse input views, accelerate rendering, and reduce memory consumption, making MCGS a practical and efficient framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting.

- **Summary**: Despite continuous advancements in deep learning for understanding human motion, existing models often struggle to accurately identify action timing and specific body parts, typically supporting only single-round interaction. Such limitations in capturing fine-grained motion details reduce their effectiveness in motion understanding tasks. In this paper, we propose MoChat, a multimodal large language model capable of spatio-temporal grounding of human motion and understanding multi-turn dialogue context. To achieve these capabilities, we group the spatial information of each skeleton frame based on human anatomical structure and then apply them with Joints-Grouped Skeleton Encoder, whose outputs are combined with LLM embeddings to create spatio-aware and temporal-aware embeddings separately. Additionally, we develop a pipeline for extracting timestamps from skeleton sequences based on textual annotations, and construct multi-turn dialogues for spatially grounding. Finally, various task instructions are generated for jointly training. Experimental results demonstrate that MoChat achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics in motion understanding tasks, making it as the first model capable of fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding of human motion.

- **Summary**: Video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs) possess significant potential for video understanding tasks. However, most Video-LLMs treat videos as a sequential set of individual frames, which results in insufficient temporal-spatial interaction that hinders fine-grained comprehension and difficulty in processing longer videos due to limited visual token capacity. To address these challenges, we propose VidCompress, a novel Video-LLM featuring memory-enhanced temporal compression. VidCompress employs a dual-compressor approach: a memory-enhanced compressor captures both short-term and long-term temporal relationships in videos and compresses the visual tokens using a multiscale transformer with a memory-cache mechanism, while a text-perceived compressor generates condensed visual tokens by utilizing Q-Former and integrating temporal contexts into query embeddings with cross attention. Experiments on several VideoQA datasets and comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate that VidCompress efficiently models complex temporal-spatial relations and significantly outperforms existing Video-LLMs.

- **Summary**: We present a spatial and angular Gaussian based representation and a triple splatting process, for real-time, high-quality novel lighting-and-view synthesis from multi-view point-lit input images. To describe complex appearance, we employ a Lambertian plus a mixture of angular Gaussians as an effective reflectance function for each spatial Gaussian. To generate self-shadow, we splat all spatial Gaussians towards the light source to obtain shadow values, which are further refined by a small multi-layer perceptron. To compensate for other effects like global illumination, another network is trained to compute and add a per-spatial-Gaussian RGB tuple. The effectiveness of our representation is demonstrated on 30 samples with a wide variation in geometry (from solid to fluffy) and appearance (from translucent to anisotropic), as well as using different forms of input data, including rendered images of synthetic/reconstructed objects, photographs captured with a handheld camera and a flash, or from a professional lightstage. We achieve a training time of 40-70 minutes and a rendering speed of 90 fps on a single commodity GPU. Our results compare favorably with state-of-the-art techniques in terms of quality/performance. Our code and data are publicly available at https://GSrelight.github.io/.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) have become essential in computer vision for local and global feature extraction. However, aggregating these architectures in existing methods often results in inefficiencies. To address this, the CNN-Transformer Aggregation Network (CTA-Net) was developed. CTA-Net combines CNNs and ViTs, with transformers capturing long-range dependencies and CNNs extracting localized features. This integration enables efficient processing of detailed local and broader contextual information. CTA-Net introduces the Light Weight Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Multi-Head Self-Attention (LMF-MHSA) module for effective multi-scale feature integration with reduced parameters. Additionally, the Reverse Reconstruction CNN-Variants (RRCV) module enhances the embedding of CNNs within the transformer architecture. Extensive experiments on small-scale datasets with fewer than 100,000 samples show that CTA-Net achieves superior performance (TOP-1 Acc 86.76\%), fewer parameters (20.32M), and greater efficiency (FLOPs 2.83B), making it a highly efficient and lightweight solution for visual tasks on small-scale datasets (fewer than 100,000).

- **Summary**: Recent progress in image generation has sparked research into controlling these models through condition signals, with various methods addressing specific challenges in conditional generation. Instead of proposing another specialized technique, we introduce a simple, unified framework to handle diverse conditional generation tasks involving a specific image-condition correlation. By learning a joint distribution over a correlated image pair (e.g. image and depth) with a diffusion model, our approach enables versatile capabilities via different inference-time sampling schemes, including controllable image generation (e.g. depth to image), estimation (e.g. image to depth), signal guidance, joint generation (image & depth), and coarse control. Previous attempts at unification often introduce significant complexity through multi-stage training, architectural modification, or increased parameter counts. In contrast, our simple formulation requires a single, computationally efficient training stage, maintains the standard model input, and adds minimal learned parameters (15% of the base model). Moreover, our model supports additional capabilities like non-spatially aligned and coarse conditioning. Extensive results show that our single model can produce comparable results with specialized methods and better results than prior unified methods. We also demonstrate that multiple models can be effectively combined for multi-signal conditional generation.

- **Summary**: Visual-textual correlations in the attention maps derived from text-to-image diffusion models are proven beneficial to dense visual prediction tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation. However, a significant challenge arises due to the input distributional discrepancy between the context-rich sentences used for image generation and the isolated class names typically employed in semantic segmentation, hindering the diffusion models from capturing accurate visual-textual correlations. To solve this, we propose InvSeg, a test-time prompt inversion method that tackles open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by inverting image-specific visual context into text prompt embedding space, leveraging structure information derived from the diffusion model's reconstruction process to enrich text prompts so as to associate each class with a structure-consistent mask. Specifically, we introduce Contrastive Soft Clustering (CSC) to align derived masks with the image's structure information, softly selecting anchors for each class and calculating weighted distances to push inner-class pixels closer while separating inter-class pixels, thereby ensuring mask distinction and internal consistency. By incorporating sample-specific context, InvSeg learns context-rich text prompts in embedding space and achieves accurate semantic alignment across modalities. Experiments show that InvSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC and Context datasets. Project page: https://jylin8100.github.io/InvSegProject/.

- **Summary**: Image monitoring and guidance during medical examinations can aid both diagnosis and treatment. However, the sampling frequency is often too low, which creates a need to estimate the missing images. We present a probabilistic motion model for sequential medical images, with the ability to both estimate motion between acquired images and forecast the motion ahead of time. The core is a low-dimensional temporal process based on a linear Gaussian state-space model with analytically tractable solutions for forecasting, simulation, and imputation of missing samples. The results, from two experiments on publicly available cardiac datasets, show reliable motion estimates and an improved forecasting performance using patient-specific adaptation by online learning.

- **Summary**: Autonomous navigation of a mobile robot is a challenging task which requires ability of mapping, localization, path planning and path following. Conventional mapping methods build a dense metric map like an occupancy grid, which is affected by odometry error accumulation and consumes a lot of memory and computations in large environments. Another approach to mapping is the usage of topological properties, e.g. adjacency of locations in the environment. Topological maps are less prone to odometry error accumulation and high resources consumption, and also enable fast path planning because of the graph sparsity. Based on this idea, we proposed NavTopo - a full navigation pipeline based on topological map and two-level path planning. The pipeline localizes in the graph by matching neural network descriptors and 2D projections of the input point clouds, which significantly reduces memory consumption compared to metric and topological point cloud-based approaches. We test our approach in a large indoor photo-relaistic simulated environment and compare it to a metric map-based approach based on popular metric mapping method RTAB-MAP. The experimental results show that our topological approach significantly outperforms the metric one in terms of performance, keeping proper navigational efficiency.

- **Summary**: Visual localization involves estimating a query image's 6-DoF (degrees of freedom) camera pose, which is a fundamental component in various computer vision and robotic tasks. This paper presents LoGS, a vision-based localization pipeline utilizing the 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) technique as scene representation. This novel representation allows high-quality novel view synthesis. During the mapping phase, structure-from-motion (SfM) is applied first, followed by the generation of a GS map. During localization, the initial position is obtained through image retrieval, local feature matching coupled with a PnP solver, and then a high-precision pose is achieved through the analysis-by-synthesis manner on the GS map. Experimental results on four large-scale datasets demonstrate the proposed approach's SoTA accuracy in estimating camera poses and robustness under challenging few-shot conditions.

- **Summary**: Omnidirectional video (ODV) can provide an immersive experience and is widely utilized in the field of virtual reality and augmented reality. However, the restricted capturing devices and transmission bandwidth lead to the low resolution of ODVs. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods are proposed to enhance the resolution of videos, but ODV projection distortions in the application are not well addressed directly applying such methods. To achieve better super-resolution reconstruction quality, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) oriented to ODV characteristics. Specifically, a spatio-temporal distortion modulation module is introduced to improve spatial ODV projection distortions and exploit the temporal correlation according to intra and inter alignments. Next, we design a multi-frame reconstruction and fusion mechanism to refine the consistency of reconstructed ODV frames. Furthermore, we incorporate latitude-saliency adaptive maps in the loss function to concentrate on important viewpoint regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. In addition, we collect a new ODV-SR dataset with various scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed STDAN achieves superior super-resolution performance on ODVs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) techniques address the high labeling costs in 3D medical image segmentation, with the teacher-student model being a common approach. However, using an exponential moving average (EMA) in single-teacher models may cause coupling issues, where the weights of the student and teacher models become similar, limiting the teacher's ability to provide additional knowledge for the student. Dual-teacher models were introduced to address this problem but often neglected the importance of maintaining teacher model diversity, leading to coupling issues among teachers. To address the coupling issue, we incorporate a double-copy-paste (DCP) technique to enhance the diversity among the teachers. Additionally, we introduce the Staged Selective Ensemble (SSE) module, which selects different ensemble methods based on the characteristics of the samples and enables more accurate segmentation of label boundaries, thereby improving the quality of pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in 3D medical image segmentation tasks. Here is the code link: https://github.com/Fazhan-cs/DCP.

- **Summary**: Sodium MRI is an imaging technique used to visualize and quantify sodium concentrations in vivo, playing a role in many biological processes and potentially aiding in breast cancer characterization. Sodium MRI, however, suffers from inherently low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and spatial resolution, compared with conventional proton MRI. A deep-learning method, the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), has demonstrated success across a wide range of denoising tasks, yet struggles with sodium MRI's unique noise profile, as DDPM primarily targets Gaussian noise. DDPM can distort features when applied to sodium MRI. This paper advances the DDPM by introducing the Rician Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (RDDPM) for sodium MRI denoising. RDDPM converts Rician noise to Gaussian noise at each timestep during the denoising process. The model's performance is evaluated using three non-reference image quality assessment metrics, where RDDPM consistently outperforms DDPM and other CNN-based denoising methods.

- **Summary**: We tackle the problem of highly-accurate, holistic performance capture for the face, body and hands simultaneously. Motion-capture technologies used in film and game production typically focus only on face, body or hand capture independently, involve complex and expensive hardware and a high degree of manual intervention from skilled operators. While machine-learning-based approaches exist to overcome these problems, they usually only support a single camera, often operate on a single part of the body, do not produce precise world-space results, and rarely generalize outside specific contexts. In this work, we introduce the first technique for marker-free, high-quality reconstruction of the complete human body, including eyes and tongue, without requiring any calibration, manual intervention or custom hardware. Our approach produces stable world-space results from arbitrary camera rigs as well as supporting varied capture environments and clothing. We achieve this through a hybrid approach that leverages machine learning models trained exclusively on synthetic data and powerful parametric models of human shape and motion. We evaluate our method on a number of body, face and hand reconstruction benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art results that generalize on diverse datasets.

- **Summary**: We present a method for prediction of a person's hairstyle from a single image. Despite growing use cases in user digitization and enrollment for virtual experiences, available methods are limited, particularly in the range of hairstyles they can capture. Human hair is extremely diverse and lacks any universally accepted description or categorization, making this a challenging task. Most current methods rely on parametric models of hair at a strand level. These approaches, while very promising, are not yet able to represent short, frizzy, coily hair and gathered hairstyles. We instead choose a classification approach which can represent the diversity of hairstyles required for a truly robust and inclusive system. Previous classification approaches have been restricted by poorly labeled data that lacks diversity, imposing constraints on the usefulness of any resulting enrollment system. We use only synthetic data to train our models. This allows for explicit control of diversity of hairstyle attributes, hair colors, facial appearance, poses, environments and other parameters. It also produces noise-free ground-truth labels. We introduce a novel hairstyle taxonomy developed in collaboration with a diverse group of domain experts which we use to balance our training data, supervise our model, and directly measure fairness. We annotate our synthetic training data and a real evaluation dataset using this taxonomy and release both to enable comparison of future hairstyle prediction approaches. We employ an architecture based on a pre-trained feature extraction network in order to improve generalization of our method to real data and predict taxonomy attributes as an auxiliary task to improve accuracy. Results show our method to be significantly more robust for challenging hairstyles than recent parametric approaches.

- **Summary**: Early detection of cardiovascular disease risk factors is essential to alter the course of the disease. Previous studies showed that deep learning can successfully be used to detect such risk factors from retinal images. This study uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict the cardiovascular disease risk factors age, BMI, smoking status, HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, gender and total cholesterol from retinal images from the UK Biobank data set. By applying contrast enhancement on the retinal images in the form of Gaussian filtering and deriving predictions on individual basis through the combination of left and right retinal image predictions, an increased prediction performance could be derived for the variables age (R2 score of 0.81) and systolic blood pressure (R2 score of 0.39) compared to previous studies using retinal images from the UK Biobank data set. Further, this is the first study that tries to predict HbA1c and total cholesterol from UK Biobank retinal fundus images. For these variables the models achieved an R2 score of 0.0579 for predicting HbA1c and an R2 score of 0.0157 for predicting total cholesterol. These results show that the value of deriving predictions for these two risk factors from retinal fundus images from the UK Biobank data set is limited.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) has gained attention for its ability to recognize a broader range of classes. However, OVS models show significant performance drops when applied to unseen domains beyond the previous training dataset. Fine-tuning these models on new datasets can improve performance, but often leads to the catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge. To address this issue, we propose a method that allows OVS models to learn information from new domains while preserving prior knowledge. Our approach begins by evaluating the input sample's proximity to multiple domains, using precomputed multivariate normal distributions for each domain. Based on this prediction, we dynamically interpolate between the weights of the pre-trained decoder and the fine-tuned decoders. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach allows OVS models to adapt to new domains while maintaining performance on the previous training dataset.

- **Summary**: The comprehension of text-rich visual scenes has become a focal point for evaluating Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to their widespread applications. Current benchmarks tailored to the scenario emphasize perceptual capabilities, while overlooking the assessment of cognitive abilities. To address this limitation, we introduce a Multimodal benchmark towards Text-rich visual scenes, to evaluate the Cognitive capabilities of MLLMs through visual reasoning and content-creation tasks (MCTBench). To mitigate potential evaluation bias from the varying distributions of datasets, MCTBench incorporates several perception tasks (e.g., scene text recognition) to ensure a consistent comparison of both the cognitive and perceptual capabilities of MLLMs. To improve the efficiency and fairness of content-creation evaluation, we conduct an automatic evaluation pipeline. Evaluations of various MLLMs on MCTBench reveal that, despite their impressive perceptual capabilities, their cognition abilities require enhancement. We hope MCTBench will offer the community an efficient resource to explore and enhance cognitive capabilities towards text-rich visual scenes.

- **Summary**: The edge-device environment imposes severe resource limitations, encompassing computation costs, hardware resource usage, and energy consumption for deploying deep neural network models. Ultra-low-bit quantization and hardware accelerators have been explored as promising approaches to address these challenges. Ultra-low-bit quantization significantly reduces the model size and the computational cost. Despite progress so far, many competitive ultra-low-bit models still partially rely on float or non-ultra-low-bit quantized computation such as the input and output layer. We introduce Efficiera Residual Networks (ERNs), a model optimized for low-resource edge devices. ERNs achieve full ultra-low-bit quantization, with all weights, including the initial and output layers, being binary, and activations set at 2 bits. We introduce the shared constant scaling factor technique to enable integer-valued computation in residual connections, allowing our model to operate without float values until the final convolution layer. Demonstrating competitiveness, ERNs achieve an ImageNet top-1 accuracy of 72.5pt with a ResNet50-compatible architecture and 63.6pt with a model size less than 1MB. Moreover, ERNs exhibit impressive inference times, reaching 300FPS with the smallest model and 60FPS with the largest model on a cost-efficient FPGA device.

- **Summary**: Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) endeavors to identify the unseen categories using knowledge from the seen domain, necessitating the intrinsic interactions between the visual features and attribute semantic features. However, GZSL suffers from insufficient visual-semantic correspondences due to the attribute diversity and instance diversity. Attribute diversity refers to varying semantic granularity in attribute descriptions, ranging from low-level (specific, directly observable) to high-level (abstract, highly generic) characteristics. This diversity challenges the collection of adequate visual cues for attributes under a uni-granularity. Additionally, diverse visual instances corresponding to the same sharing attributes introduce semantic ambiguity, leading to vague visual patterns. To tackle these problems, we propose a multi-granularity progressive semantic-visual mutual adaption (PSVMA+) network, where sufficient visual elements across granularity levels can be gathered to remedy the granularity inconsistency. PSVMA+ explores semantic-visual interactions at different granularity levels, enabling awareness of multi-granularity in both visual and semantic elements. At each granularity level, the dual semantic-visual transformer module (DSVTM) recasts the sharing attributes into instance-centric attributes and aggregates the semantic-related visual regions, thereby learning unambiguous visual features to accommodate various instances. Given the diverse contributions of different granularities, PSVMA+ employs selective cross-granularity learning to leverage knowledge from reliable granularities and adaptively fuses multi-granularity features for comprehensive representations. Experimental results demonstrate that PSVMA+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Affordance understanding, the task of identifying actionable regions on 3D objects, plays a vital role in allowing robotic systems to engage with and operate within the physical world. Although Visual Language Models (VLMs) have excelled in high-level reasoning and long-horizon planning for robotic manipulation, they still fall short in grasping the nuanced physical properties required for effective human-robot interaction. In this paper, we introduce PAVLM (Point cloud Affordance Vision-Language Model), an innovative framework that utilizes the extensive multimodal knowledge embedded in pre-trained language models to enhance 3D affordance understanding of point cloud. PAVLM integrates a geometric-guided propagation module with hidden embeddings from large language models (LLMs) to enrich visual semantics. On the language side, we prompt Llama-3.1 models to generate refined context-aware text, augmenting the instructional input with deeper semantic cues. Experimental results on the 3D-AffordanceNet benchmark demonstrate that PAVLM outperforms baseline methods for both full and partial point clouds, particularly excelling in its generalization to novel open-world affordance tasks of 3D objects.

- **Summary**: Multimodal learning is expected to boost model performance by integrating information from different modalities. However, its potential is not fully exploited because the widely-used joint training strategy, which has a uniform objective for all modalities, leads to imbalanced and under-optimized uni-modal representations. Specifically, we point out that there often exists modality with more discriminative information, e.g., vision of playing football and sound of blowing wind. They could dominate the joint training process, resulting in other modalities being significantly under-optimized. To alleviate this problem, we first analyze the under-optimized phenomenon from both the feed-forward and the back-propagation stages during optimization. Then, On-the-fly Prediction Modulation (OPM) and On-the-fly Gradient Modulation (OGM) strategies are proposed to modulate the optimization of each modality, by monitoring the discriminative discrepancy between modalities during training. Concretely, OPM weakens the influence of the dominant modality by dropping its feature with dynamical probability in the feed-forward stage, while OGM mitigates its gradient in the back-propagation stage. In experiments, our methods demonstrate considerable improvement across a variety of multimodal tasks. These simple yet effective strategies not only enhance performance in vanilla and task-oriented multimodal models, but also in more complex multimodal tasks, showcasing their effectiveness and flexibility.

- **Summary**: In recent years, imitation learning has made progress in the field of robotic manipulation. However, it still faces challenges when dealing with complex long-horizon deformable object tasks, such as high-dimensional state spaces, complex dynamics, and multimodal action distributions. Traditional imitation learning methods often require a large amount of data and encounter distributional shifts and accumulative errors in these tasks. To address these issues, we propose a data-efficient general learning framework (DeformPAM) based on preference learning and reward-guided action selection. DeformPAM decomposes long-horizon tasks into multiple action primitives, utilizes 3D point cloud inputs and diffusion models to model action distributions, and trains an implicit reward model using human preference data. During the inference phase, the reward model scores multiple candidate actions, selecting the optimal action for execution, thereby reducing the occurrence of anomalous actions and improving task completion quality. Experiments conducted on three challenging real-world long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. Results show that DeformPAM improves both task completion quality and efficiency compared to baseline methods even with limited data.

- **Summary**: Modality gap between RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) images is a crucial issue but often overlooked in existing RGBT tracking methods. It can be observed that modality gap mainly lies in the image style difference. In this work, we propose a novel Coupled Knowledge Distillation framework called CKD, which pursues common styles of different modalities to break modality gap, for high performance RGBT tracking. In particular, we introduce two student networks and employ the style distillation loss to make their style features consistent as much as possible. Through alleviating the style difference of two student networks, we can break modality gap of different modalities well. However, the distillation of style features might harm to the content representations of two modalities in student networks. To handle this issue, we take original RGB and TIR networks as the teachers, and distill their content knowledge into two student networks respectively by the style-content orthogonal feature decoupling scheme. We couple the above two distillation processes in an online optimization framework to form new feature representations of RGB and thermal modalities without modality gap. In addition, we design a masked modeling strategy and a multi-modal candidate token elimination strategy into CKD to improve tracking robustness and efficiency respectively. Extensive experiments on five standard RGBT tracking datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method against state-of-the-art methods while achieving the fastest tracking speed of 96.4 FPS.

- **Summary**: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) has gained significant research attention for its ability to identify anomalous images and pinpoint the specific areas responsible for the anomaly. A key advantage of VAD is its unsupervised nature, which eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming labeled data collection. However, despite its potential for real-world applications, the literature has given limited focus to resource-efficient VAD, particularly for deployment on edge devices. This work addresses this gap by leveraging lightweight neural networks to reduce memory and computation requirements, enabling VAD deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We benchmark the major VAD algorithms within this framework and demonstrate the feasibility of edge-based VAD using the well-known MVTec dataset. Furthermore, we introduce a novel algorithm, Partially Shared Teacher-student (PaSTe), designed to address the high resource demands of the existing Student Teacher Feature Pyramid Matching (STFPM) approach. Our results show that PaSTe decreases the inference time by 25%, while reducing the training time by 33% and peak RAM usage during training by 76%. These improvements make the VAD process significantly more efficient, laying a solid foundation for real-world deployment on edge devices.

- **Summary**: Estimating depth from a single 2D image is a challenging task because of the need for stereo or multi-view data, which normally provides depth information. This paper deals with this challenge by introducing a novel deep learning-based approach using an encoder-decoder architecture, where the Inception-ResNet-v2 model is utilized as the encoder. According to the available literature, this is the first instance of using Inception-ResNet-v2 as an encoder for monocular depth estimation, illustrating better performance than previous models. The use of Inception-ResNet-v2 enables our model to capture complex objects and fine-grained details effectively that are generally difficult to predict. Besides, our model incorporates multi-scale feature extraction to enhance depth prediction accuracy across different kinds of object sizes and distances. We propose a composite loss function consisting of depth loss, gradient edge loss, and SSIM loss, where the weights are fine-tuned to optimize the weighted sum, ensuring better balance across different aspects of depth estimation. Experimental results on the NYU Depth V2 dataset show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an ARE of 0.064, RMSE of 0.228, and accuracy ($\delta$ $<1.25$) of 89.3%. These metrics demonstrate that our model effectively predicts depth, even in challenging circumstances, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications in robotics, 3D reconstruction, and augmented reality.

- **Summary**: Efficiently retrieving and synthesizing information from large-scale multimodal collections has become a critical challenge. However, existing video retrieval datasets suffer from scope limitations, primarily focusing on matching descriptive but vague queries with small collections of professionally edited, English-centric videos. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{MultiVENT 2.0}$, a large-scale, multilingual event-centric video retrieval benchmark featuring a collection of more than 218,000 news videos and 3,906 queries targeting specific world events. These queries specifically target information found in the visual content, audio, embedded text, and text metadata of the videos, requiring systems leverage all these sources to succeed at the task. Preliminary results show that state-of-the-art vision-language models struggle significantly with this task, and while alternative approaches show promise, they are still insufficient to adequately address this problem. These findings underscore the need for more robust multimodal retrieval systems, as effective video retrieval is a crucial step towards multimodal content understanding and generation tasks.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have opened new avenues for applications in Embodied AI. Building on previous work, EgoThink, we introduce VidEgoThink, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating egocentric video understanding capabilities. To bridge the gap between MLLMs and low-level control in Embodied AI, we design four key interrelated tasks: video question-answering, hierarchy planning, visual grounding and reward modeling. To minimize manual annotation costs, we develop an automatic data generation pipeline based on the Ego4D dataset, leveraging the prior knowledge and multimodal capabilities of GPT-4o. Three human annotators then filter the generated data to ensure diversity and quality, resulting in the VidEgoThink benchmark. We conduct extensive experiments with three types of models: API-based MLLMs, open-source image-based MLLMs, and open-source video-based MLLMs. Experimental results indicate that all MLLMs, including GPT-4o, perform poorly across all tasks related to egocentric video understanding. These findings suggest that foundation models still require significant advancements to be effectively applied to first-person scenarios in Embodied AI. In conclusion, VidEgoThink reflects a research trend towards employing MLLMs for egocentric vision, akin to human capabilities, enabling active observation and interaction in the complex real-world environments.

- **Summary**: Despite recent advances in hardware acceleration of ray tracing, real-time ray budgets remain stubbornly limited at a handful of samples per pixel (spp) on commodity hardware, placing the onus on denoising algorithms to achieve high visual quality for path traced global illumination. Neural network-based solutions give excellent result quality at the cost of increased execution time relative to hand-engineered methods, making them less suitable for deployment on resource-constrained systems. We therefore propose incorporating a neural network into a computationally-efficient local linear model-based denoiser, and demonstrate faithful single-frame reconstruction of global illumination for Lambertian scenes at very low sample counts (1spp) and for low computational cost. Other contributions include improving the quality and performance of local linear model-based denoising through a simplified mathematical treatment, and demonstration of the surprising usefulness of ambient occlusion as a guide channel. We also show how our technique is straightforwardly extensible to joint denoising and upsampling of path traced renders with reference to low-cost, rasterized guide channels.

- **Summary**: By enabling capturing of 3D point clouds that reflect the geometry of the immediate environment, LiDAR has emerged as a primary sensor for autonomous systems. If a LiDAR scan is too sparse, occluded by obstacles, or too small in range, enhancing the point cloud scan by while respecting the geometry of the scene is useful for downstream tasks. Motivated by the explosive growth of interest in generative methods in vision, conditional LiDAR generation is starting to take off. This paper proposes a novel simultaneous diffusion sampling methodology to generate point clouds conditioned on the 3D structure of the scene as seen from multiple views. The key idea is to impose multi-view geometric constraints on the generation process, exploiting mutual information for enhanced results. Our method begins by recasting the input scan to multiple new viewpoints around the scan, thus creating multiple synthetic LiDAR scans. Then, the synthetic and input LiDAR scans simultaneously undergo conditional generation according to our methodology. Results show that our method can produce accurate and geometrically consistent enhancements to point cloud scans, allowing it to outperform existing methods by a large margin in a variety of benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models, trained on large-scale image-text pairs, have become widely used across a variety of downstream vision-and-language (V+L) tasks. This widespread adoption raises concerns about their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Non-universal adversarial attacks, while effective, are often impractical for real-time online applications due to their high computational demands per data instance. Recently, universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) have been introduced as a solution, but existing generator-based UAP methods are significantly time-consuming. To overcome the limitation, we propose a direct optimization-based UAP approach, termed DO-UAP, which significantly reduces resource consumption while maintaining high attack performance. Specifically, we explore the necessity of multimodal loss design and introduce a useful data augmentation strategy. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark VLP datasets, six popular VLP models, and three classical downstream tasks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of DO-UAP. Specifically, our approach drastically decreases the time consumption by 23-fold while achieving a better attack performance.

- **Summary**: Score diffusion methods can learn probability densities from samples. The score of the noise-corrupted density is estimated using a deep neural network, which is then used to iteratively transport a Gaussian white noise density to a target density. Variants for conditional densities have been developed, but correct estimation of the corresponding scores is difficult. We avoid these difficulties by introducing an algorithm that guides the diffusion with a projected score. The projection pushes the image feature vector towards the feature vector centroid of the target class. The projected score and the feature vectors are learned by the same network. Specifically, the image feature vector is defined as the spatial averages of the channels activations in select layers of the network. Optimizing the projected score for denoising loss encourages image feature vectors of each class to cluster around their centroids. It also leads to the separations of the centroids. We show that these centroids provide a low-dimensional Euclidean embedding of the class conditional densities. We demonstrate that the algorithm can generate high quality and diverse samples from the conditioning class. Conditional generation can be performed using feature vectors interpolated between those of the training set, demonstrating out-of-distribution generalization.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models are increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices for real-time data analytics. In recent years, Vision Transformer models and their variants have demonstrated outstanding performance across various computer vision tasks. However, their high computational demands and inference latency pose significant challenges for model deployment on resource-constraint edge devices. To address this issue, we propose a novel Vision Transformer splitting framework, ED-ViT, designed to execute complex models across multiple edge devices efficiently. Specifically, we partition Vision Transformer models into several sub-models, where each sub-model is tailored to handle a specific subset of data classes. To further minimize computation overhead and inference latency, we introduce a class-wise pruning technique that reduces the size of each sub-model. We conduct extensive experiments on five datasets with three model structures, demonstrating that our approach significantly reduces inference latency on edge devices and achieves a model size reduction of up to 28.9 times and 34.1 times, respectively, while maintaining test accuracy comparable to the original Vision Transformer. Additionally, we compare ED-ViT with two state-of-the-art methods that deploy CNN and SNN models on edge devices, evaluating accuracy, inference time, and overall model size. Our comprehensive evaluation underscores the effectiveness of the proposed ED-ViT framework.

- **Summary**: Cardiac T1 mapping can evaluate various clinical symptoms of myocardial tissue. However, there is currently a lack of effective, robust, and efficient methods for motion correction in cardiac T1 mapping. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based and topology-preserving image registration framework for motion correction in cardiac T1 mapping. Notably, our proposed implicit consistency constraint dubbed BLOC, to some extent preserves the image topology in registration by bidirectional consistency constraint and local anti-folding constraint. To address the contrast variation issue, we introduce a weighted image similarity metric for multimodal registration of cardiac T1-weighted images. Besides, a semi-supervised myocardium segmentation network and a dual-domain attention module are integrated into the framework to further improve the performance of the registration. Numerous comparative experiments, as well as ablation studies, demonstrated the effectiveness and high robustness of our method. The results also indicate that the proposed weighted image similarity metric, specifically crafted for our network, contributes a lot to the enhancement of the motion correction efficacy, while the bidirectional consistency constraint combined with the local anti-folding constraint ensures a more desirable topology-preserving registration mapping.

- **Summary**: The visual representation of a concept varies significantly depending on its meaning and the context where it occurs; this poses multiple challenges both for vision and multimodal models. Our study focuses on concreteness, a well-researched lexical-semantic variable, using it as a case study to examine the variability in visual representations. We rely on images associated with approximately 1,000 abstract and concrete concepts extracted from two different datasets: Bing and YFCC. Our goals are: (i) evaluate whether visual diversity in the depiction of concepts can reliably distinguish between concrete and abstract concepts; (ii) analyze the variability of visual features across multiple images of the same concept through a nearest neighbor analysis; and (iii) identify challenging factors contributing to this variability by categorizing and annotating images. Our findings indicate that for classifying images of abstract versus concrete concepts, a combination of basic visual features such as color and texture is more effective than features extracted by more complex models like Vision Transformer (ViT). However, ViTs show better performances in the nearest neighbor analysis, emphasizing the need for a careful selection of visual features when analyzing conceptual variables through modalities other than text.

- **Summary**: Accurately understanding complex visual information is crucial for visual language models (VLMs). Enhancing image resolution can improve visual perception capabilities, not only reducing hallucinations but also boosting performance in tasks that demand high resolution, such as text-rich or document analysis. In this paper, we present VisualRWKV-HD and VisualRWKV-UHD, two advancements in the VisualRWKV model family, specifically designed to process high-resolution visual inputs. For VisualRWKV-HD, we developed a lossless downsampling method to effectively integrate a high-resolution vision encoder with low-resolution encoders, without extending the input sequence length. For the VisualRWKV-UHD model, we enhanced image representation by dividing the image into four segments, which are then recombined with the original image. This technique allows the model to incorporate both high-resolution and low-resolution features, effectively balancing coarse and fine-grained information. As a result, the model supports resolutions up to 4096 x 4096 pixels, offering a more detailed and comprehensive visual processing capability. Both VisualRWKV-HD and VisualRWKV-UHD not only achieve strong results on VLM benchmarks but also show marked improvements in performance for text-rich tasks.

- **Summary**: Recently, existing RGB-guided depth super-resolution methods achieve excellent performance based on the assumption of fixed and known degradation (e.g., bicubic downsampling). However, in real-world scenarios, the captured depth often suffers from unconventional and agnostic degradation due to sensor limitations and the complexity of imaging environments (e.g., low reflective surface, illumination). Their performance significantly declines when these real degradation differ from their assumptions. To address these issues, we propose a Degradation Oriented and Regularized Network, DORNet, which pays more attention on learning degradation representation of low-resolution depth that can provide targeted guidance for depth recovery. Specifically, we first design a self-supervised Degradation Learning to model the discriminative degradation representation of low-resolution depth using routing selection-based Degradation Regularization. Then, we present a Degradation Awareness that recursively conducts multiple Degradation-Oriented Feature Transformations, each of which selectively embeds RGB information into the depth based on the learned degradation representation. Extensive experimental results on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Currently, the destruction of the sequence structure in handwritten text has become one of the main bottlenecks restricting the recognition task. The typical situations include additional specific markers (the text swapping modification) and the text overlap caused by character modifications like deletion, replacement, and insertion. In this paper, we propose a two-stage detection algorithm that combines structure knowledge and deep models for the above mentioned text. Firstly, different structure prototypes are roughly located from handwritten text images. Based on the detection results of the first stage, in the second stage, we adopt different strategies. Specifically, a shape regression network trained by a novel semi-supervised contrast training strategy is introduced and the positional relationship between the characters is fully employed. Experiments on two handwritten text datasets show that the proposed method can greatly improve the detection performance. The new dataset is available at https://github.com/Wukong90.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in head avatar rendering using Gaussian primitives have achieved significantly high-fidelity results. Although precise head geometry is crucial for applications like mesh reconstruction and relighting, current methods struggle to capture intricate geometric details and render unseen poses due to their reliance on similarity transformations, which cannot handle stretch and shear transforms essential for detailed deformations of geometry. To address this, we propose SurFhead, a novel method that reconstructs riggable head geometry from RGB videos using 2D Gaussian surfels, which offer well-defined geometric properties, such as precise depth from fixed ray intersections and normals derived from their surface orientation, making them advantageous over 3D counterparts. SurFhead ensures high-fidelity rendering of both normals and images, even in extreme poses, by leveraging classical mesh-based deformation transfer and affine transformation interpolation. SurFhead introduces precise geometric deformation and blends surfels through polar decomposition of transformations, including those affecting normals. Our key contribution lies in bridging classical graphics techniques, such as mesh-based deformation, with modern Gaussian primitives, achieving state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction and rendering quality. Unlike previous avatar rendering approaches, SurFhead enables efficient reconstruction driven by Gaussian primitives while preserving high-fidelity geometry.

- **Summary**: The advent of pre-trained vision-language foundation models has revolutionized the field of zero/few-shot (i.e., low-shot) image recognition. The key challenge to address under the condition of limited training data is how to fine-tune pre-trained vision-language models in a parameter-efficient manner. Previously, numerous approaches tackling this challenge have been proposed. Meantime, a few survey papers are also published to summarize these works. However, there still lacks a unified computational framework to integrate existing methods together, identify their nature and support in-depth comparison. As such, this survey paper first proposes a unified computational framework from the perspective of Representer Theorem and then derives many of the existing methods by specializing this framework. Thereafter, a comparative analysis is conducted to uncover the differences and relationships between existing methods. Based on the analyses, some possible variants to improve the existing works are presented. As a demonstration, we extend existing methods by modeling inter-class correlation between representers in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which is implemented by exploiting the closed-form solution of kernel ridge regression. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of this method. Toward the end of this paper, we discuss the limitations and provide further research directions.

- **Summary**: This study proposes a retinal prosthetic simulation framework driven by visual fixations, inspired by the saccade mechanism, and assesses performance improvements through end-to-end optimization in a classification task. Salient patches are predicted from input images using the self-attention map of a vision transformer to mimic visual fixations. These patches are then encoded by a trainable U-Net and simulated using the pulse2percept framework to predict visual percepts. By incorporating a learnable encoder, we aim to optimize the visual information transmitted to the retinal implant, addressing both the limited resolution of the electrode array and the distortion between the input stimuli and resulting phosphenes. The predicted percepts are evaluated using the self-supervised DINOv2 foundation model, with an optional learnable linear layer for classification accuracy. On a subset of the ImageNet validation set, the fixation-based framework achieves a classification accuracy of 87.72%, using computational parameters based on a real subject's physiological data, significantly outperforming the downsampling-based accuracy of 40.59% and approaching the healthy upper bound of 92.76%. Our approach shows promising potential for producing more semantically understandable percepts with the limited resolution available in retinal prosthetics.

- **Summary**: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hinder their practical applications. To address this, we propose a Magnifier Prompt (MagPrompt), a simple yet effective method to tackle hallucinations in MLLMs via extremely simple instructions. MagPrompt is based on the following two key principles, which guide the design of various effective prompts, demonstrating robustness: (1) MLLMs should focus more on the image. (2) When there are conflicts between the image and the model's inner knowledge, MLLMs should prioritize the image. MagPrompt is training-free and can be applied to open-source and closed-source models, such as GPT-4o and Gemini-pro. It performs well across many datasets and its effectiveness is comparable or even better than more complex methods like VCD. Furthermore, our prompt design principles and experimental analyses provide valuable insights into multimodal hallucination.

- **Summary**: Long videos contain many repeating actions, events and shots. These repetitions are frequently given identical captions, which makes it difficult to retrieve the exact desired clip using a text search. In this paper, we formulate the problem of unique captioning: Given multiple clips with the same caption, we generate a new caption for each clip that uniquely identifies it. We propose Captioning by Discriminative Prompting (CDP), which predicts a property that can separate identically captioned clips, and use it to generate unique captions. We introduce two benchmarks for unique captioning, based on egocentric footage and timeloop movies - where repeating actions are common. We demonstrate that captions generated by CDP improve text-to-video R@1 by 15% for egocentric videos and 10% in timeloop movies.

- **Summary**: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) offers significant benefits such as reduced recovery time and minimised patient trauma, but poses challenges in visibility and access, making accurate 3D reconstruction a significant tool in surgical planning and navigation. This work introduces a robotic arm platform for efficient multi-view image acquisition and precise 3D reconstruction in MIS settings. We adapted a laparoscope to a robotic arm and captured ex-vivo images of several ovine organs across varying lighting conditions (operating room and laparoscopic) and trajectories (spherical and laparoscopic). We employed recently released learning-based feature matchers combined with COLMAP to produce our reconstructions. The reconstructions were evaluated against high-precision laser scans for quantitative evaluation. Our results show that whilst reconstructions suffer most under realistic MIS lighting and trajectory, many versions of our pipeline achieve close to sub-millimetre accuracy with an average of 1.05 mm Root Mean Squared Error and 0.82 mm Chamfer distance. Our best reconstruction results occur with operating room lighting and spherical trajectories. Our robotic platform provides a tool for controlled, repeatable multi-view data acquisition for 3D generation in MIS environments which we hope leads to new datasets for training learning-based models.

- **Summary**: The emergence of Segment Anything (SAM) sparked research interest in the field of interactive segmentation, especially in the context of image editing tasks and speeding up data annotation. Unlike common semantic segmentation, interactive segmentation methods allow users to directly influence their output through prompts (e.g. clicks). However, click patterns in real-world interactive segmentation scenarios remain largely unexplored. Most methods rely on the assumption that users would click in the center of the largest erroneous area. Nevertheless, recent studies show that this is not always the case. Thus, methods may have poor performance in real-world deployment despite high metrics in a baseline benchmark. To accurately simulate real-user clicks, we conducted a large crowdsourcing study of click patterns in an interactive segmentation scenario and collected 475K real-user clicks. Drawing on ideas from saliency tasks, we develop a clickability model that enables sampling clicks, which closely resemble actual user inputs. Using our model and dataset, we propose RClicks benchmark for a comprehensive comparison of existing interactive segmentation methods on realistic clicks. Specifically, we evaluate not only the average quality of methods, but also the robustness w.r.t. click patterns. According to our benchmark, in real-world usage interactive segmentation models may perform worse than it has been reported in the baseline benchmark, and most of the methods are not robust. We believe that RClicks is a significant step towards creating interactive segmentation methods that provide the best user experience in real-world cases.

- **Summary**: Existing detection methods for insulator defect identification from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) struggle with complex background scenes and small objects, leading to suboptimal accuracy and a high number of false positives detection. Using the concept of local attention modeling, this paper proposes a new attention-based foundation architecture, YOLO-ELA, to address this issue. The Efficient Local Attention (ELA) blocks were added into the neck part of the one-stage YOLOv8 architecture to shift the model's attention from background features towards features of insulators with defects. The SCYLLA Intersection-Over-Union (SIoU) criterion function was used to reduce detection loss, accelerate model convergence, and increase the model's sensitivity towards small insulator defects, yielding higher true positive outcomes. Due to a limited dataset, data augmentation techniques were utilized to increase the diversity of the dataset. In addition, we leveraged the transfer learning strategy to improve the model's performance. Experimental results on high-resolution UAV images show that our method achieved a state-of-the-art performance of 96.9% mAP0.5 and a real-time detection speed of 74.63 frames per second, outperforming the baseline model. This further demonstrates the effectiveness of attention-based convolutional neural networks (CNN) in object detection tasks.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have achieved excellent success in solving inverse problems due to their ability to learn strong image priors, but existing approaches require a large training dataset of images that should come from the same distribution as the test dataset. When the training and test distributions are mismatched, artifacts and hallucinations can occur in reconstructed images due to the incorrect priors. In this work, we systematically study out of distribution (OOD) problems where a known training distribution is first provided. We first study the setting where only a single measurement obtained from the unknown test distribution is available. Next we study the setting where a very small sample of data belonging to the test distribution is available, and our goal is still to reconstruct an image from a measurement that came from the test distribution. In both settings, we use a patch-based diffusion prior that learns the image distribution solely from patches. Furthermore, in the first setting, we include a self-supervised loss that helps the network output maintain consistency with the measurement. Extensive experiments show that in both settings, the patch-based method can obtain high quality image reconstructions that can outperform whole-image models and can compete with methods that have access to large in-distribution training datasets. Furthermore, we show how whole-image models are prone to memorization and overfitting, leading to artifacts in the reconstructions, while a patch-based model can resolve these issues.

- **Summary**: Automated wildlife surveys based on drone imagery and object detection technology are a powerful and increasingly popular tool in conservation biology. Most detectors require training images with annotated bounding boxes, which are tedious, expensive, and not always unambiguous to create. To reduce the annotation load associated with this practice, we develop POLO, a multi-class object detection model that can be trained entirely on point labels. POLO is based on simple, yet effective modifications to the YOLOv8 architecture, including alterations to the prediction process, training losses, and post-processing. We test POLO on drone recordings of waterfowl containing up to multiple thousands of individual birds in one image and compare it to a regular YOLOv8. Our experiments show that at the same annotation cost, POLO achieves improved accuracy in counting animals in aerial imagery.

- **Summary**: We introduce Latent Action Pretraining for general Action models (LAPA), an unsupervised method for pretraining Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models without ground-truth robot action labels. Existing Vision-Language-Action models require action labels typically collected by human teleoperators during pretraining, which significantly limits possible data sources and scale. In this work, we propose a method to learn from internet-scale videos that do not have robot action labels. We first train an action quantization model leveraging VQ-VAE-based objective to learn discrete latent actions between image frames, then pretrain a latent VLA model to predict these latent actions from observations and task descriptions, and finally finetune the VLA on small-scale robot manipulation data to map from latent to robot actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing techniques that train robot manipulation policies from large-scale videos. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model trained with robotic action labels on real-world manipulation tasks that require language conditioning, generalization to unseen objects, and semantic generalization to unseen instructions. Training only on human manipulation videos also shows positive transfer, opening up the potential for leveraging web-scale data for robotics foundation model.

- **Summary**: Despite the progress made by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology, they remain limited by a predominant focus on patch-level analysis, missing essential contextual information at the whole-slide level. The lack of large-scale instruction datasets and the gigapixel scale of whole slide images (WSIs) pose significant developmental challenges. In this paper, we present SlideChat, the first vision-language assistant capable of understanding gigapixel whole-slide images, exhibiting excellent multimodal conversational capability and response complex instruction across diverse pathology scenarios. To support its development, we created SlideInstruction, the largest instruction-following dataset for WSIs consisting of 4.2K WSI captions and 176K VQA pairs with multiple categories. Furthermore, we propose SlideBench, a multimodal benchmark that incorporates captioning and VQA tasks to assess SlideChat's capabilities in varied clinical settings such as microscopy, diagnosis. Compared to both general and specialized MLLMs, SlideChat exhibits exceptional capabilities achieving state-of-the-art performance on 18 of 22 tasks. For example, it achieved an overall accuracy of 81.17% on SlideBench-VQA (TCGA), and 54.15% on SlideBench-VQA (BCNB). We will fully release SlideChat, SlideInstruction and SlideBench as open-source resources to facilitate research and development in computational pathology.

- **Summary**: Real-world datasets follow an imbalanced distribution, which poses significant challenges in rare-category object detection. Recent studies tackle this problem by developing re-weighting and re-sampling methods, that utilise the class frequencies of the dataset. However, these techniques focus solely on the frequency statistics and ignore the distribution of the classes in image space, missing important information. In contrast to them, we propose FRActal CALibration (FRACAL): a novel post-calibration method for long-tailed object detection. FRACAL devises a logit adjustment method that utilises the fractal dimension to estimate how uniformly classes are distributed in image space. During inference, it uses the fractal dimension to inversely downweight the probabilities of uniformly spaced class predictions achieving balance in two axes: between frequent and rare categories, and between uniformly spaced and sparsely spaced classes. FRACAL is a post-processing method and it does not require any training, also it can be combined with many off-the-shelf models such as one-stage sigmoid detectors and two-stage instance segmentation models. FRACAL boosts the rare class performance by up to 8.6% and surpasses all previous methods on LVIS dataset, while showing good generalisation to other datasets such as COCO, V3Det and OpenImages. The code will be released.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, but the underlying reasons remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis and find that, although MLLMs incorrectly generate the objects in the final output, they are actually able to recognize visual objects in the preceding layers. We speculate that this may be due to the strong knowledge priors of the language model suppressing the visual information, leading to hallucinations. Motivated by this, we propose a novel dynamic correction decoding method for MLLMs (DeCo), which adaptively selects the appropriate preceding layers and proportionally integrates knowledge into the final layer to adjust the output logits. Note that DeCo is model agnostic and can be seamlessly incorporated with various classic decoding strategies and applied to different MLLMs. We evaluate DeCo on widely-used benchmarks, demonstrating that it can reduce hallucination rates by a large margin compared to baselines, highlighting its potential to mitigate hallucinations. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/DeCo.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel probabilistic mapping algorithm, Latent BKI, which enables open-vocabulary mapping with quantifiable uncertainty. Traditionally, semantic mapping algorithms focus on a fixed set of semantic categories which limits their applicability for complex robotic tasks. Vision-Language (VL) models have recently emerged as a technique to jointly model language and visual features in a latent space, enabling semantic recognition beyond a predefined, fixed set of semantic classes. Latent BKI recurrently incorporates neural embeddings from VL models into a voxel map with quantifiable uncertainty, leveraging the spatial correlations of nearby observations through Bayesian Kernel Inference (BKI). Latent BKI is evaluated against similar explicit semantic mapping and VL mapping frameworks on the popular MatterPort-3D and Semantic KITTI data sets, demonstrating that Latent BKI maintains the probabilistic benefits of continuous mapping with the additional benefit of open-dictionary queries. Real-world experiments demonstrate applicability to challenging indoor environments.

- **Summary**: We study the problem of teaching humanoid robots manipulation skills by imitating from single video demonstrations. We introduce OKAMI, a method that generates a manipulation plan from a single RGB-D video and derives a policy for execution. At the heart of our approach is object-aware retargeting, which enables the humanoid robot to mimic the human motions in an RGB-D video while adjusting to different object locations during deployment. OKAMI uses open-world vision models to identify task-relevant objects and retarget the body motions and hand poses separately. Our experiments show that OKAMI achieves strong generalizations across varying visual and spatial conditions, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline on open-world imitation from observation. Furthermore, OKAMI rollout trajectories are leveraged to train closed-loop visuomotor policies, which achieve an average success rate of 79.2% without the need for labor-intensive teleoperation.

- **Summary**: As one of the most popular and sought-after generative models in the recent years, diffusion models have sparked the interests of many researchers and steadily shown excellent advantage in various generative tasks such as image synthesis, video generation, molecule design, 3D scene rendering and multimodal generation, relying on their dense theoretical principles and reliable application practices. The remarkable success of these recent efforts on diffusion models comes largely from progressive design principles and efficient architecture, training, inference, and deployment methodologies. However, there has not been a comprehensive and in-depth review to summarize these principles and practices to help the rapid understanding and application of diffusion models. In this survey, we provide a new efficiency-oriented perspective on these existing efforts, which mainly focuses on the profound principles and efficient practices in architecture designs, model training, fast inference and reliable deployment, to guide further theoretical research, algorithm migration and model application for new scenarios in a reader-friendly way. \url{https://github.com/ponyzym/Efficient-DMs-Survey}

- **Summary**: Scene graphs offer a structured, hierarchical representation of images, with nodes and edges symbolizing objects and the relationships among them. It can serve as a natural interface for image editing, dramatically improving precision and flexibility. Leveraging this benefit, we introduce a new framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with Text2Image generative model for scene graph-based image editing. This integration enables precise modifications at the object level and creative recomposition of scenes without compromising overall image integrity. Our approach involves two primary stages: 1) Utilizing a LLM-driven scene parser, we construct an image's scene graph, capturing key objects and their interrelationships, as well as parsing fine-grained attributes such as object masks and descriptions. These annotations facilitate concept learning with a fine-tuned diffusion model, representing each object with an optimized token and detailed description prompt. 2) During the image editing phase, a LLM editing controller guides the edits towards specific areas. These edits are then implemented by an attention-modulated diffusion editor, utilizing the fine-tuned model to perform object additions, deletions, replacements, and adjustments. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing image editing methods in terms of editing precision and scene aesthetics.

- **Summary**: The automatic assembly problem has attracted increasing interest due to its complex challenges that involve 3D representation. This paper introduces Jigsaw++, a novel generative method designed to tackle the multifaceted challenges of reconstruction for the reassembly problem. Existing approach focusing primarily on piecewise information for both part and fracture assembly, often overlooking the integration of complete object prior. Jigsaw++ distinguishes itself by learning a category-agnostic shape prior of complete objects. It employs the proposed "retargeting" strategy that effectively leverages the output of any existing assembly method to generate complete shape reconstructions. This capability allows it to function orthogonally to the current methods. Through extensive evaluations on Breaking Bad dataset and PartNet, Jigsaw++ has demonstrated its effectiveness, reducing reconstruction errors and enhancing the precision of shape reconstruction, which sets a new direction for future reassembly model developments.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has enabled them to generate unprecedented results from given texts. However, as text inputs become longer, existing encoding methods like CLIP face limitations, and aligning the generated images with long texts becomes challenging. To tackle these issues, we propose LongAlign, which includes a segment-level encoding method for processing long texts and a decomposed preference optimization method for effective alignment training. For segment-level encoding, long texts are divided into multiple segments and processed separately. This method overcomes the maximum input length limits of pretrained encoding models. For preference optimization, we provide decomposed CLIP-based preference models to fine-tune diffusion models. Specifically, to utilize CLIP-based preference models for T2I alignment, we delve into their scoring mechanisms and find that the preference scores can be decomposed into two components: a text-relevant part that measures T2I alignment and a text-irrelevant part that assesses other visual aspects of human preference. Additionally, we find that the text-irrelevant part contributes to a common overfitting problem during fine-tuning. To address this, we propose a reweighting strategy that assigns different weights to these two components, thereby reducing overfitting and enhancing alignment. After fine-tuning $512 \times 512$ Stable Diffusion (SD) v1.5 for about 20 hours using our method, the fine-tuned SD outperforms stronger foundation models in T2I alignment, such as PixArt-$\alpha$ and Kandinsky v2.2.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in text-to-image generation have significantly enhanced the quality of synthesized images. Despite this progress, evaluations predominantly focus on aesthetic appeal or alignment with text prompts. Consequently, there is limited understanding of whether these models can accurately represent a wide variety of realistic visual entities - a task requiring real-world knowledge. To address this gap, we propose a benchmark focused on evaluating Knowledge-InTensive image generaTion on real-world ENtities (i.e., KITTEN). Using KITTEN, we conduct a systematic study on the fidelity of entities in text-to-image generation models, focusing on their ability to generate a wide range of real-world visual entities, such as landmark buildings, aircraft, plants, and animals. We evaluate the latest text-to-image models and retrieval-augmented customization models using both automatic metrics and carefully-designed human evaluations, with an emphasis on the fidelity of entities in the generated images. Our findings reveal that even the most advanced text-to-image models often fail to generate entities with accurate visual details. Although retrieval-augmented models can enhance the fidelity of entity by incorporating reference images during testing, they often over-rely on these references and struggle to produce novel configurations of the entity as requested in creative text prompts.

- **Summary**: Recent progress in blind face restoration has resulted in producing high-quality restored results for static images. However, efforts to extend these advancements to video scenarios have been minimal, partly because of the absence of benchmarks that allow for a comprehensive and fair comparison. In this work, we first present a fair evaluation benchmark, in which we first introduce a Real-world Low-Quality Face Video benchmark (RFV-LQ), evaluate several leading image-based face restoration algorithms, and conduct a thorough systematical analysis of the benefits and challenges associated with extending blind face image restoration algorithms to degraded face videos. Our analysis identifies several key issues, primarily categorized into two aspects: significant jitters in facial components and noise-shape flickering between frames. To address these issues, we propose a Temporal Consistency Network (TCN) cooperated with alignment smoothing to reduce jitters and flickers in restored videos. TCN is a flexible component that can be seamlessly plugged into the most advanced face image restoration algorithms, ensuring the quality of image-based restoration is maintained as closely as possible. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed TCN and alignment smoothing operation.

- **Summary**: Despite significant advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for understanding complex human intentions through cross-modal interactions, capturing intricate image details remains challenging. Previous methods integrating multiple vision encoders to enhance visual detail introduce redundancy and computational overhead. We observe that most MLLMs utilize only the last-layer feature map of the vision encoder for visual representation, neglecting the rich fine-grained information in shallow feature maps. To address this issue, we propose \modelname, a simple yet effective multi-layer feature fuser that efficiently integrates deep and shallow features from Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, it leverages semantically aligned deep features as queries to dynamically extract missing details from shallow features, thus preserving semantic alignment while enriching the representation with fine-grained information. Applied to the LLaVA-1.5 model, \modelname~achieves significant improvements in visual representation and benchmark performance, providing a more flexible and lightweight solution compared to multi-encoder ensemble methods. The code and model have been released at https://github.com/yuecao0119/MMFuser.

- **Summary**: Most state-of-the-art point trackers are trained on synthetic data due to the difficulty of annotating real videos for this task. However, this can result in suboptimal performance due to the statistical gap between synthetic and real videos. In order to understand these issues better, we introduce CoTracker3, comprising a new tracking model and a new semi-supervised training recipe. This allows real videos without annotations to be used during training by generating pseudo-labels using off-the-shelf teachers. The new model eliminates or simplifies components from previous trackers, resulting in a simpler and often smaller architecture. This training scheme is much simpler than prior work and achieves better results using 1,000 times less data. We further study the scaling behaviour to understand the impact of using more real unsupervised data in point tracking. The model is available in online and offline variants and reliably tracks visible and occluded points.



### On the Effectiveness of Dataset Alignment for Fake Image Detection

- **Summary**: As latent diffusion models (LDMs) democratize image generation capabilities, there is a growing need to detect fake images. A good detector should focus on the generative models fingerprints while ignoring image properties such as semantic content, resolution, file format, etc. Fake image detectors are usually built in a data driven way, where a model is trained to separate real from fake images. Existing works primarily investigate network architecture choices and training recipes. In this work, we argue that in addition to these algorithmic choices, we also require a well aligned dataset of real/fake images to train a robust detector. For the family of LDMs, we propose a very simple way to achieve this: we reconstruct all the real images using the LDMs autoencoder, without any denoising operation. We then train a model to separate these real images from their reconstructions. The fakes created this way are extremely similar to the real ones in almost every aspect (e.g., size, aspect ratio, semantic content), which forces the model to look for the LDM decoders artifacts. We empirically show that this way of creating aligned real/fake datasets, which also sidesteps the computationally expensive denoising process, helps in building a detector that focuses less on spurious correlations, something that a very popular existing method is susceptible to. Finally, to demonstrate just how effective the alignment in a dataset can be, we build a detector using images that are not natural objects, and present promising results. Overall, our work identifies the subtle but significant issues that arise when training a fake image detector and proposes a simple and inexpensive solution to address these problems.

- **Summary**: Despite the recent progress, existing frame interpolation methods still struggle with processing extremely high resolution input and handling challenging cases such as repetitive textures, thin objects, and large motion. To address these issues, we introduce a patch-based cascaded pixel diffusion model for frame interpolation, HiFI, that excels in these scenarios while achieving competitive performance on standard benchmarks. Cascades, which generate a series of images from low- to high-resolution, can help significantly with large or complex motion that require both global context for a coarse solution and detailed context for high resolution output. However, contrary to prior work on cascaded diffusion models which perform diffusion on increasingly large resolutions, we use a single model that always performs diffusion at the same resolution and upsamples by processing patches of the inputs and the prior solution. We show that this technique drastically reduces memory usage at inference time and also allows us to use a single model at test time, solving both frame interpolation and spatial up-sampling, saving training cost. We show that HiFI helps significantly with high resolution and complex repeated textures that require global context. HiFI demonstrates comparable or beyond state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks (Vimeo, Xiph, X-Test, SEPE-8K). On our newly introduced dataset that focuses on particularly challenging cases, HiFI also significantly outperforms other baselines on these cases.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In this work, we upgrade the multi-head attention mechanism, the core of the Transformer model, to improve efficiency while maintaining or surpassing the previous accuracy level. We show that multi-head attention can be expressed in the summation form. Drawing on the insight that not all attention heads hold equal significance, we propose Mixture-of-Head attention (MoH), a new architecture that treats attention heads as experts in the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism. MoH has two significant advantages: First, MoH enables each token to select the appropriate attention heads, enhancing inference efficiency without compromising accuracy or increasing the number of parameters. Second, MoH replaces the standard summation in multi-head attention with a weighted summation, introducing flexibility to the attention mechanism and unlocking extra performance potential. Extensive experiments on ViT, DiT, and LLMs demonstrate that MoH outperforms multi-head attention by using only 50%-90% of the attention heads. Moreover, we demonstrate that pre-trained multi-head attention models, such as LLaMA3-8B, can be further continue-tuned into our MoH models. Notably, MoH-LLaMA3-8B achieves an average accuracy of 64.0% across 14 benchmarks, outperforming LLaMA3-8B by 2.4% by utilizing only 75% of the attention heads. We believe the proposed MoH is a promising alternative to multi-head attention and provides a strong foundation for developing advanced and efficient attention-based models.

- **Summary**: 3D particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) is a key technique for analyzing turbulent flow, one of the most challenging computational problems of our century. At the core of 3D PTV is the dual-frame fluid motion estimation algorithm, which tracks particles across two consecutive frames. Recently, deep learning-based methods have achieved impressive accuracy in dual-frame fluid motion estimation; however, they heavily depend on large volumes of labeled data. In this paper, we introduce a new method that is completely self-supervised and notably outperforms its fully-supervised counterparts while requiring only 1% of the training samples (without labels) used by previous methods. Our method features a novel zero-divergence loss that is specific to the domain of turbulent flow. Inspired by the success of splat operation in high-dimensional filtering and random fields, we propose a splat-based implementation for this loss which is both efficient and effective. The self-supervised nature of our method naturally supports test-time optimization, leading to the development of a tailored Dynamic Velocimetry Enhancer (DVE) module. We demonstrate that strong cross-domain robustness is achieved through test-time optimization on unseen leave-one-out synthetic domains and real physical/biological domains.

- **Summary**: Pretraining robust vision or multimodal foundation models (e.g., CLIP) relies on large-scale datasets that may be noisy, potentially misaligned, and have long-tail distributions. Previous works have shown promising results in augmenting datasets by generating synthetic samples. However, they only support domain-specific ad hoc use cases (e.g., either image or text only, but not both), and are limited in data diversity due to a lack of fine-grained control over the synthesis process. In this paper, we design a \emph{controllable} image-text synthesis pipeline, CtrlSynth, for data-efficient and robust multimodal learning. The key idea is to decompose the visual semantics of an image into basic elements, apply user-specified control policies (e.g., remove, add, or replace operations), and recompose them to synthesize images or texts. The decompose and recompose feature in CtrlSynth allows users to control data synthesis in a fine-grained manner by defining customized control policies to manipulate the basic elements. CtrlSynth leverages the capabilities of pretrained foundation models such as large language models or diffusion models to reason and recompose basic elements such that synthetic samples are natural and composed in diverse ways. CtrlSynth is a closed-loop, training-free, and modular framework, making it easy to support different pretrained models. With extensive experiments on 31 datasets spanning different vision and vision-language tasks, we show that CtrlSynth substantially improves zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and compositional reasoning performance of CLIP models.

- **Summary**: In the past utilities relied on in-field inspections to identify asset defects. Recently, utilities have started using drone-based inspections to enhance the field-inspection process. We consider a vast repository of drone images, providing a wealth of information about asset health and potential issues. However, making the collected imagery data useful for automated defect detection requires significant manual labeling effort. We propose a novel solution that combines synthetic asset defect images with manually labeled drone images. This solution has several benefits: improves performance of defect detection, reduces the number of hours spent on manual labeling, and enables the capability to generate realistic images of rare defects where not enough real-world data is available. We employ a workflow that combines 3D modeling tools such as Maya and Unreal Engine to create photorealistic 3D models and 2D renderings of defective assets and their surroundings. These synthetic images are then integrated into our training pipeline augmenting the real data. This study implements an end-to-end Artificial Intelligence solution to detect assets and asset defects from the combined imagery repository. The unique contribution of this research lies in the application of advanced computer vision models and the generation of photorealistic 3D renderings of defective assets, aiming to transform the asset inspection process. Our asset detection model has achieved an accuracy of 92 percent, we achieved a performance lift of 67 percent when introducing approximately 2,000 synthetic images of 2k resolution. In our tests, the defect detection model achieved an accuracy of 73 percent across two batches of images. Our analysis demonstrated that synthetic data can be successfully used in place of real-world manually labeled data to train defect detection model.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models excel at generative modeling (e.g., text-to-image) but sampling requires multiple denoising network passes, limiting practicality. Efforts such as progressive distillation or consistency distillation have shown promise by reducing the number of passes at the expense of quality of the generated samples. In this work we identify co-variate shift as one of reason for poor performance of multi-step distilled models from compounding error at inference time. To address co-variate shift, we formulate diffusion distillation within imitation learning (DDIL) framework and enhance training distribution for distilling diffusion models on both data distribution (forward diffusion) and student induced distributions (backward diffusion). Training on data distribution helps to diversify the generations by preserving marginal data distribution and training on student distribution addresses compounding error by correcting covariate shift. In addition, we adopt reflected diffusion formulation for distillation and demonstrate improved performance, stable training across different distillation methods. We show that DDIL consistency improves on baseline algorithms of progressive distillation (PD), Latent consistency models (LCM) and Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD2).

- **Summary**: This work contributes to breast cancer sub-type classification using histopathological images. We utilize masked autoencoders (MAEs) to learn a self-supervised embedding tailored for computer vision tasks in this domain. This embedding captures informative representations of histopathological data, facilitating feature learning without extensive labeled datasets. During pre-training, we investigate employing a random crop technique to generate a large dataset from WSIs automatically. Additionally, we assess the performance of linear probes for multi-class classification tasks of cancer sub-types using the representations learnt by the MAE. Our approach aims to achieve strong performance on downstream tasks by leveraging the complementary strengths of ViTs and autoencoders. We evaluate our model's performance on the BRACS dataset and compare it with existing benchmarks.

- **Summary**: This paper strives for motion-focused video-language representations. Existing methods to learn video-language representations use spatial-focused data, where identifying the objects and scene is often enough to distinguish the relevant caption. We instead propose LocoMotion to learn from motion-focused captions that describe the movement and temporal progression of local object motions. We achieve this by adding synthetic motions to videos and using the parameters of these motions to generate corresponding captions. Furthermore, we propose verb-variation paraphrasing to increase the caption variety and learn the link between primitive motions and high-level verbs. With this, we are able to learn a motion-focused video-language representation. Experiments demonstrate our approach is effective for a variety of downstream tasks, particularly when limited data is available for fine-tuning.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel neural network approach, LARP (Learned Articulated Rigid body Physics), to model the dynamics of articulated human motion with contact. Our goal is to develop a faster and more convenient methodological alternative to traditional physics simulators for use in computer vision tasks such as human motion reconstruction from video. To that end we introduce a training procedure and model components that support the construction of a recurrent neural architecture to accurately simulate articulated rigid body dynamics. Our neural architecture supports features typically found in traditional physics simulators, such as modeling of joint motors, variable dimensions of body parts, contact between body parts and objects, and is an order of magnitude faster than traditional systems when multiple simulations are run in parallel. To demonstrate the value of LARP we use it as a drop-in replacement for a state of the art classical non-differentiable simulator in an existing video-based reconstruction framework and show comparative or better 3D human pose reconstruction accuracy.

- **Summary**: Representation learning has become increasingly important, especially as powerful models have shifted towards learning latent representations before fine-tuning for downstream tasks. This approach is particularly valuable in leveraging the structural information within brain anatomy. However, a common limitation of recent models developed for MRIs is their tendency to ignore or remove geometric information, such as translation and rotation, thereby creating invariance with respect to geometric operations. We contend that incorporating knowledge about these geometric transformations into the model can significantly enhance its ability to learn more detailed anatomical information within brain structures. As a result, we propose a novel method for encoding 3D MRIs that enforces equivariance with respect to all rotations in 3D space, in other words, SO(3)-equivariance (SOE). By explicitly modeling this geometric equivariance in the representation space, we ensure that any rotational operation applied to the input image space is also reflected in the embedding representation space. This approach requires moving beyond traditional representation learning methods, as we need a representation vector space that allows for the application of the same SO(3) operation in that space. To facilitate this, we leverage the concept of vector neurons. The representation space formed by our method captures the brain's structural and anatomical information more effectively. We evaluate SOE pretrained on the structural MRIs of two public data sets with respect to the downstream task of predicting age and diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease from T1-weighted brain scans of the ADNI data set. We demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms other methods but is also robust against various degrees of rotation along different axes.

- **Summary**: Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in highly dynamic environments is challenging due to the correlation complexity between moving objects and the camera pose. Many methods have been proposed to deal with this problem; however, the moving properties of dynamic objects with a moving camera remain unclear. Therefore, to improve SLAM's performance, minimizing disruptive events of moving objects with a physical understanding of 3D shapes and dynamics of objects is needed. In this paper, we propose a robust method, V3D-SLAM, to remove moving objects via two lightweight re-evaluation stages, including identifying potentially moving and static objects using a spatial-reasoned Hough voting mechanism and refining static objects by detecting dynamic noise caused by intra-object motions using Chamfer distances as similarity measurements. Our experiment on the TUM RGB-D benchmark on dynamic sequences with ground-truth camera trajectories showed that our methods outperform the most recent state-of-the-art SLAM methods.

- **Summary**: We introduce nvTorchCam, an open-source library under the Apache 2.0 license, designed to make deep learning algorithms camera model-independent. nvTorchCam abstracts critical camera operations such as projection and unprojection, allowing developers to implement algorithms once and apply them across diverse camera models--including pinhole, fisheye, and 360 equirectangular panoramas, which are commonly used in automotive and real estate capture applications. Built on PyTorch, nvTorchCam is fully differentiable and supports GPU acceleration and batching for efficient computation. Furthermore, deep learning models trained for one camera type can be directly transferred to other camera types without requiring additional modification. In this paper, we provide an overview of nvTorchCam, its functionality, and present various code examples and diagrams to demonstrate its usage. Source code and installation instructions can be found on the nvTorchCam GitHub page at https://github.com/NVlabs/nvTorchCam.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose a novel approach, namely WeatherDG, that can generate realistic, weather-diverse, and driving-screen images based on the cooperation of two foundation models, i.e, Stable Diffusion (SD) and Large Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we first fine-tune the SD with source data, aligning the content and layout of generated samples with real-world driving scenarios. Then, we propose a procedural prompt generation method based on LLM, which can enrich scenario descriptions and help SD automatically generate more diverse, detailed images. In addition, we introduce a balanced generation strategy, which encourages the SD to generate high-quality objects of tailed classes under various weather conditions, such as riders and motorcycles. This segmentation-model-agnostic method can improve the generalization ability of existing models by additionally adapting them with the generated synthetic data. Experiments on three challenging datasets show that our method can significantly improve the segmentation performance of different state-of-the-art models on target domains. Notably, in the setting of ''Cityscapes to ACDC'', our method improves the baseline HRDA by 13.9% in mIoU.

- **Summary**: Image-based Pose-Agnostic 3D Anomaly Detection is an important task that has emerged in industrial quality control. This task seeks to find anomalies from query images of a tested object given a set of reference images of an anomaly-free object. The challenge is that the query views (a.k.a poses) are unknown and can be different from the reference views. Currently, new methods such as OmniposeAD and SplatPose have emerged to bridge the gap by synthesizing pseudo reference images at the query views for pixel-to-pixel comparison. However, none of these methods can infer in real-time, which is critical in industrial quality control for massive production. For this reason, we propose SplatPose+, which employs a hybrid representation consisting of a Structure from Motion (SfM) model for localization and a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model for Novel View Synthesis. Although our proposed pipeline requires the computation of an additional SfM model, it offers real-time inference speeds and faster training compared to SplatPose. Quality-wise, we achieved a new SOTA on the Pose-agnostic Anomaly Detection benchmark with the Multi-Pose Anomaly Detection (MAD-SIM) dataset.

- **Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in text generation and comprehension, with recent advancements extending into multimodal LLMs that integrate visual and audio inputs. However, these models continue to struggle with fine-grained, cross-modal temporal understanding, particularly when correlating events across audio and video streams. We address these challenges with two key contributions: a new dataset and model, called OCTAV and OMCAT respectively. OCTAV (Omni Context and Temporal Audio Video) is a novel dataset designed to capture event transitions across audio and video. Second, OMCAT (Omni Context Aware Transformer) is a powerful model that leverages RoTE (Rotary Time Embeddings), an innovative extension of RoPE, to enhance temporal grounding and computational efficiency in time-anchored tasks. Through a robust three-stage training pipeline-feature alignment, instruction tuning, and OCTAV-specific training-OMCAT excels in cross-modal temporal understanding. Our model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) tasks and the OCTAV benchmark, showcasing significant gains in temporal reasoning and cross-modal alignment, as validated through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies. Our dataset and code will be made publicly available. The link to our demo page is https://om-cat.github.io.
