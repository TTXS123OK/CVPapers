- **Summary**: It has been demonstrated that networks' parameters can be significantly reduced in the frequency domain with a very small decrease in accuracy. However, given the cost of frequency transforms, the computational complexity is not significantly decreased. In this work, we propose performing network inference in the frequency domain to speed up networks whose frequency parameters are sparse. In particular, we propose a frequency inference chain that is dual to the network inference in the spatial domain. In order to handle the non-linear layers, we make a compromise to apply non-linear operations on frequency data directly, which works effectively. Enabled by the frequency inference chain and the strategy for non-linear layers, the proposed approach completes the entire inference in the frequency domain. Unlike previous approaches which require extra frequency or inverse transforms for all layers, the proposed approach only needs the frequency transform and its inverse once at the beginning and once at the end of a network. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves accuracy in the case of a high speedup ratio (over 100x).

- **Summary**: Humans perform visual perception at multiple levels, including low-level object recognition and high-level semantic interpretation such as behavior understanding. Subtle differences in low-level details can lead to substantial changes in high-level perception. For example, substituting the shopping bag held by a person with a gun suggests violent behavior, implying criminal or violent activity. Despite significant advancements in various multimodal tasks, Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) remain unexplored in their capabilities to conduct such multi-level visual perceptions.   To investigate the perception gap between LVLMs and humans, we introduce MVP-Bench, the first visual-language benchmark systematically evaluating both low- and high-level visual perception of LVLMs. We construct MVP-Bench across natural and synthetic images to investigate how manipulated content influences model perception. Using MVP-Bench, we diagnose the visual perception of 10 open-source and 2 closed-source LVLMs, showing that high-level perception tasks significantly challenge existing LVLMs. The state-of-the-art GPT-4o only achieves an accuracy of $56\%$ on Yes/No questions, compared with $74\%$ in low-level scenarios. Furthermore, the performance gap between natural and manipulated images indicates that current LVLMs do not generalize in understanding the visual semantics of synthetic images as humans do.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing urban street scenes is crucial due to its vital role in applications such as autonomous driving and urban planning. These scenes are characterized by long and narrow camera trajectories, occlusion, complex object relationships, and data sparsity across multiple scales. Despite recent advancements, existing surface reconstruction methods, which are primarily designed for object-centric scenarios, struggle to adapt effectively to the unique characteristics of street scenes. To address this challenge, we introduce StreetSurfGS, the first method to employ Gaussian Splatting specifically tailored for scalable urban street scene surface reconstruction. StreetSurfGS utilizes a planar-based octree representation and segmented training to reduce memory costs, accommodate unique camera characteristics, and ensure scalability. Additionally, to mitigate depth inaccuracies caused by object overlap, we propose a guided smoothing strategy within regularization to eliminate inaccurate boundary points and outliers. Furthermore, to address sparse views and multi-scale challenges, we use a dual-step matching strategy that leverages adjacent and long-term information. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of StreetSurfGS in both novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have revolutionized visual content creation, but extending these capabilities to text-to-video (T2V) generation remains a challenge, particularly in preserving temporal consistency. Existing methods that aim to improve consistency often cause trade-offs such as reduced imaging quality and impractical computational time. To address these issues we introduce VideoGuide, a novel framework that enhances the temporal consistency of pretrained T2V models without the need for additional training or fine-tuning. Instead, VideoGuide leverages any pretrained video diffusion model (VDM) or itself as a guide during the early stages of inference, improving temporal quality by interpolating the guiding model's denoised samples into the sampling model's denoising process. The proposed method brings about significant improvement in temporal consistency and image fidelity, providing a cost-effective and practical solution that synergizes the strengths of various video diffusion models. Furthermore, we demonstrate prior distillation, revealing that base models can achieve enhanced text coherence by utilizing the superior data prior of the guiding model through the proposed method.

- **Summary**: The rapid progress of Deepfake technology has made face swapping highly realistic, raising concerns about the malicious use of fabricated facial content. Existing methods often struggle to generalize to unseen domains due to the diverse nature of facial manipulations. In this paper, we revisit the generation process and identify a universal principle: Deepfake images inherently contain information from both source and target identities, while genuine faces maintain a consistent identity. Building upon this insight, we introduce DiffusionFake, a novel plug-and-play framework that reverses the generative process of face forgeries to enhance the generalization of detection models. DiffusionFake achieves this by injecting the features extracted by the detection model into a frozen pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, compelling it to reconstruct the corresponding target and source images. This guided reconstruction process constrains the detection network to capture the source and target related features to facilitate the reconstruction, thereby learning rich and disentangled representations that are more resilient to unseen forgeries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffusionFake significantly improves cross-domain generalization of various detector architectures without introducing additional parameters during inference.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: While neural radiance fields (NeRF) have shown promise in novel view synthesis, their implicit representation limits explicit control over object manipulation. Existing research has proposed the integration of explicit geometric proxies to enable deformation. However, these methods face two primary challenges: firstly, the time-consuming and computationally demanding tetrahedralization process; and secondly, handling complex or thin structures often leads to either excessive, storage-intensive tetrahedral meshes or poor-quality ones that impair deformation capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose DeformRF, a method that seamlessly integrates the manipulability of tetrahedral meshes with the high-quality rendering capabilities of feature grid representations. To avoid ill-shaped tetrahedra and tetrahedralization for each object, we propose a two-stage training strategy. Starting with an almost-regular tetrahedral grid, our model initially retains key tetrahedra surrounding the object and subsequently refines object details using finer-granularity mesh in the second stage. We also present the concept of recursively subdivided tetrahedra to create higher-resolution meshes implicitly. This enables multi-resolution encoding while only necessitating the storage of the coarse tetrahedral mesh generated in the first training stage. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our DeformRF on both synthetic and real-captured datasets. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for novel view synthesis and deformation tasks. Project page: https://ustc3dv.github.io/DeformRF/

- **Summary**: In vision-language models (VLMs), visual tokens usually consume a significant amount of computational overhead, despite their sparser information density compared to text tokens. To address this, most existing methods learn a network to prune redundant visual tokens and require additional training data. Differently, we propose an efficient training-free token optimization mechanism dubbed SparseVLM without extra parameters or fine-tuning costs. Concretely, given that visual tokens complement text tokens in VLMs for linguistic reasoning, we select visual-relevant text tokens to rate the significance of vision tokens within the self-attention matrix extracted from the VLMs. Then we progressively prune irrelevant tokens. To maximize sparsity while retaining essential information, we introduce a rank-based strategy to adaptively determine the sparsification ratio for each layer, alongside a token recycling method that compresses pruned tokens into more compact representations. Experimental results show that our SparseVLM improves the efficiency of various VLMs across a range of image and video understanding tasks. In particular, LLaVA equipped with SparseVLM reduces 61% to 67% FLOPs with a compression ratio of 78% while maintaining 93% of the accuracy.

- **Summary**: This paper presents LiteVLoc, a hierarchical visual localization framework that uses a lightweight topo-metric map to represent the environment. The method consists of three sequential modules that estimate camera poses in a coarse-to-fine manner. Unlike mainstream approaches relying on detailed 3D representations, LiteVLoc reduces storage overhead by leveraging learning-based feature matching and geometric solvers for metric pose estimation. A novel dataset for the map-free relocalization task is also introduced. Extensive experiments including localization and navigation in both simulated and real-world scenarios have validate the system's performance and demonstrated its precision and efficiency for large-scale deployment. Code and data will be made publicly available.



### Disentangling Regional Primitives for Image Generation

- **Summary**: This paper presents a method to explain the internal representation structure of a neural network for image generation. Specifically, our method disentangles primitive feature components from the intermediate-layer feature of the neural network, which ensures that each feature component is exclusively used to generate a specific set of image regions. In this way, the generation of the entire image can be considered as the superposition of different pre-encoded primitive regional patterns, each being generated by a feature component. We find that the feature component can be represented as an OR relationship between the demands for generating different image regions, which is encoded by the neural network. Therefore, we extend the Harsanyi interaction to represent such an OR interaction to disentangle the feature component. Experiments show a clear correspondence between each feature component and the generation of specific image regions.

- **Summary**: In this work, we address the real-world, challenging task of out-of-context misinformation detection, where a real image is paired with an incorrect caption for creating fake news. Existing approaches for this task assume the availability of large amounts of labeled data, which is often impractical in real-world, since it requires extensive manual intervention and domain expertise. In contrast, since obtaining a large corpus of unlabeled image-text pairs is much easier, here, we propose a semi-supervised protocol, where the model has access to a limited number of labeled image-text pairs and a large corpus of unlabeled pairs. Additionally, the occurrence of fake news being much lesser compared to the real ones, the datasets tend to be highly imbalanced, thus making the task even more challenging. Towards this goal, we propose a novel framework, Consensus from Vision-Language Models (CoVLM), which generates robust pseudo-labels for unlabeled pairs using thresholds derived from the labeled data. This approach can automatically determine the right threshold parameters of the model for selecting the confident pseudo-labels. Experimental results on benchmark datasets across challenging conditions and comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant progress in recognizing visual elements and generating descriptive text in image-captioning tasks. However, their improved performance comes from increased computational burden and inference latency. Early Exit (EE) strategies can be used to enhance their efficiency, but their adaptation presents challenges in image captioning as it requires varying levels of semantic information for accurate predictions. To overcome this, we introduce CAPEEN to improve the performance of EE strategies using knowledge distillation. Inference in CAPEEN is completed at intermediary layers if prediction confidence exceeds a predefined value learned from the training data. To account for real-world deployments, where target distributions could drift from that of training samples, we introduce a variant A-CAPEEN to adapt the thresholds on the fly using Multiarmed bandits framework. Experiments on the MS COCO and Flickr30k datasets show that CAPEEN gains speedup of 1.77x while maintaining competitive performance compared to the final layer, and A-CAPEEN additionally offers robustness against distortions.

- **Summary**: The UNet architecture has transformed image segmentation. UNet's versatility and accuracy have driven its widespread adoption, significantly advancing fields reliant on machine learning problems with images. In this work, we give a clear and concise mathematical explanation of UNet. We explain what is the meaning and function of each of the components of UNet. We will show that UNet is solving a control problem. We decompose the control variables using multigrid methods. Then, operator-splitting techniques is used to solve the problem, whose architecture exactly recovers the UNet architecture. Our result shows that UNet is a one-step operator-splitting algorithm for the control problem.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated impressive achievements in diversity and aesthetics but struggle to generate images with legible visual texts. Existing backbone models have limitations such as misspelling, failing to generate texts, and lack of support for Chinese text, but their development shows promising potential. In this paper, we propose a series of methods, aiming to empower backbone models to generate visual texts in English and Chinese. We first conduct a preliminary study revealing that Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and the insufficient learning of cross-attention modules restrict the performance of the backbone models. Based on these observations, we make the following improvements: (1) We design a mixed granularity input strategy to provide more suitable text representations; (2) We propose to augment the conventional training objective with three glyph-aware training losses, which enhance the learning of cross-attention modules and encourage the model to focus on visual texts. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our methods can effectively empower backbone models to generate semantic relevant, aesthetically appealing, and accurate visual text images, while maintaining their fundamental image generation quality.

- **Summary**: Metal manufacturing often results in the production of defective products, leading to operational challenges. Since traditional manual inspection is time-consuming and resource-intensive, automatic solutions are needed. The study utilizes deep learning techniques to develop a model for detecting metal surface defects using Vision Transformers (ViTs). The proposed model focuses on the classification and localization of defects using a ViT for feature extraction. The architecture branches into two paths: classification and localization. The model must approach high classification accuracy while keeping the Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as low as possible in the localization process. Experimental results show that it can be utilized in the process of automated defects detection, improve operational efficiency, and reduce errors in metal manufacturing.

- **Summary**: The rapid expansion of video content across a variety of industries, including social media, education, entertainment, and surveillance, has made video summarization an essential field of study. The current work is a survey that explores the various approaches and methods created for video summarizing, emphasizing both abstractive and extractive strategies. The process of extractive summarization involves the identification of key frames or segments from the source video, utilizing methods such as shot boundary recognition, and clustering. On the other hand, abstractive summarization creates new content by getting the essential content from the video, using machine learning models like deep neural networks and natural language processing, reinforcement learning, attention mechanisms, generative adversarial networks, and multi-modal learning. We also include approaches that incorporate the two methodologies, along with discussing the uses and difficulties encountered in real-world implementations. The paper also covers the datasets used to benchmark these techniques. This review attempts to provide a state-of-the-art thorough knowledge of the current state and future directions of video summarization research.

- **Summary**: Previous work shows evidence that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) plays a crucial role in brain waste clearance processes, and that altered flow patterns are associated with various diseases of the central nervous system. In this study, we investigate the potential of deep learning to predict the distribution in human brain of a gadolinium-based CSF contrast agent (tracer) administered intrathecal. For this, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans taken at multiple time points before and after intrathecal injection were utilized. We propose a U-net-based supervised learning model to predict pixel-wise signal increases at their peak after 24 hours. Its performance is evaluated based on different tracer distribution stages provided during training, including predictions from baseline scans taken before injection. Our findings indicate that using imaging data from just the first two hours post-injection for training yields tracer flow predictions comparable to those trained with additional later-stage scans. The model was further validated by comparing ventricular reflux gradings provided by neuroradiologists, and inter-rater grading among medical experts and the model showed excellent agreement. Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning-based methods for CSF flow prediction, suggesting that fewer MRI scans could be sufficient for clinical analysis, which might significantly improve clinical efficiency, patient well-being, and lower healthcare costs.

- **Summary**: Nearest-neighbor search in large vector databases is crucial for various machine learning applications. This paper introduces a novel method using tensor-train (TT) low-rank tensor decomposition to efficiently represent point clouds and enable fast approximate nearest-neighbor searches. We propose a probabilistic interpretation and utilize density estimation losses like Sliced Wasserstein to train TT decompositions, resulting in robust point cloud compression. We reveal an inherent hierarchical structure within TT point clouds, facilitating efficient approximate nearest-neighbor searches. In our paper, we provide detailed insights into the methodology and conduct comprehensive comparisons with existing methods. We demonstrate its effectiveness in various scenarios, including out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problems and approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) search tasks.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models (DMs) are a class of generative models that allow sampling from a distribution learned over a training set. When applied to solving inverse imaging problems (IPs), the reverse sampling steps of DMs are typically modified to approximately sample from a measurement-conditioned distribution in the image space. However, these modifications may be unsuitable for certain settings (such as in the presence of measurement noise) and non-linear tasks, as they often struggle to correct errors from earlier sampling steps and generally require a large number of optimization and/or sampling steps. To address these challenges, we state three conditions for achieving measurement-consistent diffusion trajectories. Building on these conditions, we propose a new optimization-based sampling method that not only enforces the standard data manifold measurement consistency and forward diffusion consistency, as seen in previous studies, but also incorporates backward diffusion consistency that maintains a diffusion trajectory by optimizing over the input of the pre-trained model at every sampling step. By enforcing these conditions, either implicitly or explicitly, our sampler requires significantly fewer reverse steps. Therefore, we refer to our accelerated method as Step-wise Triple-Consistent Sampling (SITCOM). Compared to existing state-of-the-art baseline methods, under different levels of measurement noise, our extensive experiments across five linear and three non-linear image restoration tasks demonstrate that SITCOM achieves competitive or superior results in terms of standard image similarity metrics while requiring a significantly reduced run-time across all considered tasks.

- **Summary**: Vision models excel in image classification but struggle to generalize to unseen data, such as classifying images from unseen domains or discovering novel categories. In this paper, we explore the relationship between logical reasoning and deep learning generalization in visual classification. A logical regularization termed L-Reg is derived which bridges a logical analysis framework to image classification. Our work reveals that L-Reg reduces the complexity of the model in terms of the feature distribution and classifier weights. Specifically, we unveil the interpretability brought by L-Reg, as it enables the model to extract the salient features, such as faces to persons, for classification. Theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that L-Reg enhances generalization across various scenarios, including multi-domain generalization and generalized category discovery. In complex real-world scenarios where images span unknown classes and unseen domains, L-Reg consistently improves generalization, highlighting its practical efficacy.

- **Summary**: The purpose of this work is to investigate the soundness and utility of a neural network-based approach as a framework for exploring the impact of image enhancement techniques on visual cortex activation. In a preliminary study, we prepare a set of state-of-the-art brain encoding models, selected among the top 10 methods that participated in The Algonauts Project 2023 Challenge [16]. We analyze their ability to make valid predictions about the effects of various image enhancement techniques on neural responses. Given the impossibility of acquiring the actual data due to the high costs associated with brain imaging procedures, our investigation builds up on a series of experiments. Specifically, we analyze the ability of brain encoders to estimate the cerebral reaction to various augmentations by evaluating the response to augmentations targeting objects (i.e., faces and words) with known impact on specific areas. Moreover, we study the predicted activation in response to objects unseen during training, exploring the impact of semantically out-of-distribution stimuli. We provide relevant evidence for the generalization ability of the models forming the proposed framework, which appears to be promising for the identification of the optimal visual augmentation filter for a given task, model-driven design strategies as well as for AR and VR applications.

- **Summary**: Whole slide image (WSI) classification is a crucial problem for cancer diagnostics in clinics and hospitals. A WSI, acquired at gigapixel size, is commonly tiled into patches and processed by multiple-instance learning (MIL) models. Previous MIL-based models designed for this problem have only been evaluated on individual tasks for specific organs, and the ability to handle multiple tasks within a single model has not been investigated. In this study, we propose MECFormer, a generative Transformer-based model designed to handle multiple tasks within one model. To leverage the power of learning multiple tasks simultaneously and to enhance the model's effectiveness in focusing on each individual task, we introduce an Expert Consultation Network, a projection layer placed at the beginning of the Transformer-based model. Additionally, to enable flexible classification, autoregressive decoding is incorporated by a language decoder for WSI classification. Through extensive experiments on five datasets involving four different organs, one cancer classification task, and four cancer subtyping tasks, MECFormer demonstrates superior performance compared to individual state-of-the-art multiple-instance learning models.

- **Summary**: The recent development of Video-based Large Language Models (VideoLLMs), has significantly advanced video summarization by aligning video features and, in some cases, audio features with Large Language Models (LLMs). Each of these VideoLLMs possesses unique strengths and weaknesses. Many recent methods have required extensive fine-tuning to overcome the limitations of these models, which can be resource-intensive. In this work, we observe that the strengths of one VideoLLM can complement the weaknesses of another. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel video summarization framework inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, which operates as an inference-time algorithm without requiring any form of fine-tuning. Our approach integrates multiple VideoLLMs to generate comprehensive and coherent textual summaries. It effectively combines visual and audio content, provides detailed background descriptions, and excels at identifying keyframes, which enables more semantically meaningful retrieval compared to traditional computer vision approaches that rely solely on visual information, all without the need for additional fine-tuning. Moreover, the resulting summaries enhance performance in downstream tasks such as summary video generation, either through keyframe selection or in combination with text-to-image models. Our language-driven approach offers a semantically rich alternative to conventional methods and provides flexibility to incorporate newer VideoLLMs, enhancing adaptability and performance in video summarization tasks.

- **Summary**: Despite the great success of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they inevitably suffer from hallucination. As we know, both the visual encoder and the Large Language Model (LLM) decoder in LVLMs are Transformer-based, allowing the model to extract visual information and generate text outputs via attention mechanisms. We find that the attention distribution of LLM decoder on image tokens is highly consistent with the visual encoder and both distributions tend to focus on particular background tokens rather than the referred objects in the image. We attribute to the unexpected attention distribution to an inherent flaw in the visual encoder itself, which misguides LLMs to over emphasize the redundant information and generate object hallucination. To address the issue, we propose DAMRO, a novel training-free strategy that $D$ive into $A$ttention $M$echanism of LVLM to $R$educe $O$bject Hallucination. Specifically, our approach employs classification token (CLS) of ViT to filter out high-attention outlier tokens scattered in the background and then eliminate their influence during decoding stage. We evaluate our method on LVLMs including LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT and InstructBLIP, using various benchmarks such as POPE, CHAIR, MME and GPT-4V Aided Evaluation. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the impact of these outlier tokens, thus effectively alleviating the hallucination of LVLMs. The code of our method will be released soon.

- **Summary**: In recent advancements, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been fine-tuned on specific medical image datasets to address medical visual question answering (Med-VQA) tasks. However, this common approach of task-specific fine-tuning is costly and necessitates separate models for each downstream task, limiting the exploration of zero-shot capabilities. In this paper, we introduce MC-CoT, a modular cross-modal collaboration Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework designed to enhance the zero-shot performance of MLLMs in Med-VQA by leveraging large language models (LLMs). MC-CoT improves reasoning and information extraction by integrating medical knowledge and task-specific guidance, where LLM provides various complex medical reasoning chains and MLLM provides various observations of medical images based on instructions of the LLM. Our experiments on datasets such as SLAKE, VQA-RAD, and PATH-VQA show that MC-CoT surpasses standalone MLLMs and various multimodality CoT frameworks in recall rate and accuracy. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating background information and detailed guidance in addressing complex zero-shot Med-VQA tasks.

- **Summary**: Deep learning systems deployed in real-world applications often encounter data that is different from their in-distribution (ID). A reliable system should ideally abstain from making decisions in this out-of-distribution (OOD) setting. Existing state-of-the-art methods primarily focus on feature distances, such as k-th nearest neighbors and distances to decision boundaries, either overlooking or ineffectively using in-distribution statistics. In this work, we propose a novel angle-based metric for OOD detection that is computed relative to the in-distribution structure. We demonstrate that the angles between feature representations and decision boundaries, viewed from the mean of in-distribution features, serve as an effective discriminative factor between ID and OOD data. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmarks, reducing FPR95 by 0.88% and 7.74% respectively. Our score function is compatible with existing feature space regularization techniques, enhancing performance. Additionally, its scale-invariance property enables creating an ensemble of models for OOD detection via simple score summation.

- **Summary**: Accurate 3D scene representation and panoptic understanding are essential for applications such as virtual reality, robotics, and autonomous driving. However, challenges persist with existing methods, including precise 2D-to-3D mapping, handling complex scene characteristics like boundary ambiguity and varying scales, and mitigating noise in panoptic pseudo-labels. This paper introduces a novel perceptual-prior-guided 3D scene representation and panoptic understanding method, which reformulates panoptic understanding within neural radiance fields as a linear assignment problem involving 2D semantics and instance recognition. Perceptual information from pre-trained 2D panoptic segmentation models is incorporated as prior guidance, thereby synchronizing the learning processes of appearance, geometry, and panoptic understanding within neural radiance fields. An implicit scene representation and understanding model is developed to enhance generalization across indoor and outdoor scenes by extending the scale-encoded cascaded grids within a reparameterized domain distillation framework. This model effectively manages complex scene attributes and generates 3D-consistent scene representations and panoptic understanding outcomes for various scenes. Experiments and ablation studies under challenging conditions, including synthetic and real-world scenes, demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness in enhancing 3D scene representation and panoptic segmentation accuracy.

- **Summary**: We introduce UniMuMo, a unified multimodal model capable of taking arbitrary text, music, and motion data as input conditions to generate outputs across all three modalities. To address the lack of time-synchronized data, we align unpaired music and motion data based on rhythmic patterns to leverage existing large-scale music-only and motion-only datasets. By converting music, motion, and text into token-based representation, our model bridges these modalities through a unified encoder-decoder transformer architecture. To support multiple generation tasks within a single framework, we introduce several architectural improvements. We propose encoding motion with a music codebook, mapping motion into the same feature space as music. We introduce a music-motion parallel generation scheme that unifies all music and motion generation tasks into a single transformer decoder architecture with a single training task of music-motion joint generation. Moreover, the model is designed by fine-tuning existing pre-trained single-modality models, significantly reducing computational demands. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMuMo achieves competitive results on all unidirectional generation benchmarks across music, motion, and text modalities.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing (RS) imagery, requiring specialized satellites to collect and being difficult to annotate, suffers from data scarcity and class imbalance in certain spectrums. Due to data scarcity, training any large-scale RS models from scratch is unrealistic, and the alternative is to transfer pre-trained models by fine-tuning or a more data-efficient method LoRA. Due to class imbalance, transferred models exhibit strong bias, where features of the major class dominate over those of the minor class. In this paper, we propose debLoRA, a generic training approach that works with any LoRA variants to yield debiased features. It is an unsupervised learning approach that can diversify minor class features based on the shared attributes with major classes, where the attributes are obtained by a simple step of clustering. To evaluate it, we conduct extensive experiments in two transfer learning scenarios in the RS domain: from natural to optical RS images, and from optical RS to multi-spectrum RS images. We perform object classification and oriented object detection tasks on the optical RS dataset DOTA and the SAR dataset FUSRS. Results show that our debLoRA consistently surpasses prior arts across these RS adaptation settings, yielding up to 3.3 and 4.7 percentage points gains on the tail classes for natural to optical RS and optical RS to multi-spectrum RS adaptations, respectively, while preserving the performance on head classes, substantiating its efficacy and adaptability.

- **Summary**: In the field of 3D Human Pose Estimation from monocular videos, the presence of diverse occlusion types presents a formidable challenge. Prior research has made progress by harnessing spatial and temporal cues to infer 3D poses from 2D joint observations. This paper introduces a Dual Transformer Fusion (DTF) algorithm, a novel approach to obtain a holistic 3D pose estimation, even in the presence of severe occlusions. Confronting the issue of occlusion-induced missing joint data, we propose a temporal interpolation-based occlusion guidance mechanism. To enable precise 3D Human Pose Estimation, our approach leverages the innovative DTF architecture, which first generates a pair of intermediate views. Each intermediate-view undergoes spatial refinement through a self-refinement schema. Subsequently, these intermediate-views are fused to yield the final 3D human pose estimation. The entire system is end-to-end trainable. Through extensive experiments conducted on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets, our method's performance is rigorously evaluated. Notably, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on both datasets, yielding substantial improvements. The code is available here: https://github.com/MehwishG/DTF.

- **Summary**: The recent developments in deep learning led to the integration of natural language processing (NLP) with computer vision, resulting in powerful integrated Vision and Language Models (VLMs). Despite their remarkable capabilities, these models are frequently regarded as black boxes within the machine learning research community. This raises a critical question: which parts of an image correspond to specific segments of text, and how can we decipher these associations? Understanding these connections is essential for enhancing model transparency, interpretability, and trustworthiness. To answer this question, we present an image-text aligned human visual attention dataset that maps specific associations between image regions and corresponding text segments. We then compare the internal heatmaps generated by VL models with this dataset, allowing us to analyze and better understand the model's decision-making process. This approach aims to enhance model transparency, interpretability, and trustworthiness by providing insights into how these models align visual and linguistic information. We conducted a comprehensive study on text-guided visual saliency detection in these VL models. This study aims to understand how different models prioritize and focus on specific visual elements in response to corresponding text segments, providing deeper insights into their internal mechanisms and improving our ability to interpret their outputs.

- **Summary**: Blind face restoration methods have shown remarkable performance, particularly when trained on large-scale synthetic datasets with supervised learning. These datasets are often generated by simulating low-quality face images with a handcrafted image degradation pipeline. The models trained on such synthetic degradations, however, cannot deal with inputs of unseen degradations. In this paper, we address this issue by using only a set of input images, with unknown degradations and without ground truth targets, to fine-tune a restoration model that learns to map them to clean and contextually consistent outputs. We utilize a pre-trained diffusion model as a generative prior through which we generate high quality images from the natural image distribution while maintaining the input image content through consistency constraints. These generated images are then used as pseudo targets to fine-tune a pre-trained restoration model. Unlike many recent approaches that employ diffusion models at test time, we only do so during training and thus maintain an efficient inference-time performance. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach can consistently improve the perceptual quality of pre-trained blind face restoration models while maintaining great consistency with the input contents. Our best model also achieves the state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly used in impactful real-life applications. As such, there is a growing need to audit these models to ensure that they generate desirable, task-appropriate images. However, systematically inspecting the associations between prompts and generated content in a human-understandable way remains challenging. To address this, we propose \emph{Concept2Concept}, a framework where we characterize conditional distributions of vision language models using interpretable concepts and metrics that can be defined in terms of these concepts. This characterization allows us to use our framework to audit models and prompt-datasets. To demonstrate, we investigate several case studies of conditional distributions of prompts, such as user defined distributions or empirical, real world distributions. Lastly, we implement Concept2Concept as an open-source interactive visualization tool facilitating use by non-technical end-users.

- **Summary**: The pursuit of enhanced breast cancer detection and monitoring techniques is a paramount healthcare objective, driving the need for innovative imaging technologies and diagnostic approaches. This study introduces a novel multi-tiered self-contrastive model tailored for the application of microwave radiometry (MWR) breast cancer detection. Our approach encompasses three distinct models: Local-MWR (L-MWR), Regional-MWR (R-MWR), and Global-MWR (G-MWR), each engineered to analyze varying sub-regional comparisons within the breasts. These models are cohesively integrated through the Joint-MWR (J-MWR) network, which leverages the self-contrastive data generated at each analytical level to enhance detection capabilities. Employing a dataset comprising 4,932 cases of female patients, our research showcases the effectiveness of our proposed models. Notably, the J-MWR model distinguishes itself by achieving a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.74 $\pm$ 0.018, surpassing existing MWR neural networks and contrastive methods. These results highlight the significant potential of self-contrastive learning techniques in improving both the diagnostic accuracy and generalizability of MWR-based breast cancer detection processes. Such advancements hold considerable promise for further investigative and clinical endeavors. The source code is available at: https://github.com/cgalaz01/self_contrastive_mwr

- **Summary**: We present a novel-view rendering algorithm, Mode-GS, for ground-robot trajectory datasets. Our approach is based on using anchored Gaussian splats, which are designed to overcome the limitations of existing 3D Gaussian splatting algorithms. Prior neural rendering methods suffer from severe splat drift due to scene complexity and insufficient multi-view observation, and can fail to fix splats on the true geometry in ground-robot datasets. Our method integrates pixel-aligned anchors from monocular depths and generates Gaussian splats around these anchors using residual-form Gaussian decoders. To address the inherent scale ambiguity of monocular depth, we parameterize anchors with per-view depth-scales and employ scale-consistent depth loss for online scale calibration. Our method results in improved rendering performance, based on PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, in ground scenes with free trajectory patterns, and achieves state-of-the-art rendering performance on the R3LIVE odometry dataset and the Tanks and Temples dataset.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in medical image segmentation. However, despite its promise, deep learning has many challenges in practice due to its inability to effectively transition to unseen domains, caused by the inherent data distribution shift and the lack of manual annotations to guide domain adaptation. To tackle this problem, we present an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method named AdaptDiff that enables a retinal vessel segmentation network trained on fundus photography (FP) to produce satisfactory results on unseen modalities (e.g., OCT-A) without any manual labels. For all our target domains, we first adopt a segmentation model trained on the source domain to create pseudo-labels. With these pseudo-labels, we train a conditional semantic diffusion probabilistic model to represent the target domain distribution. Experimentally, we show that even with low quality pseudo-labels, the diffusion model can still capture the conditional semantic information. Subsequently, we sample on the target domain with binary vessel masks from the source domain to get paired data, i.e., target domain synthetic images conditioned on the binary vessel map. Finally, we fine-tune the pre-trained segmentation network using the synthetic paired data to mitigate the domain gap. We assess the effectiveness of AdaptDiff on seven publicly available datasets across three distinct modalities. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in segmentation performance across all unseen datasets. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/DeweiHu/AdaptDiff.

- **Summary**: Seamless integration of virtual and physical worlds in augmented reality benefits from the system semantically "understanding" the physical environment. AR research has long focused on the potential of context awareness, demonstrating novel capabilities that leverage the semantics in the 3D environment for various object-level interactions. Meanwhile, the computer vision community has made leaps in neural vision-language understanding to enhance environment perception for autonomous tasks. In this work, we introduce a multimodal 3D object representation that unifies both semantic and linguistic knowledge with the geometric representation, enabling user-guided machine learning involving physical objects. We first present a fast multimodal 3D reconstruction pipeline that brings linguistic understanding to AR by fusing CLIP vision-language features into the environment and object models. We then propose "in-situ" machine learning, which, in conjunction with the multimodal representation, enables new tools and interfaces for users to interact with physical spaces and objects in a spatially and linguistically meaningful manner. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed system through two real-world AR applications on Magic Leap 2: a) spatial search in physical environments with natural language and b) an intelligent inventory system that tracks object changes over time. We also make our full implementation and demo data available at (https://github.com/cy-xu/spatially_aware_AI) to encourage further exploration and research in spatially aware AI.
