- **Summary**: Accurate diagnosis of ocular surface diseases is critical in optometry and ophthalmology, which hinge on integrating clinical data sources (e.g., meibography imaging and clinical metadata). Traditional human assessments lack precision in quantifying clinical observations, while current machine-based methods often treat diagnoses as multi-class classification problems, limiting the diagnoses to a predefined closed-set of curated answers without reasoning the clinical relevance of each variable to the diagnosis. To tackle these challenges, we introduce an innovative multi-modal diagnostic pipeline (MDPipe) by employing large language models (LLMs) for ocular surface disease diagnosis. We first employ a visual translator to interpret meibography images by converting them into quantifiable morphology data, facilitating their integration with clinical metadata and enabling the communication of nuanced medical insight to LLMs. To further advance this communication, we introduce a LLM-based summarizer to contextualize the insight from the combined morphology and clinical metadata, and generate clinical report summaries. Finally, we refine the LLMs' reasoning ability with domain-specific insight from real-life clinician diagnoses. Our evaluation across diverse ocular surface disease diagnosis benchmarks demonstrates that MDPipe outperforms existing standards, including GPT-4, and provides clinically sound rationales for diagnoses.

- **Summary**: Place recognition is a crucial module to ensure autonomous vehicles obtain usable localization information in GPS-denied environments. In recent years, multimodal place recognition methods have gained increasing attention due to their ability to overcome the weaknesses of unimodal sensor systems by leveraging complementary information from different modalities. However, challenges arise from the necessity of harmonizing data across modalities and exploiting the spatio-temporal correlations between them sufficiently. In this paper, we propose a 3D Gaussian Splatting-based multimodal place recognition neural network dubbed GSPR. It explicitly combines multi-view RGB images and LiDAR point clouds into a spatio-temporally unified scene representation with the proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. A network composed of 3D graph convolution and transformer is designed to extract high-level spatio-temporal features and global descriptors from the Gaussian scenes for place recognition. We evaluate our method on the nuScenes dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively leverage complementary strengths of both multi-view cameras and LiDAR, achieving SOTA place recognition performance while maintaining solid generalization ability. Our open-source code is available at https://github.com/QiZS-BIT/GSPR.



### RadGazeGen: Radiomics and Gaze-guided Medical Image Generation using Diffusion Models

- **Summary**: In this work, we present RadGazeGen, a novel framework for integrating experts' eye gaze patterns and radiomic feature maps as controls to text-to-image diffusion models for high fidelity medical image generation. Despite the recent success of text-to-image diffusion models, text descriptions are often found to be inadequate and fail to convey detailed disease-specific information to these models to generate clinically accurate images. The anatomy, disease texture patterns, and location of the disease are extremely important to generate realistic images; moreover the fidelity of image generation can have significant implications in downstream tasks involving disease diagnosis or treatment repose assessment. Hence, there is a growing need to carefully define the controls used in diffusion models for medical image generation. Eye gaze patterns of radiologists are important visuo-cognitive information, indicative of subtle disease patterns and spatial location. Radiomic features further provide important subvisual cues regarding disease phenotype. In this work, we propose to use these gaze patterns in combination with standard radiomics descriptors, as controls, to generate anatomically correct and disease-aware medical images. RadGazeGen is evaluated for image generation quality and diversity on the REFLACX dataset. To demonstrate clinical applicability, we also show classification performance on the generated images from the CheXpert test set (n=500) and long-tailed learning performance on the MIMIC-CXR-LT test set (n=23550).

- **Summary**: Social dynamics in close human interactions pose significant challenges for Human Mesh Estimation (HME), particularly due to the complexity of physical contacts and the scarcity of training data. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel data generation method that utilizes Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) to annotate contact maps which guide test-time optimization to produce paired image and pseudo-ground truth meshes. This methodology not only alleviates the annotation burden but also enables the assembly of a comprehensive dataset specifically tailored for close interactions in HME. Our Ask Pose Unite (APU) dataset, comprising over 6.2k human mesh pairs in contact covering diverse interaction types, is curated from images depicting naturalistic person-to-person scenes. We empirically show that using our dataset to train a diffusion-based contact prior, used as guidance during optimization, improves mesh estimation on unseen interactions. Our work addresses longstanding challenges of data scarcity for close interactions in HME enhancing the field's capabilities of handling complex interaction scenarios.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot (ZS) 3D anomaly detection is a crucial yet unexplored field that addresses scenarios where target 3D training samples are unavailable due to practical concerns like privacy protection. This paper introduces PointAD, a novel approach that transfers the strong generalization capabilities of CLIP for recognizing 3D anomalies on unseen objects. PointAD provides a unified framework to comprehend 3D anomalies from both points and pixels. In this framework, PointAD renders 3D anomalies into multiple 2D renderings and projects them back into 3D space. To capture the generic anomaly semantics into PointAD, we propose hybrid representation learning that optimizes the learnable text prompts from 3D and 2D through auxiliary point clouds. The collaboration optimization between point and pixel representations jointly facilitates our model to grasp underlying 3D anomaly patterns, contributing to detecting and segmenting anomalies of unseen diverse 3D objects. Through the alignment of 3D and 2D space, our model can directly integrate RGB information, further enhancing the understanding of 3D anomalies in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments show the superiority of PointAD in ZS 3D anomaly detection across diverse unseen objects.

- **Summary**: This paper analyzes the impact of causal manner in the text encoder of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, which can lead to information bias and loss. Previous works have focused on addressing the issues through the denoising process. However, there is no research discussing how text embedding contributes to T2I models, especially when generating more than one object. In this paper, we share a comprehensive analysis of text embedding: i) how text embedding contributes to the generated images and ii) why information gets lost and biases towards the first-mentioned object. Accordingly, we propose a simple but effective text embedding balance optimization method, which is training-free, with an improvement of 90.05% on information balance in stable diffusion. Furthermore, we propose a new automatic evaluation metric that quantifies information loss more accurately than existing methods, achieving 81% concordance with human assessments. This metric effectively measures the presence and accuracy of objects, addressing the limitations of current distribution scores like CLIP's text-image similarities.

- **Summary**: The advancement of autonomous driving is increasingly reliant on high-quality annotated datasets, especially in the task of 3D occupancy prediction, where the occupancy labels require dense 3D annotation with significant human effort. In this paper, we propose SyntheOcc, which denotes a diffusion model that Synthesize photorealistic and geometric-controlled images by conditioning Occupancy labels in driving scenarios. This yields an unlimited amount of diverse, annotated, and controllable datasets for applications like training perception models and simulation. SyntheOcc addresses the critical challenge of how to efficiently encode 3D geometric information as conditional input to a 2D diffusion model. Our approach innovatively incorporates 3D semantic multi-plane images (MPIs) to provide comprehensive and spatially aligned 3D scene descriptions for conditioning. As a result, SyntheOcc can generate photorealistic multi-view images and videos that faithfully align with the given geometric labels (semantics in 3D voxel space). Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of SyntheOcc on the nuScenes dataset prove its effectiveness in generating controllable occupancy datasets that serve as an effective data augmentation to perception models.

- **Summary**: This study introduces a new framework for 3D person re-identification (re-ID) that leverages readily available high-resolution texture data in 3D reconstruction to improve the performance and explainability of the person re-ID task. We propose a method to emphasize texture in 3D person re-ID models by incorporating UVTexture mapping, which better differentiates human subjects. Our approach uniquely combines UVTexture and its heatmaps with 3D models to visualize and explain the person re-ID process. In particular, the visualization and explanation are achieved through activation maps and attribute-based attention maps, which highlight the important regions and features contributing to the person re-ID decision. Our contributions include: (1) a novel technique for emphasizing texture in 3D models using UVTexture processing, (2) an innovative method for explicating person re-ID matches through a combination of 3D models and UVTexture mapping, and (3) achieving state-of-the-art performance in 3D person re-ID. We ensure the reproducibility of our results by making all data, codes, and models publicly available.

- **Summary**: Along with the advancements in artificial intelligence technologies, image-to-point-cloud registration (I2P) techniques have made significant strides. Nevertheless, the dimensional differences in the features of points cloud (three-dimension) and image (two-dimension) continue to pose considerable challenges to their development. The primary challenge resides in the inability to leverage the features of one modality to augment those of another, thereby complicating the alignment of features within the latent space. To address this challenge, we propose an image-to-point-cloud method named as TFCT-I2P. Initially, we introduce a Three-Stream Fusion Network (TFN), which integrates color information from images with structural information from point clouds, facilitating the alignment of features from both modalities. Subsequently, to effectively mitigate patch-level misalignments introduced by the inclusion of color information, we design a Color-Aware Transformer (CAT). Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 7Scenes, RGB-D Scenes V2, ScanNet V2, and a self-collected dataset. The results demonstrate that TFCT-I2P surpasses state-of-the-art methods by 1.5% in Inlier Ratio, 0.4% in Feature Matching Recall, and 5.4% in Registration Recall. Therefore, we believe that the proposed TFCT-I2P contributes to the advancement of I2P registration.

- **Summary**: Smart focal-plane and in-chip image processing has emerged as a crucial technology for vision-enabled embedded systems with energy efficiency and privacy. However, the lack of special datasets providing examples of the data that these neuromorphic sensors compute to convey visual information has hindered the adoption of these promising technologies. Neuromorphic imager variants, including event-based sensors, produce various representations such as streams of pixel addresses representing time and locations of intensity changes in the focal plane, temporal-difference data, data sifted/thresholded by temporal differences, image data after applying spatial transformations, optical flow data, and/or statistical representations. To address the critical barrier to entry, we provide an annotated, temporal-threshold-based vision dataset specifically designed for face detection tasks derived from the same videos used for Aff-Wild2. By offering multiple threshold levels (e.g., 4, 8, 12, and 16), this dataset allows for comprehensive evaluation and optimization of state-of-the-art neural architectures under varying conditions and settings compared to traditional methods. The accompanying tool flow for generating event data from raw videos further enhances accessibility and usability. We anticipate that this resource will significantly support the development of robust vision systems based on smart sensors that can process based on temporal-difference thresholds, enabling more accurate and efficient object detection and localization and ultimately promoting the broader adoption of low-power, neuromorphic imaging technologies. To support further research, we publicly released the dataset at \url{https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/bw2e-dj78}.

- **Summary**: X-ray image-based medical report generation (MRG) is a pivotal area in artificial intelligence which can significantly reduce diagnostic burdens and patient wait times. Despite significant progress, we believe that the task has reached a bottleneck due to the limited benchmark datasets and the existing large models' insufficient capability enhancements in this specialized domain. Specifically, the recently released CheXpert Plus dataset lacks comparative evaluation algorithms and their results, providing only the dataset itself. This situation makes the training, evaluation, and comparison of subsequent algorithms challenging. Thus, we conduct a comprehensive benchmarking of existing mainstream X-ray report generation models and large language models (LLMs), on the CheXpert Plus dataset. We believe that the proposed benchmark can provide a solid comparative basis for subsequent algorithms and serve as a guide for researchers to quickly grasp the state-of-the-art models in this field. More importantly, we propose a large model for the X-ray image report generation using a multi-stage pre-training strategy, including self-supervised autoregressive generation and Xray-report contrastive learning, and supervised fine-tuning. Extensive experimental results indicate that the autoregressive pre-training based on Mamba effectively encodes X-ray images, and the image-text contrastive pre-training further aligns the feature spaces, achieving better experimental results.

- **Summary**: Image restoration and spectral reconstruction are longstanding computer vision tasks. Currently, CNN-transformer hybrid models provide state-of-the-art performance for these tasks. The key common ingredient in the architectural designs of these models is Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). We first show that CSA is an overall low-rank operation. Then, we propose an instance-Guided Low-rank Multi-Head selfattention (GLMHA) to replace the CSA for a considerable computational gain while closely retaining the original model performance. Unique to the proposed GLMHA is its ability to provide computational gain for both short and long input sequences. In particular, the gain is in terms of both Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) and parameter count reduction. This is in contrast to the existing popular computational complexity reduction techniques, e.g., Linformer, Performer, and Reformer, for whom FLOPs overpower the efficient design tricks for the shorter input sequences. Moreover, parameter reduction remains unaccounted for in the existing methods.We perform an extensive evaluation for the tasks of spectral reconstruction from RGB images, spectral reconstruction from snapshot compressive imaging, motion deblurring, and image deraining by enhancing the best-performing models with our GLMHA. Our results show up to a 7.7 Giga FLOPs reduction with 370K fewer parameters required to closely retain the original performance of the best-performing models that employ CSA.



### Seamless Augmented Reality Integration in Arthroscopy: A Pipeline for Articular Reconstruction and Guidance

- **Summary**: Arthroscopy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used to diagnose and treat joint problems. The clinical workflow of arthroscopy typically involves inserting an arthroscope into the joint through a small incision, during which surgeons navigate and operate largely by relying on their visual assessment through the arthroscope. However, the arthroscope's restricted field of view and lack of depth perception pose challenges in navigating complex articular structures and achieving surgical precision during procedures. Aiming at enhancing intraoperative awareness, we present a robust pipeline that incorporates simultaneous localization and mapping, depth estimation, and 3D Gaussian splatting to realistically reconstruct intra-articular structures solely based on monocular arthroscope video. Extending 3D reconstruction to Augmented Reality (AR) applications, our solution offers AR assistance for articular notch measurement and annotation anchoring in a human-in-the-loop manner. Compared to traditional Structure-from-Motion and Neural Radiance Field-based methods, our pipeline achieves dense 3D reconstruction and competitive rendering fidelity with explicit 3D representation in 7 minutes on average. When evaluated on four phantom datasets, our method achieves RMSE = 2.21mm reconstruction error, PSNR = 32.86 and SSIM = 0.89 on average. Because our pipeline enables AR reconstruction and guidance directly from monocular arthroscopy without any additional data and/or hardware, our solution may hold the potential for enhancing intraoperative awareness and facilitating surgical precision in arthroscopy. Our AR measurement tool achieves accuracy within 1.59 +/- 1.81mm and the AR annotation tool achieves a mIoU of 0.721.

- **Summary**: Enabling generative models to decompose visual concepts from a single image is a complex and challenging problem. In this paper, we study a new and challenging task, customized concept decomposition, wherein the objective is to leverage diffusion models to decompose a single image and generate visual concepts from various perspectives. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage framework, CusConcept (short for Customized Visual Concept Decomposition), to extract customized visual concept embedding vectors that can be embedded into prompts for text-to-image generation. In the first stage, CusConcept employs a vocabulary-guided concept decomposition mechanism to build vocabularies along human-specified conceptual axes. The decomposed concepts are obtained by retrieving corresponding vocabularies and learning anchor weights. In the second stage, joint concept refinement is performed to enhance the fidelity and quality of generated images. We further curate an evaluation benchmark for assessing the performance of the open-world concept decomposition task. Our approach can effectively generate high-quality images of the decomposed concepts and produce related lexical predictions as secondary outcomes. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CusConcept.

- **Summary**: The rise of short-form videos on platforms like TikTok has brought new challenges in safeguarding young viewers from inappropriate content. Traditional moderation methods often fall short in handling the vast and rapidly changing landscape of user-generated videos, increasing the risk of children encountering harmful material. This paper introduces TikGuard, a transformer-based deep learning approach aimed at detecting and flagging content unsuitable for children on TikTok. By using a specially curated dataset, TikHarm, and leveraging advanced video classification techniques, TikGuard achieves an accuracy of 86.7%, showing a notable improvement over existing methods in similar contexts. While direct comparisons are limited by the uniqueness of the TikHarm dataset, TikGuard's performance highlights its potential in enhancing content moderation, contributing to a safer online experience for minors. This study underscores the effectiveness of transformer models in video classification and sets a foundation for future research in this area.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing 3D coronary arteries is important for coronary artery disease diagnosis, treatment planning and operation navigation. Traditional reconstruction techniques often require many projections, while reconstruction from sparse-view X-ray projections is a potential way of reducing radiation dose. However, the extreme sparsity of coronary arteries in a 3D volume and ultra-limited number of projections pose significant challenges for efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction. To this end, we propose 3DGR-CAR, a 3D Gaussian Representation for Coronary Artery Reconstruction from ultra-sparse X-ray projections. We leverage 3D Gaussian representation to avoid the inefficiency caused by the extreme sparsity of coronary artery data and propose a Gaussian center predictor to overcome the noisy Gaussian initialization from ultra-sparse view projections. The proposed scheme enables fast and accurate 3D coronary artery reconstruction with only 2 views. Experimental results on two datasets indicate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other methods in terms of voxel accuracy and visual quality of coronary arteries. The code will be available in https://github.com/windrise/3DGR-CAR.

- **Summary**: The scarcity of annotated medical images is a major bottleneck in developing learning models for medical image analysis. Hence, recent studies have focused on pretrained models with fewer annotation requirements that can be fine-tuned for various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches are mainly 3D adaptions of 2D approaches ill-suited for 3D medical imaging data. Motivated by this gap, we propose novel domain-aware multi-task learning tasks to pretrain a 3D Swin Transformer for brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our method considers the domain knowledge in brain MRI by incorporating brain anatomy and morphology as well as standard pretext tasks adapted for 3D imaging in a contrastive learning setting. We pretrain our model using large-scale brain MRI data of 13,687 samples spanning several large-scale databases. Our method outperforms existing supervised and self-supervised methods in three downstream tasks of Alzheimer's disease classification, Parkinson's disease classification, and age prediction tasks. The ablation study of the proposed pretext tasks shows the effectiveness of our pretext tasks.

- **Summary**: Photo-realistic image restoration algorithms are typically evaluated by distortion measures (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and by perceptual quality measures (e.g., FID, NIQE), where the desire is to attain the lowest possible distortion without compromising on perceptual quality. To achieve this goal, current methods typically attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.

- **Summary**: In this study, we consider the problem of predicting task success for open-vocabulary manipulation by a manipulator, based on instruction sentences and egocentric images before and after manipulation. Conventional approaches, including multimodal large language models (MLLMs), often fail to appropriately understand detailed characteristics of objects and/or subtle changes in the position of objects. We propose Contrastive $\lambda$-Repformer, which predicts task success for table-top manipulation tasks by aligning images with instruction sentences. Our method integrates the following three key types of features into a multi-level aligned representation: features that preserve local image information; features aligned with natural language; and features structured through natural language. This allows the model to focus on important changes by looking at the differences in the representation between two images. We evaluate Contrastive $\lambda$-Repformer on a dataset based on a large-scale standard dataset, the RT-1 dataset, and on a physical robot platform. The results show that our approach outperformed existing approaches including MLLMs. Our best model achieved an improvement of 8.66 points in accuracy compared to the representative MLLM-based model.

- **Summary**: There has been exciting progress in generating images from natural language or layout conditions. However, these methods struggle to faithfully reproduce complex scenes due to the insufficient modeling of multiple objects and their relationships. To address this issue, we leverage the scene graph, a powerful structured representation, for complex image generation. Different from the previous works that directly use scene graphs for generation, we employ the generative capabilities of variational autoencoders and diffusion models in a generalizable manner, compositing diverse disentangled visual clues from scene graphs. Specifically, we first propose a Semantics-Layout Variational AutoEncoder (SL-VAE) to jointly derive (layouts, semantics) from the input scene graph, which allows a more diverse and reasonable generation in a one-to-many mapping. We then develop a Compositional Masked Attention (CMA) integrated with a diffusion model, incorporating (layouts, semantics) with fine-grained attributes as generation guidance. To further achieve graph manipulation while keeping the visual content consistent, we introduce a Multi-Layered Sampler (MLS) for an "isolated" image editing effect. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms recent competitors based on text, layout, or scene graph, in terms of generation rationality and controllability.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces an innovative approach to Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP) area in the specialized context of radiograph representation learning. While conventional methods frequently merge textual annotations into unified reports, we acknowledge the intrinsic hierarchical relationship between the findings and impression section in radiograph datasets. To establish a targeted correspondence between images and texts, we propose a novel HybridMED framework to align global-level visual representations with impression and token-level visual representations with findings. Moreover, our framework incorporates a generation decoder that employs two proxy tasks, responsible for generating the impression from (1) images, via a captioning branch, and (2) findings, through a summarization branch. Additionally, knowledge distillation is leveraged to facilitate the training process. Experiments on the MIMIC-CXR dataset reveal that our summarization branch effectively distills knowledge to the captioning branch, enhancing model performance without significantly increasing parameter requirements due to the shared self-attention and feed-forward architecture.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Current co-speech motion generation approaches usually focus on upper body gestures following speech contents only, while lacking supporting the elaborate control of synergistic full-body motion based on text prompts, such as talking while walking. The major challenges lie in 1) the existing speech-to-motion datasets only involve highly limited full-body motions, making a wide range of common human activities out of training distribution; 2) these datasets also lack annotated user prompts. To address these challenges, we propose SynTalker, which utilizes the off-the-shelf text-to-motion dataset as an auxiliary for supplementing the missing full-body motion and prompts. The core technical contributions are two-fold. One is the multi-stage training process which obtains an aligned embedding space of motion, speech, and prompts despite the significant distributional mismatch in motion between speech-to-motion and text-to-motion datasets. Another is the diffusion-based conditional inference process, which utilizes the separate-then-combine strategy to realize fine-grained control of local body parts. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify that our approach supports precise and flexible control of synergistic full-body motion generation based on both speeches and user prompts, which is beyond the ability of existing approaches.

- **Summary**: Accurate semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is critical for various Earth observation applications, such as land cover mapping, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, individual data sources often present limitations for this task. Very High Resolution (VHR) aerial imagery provides rich spatial details but cannot capture temporal information about land cover changes. Conversely, Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) capture temporal dynamics, such as seasonal variations in vegetation, but with limited spatial resolution, making it difficult to distinguish fine-scale objects. This paper proposes a late fusion deep learning model (LF-DLM) for semantic segmentation that leverages the complementary strengths of both VHR aerial imagery and SITS. The proposed model consists of two independent deep learning branches. One branch integrates detailed textures from aerial imagery captured by UNetFormer with a Multi-Axis Vision Transformer (MaxViT) backbone. The other branch captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics from the Sentinel-2 satellite image time series using a U-Net with Temporal Attention Encoder (U-TAE). This approach leads to state-of-the-art results on the FLAIR dataset, a large-scale benchmark for land cover segmentation using multi-source optical imagery. The findings highlight the importance of multi-modality fusion in improving the accuracy and robustness of semantic segmentation in remote sensing applications.

- **Summary**: We present a novel dataset aimed at advancing danger analysis and assessment by addressing the challenge of quantifying danger in video content and identifying how human-like a Large Language Model (LLM) evaluator is for the same. This is achieved by compiling a collection of 100 YouTube videos featuring various events. Each video is annotated by human participants who provided danger ratings on a scale from 0 (no danger to humans) to 10 (life-threatening), with precise timestamps indicating moments of heightened danger. Additionally, we leverage LLMs to independently assess the danger levels in these videos using video summaries. We introduce Mean Squared Error (MSE) scores for multimodal meta-evaluation of the alignment between human and LLM danger assessments. Our dataset not only contributes a new resource for danger assessment in video content but also demonstrates the potential of LLMs in achieving human-like evaluations.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Capturing real-world 3D spaces as point clouds is efficient and descriptive, but it comes with sensor errors and lacks object parametrization. These limitations render point clouds unsuitable for various real-world applications, such as robot programming, without extensive post-processing (e.g., outlier removal, semantic segmentation). On the other hand, CAD modeling provides high-quality, parametric representations of 3D space with embedded semantic data, but requires manual component creation that is time-consuming and costly. To address these challenges, we propose a novel solution that combines the strengths of both approaches. Our method for 3D workcell sketching from point clouds allows users to refine raw point clouds using an Augmented Reality (AR) interface that leverages their knowledge and the real-world 3D environment. By utilizing a toolbox and an AR-enabled pointing device, users can enhance point cloud accuracy based on the device's position in 3D space. We validate our approach by comparing it with ground truth models, demonstrating that it achieves a mean error within 1cm - significant improvement over standard LiDAR scanner apps.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in generative models have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, enabling the creation of highly-realistic and detailed images. In this study, we propose a novel Mask Conditional Text-to-Image Generative Model (MCGM) that leverages the power of conditional diffusion models to generate pictures with specific poses. Our model builds upon the success of the Break-a-scene [1] model in generating new scenes using a single image with multiple subjects and incorporates a mask embedding injection that allows the conditioning of the generation process. By introducing this additional level of control, MCGM offers a flexible and intuitive approach for generating specific poses for one or more subjects learned from a single image, empowering users to influence the output based on their requirements. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in generating high-quality images that meet predefined mask conditions and improving the current Break-a-scene generative model.

- **Summary**: Explainability in artificial intelligence is crucial for restoring trust, particularly in areas like face forgery detection, where viewers often struggle to distinguish between real and fabricated content. Vision and Large Language Models (VLLM) bridge computer vision and natural language, offering numerous applications driven by strong common-sense reasoning. Despite their success in various tasks, the potential of vision and language remains underexplored in face forgery detection, where they hold promise for enhancing explainability by leveraging the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of language to analyse fine-grained manipulation areas. As such, there is a need for a methodology that converts face forgery detection to a Visual Question Answering (VQA) task to systematically and fairly evaluate these capabilities. Previous efforts for unified benchmarks in deepfake detection have focused on the simpler binary task, overlooking evaluation protocols for fine-grained detection and text-generative models. We propose a multi-staged approach that diverges from the traditional binary decision paradigm to address this gap. In the first stage, we assess the models' performance on the binary task and their sensitivity to given instructions using several prompts. In the second stage, we delve deeper into fine-grained detection by identifying areas of manipulation in a multiple-choice VQA setting. In the third stage, we convert the fine-grained detection to an open-ended question and compare several matching strategies for the multi-label classification task. Finally, we qualitatively evaluate the fine-grained responses of the VLLMs included in the benchmark. We apply our benchmark to several popular models, providing a detailed comparison of binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended VQA evaluation across seven datasets. \url{https://nickyfot.github.io/hitchhickersguide.github.io/}

- **Summary**: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is pivotal in robotics, with photorealistic scene reconstruction emerging as a key challenge. To address this, we introduce Computational Alignment for Real-Time Gaussian Splatting SLAM (CaRtGS), a novel method enhancing the efficiency and quality of photorealistic scene reconstruction in real-time environments. Leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), CaRtGS achieves superior rendering quality and processing speed, which is crucial for scene photorealistic reconstruction. Our approach tackles computational misalignment in Gaussian Splatting SLAM (GS-SLAM) through an adaptive strategy that optimizes training, addresses long-tail optimization, and refines densification. Experiments on Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets demonstrate CaRtGS's effectiveness in achieving high-fidelity rendering with fewer Gaussian primitives. This work propels SLAM towards real-time, photorealistic dense rendering, significantly advancing photorealistic scene representation. For the benefit of the research community, we release the code on our project website: https://dapengfeng.github.io/cartgs.

- **Summary**: This research focuses on the development of a drone equipped with pruning tools and a stereo vision camera to accurately detect and measure the spatial positions of tree branches. YOLO is employed for branch segmentation, while two depth estimation approaches, monocular and stereo, are investigated. In comparison to SGBM, deep learning techniques produce more refined and accurate depth maps. In the absence of ground-truth data, a fine-tuning process using deep neural networks is applied to approximate optimal depth values. This methodology facilitates precise branch detection and distance measurement, addressing critical challenges in the automation of pruning operations. The results demonstrate notable advancements in both accuracy and efficiency, underscoring the potential of deep learning to drive innovation and enhance automation in the agricultural sector.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose to pre-train audio encoders using synthetic patterns instead of real audio data. Our proposed framework consists of two key elements. The first one is Masked Autoencoder (MAE), a self-supervised learning framework that learns from reconstructing data from randomly masked counterparts. MAEs tend to focus on low-level information such as visual patterns and regularities within data. Therefore, it is unimportant what is portrayed in the input, whether it be images, audio mel-spectrograms, or even synthetic patterns. This leads to the second key element, which is synthetic data. Synthetic data, unlike real audio, is free from privacy and licensing infringement issues. By combining MAEs and synthetic patterns, our framework enables the model to learn generalized feature representations without real data, while addressing the issues related to real audio. To evaluate the efficacy of our framework, we conduct extensive experiments across a total of 13 audio tasks and 17 synthetic datasets. The experiments provide insights into which types of synthetic patterns are effective for audio. Our results demonstrate that our framework achieves performance comparable to models pre-trained on AudioSet-2M and partially outperforms image-based pre-training methods.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates the enhancement of spatial resolution in Sentinel-2 bands that contain spectral information using advanced super-resolution techniques by a factor of 2. State-of-the-art CNN models are compared with enhanced GAN approaches in terms of quality and feasibility. Therefore, a representative dataset comprising Sentinel-2 low-resolution images and corresponding high-resolution aerial orthophotos is required. Literature study reveals no feasible dataset for the land type of interest (forests), for which reason an adequate dataset had to be generated in addition, accounting for accurate alignment and image source optimization. The results reveal that while CNN-based approaches produce satisfactory outcomes, they tend to yield blurry images. In contrast, GAN-based models not only provide clear and detailed images, but also demonstrate superior performance in terms of quantitative assessment, underlying the potential of the framework beyond the specific land type investigated.

- **Summary**: Reliable perception of targets is crucial for the stable operation of autonomous robots. A widely preferred method is keypoint identification in an image, as it allows direct mapping from raw images to 2D coordinates, facilitating integration with other algorithms like localization and path planning. In this study, we closely examine the design and identification of keypoint patches in cluttered environments, where factors such as blur and shadows can hinder detection. We propose four simple yet distinct designs that consider various scale, rotation and camera projection using a limited number of pixels. Additionally, we customize the Superpoint network to ensure robust detection under various types of image degradation. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through real-world video tests, highlighting potential for vision-based autonomous systems.

- **Summary**: Model Interpretation aims at the extraction of insights from the internals of a trained model. A common approach to address this task is the characterization of relevant features internally encoded in the model that are critical for its proper operation. Despite recent progress of these methods, they come with the weakness of being computationally expensive due to the dense evaluation of datasets that they require. As a consequence, research on the design of these methods have focused on smaller data subsets which may led to reduced insights. To address these computational costs, we propose a coreset-based interpretation framework that utilizes coreset selection methods to sample a representative subset of the large dataset for the interpretation task. Towards this goal, we propose a similarity-based evaluation protocol to assess the robustness of model interpretation methods towards the amount data they take as input. Experiments considering several interpretation methods, DNN models, and coreset selection methods show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

- **Summary**: Accurate assessment of disease severity from endoscopy videos in ulcerative colitis (UC) is crucial for evaluating drug efficacy in clinical trials. Severity is often measured by the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) and Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) score. However, expert MES/UCEIS annotation is time-consuming and susceptible to inter-rater variability, factors addressable by automation. Automation attempts with frame-level labels face challenges in fully-supervised solutions due to the prevalence of video-level labels in clinical trials. CNN-based weakly-supervised models (WSL) with end-to-end (e2e) training lack generalization to new disease scores and ignore spatio-temporal information crucial for accurate scoring. To address these limitations, we propose "Arges", a deep learning framework that utilizes a transformer with positional encoding to incorporate spatio-temporal information from frame features to estimate disease severity scores in endoscopy video. Extracted features are derived from a foundation model (ArgesFM), pre-trained on a large diverse dataset from multiple clinical trials (61M frames, 3927 videos). We evaluate four UC disease severity scores, including MES and three UCEIS component scores. Test set evaluation indicates significant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 4.1% for MES and 18.8%, 6.6%, 3.8% for the three UCEIS component scores compared to state-of-the-art methods. Prospective validation on previously unseen clinical trial data further demonstrates the model's successful generalization.

- **Summary**: In end-to-end learned image compression, encoder and decoder are jointly trained to minimize a $R + {\lambda}D$ cost function, where ${\lambda}$ controls the trade-off between rate of the quantized latent representation and image quality. Unfortunately, a distinct encoder-decoder pair with millions of parameters must be trained for each ${\lambda}$, hence the need to switch encoders and to store multiple encoders and decoders on the user device for every target rate. This paper proposes to exploit a differentiable quantizer designed around a parametric sum of hyperbolic tangents, called STanH , that relaxes the step-wise quantization function. STanH is implemented as a differentiable activation layer with learnable quantization parameters that can be plugged into a pre-trained fixed rate model and refined to achieve different target bitrates. Experimental results show that our method enables variable rate coding with comparable efficiency to the state-of-the-art, yet with significant savings in terms of ease of deployment, training time, and storage costs

- **Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and neuromorphic computing offer bio-inspired advantages such as sparsity and ultra-low power consumption, providing a promising alternative to conventional networks. However, training deep SNNs from scratch remains a challenge, as SNNs process and transmit information by quantizing the real-valued membrane potentials into binary spikes. This can lead to information loss and vanishing spikes in deeper layers, impeding effective training. While weight initialization is known to be critical for training deep neural networks, what constitutes an effective initial state for a deep SNN is not well-understood. Existing weight initialization methods designed for conventional networks (ANNs) are often applied to SNNs without accounting for their distinct computational properties. In this work we derive an optimal weight initialization method specifically tailored for SNNs, taking into account the quantization operation. We show theoretically that, unlike standard approaches, this method enables the propagation of activity in deep SNNs without loss of spikes. We demonstrate this behavior in numerical simulations of SNNs with up to 100 layers across multiple time steps. We present an in-depth analysis of the numerical conditions, regarding layer width and neuron hyperparameters, which are necessary to accurately apply our theoretical findings. Furthermore, our experiments on MNIST demonstrate higher accuracy and faster convergence when using the proposed weight initialization scheme. Finally, we show that the newly introduced weight initialization is robust against variations in several network and neuron hyperparameters.

- **Summary**: Efficient point cloud (PC) compression is crucial for streaming applications, such as augmented reality and cooperative perception. Classic PC compression techniques encode all the points in a frame. Tailoring compression towards perception tasks at the receiver side, we ask the question, "Can we remove the ground points during transmission without sacrificing the detection performance?" Our study reveals a strong dependency on the ground from state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D object detection models, especially on those points below and around the object. In this work, we propose a lightweight obstacle-aware Pillar-based Ground Removal (PGR) algorithm. PGR filters out ground points that do not provide context to object recognition, significantly improving compression ratio without sacrificing the receiver side perception performance. Not using heavy object detection or semantic segmentation models, PGR is light-weight, highly parallelizable, and effective. Our evaluations on KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset show that SOTA detection models work equally well with PGR removing 20-30% of the points, with a speeding of 86 FPS.

- **Summary**: Point cloud registration aims to provide estimated transformations to align point clouds, which plays a crucial role in pose estimation of various navigation systems, such as surgical guidance systems and autonomous vehicles. Despite the impressive performance of recent models on benchmark datasets, many rely on complex modules like KPConv and Transformers, which impose significant computational and memory demands. These requirements hinder their practical application, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as mobile robotics. In this paper, we propose a novel point cloud registration network that leverages a pure MLP architecture, constructing geometric information offline. This approach eliminates the computational and memory burdens associated with traditional complex feature extractors and significantly reduces inference time and resource consumption. Our method is the first to replace 3D coordinate inputs with offline-constructed geometric encoding, improving generalization and stability, as demonstrated by Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) comparisons. This efficient and accurate geometric representation marks a significant advancement in point cloud analysis, particularly for applications requiring fast and reliability.

- **Summary**: Visual features, whose description often relies on the local intensity and gradient direction, have found wide applications in robot navigation and localization in recent years. However, the extraction of visual features is usually disturbed by the variation of illumination conditions, making it challenging for real-world applications. Previous works have addressed this issue by establishing datasets with variations in illumination conditions, but can be costly and time-consuming. This paper proposes a design procedure for an illumination-robust feature extractor, where the recently developed relightable 3D reconstruction techniques are adopted for rapid and direct data generation with varying illumination conditions. A self-supervised framework is proposed for extracting features with advantages in repeatability for key points and similarity for descriptors across good and bad illumination conditions. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for robust feature extraction. Ablation studies also indicate the effectiveness of the self-supervised framework design.

- **Summary**: Volumetric modeling and neural radiance field representations have revolutionized 3D face capture and photorealistic novel view synthesis. However, these methods often require hundreds of multi-view input images and are thus inapplicable to cases with less than a handful of inputs. We present a novel volumetric prior on human faces that allows for high-fidelity expressive face modeling from as few as three input views captured in the wild. Our key insight is that an implicit prior trained on synthetic data alone can generalize to extremely challenging real-world identities and expressions and render novel views with fine idiosyncratic details like wrinkles and eyelashes. We leverage a 3D Morphable Face Model to synthesize a large training set, rendering each identity with different expressions, hair, clothing, and other assets. We then train a conditional Neural Radiance Field prior on this synthetic dataset and, at inference time, fine-tune the model on a very sparse set of real images of a single subject. On average, the fine-tuning requires only three inputs to cross the synthetic-to-real domain gap. The resulting personalized 3D model reconstructs strong idiosyncratic facial expressions and outperforms the state-of-the-art in high-quality novel view synthesis of faces from sparse inputs in terms of perceptual and photo-metric quality.



### Cross-Camera Data Association via GNN for Supervised Graph Clustering

- **Summary**: Cross-camera data association is one of the cornerstones of the multi-camera computer vision field. Although often integrated into detection and tracking tasks through architecture design and loss definition, it is also recognized as an independent challenge. The ultimate goal is to connect appearances of one item from all cameras, wherever it is visible. Therefore, one possible perspective on this task involves supervised clustering of the affinity graph, where nodes are instances captured by all cameras. They are represented by appropriate visual features and positional attributes. We leverage the advantages of GNN (Graph Neural Network) architecture to examine nodes' relations and generate representative edge embeddings. These embeddings are then classified to determine the existence or non-existence of connections in node pairs. Therefore, the core of this approach is graph connectivity prediction. Experimental validation was conducted on multicamera pedestrian datasets across diverse environments such as the laboratory, basketball court, and terrace. Our proposed method, named SGC-CCA, outperformed the state-of-the-art method named GNN-CCA across all clustering metrics, offering an end-to-end clustering solution without the need for graph post-processing.

- **Summary**: Novel view synthesis (NVS) aims to generate images at arbitrary viewpoints using multi-view images, and recent insights from neural radiance fields (NeRF) have contributed to remarkable improvements. Recently, studies on generalizable NeRF (G-NeRF) have addressed the challenge of per-scene optimization in NeRFs. The construction of radiance fields on-the-fly in G-NeRF simplifies the NVS process, making it well-suited for real-world applications. Meanwhile, G-NeRF still struggles in representing fine details for a specific scene due to the absence of per-scene optimization, even with texture-rich multi-view source inputs. As a remedy, we propose a Geometry-driven Multi-reference Texture transfer network (GMT) available as a plug-and-play module designed for G-NeRF. Specifically, we propose ray-imposed deformable convolution (RayDCN), which aligns input and reference features reflecting scene geometry. Additionally, the proposed texture preserving transformer (TP-Former) aggregates multi-view source features while preserving texture information. Consequently, our module enables direct interaction between adjacent pixels during the image enhancement process, which is deficient in G-NeRF models with an independent rendering process per pixel. This addresses constraints that hinder the ability to capture high-frequency details. Experiments show that our plug-and-play module consistently improves G-NeRF models on various benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an Arabic Alphabet Sign Language recognition approach, using deep learning methods in conjunction with transfer learning and transformer-based models. We study the performance of the different variants on two publicly available datasets, namely ArSL2018 and AASL. This task will make full use of state-of-the-art CNN architectures like ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB7, and the latest transformer models such as Google ViT and Microsoft Swin Transformer. These pre-trained models have been fine-tuned on the above datasets in an attempt to capture some unique features of Arabic sign language motions. Experimental results present evidence that the suggested methodology can receive a high recognition accuracy, by up to 99.6\% and 99.43\% on ArSL2018 and AASL, respectively. That is far beyond the previously reported state-of-the-art approaches. This performance opens up even more avenues for communication that may be more accessible to Arabic-speaking deaf and hard-of-hearing, and thus encourages an inclusive society.

- **Summary**: Personalized text-to-image diffusion models have grown popular for their ability to efficiently acquire a new concept from user-defined text descriptions and a few images. However, in the real world, a user may wish to personalize a model on multiple concepts but one at a time, with no access to the data from previous concepts due to storage/privacy concerns. When faced with this continual learning (CL) setup, most personalization methods fail to find a balance between acquiring new concepts and retaining previous ones -- a challenge that continual personalization (CP) aims to solve. Inspired by the successful CL methods that rely on class-specific information for regularization, we resort to the inherent class-conditioned density estimates, also known as diffusion classifier (DC) scores, for continual personalization of text-to-image diffusion models. Namely, we propose using DC scores for regularizing the parameter-space and function-space of text-to-image diffusion models, to achieve continual personalization. Using several diverse evaluation setups, datasets, and metrics, we show that our proposed regularization-based CP methods outperform the state-of-the-art C-LoRA, and other baselines. Finally, by operating in the replay-free CL setup and on low-rank adapters, our method incurs zero storage and parameter overhead, respectively, over the state-of-the-art.



### A Low-Cost, High-Speed, and Robust Bin Picking System for Factory Automation Enabled by a Non-Stop, Multi-View, and Active Vision Scheme

- **Summary**: Bin picking systems in factory automation usually face robustness issues caused by sparse and noisy 3D data of metallic objects. Utilizing multiple views, especially with a one-shot 3D sensor and "sensor on hand" configuration is getting more popularity due to its effectiveness, flexibility, and low cost. While moving the 3D sensor to acquire multiple views for 3D fusion, joint optimization, or active vision suffers from low-speed issues. That is because sensing is taken as a decoupled module from motion tasks and is not intentionally designed for a bin picking system. To address the problems, we designed a bin picking system, which tightly couples a multi-view, active vision scheme with motion tasks in a "sensor on hand" configuration. It not only speeds up the system by parallelizing the high-speed sensing scheme to the robot place action but also decides the next sensing path to maintain the continuity of the whole picking process. Unlike others focusing only on sensing evaluation, we also evaluated our design by picking experiments on 5 different types of objects without human intervention. Our experiments show the whole sensing scheme can be finished within 1.682 seconds (maximum) on CPU and the average picking complete rate is over 97.75%. Due to the parallelization with robot motion, the sensing scheme accounts for only 0.635 seconds in takt time on average.

- **Summary**: Facial dysmorphologies have emerged as potential critical indicators in the diagnosis and prognosis of genetic, psychotic and rare disorders. While in certain conditions these dysmorphologies are severe, in other cases may be subtle and not perceivable to the human eye, requiring precise quantitative tools for their identification. Manual coding of facial dysmorphologies is a burdensome task and is subject to inter- and intra-observer variability. To overcome this gap, we present BioFace3D as a fully automatic tool for the calculation of facial biomarkers using facial models reconstructed from magnetic resonance images. The tool is divided into three automatic modules for the extraction of 3D facial models from magnetic resonance images, the registration of homologous 3D landmarks encoding facial morphology, and the calculation of facial biomarkers from anatomical landmarks coordinates using geometric morphometrics techniques.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in industrial anomaly detection have been hindered by the lack of realistic datasets that accurately represent real-world conditions. Existing algorithms are often developed and evaluated using idealized datasets, which deviate significantly from real-life scenarios characterized by environmental noise and data corruption such as fluctuating lighting conditions, variable object poses, and unstable camera positions. To address this gap, we introduce the Realistic Anomaly Detection (RAD) dataset, the first multi-view RGB-based anomaly detection dataset specifically collected using a real robot arm, providing unique and realistic data scenarios. RAD comprises 4765 images across 13 categories and 4 defect types, collected from more than 50 viewpoints, providing a comprehensive and realistic benchmark. This multi-viewpoint setup mirrors real-world conditions where anomalies may not be detectable from every perspective. Moreover, by sampling varying numbers of views, the algorithm's performance can be comprehensively evaluated across different viewpoints. This approach enhances the thoroughness of performance assessment and helps improve the algorithm's robustness. Besides, to support 3D multi-view reconstruction algorithms, we propose a data augmentation method to improve the accuracy of pose estimation and facilitate the reconstruction of 3D point clouds. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art RGB-based and point cloud-based models using RAD, identifying limitations and future research directions.

- **Summary**: Humans excel at abstracting data and constructing \emph{reusable} concepts, a capability lacking in current continual learning systems. The field of object-centric learning addresses this by developing abstract representations, or slots, from data without human supervision. Different methods have been proposed to tackle this task for images, whereas most are overly complex, non-differentiable, or poorly scalable. In this paper, we introduce a conceptually simple, fully-differentiable, non-iterative, and scalable method called SAMP Simplified Slot Attention with Max Pool Priors). It is implementable using only Convolution and MaxPool layers and an Attention layer. Our method encodes the input image with a Convolutional Neural Network and then uses a branch of alternating Convolution and MaxPool layers to create specialized sub-networks and extract primitive slots. These primitive slots are then used as queries for a Simplified Slot Attention over the encoded image. Despite its simplicity, our method is competitive or outperforms previous methods on standard benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has been widely studied and applied in numerous applications. However, the emphasis on brief summary texts during pre-training prevents CLIP from understanding long descriptions. This issue is particularly acute regarding videos given that videos often contain abundant detailed contents. In this paper, we propose the VideoCLIP-XL (eXtra Length) model, which aims to unleash the long-description understanding capability of video CLIP models. Firstly, we establish an automatic data collection system and gather a large-scale VILD pre-training dataset with VIdeo and Long-Description pairs. Then, we propose Text-similarity-guided Primary Component Matching (TPCM) to better learn the distribution of feature space while expanding the long description capability. We also introduce two new tasks namely Detail-aware Description Ranking (DDR) and Hallucination-aware Description Ranking (HDR) for further understanding improvement. Finally, we construct a Long Video Description Ranking (LVDR) benchmark for evaluating the long-description capability more comprehensively. Extensive experimental results on widely-used text-video retrieval benchmarks with both short and long descriptions and our LVDR benchmark can fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Purpose. Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (1H-MRSI) provides non-invasive spectral-spatial mapping of metabolism. However, long-standing problems in whole-brain 1H-MRSI are spectral overlap of metabolite peaks with large lipid signal from scalp, and overwhelming water signal that distorts spectra. Fast and effective methods are needed for high-resolution 1H-MRSI to accurately remove lipid and water signals while preserving the metabolite signal. The potential of supervised neural networks for this task remains unexplored, despite their success for other MRSI processing.   Methods. We introduce a deep-learning method based on a modified Y-NET network for water and lipid removal in whole-brain 1H-MRSI. The WALINET (WAter and LIpid neural NETwork) was compared to conventional methods such as the state-of-the-art lipid L2 regularization and Hankel-Lanczos singular value decomposition (HLSVD) water suppression. Methods were evaluated on simulated and in-vivo whole-brain MRSI using NMRSE, SNR, CRLB, and FWHM metrics.   Results. WALINET is significantly faster and needs 8s for high-resolution whole-brain MRSI, compared to 42 minutes for conventional HLSVD+L2. Quantitative analysis shows WALINET has better performance than HLSVD+L2: 1) more lipid removal with 41% lower NRMSE, 2) better metabolite signal preservation with 71% lower NRMSE in simulated data, 155% higher SNR and 50% lower CRLB in in-vivo data. Metabolic maps obtained by WALINET in healthy subjects and patients show better gray/white-matter contrast with more visible structural details.   Conclusions. WALINET has superior performance for nuisance signal removal and metabolite quantification on whole-brain 1H-MRSI compared to conventional state-of-the-art techniques. This represents a new application of deep-learning for MRSI processing, with potential for automated high-throughput workflow.

- **Summary**: Robots-based smart pharmacies are essential for modern healthcare systems, enabling efficient drug delivery. However, a critical challenge exists in the robotic handling of drugs with varying shapes and overlapping positions, which previous studies have not adequately addressed. To enhance the robotic arm's ability to grasp chaotic, overlapping, and variously shaped drugs, this paper proposed a novel framework combining a multi-stage grasping network with an adaptive robotics mechanism. The framework first preprocessed images using an improved Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) algorithm, and then employed the proposed YOLOv5+E-A-SPPFCSPC+BIFPNC (YOLO-EASB) instance segmentation algorithm for precise drug segmentation. The most suitable drugs for grasping can be determined by assessing the completeness of the segmentation masks. Then, these segmented drugs were processed by our improved Adaptive Feature Fusion and Grasp-Aware Network (IAFFGA-Net) with the optimized loss function, which ensures accurate picking actions even in complex environments. To control the robot grasping, a time-optimal robotic arm trajectory planning algorithm that combines an improved ant colony algorithm with 3-5-3 interpolation was developed, further improving efficiency while ensuring smooth trajectories. Finally, this system was implemented and validated within an adaptive collaborative robot setup, which dynamically adjusts to different production environments and task requirements. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our multi-stage grasping network in optimizing smart pharmacy operations, while also showcasing its remarkable adaptability and effectiveness in practical applications.

- **Summary**: High-definition maps (HD maps) play a crucial role in the development, safety validation, and operation of highly automated vehicles. Efficiently collecting up-to-date sensor data from road segments and obtaining accurate maps from these are key challenges in HD map creation. Commonly used methods, such as dedicated measurement vehicles and crowd-sourced data from series vehicles, often face limitations in commercial viability. Although high-resolution aerial imagery offers a cost-effective or even free alternative, it requires significant manual effort and time to transform it into maps. In this paper, we introduce a semi-automatic method for creating HD maps from high-resolution aerial imagery. Our method involves training neural networks to semantically segment aerial images into classes relevant to HD maps. The resulting segmentation is then hierarchically post-processed to generate a prototypical HD map of visible road elements. Exporting the map to the Lanelet2 format allows easy extension for different use cases using standard tools. To train and evaluate our method, we created a dataset using public aerial imagery of urban road segments in Germany. In our evaluation, we achieved an automatic mapping of lane markings and road borders with a recall and precision exceeding 96%. The source code for our method is publicly available at https://github.com/RobertKrajewski/DeepAerialMapper.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the rapid increase in online video content has underscored the limitations of static Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models trained on fixed datasets, as they struggle to adapt to new questions or tasks posed by newly available content. In this paper, we explore the novel challenge of VideoQA within a continual learning framework, and empirically identify a critical issue: fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) for a sequence of tasks often results in catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose Collaborative Prompting (ColPro), which integrates specific question constraint prompting, knowledge acquisition prompting, and visual temporal awareness prompting. These prompts aim to capture textual question context, visual content, and video temporal dynamics in VideoQA, a perspective underexplored in prior research. Experimental results on the NExT-QA and DramaQA datasets show that ColPro achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches, achieving 55.14\% accuracy on NExT-QA and 71.24\% accuracy on DramaQA, highlighting its practical relevance and effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods learn from unlabeled data and achieve high generalization performance on downstream tasks. However, they may also suffer from overfitting to their training data and lose the ability to adapt to new tasks. To investigate this phenomenon, we conduct experiments on various SSL methods and datasets and make two observations: (1) Overfitting occurs abruptly in later layers and epochs, while generalizing features are learned in early layers for all epochs; (2) Coding rate reduction can be used as an indicator to measure the degree of overfitting in SSL models. Based on these observations, we propose Undoing Memorization Mechanism (UMM), a plug-and-play method that mitigates overfitting of the pre-trained feature extractor by aligning the feature distributions of the early and the last layers to maximize the coding rate reduction of the last layer output. The learning process of UMM is a bi-level optimization process. We provide a causal analysis of UMM to explain how UMM can help the pre-trained feature extractor overcome overfitting and recover generalization. We also demonstrate that UMM significantly improves the generalization performance of SSL methods on various downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Artificial intelligence algorithms have demonstrated their image classification and segmentation ability in the past decade. However, artificial intelligence algorithms perform less for actual clinical data than those used for simulations. This research aims to present a novel hybrid learning model using self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation, which can achieve sufficient generalization and robustness. The self-attention mechanism and tokens employed in ViT, besides the local-to-global learning approach used in the hybrid model, enable the proposed algorithm to extract a high-dimensional and high-quality feature space from images. To demonstrate the proposed neural network's capability in classifying and extracting feature spaces from medical images, we use it on a dataset of Diabetic Retinopathy images, specifically the EyePACS dataset. This dataset is more complex structurally and challenging regarding damaged areas than other medical images. For the first time in this study, self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation are used to classify this dataset. In our algorithm, for the first time among all self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation models, the test dataset is 50% larger than the training dataset. Unlike many studies, we have not removed any images from the dataset. Finally, our algorithm achieved an accuracy of 79.1% in the linear classifier and 74.36% in the k-NN algorithm for multiclass classification. Compared to a similar state-of-the-art model, our results achieved higher accuracy and more effective representation spaces.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong adaptability to various real-world challenges, with architectures such as Vision GNN (ViG) achieving state-of-the-art performance in several computer vision tasks. However, their practical applicability is hindered by the computational complexity of constructing the graph, which scales quadratically with the image size. In this paper, we introduce a novel Windowed vision Graph neural Network (WiGNet) model for efficient image processing. WiGNet explores a different strategy from previous works by partitioning the image into windows and constructing a graph within each window. Therefore, our model uses graph convolutions instead of the typical 2D convolution or self-attention mechanism. WiGNet effectively manages computational and memory complexity for large image sizes. We evaluate our method in the ImageNet-1k benchmark dataset and test the adaptability of WiGNet using the CelebA-HQ dataset as a downstream task with higher-resolution images. In both of these scenarios, our method achieves competitive results compared to previous vision GNNs while keeping memory and computational complexity at bay. WiGNet offers a promising solution toward the deployment of vision GNNs in real-world applications. We publicly released the code at https://github.com/EIDOSLAB/WiGNet.

- **Summary**: Prediction of mRNA gene-expression profiles directly from routine whole-slide images (WSIs) using deep learning models could potentially offer cost-effective and widely accessible molecular phenotyping. While such WSI-based gene-expression prediction models have recently emerged within computational pathology, the high-dimensional nature of the corresponding regression problem offers numerous design choices which remain to be analyzed in detail. This study provides recommendations on how deep regression models should be trained for WSI-based gene-expression prediction. For example, we conclude that training a single model to simultaneously regress all 20530 genes is a computationally efficient yet very strong baseline.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are important for many machine learning tasks. They are built with different types of layers: convolutional layers that detect features, dropout layers that help to avoid over-reliance on any single neuron, and residual layers that allow the reuse of features. However, CNNs lack a dynamic feature retention mechanism similar to the human brain's memory, limiting their ability to use learned information in new contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce the "Squeeze-and-Remember" (SR) block, a novel architectural unit that gives CNNs dynamic memory-like functionalities. The SR block selectively memorizes important features during training, and then adaptively re-applies these features during inference. This improves the network's ability to make contextually informed predictions. Empirical results on ImageNet and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the SR block's efficacy: integration into ResNet50 improved top-1 validation accuracy on ImageNet by 0.52% over dropout2d alone, and its application in DeepLab v3 increased mean Intersection over Union in Cityscapes by 0.20%. These improvements are achieved with minimal computational overhead. This show the SR block's potential to enhance the capabilities of CNNs in image processing tasks.

- **Summary**: Mamba has achieved significant advantages in long-context modeling and autoregressive tasks, but its scalability with large parameters remains a major limitation in vision applications. pretraining is a widely used strategy to enhance backbone model performance. Although the success of Masked Autoencoder in Transformer pretraining is well recognized, it does not significantly improve Mamba's visual learning performance. We found that using the correct autoregressive pretraining can significantly boost the performance of the Mamba architecture. Based on this analysis, we propose Masked Autoregressive Pretraining (MAP) to pretrain a hybrid Mamba-Transformer vision backbone network. This strategy combines the strengths of both MAE and Autoregressive pretraining, improving the performance of Mamba and Transformer modules within a unified paradigm. Additionally, in terms of integrating Mamba and Transformer modules, we empirically found that inserting Transformer layers at regular intervals within Mamba layers can significantly enhance downstream task performance. Experimental results show that both the pure Mamba architecture and the hybrid Mamba-Transformer vision backbone network pretrained with MAP significantly outperform other pretraining strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We validate the effectiveness of the method on both 2D and 3D datasets and provide detailed ablation studies to support the design choices for each component.

- **Summary**: Generating high-quality 3D content from text, single images, or sparse view images remains a challenging task with broad applications. Existing methods typically employ multi-view diffusion models to synthesize multi-view images, followed by a feed-forward process for 3D reconstruction. However, these approaches are often constrained by a small and fixed number of input views, limiting their ability to capture diverse viewpoints and, even worse, leading to suboptimal generation results if the synthesized views are of poor quality. To address these limitations, we propose Flex3D, a novel two-stage framework capable of leveraging an arbitrary number of high-quality input views. The first stage consists of a candidate view generation and curation pipeline. We employ a fine-tuned multi-view image diffusion model and a video diffusion model to generate a pool of candidate views, enabling a rich representation of the target 3D object. Subsequently, a view selection pipeline filters these views based on quality and consistency, ensuring that only the high-quality and reliable views are used for reconstruction. In the second stage, the curated views are fed into a Flexible Reconstruction Model (FlexRM), built upon a transformer architecture that can effectively process an arbitrary number of inputs. FlemRM directly outputs 3D Gaussian points leveraging a tri-plane representation, enabling efficient and detailed 3D generation. Through extensive exploration of design and training strategies, we optimize FlexRM to achieve superior performance in both reconstruction and generation tasks. Our results demonstrate that Flex3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a user study winning rate of over 92% in 3D generation tasks when compared to several of the latest feed-forward 3D generative models.

- **Summary**: Despite their success in various vision tasks, deep neural network architectures often underperform in out-of-distribution scenarios due to the difference between training and target domain style. To address this limitation, we introduce One-Shot Style Adaptation (OSSA), a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method for object detection that utilizes a single, unlabeled target image to approximate the target domain style. Specifically, OSSA generates diverse target styles by perturbing the style statistics derived from a single target image and then applies these styles to a labeled source dataset at the feature level using Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN). Extensive experiments show that OSSA establishes a new state-of-the-art among one-shot domain adaptation methods by a significant margin, and in some cases, even outperforms strong baselines that use thousands of unlabeled target images. By applying OSSA in various scenarios, including weather, simulated-to-real (sim2real), and visual-to-thermal adaptations, our study explores the overarching significance of the style gap in these contexts. OSSA's simplicity and efficiency allow easy integration into existing frameworks, providing a potentially viable solution for practical applications with limited data availability.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a model designed to improve the prediction of image-text alignment, targeting the challenge of compositional understanding in current visual-language models. Our approach focuses on generating high-quality training datasets for the alignment task by producing mixed-type negative captions derived from positive ones. Critically, we address the distribution imbalance between positive and negative captions to ensure that the alignment model does not depend solely on textual information but also considers the associated images for predicting alignment accurately. By creating this enhanced training data, we fine-tune an existing leading visual-language model to boost its capability in understanding alignment. Our model significantly outperforms current top-performing methods across various datasets. We also demonstrate the applicability of our model by ranking the images generated by text-to-image models based on text alignment. Project page: \url{https://yuheng-li.github.io/LLaVA-score/}

- **Summary**: Domain-Incremental Learning (DIL) involves the progressive adaptation of a model to new concepts across different domains. While recent advances in pre-trained models provide a solid foundation for DIL, learning new concepts often results in the catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge. Specifically, sequential model updates can overwrite both the representation and the classifier with knowledge from the latest domain. Thus, it is crucial to develop a representation and corresponding classifier that accommodate all seen domains throughout the learning process. To this end, we propose DUal ConsolidaTion (Duct) to unify and consolidate historical knowledge at both the representation and classifier levels. By merging the backbone of different stages, we create a representation space suitable for multiple domains incrementally. The merged representation serves as a balanced intermediary that captures task-specific features from all seen domains. Additionally, to address the mismatch between consolidated embeddings and the classifier, we introduce an extra classifier consolidation process. Leveraging class-wise semantic information, we estimate the classifier weights of old domains within the latest embedding space. By merging historical and estimated classifiers, we align them with the consolidated embedding space, facilitating incremental classification. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate Duct's state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Adaptation methods are developed to adapt depth foundation models to endoscopic depth estimation recently. However, such approaches typically under-perform training since they limit the parameter search to a low-rank subspace and alter the training dynamics. Therefore, we propose a full-parameter and parameter-efficient learning framework for endoscopic depth estimation. At the first stage, the subspace of attention, convolution and multi-layer perception are adapted simultaneously within different sub-spaces. At the second stage, a memory-efficient optimization is proposed for subspace composition and the performance is further improved in the united sub-space. Initial experiments on the SCARED dataset demonstrate that results at the first stage improves the performance from 10.2% to 4.1% for Sq Rel, Abs Rel, RMSE and RMSE log in the comparison with the state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: Accurately identifying, understanding, and describing driving safety-critical events (SCEs), including crashes and near-crashes, is crucial for traffic safety, automated driving systems, and advanced driver assistance systems research and application. As SCEs are rare events, most general Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have not been trained sufficiently to link SCE videos and narratives, which could lead to hallucination and missing key safety characteristics. To tackle these challenges, we propose ScVLM, a hybrid approach that combines supervised learning and contrastive learning to improve driving video understanding and event description rationality for VLMs. The proposed approach is trained on and evaluated by more than 8,600 SCEs from the Second Strategic Highway Research Program Naturalistic Driving Study dataset, the largest publicly accessible driving dataset with videos and SCE annotations. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in generating contextually accurate event descriptions and mitigate hallucinations from VLMs.

- **Summary**: High-resolution images are preferable in medical imaging domain as they significantly improve the diagnostic capability of the underlying method. In particular, high resolution helps substantially in improving automatic image segmentation. However, most of the existing deep learning-based techniques for medical image segmentation are optimized for input images having small spatial dimensions and perform poorly on high-resolution images. To address this shortcoming, we propose a parallel-in-branch architecture called TransResNet, which incorporates Transformer and CNN in a parallel manner to extract features from multi-resolution images independently. In TransResNet, we introduce Cross Grafting Module (CGM), which generates the grafted features, enriched in both global semantic and low-level spatial details, by combining the feature maps from Transformer and CNN branches through fusion and self-attention mechanism. Moreover, we use these grafted features in the decoding process, increasing the information flow for better prediction of the segmentation mask. Extensive experiments on ten datasets demonstrate that TransResNet achieves either state-of-the-art or competitive results on several segmentation tasks, including skin lesion, retinal vessel, and polyp segmentation. The source code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/Sharifmhamza/TransResNet.

- **Summary**: Audio-driven talking head generation is a pivotal area within film-making and Virtual Reality. Although existing methods have made significant strides following the end-to-end paradigm, they still encounter challenges in producing videos with high-frequency details due to their limited expressivity in this domain. This limitation has prompted us to explore an effective post-processing approach to synthesize photo-realistic talking head videos. Specifically, we employ a pretrained Wav2Lip model as our foundation model, leveraging its robust audio-lip alignment capabilities. Drawing on the theory of Lipschitz Continuity, we have theoretically established the noise robustness of Vector Quantised Auto Encoders (VQAEs). Our experiments further demonstrate that the high-frequency texture deficiency of the foundation model can be temporally consistently recovered by the Space-Optimised Vector Quantised Auto Encoder (SOVQAE) we introduced, thereby facilitating the creation of realistic talking head videos. We conduct experiments on both the conventional dataset and the High-Frequency TalKing head (HFTK) dataset that we curated. The results indicate that our method, LaDTalk, achieves new state-of-the-art video quality and out-of-domain lip synchronization performance.

- **Summary**: Recent attention-based volumetric segmentation (VS) methods have achieved remarkable performance in the medical domain which focuses on modeling long-range dependencies. However, for voxel-wise prediction tasks, discriminative local features are key components for the performance of the VS models which is missing in attention-based VS methods. Aiming at resolving this issue, we deliberately incorporate the convolutional encoder branch with transformer backbone to extract local and global features in a parallel manner and aggregate them in Cross Feature Mixer Module (CFMM) for better prediction of segmentation mask. Consequently, we observe that the derived model, Y-CT-Net, achieves competitive performance on multiple medical segmentation tasks. For example, on multi-organ segmentation, Y-CT-Net achieves an 82.4% dice score, surpassing well-tuned VS Transformer/CNN-like baselines UNETR/ResNet-3D by 2.9%/1.4%. With the success of Y-CT-Net, we extend this concept with hybrid attention models, that derived Y-CH-Net model, which brings a 3% improvement in terms of HD95 score for same segmentation task. The effectiveness of both models Y-CT-Net and Y-CH-Net verifies our hypothesis and motivates us to initiate the concept of Y-CA-Net, a versatile generic architecture based upon any two encoders and a decoder backbones, to fully exploit the complementary strengths of both convolution and attention mechanisms. Based on experimental results, we argue Y-CA-Net is a key player in achieving superior results for volumetric segmentation.

- **Summary**: The task of Visual Sound Source Localization (VSSL) involves identifying the location of sound sources in visual scenes, integrating audio-visual data for enhanced scene understanding. Despite advancements in state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, we observe three critical flaws: i) The evaluation of the models is mainly focused in sounds produced by objects that are visible in the image, ii) The evaluation often assumes a prior knowledge of the size of the sounding object, and iii) No universal threshold for localization in real-world scenarios is established, as previous approaches only consider positive examples without accounting for both positive and negative cases. In this paper, we introduce a novel test set and metrics designed to complete the current standard evaluation of VSSL models by testing them in scenarios where none of the objects in the image corresponds to the audio input, i.e. a negative audio. We consider three types of negative audio: silence, noise and offscreen. Our analysis reveals that numerous SOTA models fail to appropriately adjust their predictions based on audio input, suggesting that these models may not be leveraging audio information as intended. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the range of maximum values in the estimated audio-visual similarity maps, in both positive and negative audio cases, and show that most of the models are not discriminative enough, making them unfit to choose a universal threshold appropriate to perform sound localization without any a priori information of the sounding object, that is, object size and visibility.

- **Summary**: Humans possess multimodal literacy, allowing them to actively integrate information from various modalities to form reasoning. Faced with challenges like lexical ambiguity in text, we supplement this with other modalities, such as thumbnail images or textbook illustrations. Is it possible for machines to achieve a similar multimodal understanding capability? In response, we present Understanding Pun with Image Explanations (UNPIE), a novel benchmark designed to assess the impact of multimodal inputs in resolving lexical ambiguities. Puns serve as the ideal subject for this evaluation due to their intrinsic ambiguity. Our dataset includes 1,000 puns, each accompanied by an image that explains both meanings. We pose three multimodal challenges with the annotations to assess different aspects of multimodal literacy; Pun Grounding, Disambiguation, and Reconstruction. The results indicate that various Socratic Models and Visual-Language Models improve over the text-only models when given visual context, particularly as the complexity of the tasks increases.

- **Summary**: Children often suffer wrist trauma in daily life, while they usually need radiologists to analyze and interpret X-ray images before surgical treatment by surgeons. The development of deep learning has enabled neural networks to serve as computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) tools to help doctors and experts in medical image diagnostics. Since the You Only Look Once Version-8 (YOLOv8) model has obtained the satisfactory success in object detection tasks, it has been applied to various fracture detection. This work introduces four variants of Feature Contexts Excitation-YOLOv8 (FCE-YOLOv8) model, each incorporating a different FCE module (i.e., modules of Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE), Global Context (GC), Gather-Excite (GE), and Gaussian Context Transformer (GCT)) to enhance the model performance. Experimental results on GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset demonstrate that our proposed YOLOv8+GC-M3 model improves the mAP@50 value from 65.78% to 66.32%, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model while reducing inference time. Furthermore, our proposed YOLOv8+SE-M3 model achieves the highest mAP@50 value of 67.07%, exceeding the SOTA performance. The implementation of this work is available at https://github.com/RuiyangJu/FCE-YOLOv8.

- **Summary**: As the uses of augmented reality (AR) become more complex and widely available, AR applications will increasingly incorporate intelligent features that require developers to understand the user's behavior and surrounding environment (e.g. an intelligent assistant). Such applications rely on video captured by an AR headset, which often contains disjointed camera movement with a limited field of view that cannot capture the full scope of what the user sees at any given time. Moreover, standard methods of visualizing object detection model outputs are limited to capturing objects within a single frame and timestep, and therefore fail to capture the temporal and spatial context that is often necessary for various domain applications. We propose ARPOV, an interactive visual analytics tool for analyzing object detection model outputs tailored to video captured by an AR headset that maximizes user understanding of model performance. The proposed tool leverages panorama stitching to expand the view of the environment while automatically filtering undesirable frames, and includes interactive features that facilitate object detection model debugging. ARPOV was designed as part of a collaboration between visualization researchers and machine learning and AR experts; we validate our design choices through interviews with 5 domain experts.

- **Summary**: We present an approach for pose and burial fraction estimation of debris field barrels found on the seabed in the Southern California San Pedro Basin. Our computational workflow leverages recent advances in foundation models for segmentation and a vision transformer-based approach to estimate the point cloud which defines the geometry of the barrel. We propose BarrelNet for estimating the 6-DOF pose and radius of buried barrels from the barrel point clouds as input. We train BarrelNet using synthetically generated barrel point clouds, and qualitatively demonstrate the potential of our approach using remotely operated vehicle (ROV) video footage of barrels found at a historic dump site. We compare our method to a traditional least squares fitting approach and show significant improvement according to our defined benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains play a vital role in a pathologist's analysis of medical images, providing crucial diagnostic information for various diseases. Virtual staining from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) allows the automatic production of other useful IHC stains without the expensive physical staining process. However, current virtual WSI generation methods based on tile-wise processing often suffer from inconsistencies in content, texture, and color at tile boundaries. These inconsistencies lead to artifacts that compromise image quality and potentially hinder accurate clinical assessment and diagnoses. To address this limitation, we propose a novel consistent WSI synthesis network, CC-WSI-Net, that extends GAN models to produce seamless synthetic whole slide images. Our CC-WSI-Net integrates a content- and color-consistency supervisor, ensuring consistency across tiles and facilitating the generation of seamless synthetic WSIs while ensuring Sox10 immunohistochemistry accuracy in melanocyte detection. We validate our method through extensive image-quality analyses, objective detection assessments, and a subjective survey with pathologists. By generating high-quality synthetic WSIs, our method opens doors for advanced virtual staining techniques with broader applications in research and clinical care.

- **Summary**: Subsampling layers play a crucial role in deep nets by discarding a portion of an activation map to reduce its spatial dimensions. This encourages the deep net to learn higher-level representations. Contrary to this motivation, we hypothesize that the discarded activations are useful and can be incorporated on the fly to improve models' prediction. To validate our hypothesis, we propose a search and aggregate method to find useful activation maps to be used at test time. We applied our approach to the task of image classification and semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments over nine different architectures on multiple datasets show that our method consistently improves model test-time performance, complementing existing test-time augmentation techniques. Our code is available at https://github.com/ca-joe-yang/discard-in-subsampling.

- **Summary**: Advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved medical task performance, such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Report Generation (RG). However, the fairness of these models across diverse demographic groups remains underexplored, despite its importance in healthcare. This oversight is partly due to the lack of demographic diversity in existing medical multimodal datasets, which complicates the evaluation of fairness. In response, we propose FMBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the fairness of MLLMs performance across diverse demographic attributes. FMBench has the following key features: 1: It includes four demographic attributes: race, ethnicity, language, and gender, across two tasks, VQA and RG, under zero-shot settings. 2: Our VQA task is free-form, enhancing real-world applicability and mitigating the biases associated with predefined choices. 3: We utilize both lexical metrics and LLM-based metrics, aligned with clinical evaluations, to assess models not only for linguistic accuracy but also from a clinical perspective. Furthermore, we introduce a new metric, Fairness-Aware Performance (FAP), to evaluate how fairly MLLMs perform across various demographic attributes. We thoroughly evaluate the performance and fairness of eight state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs, including both general and medical MLLMs, ranging from 7B to 26B parameters on the proposed benchmark. We aim for FMBench to assist the research community in refining model evaluation and driving future advancements in the field. All data and code will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: The escalating use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as remote sensing platforms has garnered considerable attention, proving invaluable for ground object recognition. While satellite remote sensing images face limitations in resolution and weather susceptibility, UAV remote sensing, employing low-speed unmanned aircraft, offers enhanced object resolution and agility. The advent of advanced machine learning techniques has propelled significant strides in image analysis, particularly in semantic segmentation for UAV remote sensing images. This paper evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of SegFormer, a semantic segmentation framework, for the semantic segmentation of UAV images. SegFormer variants, ranging from real-time (B0) to high-performance (B5) models, are assessed using the UAVid dataset tailored for semantic segmentation tasks. The research details the architecture and training procedures specific to SegFormer in the context of UAV semantic segmentation. Experimental results showcase the model's performance on benchmark dataset, highlighting its ability to accurately delineate objects and land cover features in diverse UAV scenarios, leading to both high efficiency and performance.

- **Summary**: Few-shot medical image segmentation (FSMIS) aims to perform the limited annotated data learning in the medical image analysis scope. Despite the progress has been achieved, current FSMIS models are all trained and deployed on the same data domain, as is not consistent with the clinical reality that medical imaging data is always across different data domains (e.g. imaging modalities, institutions and equipment sequences). How to enhance the FSMIS models to generalize well across the different specific medical imaging domains? In this paper, we focus on the matching mechanism of the few-shot semantic segmentation models and introduce an Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) calculation based domain robust matching mechanism for the cross-domain scenario. Specifically, we formulate the EMD transportation process between the foreground support-query features, the texture structure aware weights generation method, which proposes to perform the sobel based image gradient calculation over the nodes, is introduced in the EMD matching flow to restrain the domain relevant nodes. Besides, the point set level distance measurement metric is introduced to calculated the cost for the transportation from support set nodes to query set nodes. To evaluate the performance of our model, we conduct experiments on three scenarios (i.e., cross-modal, cross-sequence and cross-institution), which includes eight medical datasets and involves three body regions, and the results demonstrate that our model achieves the SoTA performance against the compared models.

- **Summary**: The fuzzy object detection is a challenging field of research in computer vision (CV). Distinguishing between fuzzy and non-fuzzy object detection in CV is important. Fuzzy objects such as fire, smoke, mist, and steam present significantly greater complexities in terms of visual features, blurred edges, varying shapes, opacity, and volume compared to non-fuzzy objects such as trees and cars. Collection of a balanced and diverse dataset and accurate annotation is crucial to achieve better ML models for fuzzy objects, however, the task of collection and annotation is still highly manual. In this research, we propose and leverage an alternative method of generating and automatically annotating fully synthetic fire images based on 3D models for training an object detection model. Moreover, the performance, and efficiency of the trained ML models on synthetic images is compared with ML models trained on real imagery and mixed imagery. Findings proved the effectiveness of the synthetic data for fire detection, while the performance improves as the test dataset covers a broader spectrum of real fires. Our findings illustrates that when synthetic imagery and real imagery is utilized in a mixed training set the resulting ML model outperforms models trained on real imagery as well as models trained on synthetic imagery for detection of a broad spectrum of fires. The proposed method for automating the annotation of synthetic fuzzy objects imagery carries substantial implications for reducing both time and cost in creating computer vision models specifically tailored for detecting fuzzy objects.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become popular in computer vision tasks. Backdoor attacks, which trigger undesirable behaviours in models during inference, threaten ViTs' performance, particularly in security-sensitive tasks. Although backdoor defences have been developed for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), they are less effective for ViTs, and defences tailored to ViTs are scarce. To address this, we present Interleaved Ensemble Unlearning (IEU), a method for finetuning clean ViTs on backdoored datasets. In stage 1, a shallow ViT is finetuned to have high confidence on backdoored data and low confidence on clean data. In stage 2, the shallow ViT acts as a ``gate'' to block potentially poisoned data from the defended ViT. This data is added to an unlearn set and asynchronously unlearned via gradient ascent. We demonstrate IEU's effectiveness on three datasets against 11 state-of-the-art backdoor attacks and show its versatility by applying it to different model architectures.
