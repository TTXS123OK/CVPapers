- **Summary**: This work proposes to augment the lifting steps of the conventional wavelet transform with additional neural network assisted lifting steps. These additional steps reduce residual redundancy (notably aliasing information) amongst the wavelet subbands, and also improve the visual quality of reconstructed images at reduced resolutions. The proposed approach involves two steps, a high-to-low step followed by a low-to-high step. The high-to-low step suppresses aliasing in the low-pass band by using the detail bands at the same resolution, while the low-to-high step aims to further remove redundancy from detail bands, so as to achieve higher energy compaction. The proposed two lifting steps are trained in an end-to-end fashion; we employ a backward annealing approach to overcome the non-differentiability of the quantization and cost functions during back-propagation. Importantly, the networks employed in this paper are compact and with limited non-linearities, allowing a fully scalable system; one pair of trained network parameters are applied for all levels of decomposition and for all bit-rates of interest. By employing the proposed approach within the JPEG 2000 image coding standard, our method can achieve up to 17.4% average BD bit-rate saving over a wide range of bit-rates, while retaining quality and resolution scalability features of JPEG 2000.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a novel point generation model, referred to as Pillar-based Point Generation Network (PillarGen), which facilitates the transformation of point clouds from one domain into another. PillarGen can produce synthetic point clouds with enhanced density and quality based on the provided input point clouds. The PillarGen model performs the following three steps: 1) pillar encoding, 2) Occupied Pillar Prediction (OPP), and 3) Pillar to Point Generation (PPG). The input point clouds are encoded using a pillar grid structure to generate pillar features. Then, OPP determines the active pillars used for point generation and predicts the center of points and the number of points to be generated for each active pillar. PPG generates the synthetic points for each active pillar based on the information provided by OPP. We evaluate the performance of PillarGen using our proprietary radar dataset, focusing on enhancing the density and quality of short-range radar data using the long-range radar data as supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that PillarGen outperforms traditional point upsampling methods in quantitative and qualitative measures. We also confirm that when PillarGen is incorporated into bird's eye view object detection, a significant improvement in detection accuracy is achieved.

- **Summary**: Generative models have shown strong generation ability while efficient likelihood estimation is less explored. Energy-based models~(EBMs) define a flexible energy function to parameterize unnormalized densities efficiently but are notorious for being difficult to train. Adversarial EBMs introduce a generator to form a minimax training game to avoid expensive MCMC sampling used in traditional EBMs, but a noticeable gap between adversarial EBMs and other strong generative models still exists. Inspired by diffusion-based models, we embedded EBMs into each denoising step to split a long-generated process into several smaller steps. Besides, we employ a symmetric Jeffrey divergence and introduce a variational posterior distribution for the generator's training to address the main challenges that exist in adversarial EBMs. Our experiments show significant improvement in generation compared to existing adversarial EBMs, while also providing a useful energy function for efficient density estimation.

- **Summary**: This paper presents Incremental Vision-Language Object Detection (IVLOD), a novel learning task designed to incrementally adapt pre-trained Vision-Language Object Detection Models (VLODMs) to various specialized domains, while simultaneously preserving their zero-shot generalization capabilities for the generalized domain. To address this new challenge, we present the Zero-interference Reparameterizable Adaptation (ZiRa), a novel method that introduces Zero-interference Loss and reparameterization techniques to tackle IVLOD without incurring additional inference costs or a significant increase in memory usage. Comprehensive experiments on COCO and ODinW-13 datasets demonstrate that ZiRa effectively safeguards the zero-shot generalization ability of VLODMs while continuously adapting to new tasks. Specifically, after training on ODinW-13 datasets, ZiRa exhibits superior performance compared to CL-DETR and iDETR, boosting zero-shot generalizability by substantial 13.91 and 8.71 AP, respectively.

- **Summary**: Real-time 6 DOF localization of bronchoscopes is crucial for enhancing intervention quality. However, current vision-based technologies struggle to balance between generalization to unseen data and computational speed. In this study, we propose a Depth-based Dual-Loop framework for real-time Visually Navigated Bronchoscopy (DD-VNB) that can generalize across patient cases without the need of re-training. The DD-VNB framework integrates two key modules: depth estimation and dual-loop localization. To address the domain gap among patients, we propose a knowledge-embedded depth estimation network that maps endoscope frames to depth, ensuring generalization by eliminating patient-specific textures. The network embeds view synthesis knowledge into a cycle adversarial architecture for scale-constrained monocular depth estimation. For real-time performance, our localization module embeds a fast ego-motion estimation network into the loop of depth registration. The ego-motion inference network estimates the pose change of the bronchoscope in high frequency while depth registration against the pre-operative 3D model provides absolute pose periodically. Specifically, the relative pose changes are fed into the registration process as the initial guess to boost its accuracy and speed. Experiments on phantom and in-vivo data from patients demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework: 1) monocular depth estimation outperforms SOTA, 2) localization achieves an accuracy of Absolute Tracking Error (ATE) of 4.7 $\pm$ 3.17 mm in phantom and 6.49 $\pm$ 3.88 mm in patient data, 3) with a frame-rate approaching video capture speed, 4) without the necessity of case-wise network retraining. The framework's superior speed and accuracy demonstrate its promising clinical potential for real-time bronchoscopic navigation.

- **Summary**: In the imaging process of an astronomical telescope, the deconvolution of its beam or Point Spread Function (PSF) is a crucial task. However, deconvolution presents a classical and challenging inverse computation problem. In scenarios where the beam or PSF is complex or inaccurately measured, such as in interferometric arrays and certain radio telescopes, the resultant blurry images are often challenging to interpret visually or analyze using traditional physical detection methods. We argue that traditional methods frequently lack specific prior knowledge, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue and achieve image deconvolution and reconstruction, we propose an unsupervised network architecture that incorporates prior physical information. The network adopts an encoder-decoder structure while leveraging the telescope's PSF as prior knowledge. During network training, we introduced accelerated Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) convolution to enable efficient processing of high-resolution input images and PSFs. We explored various classic regression networks, including autoencoder (AE) and U-Net, and conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation through comparative analysis.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image generative models can generate high-quality humans, but realism is lost when generating hands. Common artifacts include irregular hand poses, shapes, incorrect numbers of fingers, and physically implausible finger orientations. To generate images with realistic hands, we propose a novel diffusion-based architecture called HanDiffuser that achieves realism by injecting hand embeddings in the generative process. HanDiffuser consists of two components: a Text-to-Hand-Params diffusion model to generate SMPL-Body and MANO-Hand parameters from input text prompts, and a Text-Guided Hand-Params-to-Image diffusion model to synthesize images by conditioning on the prompts and hand parameters generated by the previous component. We incorporate multiple aspects of hand representation, including 3D shapes and joint-level finger positions, orientations and articulations, for robust learning and reliable performance during inference. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments and perform user studies to demonstrate the efficacy of our method in generating images with high-quality hands.

- **Summary**: Channel attention mechanisms endeavor to recalibrate channel weights to enhance representation abilities of networks. However, mainstream methods often rely solely on global average pooling as the feature squeezer, which significantly limits the overall potential of models. In this paper, we investigate the statistical moments of feature maps within a neural network. Our findings highlight the critical role of high-order moments in enhancing model capacity. Consequently, we introduce a flexible and comprehensive mechanism termed Extensive Moment Aggregation (EMA) to capture the global spatial context. Building upon this mechanism, we propose the Moment Channel Attention (MCA) framework, which efficiently incorporates multiple levels of moment-based information while minimizing additional computation costs through our Cross Moment Convolution (CMC) module. The CMC module via channel-wise convolution layer to capture multiple order moment information as well as cross channel features. The MCA block is designed to be lightweight and easily integrated into a variety of neural network architectures. Experimental results on classical image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing channel attention methods.

- **Summary**: In order to successfully perform manipulation tasks in new environments, such as grasping, robots must be proficient in segmenting unseen objects from the background and/or other objects. Previous works perform unseen object instance segmentation (UOIS) by training deep neural networks on large-scale data to learn RGB/RGB-D feature embeddings, where cluttered environments often result in inaccurate segmentations. We build upon these methods and introduce a novel approach to correct inaccurate segmentation, such as under-segmentation, of static image-based UOIS masks by using robot interaction and a designed body frame-invariant feature. We demonstrate that the relative linear and rotational velocities of frames randomly attached to rigid bodies due to robot interactions can be used to identify objects and accumulate corrected object-level segmentation masks. By introducing motion to regions of segmentation uncertainty, we are able to drastically improve segmentation accuracy in an uncertainty-driven manner with minimal, non-disruptive interactions (ca. 2-3 per scene). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed interactive perception pipeline in accurately segmenting cluttered scenes by achieving an average object segmentation accuracy rate of 80.7%, an increase of 28.2% when compared with other state-of-the-art UOIS methods.

- **Summary**: Recently, 3D hand reconstruction has gained more attention in human-computer cooperation, especially for hand-object interaction scenario. However, it still remains huge challenge due to severe hand-occlusion caused by interaction, which contain the balance of accuracy and physical plausibility, highly nonlinear mapping of model parameters and occlusion feature enhancement. To overcome these issues, we propose a 3D hand reconstruction network combining the benefits of model-based and model-free approaches to balance accuracy and physical plausibility for hand-object interaction scenario. Firstly, we present a novel MANO pose parameters regression module from 2D joints directly, which avoids the process of highly nonlinear mapping from abstract image feature and no longer depends on accurate 3D joints. Moreover, we further propose a vertex-joint mutual graph-attention model guided by MANO to jointly refine hand meshes and joints, which model the dependencies of vertex-vertex and joint-joint and capture the correlation of vertex-joint for aggregating intra-graph and inter-graph node features respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a competitive performance on recently benchmark datasets HO3DV2 and Dex-YCB, and outperforms all only model-base approaches and model-free approaches.

- **Summary**: Motion synthesis in real-world 3D scenes has recently attracted much attention. However, the static environment assumption made by most current methods usually cannot be satisfied especially for real-time motion synthesis in scanned point cloud scenes, if multiple dynamic objects exist, e.g., moving persons or vehicles. To handle this problem, we propose the first Dynamic Environment MOtion Synthesis framework (DEMOS) to predict future motion instantly according to the current scene, and use it to dynamically update the latent motion for final motion synthesis. Concretely, we propose a Spherical-BEV perception method to extract local scene features that are specifically designed for instant scene-aware motion prediction. Then, we design a time-variant motion blending to fuse the new predicted motions into the latent motion, and the final motion is derived from the updated latent motions, benefitting both from motion-prior and iterative methods. We unify the data format of two prevailing datasets, PROX and GTA-IM, and take them for motion synthesis evaluation in 3D scenes. We also assess the effectiveness of the proposed method in dynamic environments from GTA-IM and Semantic3D to check the responsiveness. The results show our method outperforms previous works significantly and has great performance in handling dynamic environments.

- **Summary**: Recently, model merging techniques have surfaced as a solution to combine multiple single-talent models into a single multi-talent model. However, previous endeavors in this field have either necessitated additional training or fine-tuning processes, or require that the models possess the same pre-trained initialization. In this work, we identify a common drawback in prior works w.r.t. the inconsistency of unit similarity in the weight space and the activation space. To address this inconsistency, we propose an innovative model merging framework, coined as merging under dual-space constraints (MuDSC). Specifically, instead of solely maximizing the objective of a single space, we advocate for the exploration of permutation matrices situated in a region with a unified high similarity in the dual space, achieved through the linear combination of activation and weight similarity matrices. In order to enhance usability, we have also incorporated adaptations for group structure, including Multi-Head Attention and Group Normalization. Comprehensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that MuDSC can significantly boost the performance of merged models with various task combinations and architectures. Furthermore, the visualization of the merged model within the multi-task loss landscape reveals that MuDSC enables the merged model to reside in the overlapping segment, featuring a unified lower loss for each task.

- **Summary**: Handwritten mathematical expression recognition (HMER) is challenging in image-to-text tasks due to the complex layouts of mathematical expressions and suffers from problems including over-parsing and under-parsing. To solve these, previous HMER methods improve the attention mechanism by utilizing historical alignment information. However, this approach has limitations in addressing under-parsing since it cannot correct the erroneous attention on image areas that should be parsed at subsequent decoding steps. This faulty attention causes the attention module to incorporate future context into the current decoding step, thereby confusing the alignment process. To address this issue, we propose an attention guidance mechanism to explicitly suppress attention weights in irrelevant areas and enhance the appropriate ones, thereby inhibiting access to information outside the intended context. Depending on the type of attention guidance, we devise two complementary approaches to refine attention weights: self-guidance that coordinates attention of multiple heads and neighbor-guidance that integrates attention from adjacent time steps. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving expression recognition rates of 60.75% / 61.81% / 63.30% on the CROHME 2014/ 2016/ 2019 datasets.

- **Summary**: Existing explanation results of functional connectivity (FC) are normally generated by using classification result labels and correlation analysis methods such as Pearson's correlation or gradient backward. However, the diagnostic model is still trained on the black box model and might lack the attention of FCs in important regions during the training. To enhance the explainability and improve diagnostic performance, providing prior knowledge on neurodegeneration-related regions when healthy subjects (HC) develop into subject cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) for the diagnostic model is a key step. To better determine the neurodegeneration-related regions, we employ counterfactual reasoning to generate the target label FC matrices derived from source label FC and then subtract source label FC with target label FC. The counterfactual reasoning architecture is constructed by adaptive forward and backward transformer generative adversarial network (AFBT GAN), which is specifically designed by network property in FC and inverse patch embedding operation in the transformer. The specific design can make the model focus more on the current network correlation and employ the global insight of the transformer to reconstruct FC, which both help the generation of high-quality target label FC. The validation experiments are conducted on both clinical and public datasets, the generated attention map are both vital correlated to cognitive function and the diagnostic performance is also significant. The code is available at https://github.com/SXR3015/AFBT-GAN.

- **Summary**: Machine learning has achieved remarkable success in many applications. However, existing studies are largely based on the closed-world assumption, which assumes that the environment is stationary, and the model is fixed once deployed. In many real-world applications, this fundamental and rather naive assumption may not hold because an open environment is complex, dynamic, and full of unknowns. In such cases, rejecting unknowns, discovering novelties, and then incrementally learning them, could enable models to be safe and evolve continually as biological systems do. This paper provides a holistic view of open-world machine learning by investigating unknown rejection, novel class discovery, and class-incremental learning in a unified paradigm. The challenges, principles, and limitations of current methodologies are discussed in detail. Finally, we discuss several potential directions for future research. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the emerging open-world machine learning paradigm, to help researchers build more powerful AI systems in their respective fields, and to promote the development of artificial general intelligence.

- **Summary**: Social robots often rely on visual perception to understand their users and the environment. Recent advancements in data-driven approaches for computer vision have demonstrated great potentials for applying deep-learning models to enhance a social robot's visual perception. However, the high computational demands of deep-learning methods, as opposed to the more resource-efficient shallow-learning models, bring up important questions regarding their effects on real-world interaction and user experience. It is unclear how will the objective interaction performance and subjective user experience be influenced when a social robot adopts a deep-learning based visual perception model. We employed state-of-the-art human perception and tracking models to improve the visual perception function of the Pepper robot and conducted a controlled lab study and an in-the-wild human-robot interaction study to evaluate this novel perception function for following a specific user with other people present in the scene.

- **Summary**: Understanding the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is an important area of research. In this study, we introduce a dynamic benchmark, NPHardEval4V, aimed at addressing the existing gaps in evaluating the pure reasoning abilities of MLLMs. Our benchmark aims to provide a venue to disentangle the effect of various factors such as image recognition and instruction following, from the overall performance of the models, allowing us to focus solely on evaluating their reasoning abilities. It is built by converting textual description of questions from NPHardEval to image representations. Our findings reveal significant discrepancies in reasoning abilities across different models and highlight the relatively weak performance of MLLMs compared to LLMs in terms of reasoning. We also investigate the impact of different prompting styles, including visual, text, and combined visual and text prompts, on the reasoning abilities of MLLMs, demonstrating the different impacts of multimodal inputs in model performance. Unlike traditional benchmarks, which focus primarily on static evaluations, our benchmark will be updated monthly to prevent overfitting and ensure a more authentic and fine-grained evaluation of the models. We believe that this benchmark can aid in understanding and guide the further development of reasoning abilities in MLLMs. The benchmark dataset and code are available at https://github.com/lizhouf/NPHardEval4V

- **Summary**: Image-based virtual try-on (VTON), which aims to generate an outfitted image of a target human wearing an in-shop garment, is a challenging image-synthesis task calling for not only high fidelity of the outfitted human but also full preservation of garment details. To tackle this issue, we propose Outfitting over Try-on Diffusion (OOTDiffusion), leveraging the power of pretrained latent diffusion models and designing a novel network architecture for realistic and controllable virtual try-on. Without an explicit warping process, we propose an outfitting UNet to learn the garment detail features, and merge them with the target human body via our proposed outfitting fusion in the denoising process of diffusion models. In order to further enhance the controllability of our outfitting UNet, we introduce outfitting dropout to the training process, which enables us to adjust the strength of garment features through classifier-free guidance. Our comprehensive experiments on the VITON-HD and Dress Code datasets demonstrate that OOTDiffusion efficiently generates high-quality outfitted images for arbitrary human and garment images, which outperforms other VTON methods in both fidelity and controllability, indicating an impressive breakthrough in virtual try-on.

- **Summary**: In the realm of computer vision and graphics, accurately establishing correspondences between geometric 3D shapes is pivotal for applications like object tracking, registration, texture transfer, and statistical shape analysis. Moving beyond traditional hand-crafted and data-driven feature learning methods, we incorporate spectral methods with deep learning, focusing on functional maps (FMs) and optimal transport (OT). Traditional OT-based approaches, often reliant on entropy regularization OT in learning-based framework, face computational challenges due to their quadratic cost. Our key contribution is to employ the sliced Wasserstein distance (SWD) for OT, which is a valid fast optimal transport metric in an unsupervised shape matching framework. This unsupervised framework integrates functional map regularizers with a novel OT-based loss derived from SWD, enhancing feature alignment between shapes treated as discrete probability measures. We also introduce an adaptive refinement process utilizing entropy regularized OT, further refining feature alignments for accurate point-to-point correspondences. Our method demonstrates superior performance in non-rigid shape matching, including near-isometric and non-isometric scenarios, and excels in downstream tasks like segmentation transfer. The empirical results on diverse datasets highlight our framework's effectiveness and generalization capabilities, setting new standards in non-rigid shape matching with efficient OT metrics and an adaptive refinement module.

- **Summary**: Deepfake technology has given rise to a spectrum of novel and compelling applications. Unfortunately, the widespread proliferation of high-fidelity fake videos has led to pervasive confusion and deception, shattering our faith that seeing is believing. One aspect that has been overlooked so far is that current deepfake detection approaches may easily fall into the trap of overfitting, focusing only on forgery clues within one or a few local regions. Moreover, existing works heavily rely on neural networks to extract forgery features, lacking theoretical constraints guaranteeing that sufficient forgery clues are extracted and superfluous features are eliminated. These deficiencies culminate in unsatisfactory accuracy and limited generalizability in real-life scenarios.   In this paper, we try to tackle these challenges through three designs: (1) We present a novel framework to capture broader forgery clues by extracting multiple non-overlapping local representations and fusing them into a global semantic-rich feature. (2) Based on the information bottleneck theory, we derive Local Information Loss to guarantee the orthogonality of local representations while preserving comprehensive task-relevant information. (3) Further, to fuse the local representations and remove task-irrelevant information, we arrive at a Global Information Loss through the theoretical analysis of mutual information. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets.Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/QingyuLiu/Exposing-the-Deception}, hoping to inspire researchers.

- **Summary**: Detecting edges in images suffers from the problems of (P1) heavy imbalance between positive and negative classes as well as (P2) label uncertainty owing to disagreement between different annotators. Existing solutions address P1 using class-balanced cross-entropy loss and dice loss and P2 by only predicting edges agreed upon by most annotators. In this paper, we propose RankED, a unified ranking-based approach that addresses both the imbalance problem (P1) and the uncertainty problem (P2). RankED tackles these two problems with two components: One component which ranks positive pixels over negative pixels, and the second which promotes high confidence edge pixels to have more label certainty. We show that RankED outperforms previous studies and sets a new state-of-the-art on NYUD-v2, BSDS500 and Multi-cue datasets. Code is available at https://ranked-cvpr24.github.io.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral images (HSI) clustering is an important but challenging task. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods usually rely on superpixels, however, they do not fully utilize the spatial and spectral information in HSI 3-D structure, and their optimization targets are not clustering-oriented. In this work, we first use 3-D and 2-D hybrid convolutional neural networks to extract the high-order spatial and spectral features of HSI through pre-training, and then design a superpixel graph contrastive clustering (SPGCC) model to learn discriminative superpixel representations. Reasonable augmented views are crucial for contrastive clustering, and conventional contrastive learning may hurt the cluster structure since different samples are pushed away in the embedding space even if they belong to the same class. In SPGCC, we design two semantic-invariant data augmentations for HSI superpixels: pixel sampling augmentation and model weight augmentation. Then sample-level alignment and clustering-center-level contrast are performed for better intra-class similarity and inter-class dissimilarity of superpixel embeddings. We perform clustering and network optimization alternatively. Experimental results on several HSI datasets verify the advantages of the proposed method, e.g., on India Pines, our model improves the clustering accuracy from 58.79% to 67.59% compared to the SOTA method.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a Tri-branch Neural Fusion (TNF) approach designed for classifying multimodal medical images and tabular data. It also introduces two solutions to address the challenge of label inconsistency in multimodal classification. Traditional methods in multi-modality medical data classification often rely on single-label approaches, typically merging features from two distinct input modalities. This becomes problematic when features are mutually exclusive or labels differ across modalities, leading to reduced accuracy. To overcome this, our TNF approach implements a tri-branch framework that manages three separate outputs: one for image modality, another for tabular modality, and a third hybrid output that fuses both image and tabular data. The final decision is made through an ensemble method that integrates likelihoods from all three branches. We validate the effectiveness of TNF through extensive experiments, which illustrate its superiority over traditional fusion and ensemble methods in various convolutional neural networks and transformer-based architectures across multiple datasets.

- **Summary**: Three-dimensional point cloud anomaly detection that aims to detect anomaly data points from a training set serves as the foundation for a variety of applications, including industrial inspection and autonomous driving. However, existing point cloud anomaly detection methods often incorporate multiple feature memory banks to fully preserve local and global representations, which comes at the high cost of computational complexity and mismatches between features. To address that, we propose an unsupervised point cloud anomaly detection framework based on joint local-global features, termed PointCore. To be specific, PointCore only requires a single memory bank to store local (coordinate) and global (PointMAE) representations and different priorities are assigned to these local-global features, thereby reducing the computational cost and mismatching disturbance in inference. Furthermore, to robust against the outliers, a normalization ranking method is introduced to not only adjust values of different scales to a notionally common scale, but also transform densely-distributed data into a uniform distribution. Extensive experiments on Real3D-AD dataset demonstrate that PointCore achieves competitive inference time and the best performance in both detection and localization as compared to the state-of-the-art Reg3D-AD approach and several competitors.

- **Summary**: 3D asset generation is getting massive amounts of attention, inspired by the recent success of text-guided 2D content creation. Existing text-to-3D methods use pretrained text-to-image diffusion models in an optimization problem or fine-tune them on synthetic data, which often results in non-photorealistic 3D objects without backgrounds. In this paper, we present a method that leverages pretrained text-to-image models as a prior, and learn to generate multi-view images in a single denoising process from real-world data. Concretely, we propose to integrate 3D volume-rendering and cross-frame-attention layers into each block of the existing U-Net network of the text-to-image model. Moreover, we design an autoregressive generation that renders more 3D-consistent images at any viewpoint. We train our model on real-world datasets of objects and showcase its capabilities to generate instances with a variety of high-quality shapes and textures in authentic surroundings. Compared to the existing methods, the results generated by our method are consistent, and have favorable visual quality (-30% FID, -37% KID).

- **Summary**: 3D hand pose estimation has found broad application in areas such as gesture recognition and human-machine interaction tasks. As performance improves, the complexity of the systems also increases, which can limit the comparative analysis and practical implementation of these methods. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective baseline that not only surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods but also demonstrates computational efficiency. To establish this baseline, we abstract existing work into two components: a token generator and a mesh regressor, and then examine their core structures. A core structure, in this context, is one that fulfills intrinsic functions, brings about significant improvements, and achieves excellent performance without unnecessary complexities. Our proposed approach is decoupled from any modifications to the backbone, making it adaptable to any modern models. Our method outperforms existing solutions, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across multiple datasets. On the FreiHAND dataset, our approach produced a PA-MPJPE of 5.7mm and a PA-MPVPE of 6.0mm. Similarly, on the Dexycb dataset, we observed a PA-MPJPE of 5.5mm and a PA-MPVPE of 5.0mm. As for performance speed, our method reached up to 33 frames per second (fps) when using HRNet and up to 70 fps when employing FastViT-MA36

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) has been proposed to alleviate the burden of time-consuming pixel-level manual labeling, which leverages limited labeled data along with larger amounts of unlabeled data. Current state-of-the-art methods train the labeled data with ground truths and unlabeled data with pseudo labels. However, the two training flows are separate, which allows labeled data to dominate the training process, resulting in low-quality pseudo labels and, consequently, sub-optimal results. To alleviate this issue, we present AllSpark, which reborns the labeled features from unlabeled ones with the channel-wise cross-attention mechanism. We further introduce a Semantic Memory along with a Channel Semantic Grouping strategy to ensure that unlabeled features adequately represent labeled features. The AllSpark shed new light on the architecture level designs of SSSS rather than framework level, which avoids increasingly complicated training pipeline designs. It can also be regarded as a flexible bottleneck module that can be seamlessly integrated into a general transformer-based segmentation model. The proposed AllSpark outperforms existing methods across all evaluation protocols on Pascal, Cityscapes and COCO benchmarks without bells-and-whistles.

- **Summary**: Recent human-object interaction (HOI) detection approaches rely on high cost of manpower and require comprehensive annotated image datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel self-adaption language-driven HOI detection method, termed as FreeA, without labeling by leveraging the adaptability of CLIP to generate latent HOI labels. To be specific, FreeA matches image features of human-object pairs with HOI text templates, and a priori knowledge-based mask method is developed to suppress improbable interactions. In addition, FreeA utilizes the proposed interaction correlation matching method to enhance the likelihood of actions related to a specified action, further refine the generated HOI labels. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that FreeA achieves state-of-the-art performance among weakly supervised HOI models. Our approach is +8.58 mean Average Precision (mAP) on HICO-DET and +1.23 mAP on V-COCO more accurate in localizing and classifying the interactive actions than the newest weakly model, and +1.68 mAP and +7.28 mAP than the latest weakly+ model, respectively.

- **Summary**: As machine learning (ML) algorithms get deployed in an ever-increasing number of applications, these algorithms need to achieve better trade-offs between high accuracy, high throughput and low latency. This paper introduces NASH, a novel approach that applies neural architecture search to machine learning hardware. Using NASH, hardware designs can achieve not only high throughput and low latency but also superior accuracy performance. We present four versions of the NASH strategy in this paper, all of which show higher accuracy than the original models. The strategy can be applied to various convolutional neural networks, selecting specific model operations among many to guide the training process toward higher accuracy. Experimental results show that applying NASH on ResNet18 or ResNet34 achieves a top 1 accuracy increase of up to 3.1% and a top 5 accuracy increase of up to 2.2% compared to the non-NASH version when tested on the ImageNet data set. We also integrated this approach into the FINN hardware model synthesis tool to automate the application of our approach and the generation of the hardware model. Results show that using FINN can achieve a maximum throughput of 324.5 fps. In addition, NASH models can also result in a better trade-off between accuracy and hardware resource utilization. The accuracy-hardware (HW) Pareto curve shows that the models with the four NASH versions represent the best trade-offs achieving the highest accuracy for a given HW utilization. The code for our implementation is open-source and publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/MFJI/NASH.

- **Summary**: Large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP, despite having remarkable generalization ability, are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. This work studies the adversarial robustness of VLMs from the novel perspective of the text prompt instead of the extensively studied model weights (frozen in this work). We first show that the effectiveness of both adversarial attack and defense are sensitive to the used text prompt. Inspired by this, we propose a method to improve resilience to adversarial attacks by learning a robust text prompt for VLMs. The proposed method, named Adversarial Prompt Tuning (APT), is effective while being both computationally and data efficient. Extensive experiments are conducted across 15 datasets and 4 data sparsity schemes (from 1-shot to full training data settings) to show APT's superiority over hand-engineered prompts and other state-of-the-art adaption methods. APT demonstrated excellent abilities in terms of the in-distribution performance and the generalization under input distribution shift and across datasets. Surprisingly, by simply adding one learned word to the prompts, APT can significantly boost the accuracy and robustness (epsilon=4/255) over the hand-engineered prompts by +13% and +8.5% on average respectively. The improvement further increases, in our most effective setting, to +26.4% for accuracy and +16.7% for robustness. Code is available at https://github.com/TreeLLi/APT.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in large-scale pre-trained text-to-image models have led to remarkable progress in semantic image synthesis. Nevertheless, synthesizing high-quality images with consistent semantics and layout remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose the adaPtive LAyout-semantiC fusion modulE (PLACE) that harnesses pre-trained models to alleviate the aforementioned issues. Specifically, we first employ the layout control map to faithfully represent layouts in the feature space. Subsequently, we combine the layout and semantic features in a timestep-adaptive manner to synthesize images with realistic details. During fine-tuning, we propose the Semantic Alignment (SA) loss to further enhance layout alignment. Additionally, we introduce the Layout-Free Prior Preservation (LFP) loss, which leverages unlabeled data to maintain the priors of pre-trained models, thereby improving the visual quality and semantic consistency of synthesized images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach performs favorably in terms of visual quality, semantic consistency, and layout alignment.

- **Summary**: Detecting surface anomalies of industrial materials poses a significant challenge within a myriad of industrial manufacturing processes. In recent times, various methodologies have emerged, capitalizing on the advantages of employing a network pre-trained on natural images for the extraction of representative features. Subsequently, these features are subjected to processing through a diverse range of techniques including memory banks, normalizing flow, and knowledge distillation, which have exhibited exceptional accuracy. This paper revisits approaches based on pre-trained features by introducing a novel method centered on target-specific embedding. To capture the most representative features of the texture under consideration, we employ a variant of a contrastive training procedure that incorporates both artificially generated defective samples and anomaly-free samples during training. Exploiting the intrinsic properties of surfaces, we derived a meaningful representation from the defect-free samples during training, facilitating a straightforward yet effective calculation of anomaly scores. The experiments conducted on the MVTEC AD and TILDA datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Indoor scenes we are living in are visually homogenous or textureless, while they inherently have structural forms and provide enough structural priors for 3D scene reconstruction. Motivated by this fact, we propose a structure-aware online signed distance fields (SDF) reconstruction framework in indoor scenes, especially under the Atlanta world (AW) assumption. Thus, we dub this incremental SDF reconstruction for AW as AiSDF. Within the online framework, we infer the underlying Atlanta structure of a given scene and then estimate planar surfel regions supporting the Atlanta structure. This Atlanta-aware surfel representation provides an explicit planar map for a given scene. In addition, based on these Atlanta planar surfel regions, we adaptively sample and constrain the structural regularity in the SDF reconstruction, which enables us to improve the reconstruction quality by maintaining a high-level structure while enhancing the details of a given scene. We evaluate the proposed AiSDF on the ScanNet and ReplicaCAD datasets, where we demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of reconstructing fine details of objects implicitly, as well as structures explicitly in room-scale scenes.

- **Summary**: For autonomous navigation, high definition maps are a widely used source of information. Pole-like features encoded in HD maps such as traffic signs, traffic lights or street lights can be used as landmarks for localization. For this purpose, they first need to be detected by the vehicle using its embedded sensors. While geometric models can be used to process 3D point clouds retrieved by lidar sensors, modern image-based approaches rely on deep neural network and therefore heavily depend on annotated training data. In this paper, a 2D HD map is used to automatically annotate pole-like features in images. In the absence of height information, the map features are represented as pole bases at the ground level. We show how an additional lidar sensor can be used to filter out occluded features and refine the ground projection. We also demonstrate how an object detector can be trained to detect a pole base. To evaluate our methodology, it is first validated with data manually annotated from semantic segmentation and then compared to our own automatically generated annotated data recorded in the city of Compi{\`e}gne, France. Erratum: In the original version [1], an error occurred in the accuracy evaluation of the different models studied and the evaluation method applied on the detection results was not clearly defined. In this revision, we offer a rectification to this segment, presenting updated results, especially in terms of Mean Absolute Errors (MAE).

- **Summary**: Video motion magnification is a technique to capture and amplify subtle motion in a video that is invisible to the naked eye. The deep learning-based prior work successfully demonstrates the modelling of the motion magnification problem with outstanding quality compared to conventional signal processing-based ones. However, it still lags behind real-time performance, which prevents it from being extended to various online applications. In this paper, we investigate an efficient deep learning-based motion magnification model that runs in real time for full-HD resolution videos. Due to the specified network design of the prior art, i.e. inhomogeneous architecture, the direct application of existing neural architecture search methods is complicated. Instead of automatic search, we carefully investigate the architecture module by module for its role and importance in the motion magnification task. Two key findings are 1) Reducing the spatial resolution of the latent motion representation in the decoder provides a good trade-off between computational efficiency and task quality, and 2) surprisingly, only a single linear layer and a single branch in the encoder are sufficient for the motion magnification task. Based on these findings, we introduce a real-time deep learning-based motion magnification model with4.2X fewer FLOPs and is 2.7X faster than the prior art while maintaining comparable quality.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we abstract the process of people hearing speech, extracting meaningful cues, and creating various dynamically audio-consistent talking faces, termed Listening and Imagining, into the task of high-fidelity diverse talking faces generation from a single audio. Specifically, it involves two critical challenges: one is to effectively decouple identity, content, and emotion from entangled audio, and the other is to maintain intra-video diversity and inter-video consistency. To tackle the issues, we first dig out the intricate relationships among facial factors and simplify the decoupling process, tailoring a Progressive Audio Disentanglement for accurate facial geometry and semantics learning, where each stage incorporates a customized training module responsible for a specific factor. Secondly, to achieve visually diverse and audio-synchronized animation solely from input audio within a single model, we introduce the Controllable Coherent Frame generation, which involves the flexible integration of three trainable adapters with frozen Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to focus on maintaining facial geometry and semantics, as well as texture and temporal coherence between frames. In this way, we inherit high-quality diverse generation from LDMs while significantly improving their controllability at a low training cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our method in handling this paradigm. The codes will be released at https://github.com/modelscope/facechain.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is an important and popular research area in computer vision that focuses on classifying pixels in an image based on their semantics. However, supervised deep learning requires large amounts of data to train models and the process of labeling images pixel by pixel is time-consuming and laborious. This review aims to provide a first comprehensive and organized overview of the state-of-the-art research results on pseudo-label methods in the field of semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which we categorize from different perspectives and present specific methods for specific application areas. In addition, we explore the application of pseudo-label technology in medical and remote-sensing image segmentation. Finally, we also propose some feasible future research directions to address the existing challenges.

- **Summary**: Modern computer vision pipelines handle large images in one of two sub-optimal ways: down-sampling or cropping. These two methods incur significant losses in the amount of information and context present in an image. There are many downstream applications in which global context matters as much as high frequency details, such as in real-world satellite imagery; in such cases researchers have to make the uncomfortable choice of which information to discard. We introduce xT, a simple framework for vision transformers which effectively aggregates global context with local details and can model large images end-to-end on contemporary GPUs. We select a set of benchmark datasets across classic vision tasks which accurately reflect a vision model's ability to understand truly large images and incorporate fine details over large scales and assess our method's improvement on them. By introducing a nested tokenization scheme for large images in conjunction with long-sequence length models normally used for natural language processing, we are able to increase accuracy by up to 8.6% on challenging classification tasks and $F_1$ score by 11.6 on context-dependent segmentation in large images.

- **Summary**: Gene selection plays a pivotal role in oncology research for improving outcome prediction accuracy and facilitating cost-effective genomic profiling for cancer patients. This paper introduces two gene selection strategies for deep learning-based survival prediction models. The first strategy uses a sparsity-inducing method while the second one uses importance based gene selection for identifying relevant genes. Our overall approach leverages the power of deep learning to model complex biological data structures, while sparsity-inducing methods ensure the selection process focuses on the most informative genes, minimizing noise and redundancy. Through comprehensive experimentation on diverse genomic and survival datasets, we demonstrate that our strategy not only identifies gene signatures with high predictive power for survival outcomes but can also streamlines the process for low-cost genomic profiling. The implications of this research are profound as it offers a scalable and effective tool for advancing personalized medicine and targeted cancer therapies. By pushing the boundaries of gene selection methodologies, our work contributes significantly to the ongoing efforts in cancer genomics, promising improved diagnostic and prognostic capabilities in clinical settings.

- **Summary**: Accurate and consistent methods for counting trees based on remote sensing data are needed to support sustainable forest management, assess climate change mitigation strategies, and build trust in tree carbon credits. Two-dimensional remote sensing imagery primarily shows overstory canopy, and it does not facilitate easy differentiation of individual trees in areas with a dense canopy and does not allow for easy separation of trees when the canopy is dense. We leverage the fusion of three-dimensional LiDAR measurements and 2D imagery to facilitate the accurate counting of trees. We compare a deep learning approach to counting trees in forests using 3D airborne LiDAR data and 2D imagery. The approach is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, like operating on 3D point cloud and 2D imagery. We empirically evaluate the different methods on the NeonTreeCount data set, which we use to define a tree-counting benchmark. The experiments show that FuseCountNet yields more accurate tree counts.

- **Summary**: Deep clustering has exhibited remarkable performance; however, the overconfidence problem, i.e., the estimated confidence for a sample belonging to a particular cluster greatly exceeds its actual prediction accuracy, has been overlooked in prior research. To tackle this critical issue, we pioneer the development of a calibrated deep clustering framework. Specifically, we propose a novel dual-head deep clustering pipeline that can effectively calibrate the estimated confidence and the actual accuracy. The calibration head adjusts the overconfident predictions of the clustering head using regularization methods, generating prediction confidence and pseudo-labels that match the model learning status. This calibration process also guides the clustering head in dynamically selecting reliable high-confidence samples for training. Additionally, we introduce an effective network initialization strategy that enhances both training speed and network robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed calibrated deep clustering framework not only surpasses state-of-the-art deep clustering methods by approximately 10 times in terms of expected calibration error but also significantly outperforms them in terms of clustering accuracy.

- **Summary**: Computer vision models normally witness degraded performance when deployed in real-world scenarios, due to unexpected changes in inputs that were not accounted for during training. Data augmentation is commonly used to address this issue, as it aims to increase data variety and reduce the distribution gap between training and test data. However, common visual augmentations might not guarantee extensive robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we propose Auxiliary Fourier-basis Augmentation (AFA), a complementary technique targeting augmentation in the frequency domain and filling the augmentation gap left by visual augmentations. We demonstrate the utility of augmentation via Fourier-basis additive noise in a straightforward and efficient adversarial setting. Our results show that AFA benefits the robustness of models against common corruptions, OOD generalization, and consistency of performance of models against increasing perturbations, with negligible deficit to the standard performance of models. It can be seamlessly integrated with other augmentation techniques to further boost performance. Code and models can be found at: https://github.com/nis-research/afa-augment

- **Summary**: Existing Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) methods require access to source domain data to train a model in the pre-training phase. However, due to increasing concerns about data privacy and the desire to reduce data transmission and training costs, it is necessary to develop a CDFSL solution without accessing source data. For this reason, this paper explores a Source-Free CDFSL (SF-CDFSL) problem, in which CDFSL is addressed through the use of existing pretrained models instead of training a model with source data, avoiding accessing source data. This paper proposes an Enhanced Information Maximization with Distance-Aware Contrastive Learning (IM-DCL) method to address these challenges. Firstly, we introduce the transductive mechanism for learning the query set. Secondly, information maximization (IM) is explored to map target samples into both individual certainty and global diversity predictions, helping the source model better fit the target data distribution. However, IM fails to learn the decision boundary of the target task. This motivates us to introduce a novel approach called Distance-Aware Contrastive Learning (DCL), in which we consider the entire feature set as both positive and negative sets, akin to Schrodinger's concept of a dual state. Instead of a rigid separation between positive and negative sets, we employ a weighted distance calculation among features to establish a soft classification of the positive and negative sets for the entire feature set. Furthermore, we address issues related to IM by incorporating contrastive constraints between object features and their corresponding positive and negative sets. Evaluations of the 4 datasets in the BSCD-FSL benchmark indicate that the proposed IM-DCL, without accessing the source domain, demonstrates superiority over existing methods, especially in the distant domain task.

- **Summary**: Camouflage poses challenges in distinguishing a static target, whereas any movement of the target can break this disguise. Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) approaches take noisy motion estimation as input or model motion implicitly, restricting detection performance in complex dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel Explicit Motion handling and Interactive Prompting framework for VCOD, dubbed EMIP, which handles motion cues explicitly using a frozen pre-trained optical flow fundamental model. EMIP is characterized by a two-stream architecture for simultaneously conducting camouflaged segmentation and optical flow estimation. Interactions across the dual streams are realized in an interactive prompting way that is inspired by emerging visual prompt learning. Two learnable modules, i.e. the camouflaged feeder and motion collector, are designed to incorporate segmentation-to-motion and motion-to-segmentation prompts, respectively, and enhance outputs of the both streams. The prompt fed to the motion stream is learned by supervising optical flow in a self-supervised manner. Furthermore, we show that long-term historical information can also be incorporated as a prompt into EMIP and achieve more robust results with temporal consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our EMIP achieves new state-of-the-art records on popular VCOD benchmarks. The code will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Robot navigation under visual corruption presents a formidable challenge. To address this, we propose a Test-time Adaptation (TTA) method, named as TTA-Nav, for point-goal navigation under visual corruptions. Our "plug-and-play" method incorporates a top-down decoder to a pre-trained navigation model. Firstly, the pre-trained navigation model gets a corrupted image and extracts features. Secondly, the top-down decoder produces the reconstruction given the high-level features extracted by the pre-trained model. Then, it feeds the reconstruction of a corrupted image back to the pre-trained model. Finally, the pre-trained model does forward pass again to output action. Despite being trained solely on clean images, the top-down decoder can reconstruct cleaner images from corrupted ones without the need for gradient-based adaptation. The pre-trained navigation model with our top-down decoder significantly enhances navigation performance across almost all visual corruptions in our benchmarks. Our method improves the success rate of point-goal navigation from the state-of-the-art result of 46% to 94% on the most severe corruption. This suggests its potential for broader application in robotic visual navigation.

- **Summary**: 3D object detection based on LiDAR point cloud and prior anchor boxes is a critical technology for autonomous driving environment perception and understanding. Nevertheless, an overlooked practical issue in existing methods is the ambiguity in training sample allocation based on box Intersection over Union (IoU_box). This problem impedes further enhancements in the performance of anchor-based LiDAR 3D object detectors. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces a new training sample selection method that utilizes point cloud distribution for anchor sample quality measurement, named Point Assisted Sample Selection (PASS). This method has undergone rigorous evaluation on two widely utilized datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the application of PASS elevates the average precision of anchor-based LiDAR 3D object detectors to a novel state-of-the-art, thereby proving the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The codes will be made available at https://github.com/XJTU-Haolin/Point_Assisted_Sample_Selection.

- **Summary**: Three-dimensional Digital Subtraction Angiography (3D-DSA) is a well-established X-ray-based technique for visualizing vascular anatomy. Recently, four-dimensional DSA (4D-DSA) reconstruction algorithms have been developed to enable the visualization of volumetric contrast flow dynamics through time-series of volumes. . This reconstruction problem is ill-posed mainly due to vessel overlap in the projection direction and geometric vessel foreshortening, which leads to information loss in the recorded projection images. However, knowledge about the underlying fluid dynamics can be leveraged to constrain the solution space. In our work, we implicitly include this information in a neural network-based model that is trained on a dataset of image-based blood flow simulations. The model predicts the spatially averaged contrast agent concentration for each centerline point of the vasculature over time, lowering the overall computational demand. The trained network enables the reconstruction of relative contrast agent concentrations with a mean absolute error of 0.02 $\pm$ 0.02 and a mean absolute percentage error of 5.31 % $\pm$ 9.25 %. Moreover, the network is robust to varying degrees of vessel overlap and vessel foreshortening. Our approach demonstrates the potential of the integration of machine learning and blood flow simulations in time-resolved angiographic flow reconstruction.

- **Summary**: This dissertation is a multifaceted contribution to the advancement of vision-based 3D perception technologies. In the first segment, the thesis introduces structural enhancements to both monocular and stereo 3D object detection algorithms. By integrating ground-referenced geometric priors into monocular detection models, this research achieves unparalleled accuracy in benchmark evaluations for monocular 3D detection. Concurrently, the work refines stereo 3D detection paradigms by incorporating insights and inferential structures gleaned from monocular networks, thereby augmenting the operational efficiency of stereo detection systems. The second segment is devoted to data-driven strategies and their real-world applications in 3D vision detection. A novel training regimen is introduced that amalgamates datasets annotated with either 2D or 3D labels. This approach not only augments the detection models through the utilization of a substantially expanded dataset but also facilitates economical model deployment in real-world scenarios where only 2D annotations are readily available. Lastly, the dissertation presents an innovative pipeline tailored for unsupervised depth estimation in autonomous driving contexts. Extensive empirical analyses affirm the robustness and efficacy of this newly proposed pipeline. Collectively, these contributions lay a robust foundation for the widespread adoption of vision-based 3D perception technologies in autonomous driving applications.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address web-scale visual entity recognition, specifically the task of mapping a given query image to one of the 6 million existing entities in Wikipedia. One way of approaching a problem of such scale is using dual-encoder models (eg CLIP), where all the entity names and query images are embedded into a unified space, paving the way for an approximate k-NN search. Alternatively, it is also possible to re-purpose a captioning model to directly generate the entity names for a given image. In contrast, we introduce a novel Generative Entity Recognition (GER) framework, which given an input image learns to auto-regressively decode a semantic and discriminative ``code'' identifying the target entity. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of this GER paradigm, showcasing state-of-the-art performance on the challenging OVEN benchmark. GER surpasses strong captioning, dual-encoder, visual matching and hierarchical classification baselines, affirming its advantage in tackling the complexities of web-scale recognition.

- **Summary**: Light field cameras and multi-camera arrays have emerged as promising solutions for accurately estimating depth by passively capturing light information. This is possible because the 3D information of a scene is embedded in the 4D light field geometry. Commonly, depth estimation methods extract this information relying on gradient information, heuristic-based optimisation models, or learning-based approaches. This paper focuses mainly on explicitly understanding and exploiting 4D geometrical cues for light field depth estimation. Thus, a novel method is proposed, based on a non-learning-based optimisation approach for depth estimation that explicitly considers surface normal accuracy and occlusion regions by utilising a fully explainable 4D geometric model of the light field. The 4D model performs depth/disparity estimation by determining the orientations and analysing the intersections of key 2D planes in 4D space, which are the images of 3D-space points in the 4D light field. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms both learning-based and non-learning-based state-of-the-art methods in terms of surface normal angle accuracy, achieving a Median Angle Error on planar surfaces, on average, 26.3\% lower than the state-of-the-art, and still being competitive with state-of-the-art methods in terms of Mean Squared Error $\vc{\times}$ 100 and Badpix 0.07.

- **Summary**: Image retrieval enables an efficient search through vast amounts of satellite imagery and returns similar images to a query. Deep learning models can identify images across various semantic concepts without the need for annotations. This work proposes to use Geospatial Foundation Models, like Prithvi, for remote sensing image retrieval with multiple benefits: i) the models encode multi-spectral satellite data and ii) generalize without further fine-tuning. We introduce two datasets to the retrieval task and observe a strong performance: Prithvi processes six bands and achieves a mean Average Precision of 97.62\% on BigEarthNet-43 and 44.51\% on ForestNet-12, outperforming other RGB-based models. Further, we evaluate three compression methods with binarized embeddings balancing retrieval speed and accuracy. They match the retrieval speed of much shorter hash codes while maintaining the same accuracy as floating-point embeddings but with a 32-fold compression.

- **Summary**: Novel-view synthesis with sparse input views is important for real-world applications like AR/VR and autonomous driving. Recent methods have integrated depth information into NeRFs for sparse input synthesis, leveraging depth prior for geometric and spatial understanding. However, most existing works tend to overlook inaccuracies within depth maps and have low time efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a depth-guided robust and fast point cloud fusion NeRF for sparse inputs. We perceive radiance fields as an explicit voxel grid of features. A point cloud is constructed for each input view, characterized within the voxel grid using matrices and vectors. We accumulate the point cloud of each input view to construct the fused point cloud of the entire scene. Each voxel determines its density and appearance by referring to the point cloud of the entire scene. Through point cloud fusion and voxel grid fine-tuning, inaccuracies in depth values are refined or substituted by those from other views. Moreover, our method can achieve faster reconstruction and greater compactness through effective vector-matrix decomposition. Experimental results underline the superior performance and time efficiency of our approach compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

- **Summary**: Methods for medical image registration infer geometric transformations that align pairs/groups of images by maximising an image similarity metric. This problem is ill-posed as several solutions may have equivalent likelihoods, also optimising purely for image similarity can yield implausible transformations. For these reasons regularization terms are essential to obtain meaningful registration results. However, this requires the introduction of at least one hyperparameter often termed {\lambda}, that serves as a tradeoff between loss terms. In some situations, the quality of the estimated transformation greatly depends on hyperparameter choice, and different choices may be required depending on the characteristics of the data. Analyzing the effect of these hyperparameters requires labelled data, which is not commonly available at test-time. In this paper, we propose a method for evaluating the influence of hyperparameters and subsequently selecting an optimal value for given image pairs. Our approach which we call HyperPredict, implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron that learns the effect of selecting particular hyperparameters for registering an image pair by predicting the resulting segmentation overlap and measure of deformation smoothness. This approach enables us to select optimal hyperparameters at test time without requiring labelled data, removing the need for a one-size-fits-all cross-validation approach. Furthermore, the criteria used to define optimal hyperparameter is flexible post-training, allowing us to efficiently choose specific properties. We evaluate our proposed method on the OASIS brain MR dataset using a recent deep learning approach(cLapIRN) and an algorithmic method(Niftyreg). Our results demonstrate good performance in predicting the effects of regularization hyperparameters and highlight the benefits of our image-pair specific approach to hyperparameter selection.

- **Summary**: Combining images from multi-modalities is beneficial to explore various information in computer vision, especially in the medical domain. As an essential part of clinical diagnosis, multi-modal brain tumor segmentation aims to delineate the malignant entity involving multiple modalities. Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance in the task, the information exchange for cross-scale and high-level representations fusion in spatial and modality are limited in these methods. In this paper, we present a novel Modality Aware and Shift Mixer that integrates intra-modality and inter-modality dependencies of multi-modal images for effective and robust brain tumor segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a Modality-Aware module according to neuroimaging studies for modeling the specific modality pair relationships at low levels, and a Modality-Shift module with specific mosaic patterns is developed to explore the complex relationships across modalities at high levels via the self-attention. Experimentally, we outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches on the public Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS 2021 segmentation) dataset. Further qualitative experiments demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of MASM.

- **Summary**: In Multiple Object Tracking, objects often exhibit non-linear motion of acceleration and deceleration, with irregular direction changes. Tacking-by-detection (TBD) with Kalman Filter motion prediction works well in pedestrian-dominant scenarios but falls short in complex situations when multiple objects perform non-linear and diverse motion simultaneously. To tackle the complex non-linear motion, we propose a real-time diffusion-based MOT approach named DiffMOT. Specifically, for the motion predictor component, we propose a novel Decoupled Diffusion-based Motion Predictor (D MP). It models the entire distribution of various motion presented by the data as a whole. It also predicts an individual object's motion conditioning on an individual's historical motion information. Furthermore, it optimizes the diffusion process with much less sampling steps. As a MOT tracker, the DiffMOT is real-time at 22.7FPS, and also outperforms the state-of-the-art on DanceTrack and SportsMOT datasets with 63.4 and 76.2 in HOTA metrics, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, DiffMOT is the first to introduce a diffusion probabilistic model into the MOT to tackle non-linear motion prediction.

- **Summary**: Video temporal grounding (VTG) aims to locate specific temporal segments from an untrimmed video based on a linguistic query. Most existing VTG models are trained on extensive annotated video-text pairs, a process that not only introduces human biases from the queries but also incurs significant computational costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose VTG-GPT, a GPT-based method for zero-shot VTG without training or fine-tuning. To reduce prejudice in the original query, we employ Baichuan2 to generate debiased queries. To lessen redundant information in videos, we apply MiniGPT-v2 to transform visual content into more precise captions. Finally, we devise the proposal generator and post-processing to produce accurate segments from debiased queries and image captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VTG-GPT significantly outperforms SOTA methods in zero-shot settings and surpasses unsupervised approaches. More notably, it achieves competitive performance comparable to supervised methods. The code is available on https://github.com/YoucanBaby/VTG-GPT

- **Summary**: Recent advancement in text-to-image models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) and corresponding personalized technologies (e.g., DreamBooth and LoRA) enables individuals to generate high-quality and imaginative images. However, they often suffer from limitations when generating images with resolutions outside of their trained domain. To overcome this limitation, we present the Resolution Adapter (ResAdapter), a domain-consistent adapter designed for diffusion models to generate images with unrestricted resolutions and aspect ratios. Unlike other multi-resolution generation methods that process images of static resolution with complex post-process operations, ResAdapter directly generates images with the dynamical resolution. Especially, after learning a deep understanding of pure resolution priors, ResAdapter trained on the general dataset, generates resolution-free images with personalized diffusion models while preserving their original style domain. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ResAdapter with only 0.5M can process images with flexible resolutions for arbitrary diffusion models. More extended experiments demonstrate that ResAdapter is compatible with other modules (e.g., ControlNet, IP-Adapter and LCM-LoRA) for image generation across a broad range of resolutions, and can be integrated into other multi-resolution model (e.g., ElasticDiffusion) for efficiently generating higher-resolution images.

- **Summary**: Understanding social interactions involving both verbal and non-verbal cues is essential to effectively interpret social situations. However, most prior works on multimodal social cues focus predominantly on single-person behaviors or rely on holistic visual representations that are not densely aligned to utterances in multi-party environments. They are limited in modeling the intricate dynamics of multi-party interactions. In this paper, we introduce three new challenging tasks to model the fine-grained dynamics between multiple people: speaking target identification, pronoun coreference resolution, and mentioned player prediction. We contribute extensive data annotations to curate these new challenges in social deduction game settings. Furthermore, we propose a novel multimodal baseline that leverages densely aligned language-visual representations by synchronizing visual features with their corresponding utterances. This facilitates concurrently capturing verbal and non-verbal cues pertinent to social reasoning. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with densely aligned multimodal representations in modeling social interactions. We will release our benchmarks and source code to facilitate further research.

- **Summary**: Smiles and laughs detection systems have attracted a lot of attention in the past decade contributing to the improvement of human-agent interaction systems. But very few considered these expressions as distinct, although no prior work clearly proves them to belong to the same category or not. In this work, we present a deep learning-based multimodal smile and laugh classification system, considering them as two different entities. We compare the use of audio and vision-based models as well as a fusion approach. We show that, as expected, the fusion leads to a better generalization on unseen data. We also present an in-depth analysis of the behavior of these models on the smiles and laughs intensity levels. The analyses on the intensity levels show that the relationship between smiles and laughs might not be as simple as a binary one or even grouping them in a single category, and so, a more complex approach should be taken when dealing with them. We also tackle the problem of limited resources by showing that transfer learning allows the models to improve the detection of confusing intensity levels.

- **Summary**: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have had great success, and many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their performance and safety. However, they only consider explicit prompts while neglecting implicit prompts (hint at a target without explicitly mentioning it). These prompts may get rid of safety constraints and pose potential threats to the applications of these models. This position paper highlights the current state of T2I models toward implicit prompts. We present a benchmark named ImplicitBench and conduct an investigation on the performance and impacts of implicit prompts with popular T2I models. Specifically, we design and collect more than 2,000 implicit prompts of three aspects: General Symbols, Celebrity Privacy, and Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) Issues, and evaluate six well-known T2I models' capabilities under these implicit prompts. Experiment results show that (1) T2I models are able to accurately create various target symbols indicated by implicit prompts; (2) Implicit prompts bring potential risks of privacy leakage for T2I models. (3) Constraints of NSFW in most of the evaluated T2I models can be bypassed with implicit prompts. We call for increased attention to the potential and risks of implicit prompts in the T2I community and further investigation into the capabilities and impacts of implicit prompts, advocating for a balanced approach that harnesses their benefits while mitigating their risks.

- **Summary**: Academic documents are packed with texts, equations, tables, and figures, requiring comprehensive understanding for accurate Optical Character Recognition (OCR). While end-to-end OCR methods offer improved accuracy over layout-based approaches, they often grapple with significant repetition issues, especially with complex layouts in Out-Of-Domain (OOD) documents.To tackle this issue, we propose LOCR, a model that integrates location guiding into the transformer architecture during autoregression. We train the model on a dataset comprising over 77M text-location pairs from 125K academic document pages, including bounding boxes for words, tables and mathematical symbols. LOCR adeptly handles various formatting elements and generates content in Markdown language. It outperforms all existing methods in our test set constructed from arXiv, as measured by edit distance, BLEU, METEOR and F-measure.LOCR also reduces repetition frequency from 4.4% of pages to 0.5% in the arXiv dataset, from 13.2% to 1.3% in OOD quantum physics documents and from 8.1% to 1.8% in OOD marketing documents. Additionally, LOCR features an interactive OCR mode, facilitating the generation of complex documents through a few location prompts from human.

- **Summary**: Fine classification of city-scale buildings from satellite remote sensing imagery is a crucial research area with significant implications for urban planning, infrastructure development, and population distribution analysis. However, the task faces big challenges due to low-resolution overhead images acquired from high altitude space-borne platforms and the long-tail sample distribution of fine-grained urban building categories, leading to severe class imbalance problem. To address these issues, we propose a deep network approach to fine-grained classification of urban buildings using open-access satellite images. A Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) based super-resolution method is first introduced to enhance the spatial resolution of satellite images, which benefits from domain-adaptive knowledge distillation. Then, a new fine-grained classification network with Category Information Balancing Module (CIBM) and Contrastive Supervision (CS) technique is proposed to mitigate the problem of class imbalance and improve the classification robustness and accuracy. Experiments on Hong Kong data set with 11 fine building types revealed promising classification results with a mean Top-1 accuracy of 60.45\%, which is on par with street-view image based approaches. Extensive ablation study shows that CIBM and CS improve Top-1 accuracy by 2.6\% and 3.5\% compared to the baseline method, respectively. And both modules can be easily inserted into other classification networks and similar enhancements have been achieved. Our research contributes to the field of urban analysis by providing a practical solution for fine classification of buildings in challenging mega city scenarios solely using open-access satellite images. The proposed method can serve as a valuable tool for urban planners, aiding in the understanding of economic, industrial, and population distribution.

- **Summary**: We present a learning-based approach to reconstruct buildings as 3D polygonal meshes from airborne LiDAR point clouds. What makes 3D building reconstruction from airborne LiDAR hard is the large diversity of building designs and especially roof shapes, the low and varying point density across the scene, and the often incomplete coverage of building facades due to occlusions by vegetation or to the viewing angle of the sensor. To cope with the diversity of shapes and inhomogeneous and incomplete object coverage, we introduce a generative model that directly predicts 3D polygonal meshes from input point clouds. Our autoregressive model, called Point2Building, iteratively builds up the mesh by generating sequences of vertices and faces. This approach enables our model to adapt flexibly to diverse geometries and building structures. Unlike many existing methods that rely heavily on pre-processing steps like exhaustive plane detection, our model learns directly from the point cloud data, thereby reducing error propagation and increasing the fidelity of the reconstruction. We experimentally validate our method on a collection of airborne LiDAR data of Zurich, Berlin and Tallinn. Our method shows good generalization to diverse urban styles.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised pre-training has been proved to be effective in learning transferable representations that benefit various visual tasks. This paper asks this question: can self-supervised pre-training learn general facial representations for various facial analysis tasks? Recent efforts toward this goal are limited to treating each face image as a whole, i.e., learning consistent facial representations at the image-level, which overlooks the consistency of local facial representations (i.e., facial regions like eyes, nose, etc). In this work, we make a first attempt to propose a novel self-supervised facial representation learning framework to learn consistent global and local facial representations, Facial Region Awareness (FRA). Specifically, we explicitly enforce the consistency of facial regions by matching the local facial representations across views, which are extracted with learned heatmaps highlighting the facial regions. Inspired by the mask prediction in supervised semantic segmentation, we obtain the heatmaps via cosine similarity between the per-pixel projection of feature maps and facial mask embeddings computed from learnable positional embeddings, which leverage the attention mechanism to globally look up the facial image for facial regions. To learn such heatmaps, we formulate the learning of facial mask embeddings as a deep clustering problem by assigning the pixel features from the feature maps to them. The transfer learning results on facial classification and regression tasks show that our FRA outperforms previous pre-trained models and more importantly, using ResNet as the unified backbone for various tasks, our FRA achieves comparable or even better performance compared with SOTA methods in facial analysis tasks.

- **Comment**: The first Mamba-based model for infrared small target detection
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Thanks to the development of basic models, infrared small target detection (ISTD) algorithms have made significant progress. Specifically, the structures combining convolutional networks with transformers can well extract both local and global features. At the same time, they also inherit defects from the basic model, e.g., the quadratic computational complexity of transformers, which impacts efficiency. Inspired by a recent basic model with linear complexity for long-distance modeling, called Mamba, we explore the potential of this state space model in ISTD in this paper. However, direct application is unsuitable since local features, which are critical to detecting small targets, cannot be fully exploited. Instead, we tailor a Mamba-in-Mamba (MiM-ISTD) structure for efficient ISTD. For example, we treat the local patches as "visual sentences" and further decompose them into sub-patches as "visual words" to further explore the locality. The interactions among each word in a given visual sentence will be calculated with negligible computational costs. By aggregating the word and sentence features, the representation ability of MiM-ISTD can be significantly bolstered. Experiments on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1k prove the superior accuracy and efficiency of our method. Specifically, MiM-ISTD is $10 \times$ faster than the SOTA and reduces GPU memory usage by 73.4$\%$ per $2048 \times 2048$ image during inference, overcoming the computation$\&$memory constraints on performing Mamba-based understanding on high-resolution infrared images.Source code is available at https://github.com/txchen-USTC/MiM-ISTD.

- **Summary**: Detection and diagnosis of colon polyps are key to preventing colorectal cancer. Recent evidence suggests that AI-based computer-aided detection (CADe) and computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems can enhance endoscopists' performance and boost colonoscopy effectiveness. However, most available public datasets primarily consist of still images or video clips, often at a down-sampled resolution, and do not accurately represent real-world colonoscopy procedures. We introduce the REAL-Colon (Real-world multi-center Endoscopy Annotated video Library) dataset: a compilation of 2.7M native video frames from sixty full-resolution, real-world colonoscopy recordings across multiple centers. The dataset contains 350k bounding-box annotations, each created under the supervision of expert gastroenterologists. Comprehensive patient clinical data, colonoscopy acquisition information, and polyp histopathological information are also included in each video. With its unprecedented size, quality, and heterogeneity, the REAL-Colon dataset is a unique resource for researchers and developers aiming to advance AI research in colonoscopy. Its openness and transparency facilitate rigorous and reproducible research, fostering the development and benchmarking of more accurate and reliable colonoscopy-related algorithms and models.

- **Summary**: Popular methods usually use a degradation model in a supervised way to learn a watermark removal model. However, it is true that reference images are difficult to obtain in the real world, as well as collected images by cameras suffer from noise. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a perceptive self-supervised learning network for noisy image watermark removal (PSLNet) in this paper. PSLNet depends on a parallel network to remove noise and watermarks. The upper network uses task decomposition ideas to remove noise and watermarks in sequence. The lower network utilizes the degradation model idea to simultaneously remove noise and watermarks. Specifically, mentioned paired watermark images are obtained in a self supervised way, and paired noisy images (i.e., noisy and reference images) are obtained in a supervised way. To enhance the clarity of obtained images, interacting two sub-networks and fusing obtained clean images are used to improve the effects of image watermark removal in terms of structural information and pixel enhancement. Taking into texture information account, a mixed loss uses obtained images and features to achieve a robust model of noisy image watermark removal. Comprehensive experiments show that our proposed method is very effective in comparison with popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for noisy image watermark removal.

- **Summary**: Creating 3D textured meshes using generative artificial intelligence has garnered significant attention recently. While existing methods support text-based generative texture generation or editing on 3D meshes, they often struggle to precisely control pixels of texture images through more intuitive interaction. While 2D images can be edited generatively using drag interaction, applying this type of methods directly to 3D mesh textures still leads to issues such as the lack of local consistency among multiple views, error accumulation and long training times. To address these challenges, we propose a generative point-based 3D mesh texture editing method called DragTex. This method utilizes a diffusion model to blend locally inconsistent textures in the region near the deformed silhouette between different views, enabling locally consistent texture editing. Besides, we fine-tune a decoder to reduce reconstruction errors in the non-drag region, thereby mitigating overall error accumulation. Moreover, we train LoRA using multi-view images instead of training each view individually, which significantly shortens the training time. The experimental results show that our method effectively achieves dragging textures on 3D meshes and generates plausible textures that align with the desired intent of drag interaction.

- **Summary**: We present a two-stage text-to-3D generation system, namely 3DTopia, which generates high-quality general 3D assets within 5 minutes using hybrid diffusion priors. The first stage samples from a 3D diffusion prior directly learned from 3D data. Specifically, it is powered by a text-conditioned tri-plane latent diffusion model, which quickly generates coarse 3D samples for fast prototyping. The second stage utilizes 2D diffusion priors to further refine the texture of coarse 3D models from the first stage. The refinement consists of both latent and pixel space optimization for high-quality texture generation. To facilitate the training of the proposed system, we clean and caption the largest open-source 3D dataset, Objaverse, by combining the power of vision language models and large language models. Experiment results are reported qualitatively and quantitatively to show the performance of the proposed system. Our codes and models are available at https://github.com/3DTopia/3DTopia

- **Summary**: Detecting elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is crucial in diagnosing and managing various neurological conditions. These fluctuations in pressure are transmitted to the optic nerve sheath (ONS), resulting in changes to its diameter, which can then be detected using ultrasound imaging devices. However, interpreting sonographic images of the ONS can be challenging. In this work, we propose two systems that actively monitor the ONS diameter throughout an ultrasound video and make a final prediction as to whether ICP is elevated. To construct our systems, we leverage subject matter expert (SME) guidance, structuring our processing pipeline according to their collection procedure, while also prioritizing interpretability and computational efficiency. We conduct a number of experiments, demonstrating that our proposed systems are able to outperform various baselines. One of our SMEs then manually validates our top system's performance, lending further credibility to our approach while demonstrating its potential utility in a clinical setting.

- **Summary**: Our understanding of the generalization capabilities of neural networks (NNs) is still incomplete. Prevailing explanations are based on implicit biases of gradient descent (GD) but they cannot account for the capabilities of models from gradient-free methods nor the simplicity bias recently observed in untrained networks. This paper seeks other sources of generalization in NNs.   Findings. To understand the inductive biases provided by architectures independently from GD, we examine untrained, random-weight networks. Even simple MLPs show strong inductive biases: uniform sampling in weight space yields a very biased distribution of functions in terms of complexity. But unlike common wisdom, NNs do not have an inherent "simplicity bias". This property depends on components such as ReLUs, residual connections, and layer normalizations. Alternative architectures can be built with a bias for any level of complexity. Transformers also inherit all these properties from their building blocks.   Implications. We provide a fresh explanation for the success of deep learning independent from gradient-based training. It points at promising avenues for controlling the solutions implemented by trained models.

- **Summary**: Sequence-to-sequence vision-language models are showing promise, but their applicability is limited by their inference latency due to their autoregressive way of generating predictions. We propose a parallel decoding sequence-to-sequence vision-language model, trained with a Query-CTC loss, that marginalizes over multiple inference paths in the decoder. This allows us to model the joint distribution of tokens, rather than restricting to conditional distribution as in an autoregressive model. The resulting model, NARVL, achieves performance on-par with its state-of-the-art autoregressive counterpart, but is faster at inference time, reducing from the linear complexity associated with the sequential generation of tokens to a paradigm of constant time joint inference.

- **Summary**: Addressing the intricate challenge of modeling and re-rendering dynamic scenes, most recent approaches have sought to simplify these complexities using plane-based explicit representations, overcoming the slow training time issues associated with methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and implicit representations. However, the straightforward decomposition of 4D dynamic scenes into multiple 2D plane-based representations proves insufficient for re-rendering high-fidelity scenes with complex motions. In response, we present a novel direction-aware representation (DaRe) approach that captures scene dynamics from six different directions. This learned representation undergoes an inverse dual-tree complex wavelet transformation (DTCWT) to recover plane-based information. DaReNeRF computes features for each space-time point by fusing vectors from these recovered planes. Combining DaReNeRF with a tiny MLP for color regression and leveraging volume rendering in training yield state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis for complex dynamic scenes. Notably, to address redundancy introduced by the six real and six imaginary direction-aware wavelet coefficients, we introduce a trainable masking approach, mitigating storage issues without significant performance decline. Moreover, DaReNeRF maintains a 2x reduction in training time compared to prior art while delivering superior performance.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently gained immense popularity. Powerful commercial models like ChatGPT-4V and Gemini, as well as open-source ones such as LLaVA, are essentially general-purpose models and are applied to solve a wide variety of tasks, including those in computer vision. These neural networks possess such strong general knowledge and reasoning abilities that they have proven capable of working even on tasks for which they were not specifically trained. We compared the capabilities of the most powerful MLLMs to date: ShareGPT4V, ChatGPT, LLaVA-Next in a specialized task of age and gender estimation with our state-of-the-art specialized model, MiVOLO. We also updated MiVOLO and provide details and new metrics in this article. This comparison has yielded some interesting results and insights about the strengths and weaknesses of the participating models. Furthermore, we attempted various ways to fine-tune the ShareGPT4V model for this specific task, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art results in this particular challenge. Although such a model would not be practical in production, as it is incredibly expensive compared to a specialized model like MiVOLO, it could be very useful in some tasks, like data annotation.

- **Summary**: Realizing sufficient separability between the distributions of healthy and pathological samples is a critical obstacle for pathology detection convolutional models. Moreover, these models exhibit a bias for contrast-based images, with diminished performance on texture-based medical images. This study introduces the notion of a population-level context for pathology detection and employs a graph theoretic approach to model and incorporate it into the latent code of an autoencoder via a refinement module we term PopuSense. PopuSense seeks to capture additional intra-group variations inherent in biomedical data that a local or global context of the convolutional model might miss or smooth out. Experiments on contrast-based and texture-based images, with minimal adaptation, encounter the existing preference for intensity-based input. Nevertheless, PopuSense demonstrates improved separability in contrast-based images, presenting an additional avenue for refining representations learned by a model.

- **Summary**: Transformers have revolutionized computer vision and natural language processing, but their high computational complexity limits their application in high-resolution image processing and long-context analysis. This paper introduces Vision-RWKV (VRWKV), a model adapted from the RWKV model used in the NLP field with necessary modifications for vision tasks. Similar to the Vision Transformer (ViT), our model is designed to efficiently handle sparse inputs and demonstrate robust global processing capabilities, while also scaling up effectively, accommodating both large-scale parameters and extensive datasets. Its distinctive advantage lies in its reduced spatial aggregation complexity, which renders it exceptionally adept at processing high-resolution images seamlessly, eliminating the necessity for windowing operations. Our evaluations in image classification demonstrate that VRWKV matches ViT's classification performance with significantly faster speeds and lower memory usage. In dense prediction tasks, it outperforms window-based models, maintaining comparable speeds. These results highlight VRWKV's potential as a more efficient alternative for visual perception tasks.

- **Summary**: Deep learning (DL)-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of medical image segmentation tasks. Nevertheless, recent studies show that deep neural networks (DNNs) can be miscalibrated and overconfident, leading to "silent failures" that are risky} for clinical applications. Bayesian statistics provide an intuitive approach to DL failure detection, based on posterior probability estimation. However, Bayesian DL, and in particular the posterior estimation, is intractable for large medical image segmentation DNNs. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Bayesian learning framework by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), tempered by cold posterior (CP) to accommodate medical data augmentation, named HMC-CP. For HMC computation, we further propose a cyclical annealing strategy, which captures both local and global geometries of the posterior distribution, enabling highly efficient Bayesian DNN training with the same computational budget requirements as training a single DNN. The resulting Bayesian DNN outputs an ensemble segmentation along with the segmentation uncertainty. We evaluate the proposed HMC-CP extensively on cardiac magnetic resonance image (MRI) segmentation, using in-domain steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine images as well as out-of-domain datasets of quantitative $T_1$ and $T_2$ mapping.

- **Summary**: Highlighting particularly relevant regions of an image can improve the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) on various vision-language (VL) tasks by guiding the model to attend more closely to these regions of interest. For example, VLMs can be given a "visual prompt", where visual markers such as bounding boxes delineate key image regions. However, current VLMs that can incorporate visual guidance are either proprietary and expensive or require costly training on curated data that includes visual prompts. We introduce Contrastive Region Guidance (CRG), a training-free guidance method that enables open-source VLMs to respond to visual prompts. CRG contrasts model outputs produced with and without visual prompts, factoring out biases revealed by the model when answering without the information required to produce a correct answer (i.e., the model's prior). CRG achieves substantial improvements in a wide variety of VL tasks: When region annotations are provided, CRG increases absolute accuracy by up to 11.1% on ViP-Bench, a collection of six diverse region-based tasks such as recognition, math, and object relationship reasoning. We also show CRG's applicability to spatial reasoning, with 10% improvement on What'sUp, as well as to compositional generalization -- improving accuracy by 11.5% and 7.5% on two challenging splits from SugarCrepe -- and to image-text alignment for generated images, where we improve by up to 8.4 AUROC and 6.8 F1 points on SeeTRUE. When reference regions are absent, CRG allows us to re-rank proposed regions in referring expression comprehension and phrase grounding benchmarks like RefCOCO/+/g and Flickr30K Entities, with an average gain of 3.2% in accuracy. Our analysis explores alternative masking strategies for CRG, quantifies CRG's probability shift, and evaluates the role of region guidance strength, empirically validating CRG's design choices.

- **Summary**: Multi-sensor fusion systems (MSFs) play a vital role as the perception module in modern autonomous vehicles (AVs). Therefore, ensuring their robustness against common and realistic adversarial semantic transformations, such as rotation and shifting in the physical world, is crucial for the safety of AVs. While empirical evidence suggests that MSFs exhibit improved robustness compared to single-modal models, they are still vulnerable to adversarial semantic transformations. Despite the proposal of empirical defenses, several works show that these defenses can be attacked again by new adaptive attacks. So far, there is no certified defense proposed for MSFs. In this work, we propose the first robustness certification framework COMMIT certify robustness of multi-sensor fusion systems against semantic attacks. In particular, we propose a practical anisotropic noise mechanism that leverages randomized smoothing with multi-modal data and performs a grid-based splitting method to characterize complex semantic transformations. We also propose efficient algorithms to compute the certification in terms of object detection accuracy and IoU for large-scale MSF models. Empirically, we evaluate the efficacy of COMMIT in different settings and provide a comprehensive benchmark of certified robustness for different MSF models using the CARLA simulation platform. We show that the certification for MSF models is at most 48.39% higher than that of single-modal models, which validates the advantages of MSF models. We believe our certification framework and benchmark will contribute an important step towards certifiably robust AVs in practice.

- **Summary**: Vision language models (VLMs) have experienced rapid advancements through the integration of large language models (LLMs) with image-text pairs, yet they struggle with detailed regional visual understanding due to limited spatial awareness of the vision encoder, and the use of coarse-grained training data that lacks detailed, region-specific captions. To address this, we introduce RegionGPT (short as RGPT), a novel framework designed for complex region-level captioning and understanding. RGPT enhances the spatial awareness of regional representation with simple yet effective modifications to existing visual encoders in VLMs. We further improve performance on tasks requiring a specific output scope by integrating task-guided instruction prompts during both training and inference phases, while maintaining the model's versatility for general-purpose tasks. Additionally, we develop an automated region caption data generation pipeline, enriching the training set with detailed region-level captions. We demonstrate that a universal RGPT model can be effectively applied and significantly enhancing performance across a range of region-level tasks, including but not limited to complex region descriptions, reasoning, object classification, and referring expressions comprehension.

- **Summary**: Video Diffusion Models have been developed for video generation, usually integrating text and image conditioning to enhance control over the generated content. Despite the progress, ensuring consistency across frames remains a challenge, particularly when using text prompts as control conditions. To address this problem, we introduce UniCtrl, a novel, plug-and-play method that is universally applicable to improve the spatiotemporal consistency and motion diversity of videos generated by text-to-video models without additional training. UniCtrl ensures semantic consistency across different frames through cross-frame self-attention control, and meanwhile, enhances the motion quality and spatiotemporal consistency through motion injection and spatiotemporal synchronization. Our experimental results demonstrate UniCtrl's efficacy in enhancing various text-to-video models, confirming its effectiveness and universality.

- **Summary**: Efficient continual learning techniques have been a topic of significant research over the last few years. A fundamental problem with such learning is severe degradation of performance on previously learned tasks, known also as catastrophic forgetting. This paper introduces a novel method to reduce catastrophic forgetting in the context of incremental class learning called Gradient Correlation Subspace Learning (GCSL). The method detects a subspace of the weights that is least affected by previous tasks and projects the weights to train for the new task into said subspace. The method can be applied to one or more layers of a given network architectures and the size of the subspace used can be altered from layer to layer and task to task.

The first step leverages YOLOv8 for precise logo detection across prominent datasets, FoodLogoDet-1500 and LogoDet-3K. The second step involves modeling the user's visual attention with a novel saliency prediction model tailored for the packaging context. The proposed saliency model combines the visual elements with text maps employing a transformers-based architecture to predict user attention maps. In the third step, by integrating logo detection with a saliency map generation, the framework provides a comprehensive brand attention score. The effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed module by module, ensuring a thorough evaluation of each component. Comparing logo detection and saliency map prediction with state-of-the-art models shows the superiority of the proposed methods. To investigate the robustness of the proposed brand attention score, we collected a unique dataset to examine previous psychophysical hypotheses related to brand visibility. the results show that the brand attention score is in line with all previous studies. Also, we introduced seven new hypotheses to check the impact of position, orientation, presence of person, and other visual elements on brand attention. This research marks a significant stride in the intersection of cognitive psychology, computer vision, and marketing, paving the way for advanced, consumer-centric packaging designs.

- **Summary**: Manipulating objects with two multi-fingered hands has been a long-standing challenge in robotics, attributed to the contact-rich nature of many manipulation tasks and the complexity inherent in coordinating a high-dimensional bimanual system. In this work, we consider the problem of twisting lids of various bottle-like objects with two hands, and demonstrate that policies trained in simulation using deep reinforcement learning can be effectively transferred to the real world. With novel engineering insights into physical modeling, real-time perception, and reward design, the policy demonstrates generalization capabilities across a diverse set of unseen objects, showcasing dynamic and dexterous behaviors. Our findings serve as compelling evidence that deep reinforcement learning combined with sim-to-real transfer remains a promising approach for addressing manipulation problems of unprecedented complexity.

- **Summary**: Distortions caused by low-light conditions are not only visually unpleasant but also degrade the performance of computer vision tasks. The restoration and enhancement have proven to be highly beneficial. However, there are only a limited number of enhancement methods explicitly designed for videos acquired in low-light conditions. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Aligned SUNet (STA-SUNet) model using a Swin Transformer as a backbone to capture low light video features and exploit their spatio-temporal correlations. The STA-SUNet model is trained on a novel, fully registered dataset (BVI), which comprises dynamic scenes captured under varying light conditions. It is further analysed comparatively against various other models over three test datasets. The model demonstrates superior adaptivity across all datasets, obtaining the highest PSNR and SSIM values. It is particularly effective in extreme low-light conditions, yielding fairly good visualisation results.

- **Summary**: The Attention mechanism is the main component of the Transformer architecture, and since its introduction, it has led to significant advancements in Deep Learning that span many domains and multiple tasks. The Attention Mechanism was utilized in Computer Vision as the Vision Transformer ViT, and its usage has expanded into many tasks in the vision domain, such as classification, segmentation, object detection, and image generation. While this mechanism is very expressive and capable, it comes with the drawback of being computationally expensive and requiring datasets of considerable size for effective optimization. To address these shortcomings, many designs have been proposed in the literature to reduce the computational burden and alleviate the data size requirements. Examples of such attempts in the vision domain are the MLP-Mixer, the Conv-Mixer, the Perciver-IO, and many more. This paper introduces a new computational block as an alternative to the standard ViT block that reduces the compute burdens by replacing the normal Attention layers with a Network in Network structure that enhances the static approach of the MLP Mixer with a dynamic system of learning an element-wise gating function by a token mixing process. Extensive experimentation shows that the proposed design provides better performance than the baseline architectures on multiple datasets applied in the image classification task of the vision domain.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is increasingly used to study the fetal brain in utero. An important computation enabled by dMRI is streamline tractography, which has unique applications such as tract-specific analysis of the brain white matter and structural connectivity assessment. However, due to the low fetal dMRI data quality and the challenging nature of tractography, existing methods tend to produce highly inaccurate results. They generate many false streamlines while failing to reconstruct streamlines that constitute the major white matter tracts. In this paper, we advocate for anatomically constrained tractography based on an accurate segmentation of the fetal brain tissue directly in the dMRI space. We develop a deep learning method to compute the segmentation automatically. Experiments on independent test data show that this method can accurately segment the fetal brain tissue and drastically improve tractography results. It enables the reconstruction of highly curved tracts such as optic radiations. Importantly, our method infers the tissue segmentation and streamline propagation direction from a diffusion tensor fit to the dMRI data, making it applicable to routine fetal dMRI scans. The proposed method can lead to significant improvements in the accuracy and reproducibility of quantitative assessment of the fetal brain with dMRI.

- **Summary**: Efficient deployment of neural networks (NN) requires the co-optimization of accuracy and latency. For example, hardware-aware neural architecture search has been used to automatically find NN architectures that satisfy a latency constraint on a specific hardware device. Central to these search algorithms is a prediction model that is designed to provide a hardware latency estimate for a candidate NN architecture. Recent research has shown that the sample efficiency of these predictive models can be greatly improved through pre-training on some \textit{training} devices with many samples, and then transferring the predictor on the \textit{test} (target) device. Transfer learning and meta-learning methods have been used for this, but often exhibit significant performance variability. Additionally, the evaluation of existing latency predictors has been largely done on hand-crafted training/test device sets, making it difficult to ascertain design features that compose a robust and general latency predictor. To address these issues, we introduce a comprehensive suite of latency prediction tasks obtained in a principled way through automated partitioning of hardware device sets. We then design a general latency predictor to comprehensively study (1) the predictor architecture, (2) NN sample selection methods, (3) hardware device representations, and (4) NN operation encoding schemes. Building on conclusions from our study, we present an end-to-end latency predictor training strategy that outperforms existing methods on 11 out of 12 difficult latency prediction tasks, improving latency prediction by 22.5\% on average, and up to to 87.6\% on the hardest tasks. Focusing on latency prediction, our HW-Aware NAS reports a $5.8\times$ speedup in wall-clock time.

- **Summary**: High dynamic range (HDR) imaging involves capturing a series of frames of the same scene, each with different exposure settings, to broaden the dynamic range of light. This can be achieved through burst capturing or using staggered HDR sensors that capture long and short exposures simultaneously in the camera image signal processor (ISP). Within camera ISP pipeline, illuminant estimation is a crucial step aiming to estimate the color of the global illuminant in the scene. This estimation is used in camera ISP white-balance module to remove undesirable color cast in the final image. Despite the multiple frames captured in the HDR pipeline, conventional illuminant estimation methods often rely only on a single frame of the scene. In this paper, we explore leveraging information from frames captured with different exposure times. Specifically, we introduce a simple feature extracted from dual-exposure images to guide illuminant estimators, referred to as the dual-exposure feature (DEF). To validate the efficiency of DEF, we employed two illuminant estimators using the proposed DEF: 1) a multilayer perceptron network (MLP), referred to as exposure-based MLP (EMLP), and 2) a modified version of the convolutional color constancy (CCC) to integrate our DEF, that we call ECCC. Both EMLP and ECCC achieve promising results, in some cases surpassing prior methods that require hundreds of thousands or millions of parameters, with only a few hundred parameters for EMLP and a few thousand parameters for ECCC.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in computer vision tasks such as image classification, detection, segmentation, and medical image analysis. In general, an arbitrary number of epochs is used to train such neural networks. In a single epoch, the entire training data -- divided by batch size -- are fed to the network. In practice, validation error with training loss is used to estimate the neural network's generalization, which indicates the optimal learning capacity of the network. Current practice is to stop training when the training loss decreases and the gap between training and validation error increases (i.e., the generalization gap) to avoid overfitting. However, this is a trial-and-error-based approach which raises a critical question: Is it possible to estimate when neural networks stop learning based on training data? This research work introduces a hypothesis that analyzes the data variation across all the layers of a CNN variant to anticipate its near-optimal learning capacity. In the training phase, we use our hypothesis to anticipate the near-optimal learning capacity of a CNN variant without using any validation data. Our hypothesis can be deployed as a plug-and-play to any existing CNN variant without introducing additional trainable parameters to the network. We test our hypothesis on six different CNN variants and three different general image datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN). The result based on these CNN variants and datasets shows that our hypothesis saves 58.49\% of computational time (on average) in training. We further conduct our hypothesis on ten medical image datasets and compared with the MedMNIST-V2 benchmark. Based on our experimental result, we save $\approx$ 44.1\% of computational time without losing accuracy against the MedMNIST-V2 benchmark.

- **Summary**: Predictor-based methods have substantially enhanced Neural Architecture Search (NAS) optimization. The efficacy of these predictors is largely influenced by the method of encoding neural network architectures. While traditional encodings used an adjacency matrix describing the graph structure of a neural network, novel encodings embrace a variety of approaches from unsupervised pretraining of latent representations to vectors of zero-cost proxies. In this paper, we categorize and investigate neural encodings from three main types: structural, learned, and score-based. Furthermore, we extend these encodings and introduce \textit{unified encodings}, that extend NAS predictors to multiple search spaces. Our analysis draws from experiments conducted on over 1.5 million neural network architectures on NAS spaces such as NASBench-101 (NB101), NB201, NB301, Network Design Spaces (NDS), and TransNASBench-101. Building on our study, we present our predictor \textbf{FLAN}: \textbf{Fl}ow \textbf{A}ttention for \textbf{N}AS. FLAN integrates critical insights on predictor design, transfer learning, and \textit{unified encodings} to enable more than an order of magnitude cost reduction for training NAS accuracy predictors. Our implementation and encodings for all neural networks are open-sourced at \href{https://github.com/abdelfattah-lab/flan_nas}{https://github.com/abdelfattah-lab/flan\_nas}.

- **Summary**: Differentially private (DP) machine learning is considered the gold-standard solution for training a model from sensitive data while still preserving privacy. However, a major barrier to achieving this ideal is its sub-optimal privacy-accuracy trade-off, which is particularly visible in DP representation learning. Specifically, it has been shown that under modest privacy budgets, most models learn representations that are not significantly better than hand-crafted features. In this work, we show that effective DP representation learning can be done via image captioning and scaling up to internet-scale multimodal datasets. Through a series of engineering tricks, we successfully train a DP image captioner (DP-Cap) on a 233M subset of LAION-2B from scratch using a reasonable amount of computation, and obtaining unprecedented high-quality image features that can be used in a variety of downstream vision and vision-language tasks. For example, under a privacy budget of $\varepsilon=8$, a linear classifier trained on top of learned DP-Cap features attains 65.8% accuracy on ImageNet-1K, considerably improving the previous SOTA of 56.5%. Our work challenges the prevailing sentiment that high-utility DP representation learning cannot be achieved by training from scratch.

- **Summary**: Battery technology is increasingly important for global electrification efforts. However, batteries are highly sensitive to small manufacturing variations that can induce reliability or safety issues. An important technology for battery quality control is computed tomography (CT) scanning, which is widely used for non-destructive 3D inspection across a variety of clinical and industrial applications. Historically, however, the utility of CT scanning for high-volume manufacturing has been limited by its low throughput as well as the difficulty of handling its large file sizes. In this work, we present a dataset of over one thousand CT scans of as-produced commercially available batteries. The dataset spans various chemistries (lithium-ion and sodium-ion) as well as various battery form factors (cylindrical, pouch, and prismatic). We evaluate seven different battery types in total. The manufacturing variability and the presence of battery defects can be observed via this dataset. This dataset may be of interest to scientists and engineers working on battery technology, computer vision, or both.

- **Summary**: The isometric mapping method employs the shortest path algorithm to estimate the Euclidean distance between points on High dimensional (HD) manifolds. This may not be sufficient for weakly uniformed HD data as it could lead to overestimating distances between far neighboring points, resulting in inconsistencies between the intrinsic (local) and extrinsic (global) distances during the projection. To address this issue, we modify the shortest path algorithm by adding a novel constraint inspired by the Parzen-Rosenblatt (PR) window, which helps to maintain the uniformity of the constructed shortest-path graph in Isomap. Multiple imaging datasets overall of 72,236 cases, 70,000 MINST data, 1596 from multiple Chest-XRay pneumonia datasets, and three NSCLC CT/PET datasets with a total of 640 lung cancer patients, were used to benchmark and validate PR-Isomap. 431 imaging biomarkers were extracted from each modality. Our results indicate that PR-Isomap projects HD attributes into a lower-dimensional (LD) space while preserving information, visualized by the MNIST dataset indicating the maintaining local and global distances. PR-Isomap achieved the highest comparative accuracies of 80.9% (STD:5.8) for pneumonia and 78.5% (STD:4.4), 88.4% (STD:1.4), and 61.4% (STD:11.4) for three NSCLC datasets, with a confidence interval of 95% for outcome prediction. Similarly, the multivariate Cox model showed higher overall survival, measured with c-statistics and log-likelihood test, of PR-Isomap compared to other dimensionality reduction methods. Kaplan Meier survival curve also signifies the notable ability of PR-Isomap to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk patients using multimodal imaging biomarkers preserving HD imaging characteristics for precision medicine.

- **Summary**: Precise localization of coronary arteries in Computed Tomography (CT) scans is critical from the perspective of medical assessment of coronary artery disease. Although various methods exist that offer high-quality segmentation of coronary arteries in cardiac contrast-enhanced CT scans, the potential of less invasive, non-contrast CT in this area is still not fully exploited. Since such fine anatomical structures are hardly visible in this type of medical images, the existing methods are characterized by high recall and low precision, and are used mainly for filtering of atherosclerotic plaques in the context of calcium scoring. In this paper, we address this research gap and introduce a deep learning algorithm for segmenting coronary arteries in multi-vendor ECG-gated non-contrast cardiac CT images which benefits from a novel framework for semi-automatic generation of Ground Truth (GT) via image registration. We hypothesize that the proposed GT generation process is much more efficient in this case than manual segmentation, since it allows for a fast generation of large volumes of diverse data, which leads to well-generalizing models. To investigate and thoroughly evaluate the segmentation quality based on such an approach, we propose a novel method for manual mesh-to-image registration, which is used to create our test-GT. The experimental study shows that the trained model has significantly higher accuracy than the GT used for training, and leads to the Dice and clDice metrics close to the interrater variability.
