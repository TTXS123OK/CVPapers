- **Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) aim to bridge the gap between neuroscience and machine learning by emulating the structure of the human nervous system. However, like convolutional neural networks, SNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To tackle the challenge, we propose a biologically inspired methodology to enhance the robustness of SNNs, drawing insights from the visual masking effect and filtering theory. First, an end-to-end SNN-based image purification model is proposed to defend against adversarial attacks, including a noise extraction network and a non-blind denoising network. The former network extracts noise features from noisy images, while the latter component employs a residual U-Net structure to reconstruct high-quality noisy images and generate clean images. Simultaneously, a multi-level firing SNN based on Squeeze-and-Excitation Network is introduced to improve the robustness of the classifier. Crucially, the proposed image purification network serves as a pre-processing module, avoiding modifications to classifiers. Unlike adversarial training, our method is highly flexible and can be seamlessly integrated with other defense strategies. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of defense effectiveness, training time, and resource consumption.

- **Summary**: In Video-based Facial Expression Recognition (V-FER), models are typically trained on closed-set datasets with a fixed number of known classes. However, these V-FER models cannot deal with unknown classes that are prevalent in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a challenging Open-set Video-based Facial Expression Recognition (OV-FER) task, aiming at identifying not only known classes but also new, unknown human facial expressions not encountered during training. While existing approaches address open-set recognition by leveraging large-scale vision-language models like CLIP to identify unseen classes, we argue that these methods may not adequately capture the nuanced and subtle human expression patterns required by the OV-FER task. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Human Expression-Sensitive Prompting (HESP) mechanism to significantly enhance CLIP's ability to model video-based facial expression details effectively, thereby presenting a new CLIP-based OV-FER approach. Our proposed HESP comprises three components: 1) a textual prompting module with learnable prompt representations to complement the original CLIP textual prompts and enhance the textual representations of both known and unknown emotions, 2) a visual prompting module that encodes temporal emotional information from video frames using expression-sensitive attention, equipping CLIP with a new visual modeling ability to extract emotion-rich information, 3) a delicately designed open-set multi-task learning scheme that facilitates prompt learning and encourages interactions between the textual and visual prompting modules. Extensive experiments conducted on four OV-FER task settings demonstrate that HESP can significantly boost CLIP's performance (a relative improvement of 17.93% on AUROC and 106.18% on OSCR) and outperform other state-of-the-art open-set video understanding methods by a large margin.

- **Summary**: We consider the question of how to best achieve the perception of eye contact when a person is captured by camera and then rendered on a 2D display. For single subjects photographed by a camera, conventional wisdom tells us that looking directly into the camera achieves eye contact. Through empirical user studies, we show that it is instead preferable to {\em look just below the camera lens}. We quantitatively assess where subjects should direct their gaze relative to a camera lens to optimize the perception that they are making eye contact.

- **Summary**: Biometric systems based on iris recognition are currently being used in border control applications and mobile devices. However, research in iris recognition is stymied by various factors such as limited datasets of bonafide irides and presentation attack instruments; restricted intra-class variations; and privacy concerns. Some of these issues can be mitigated by the use of synthetic iris data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art GAN-based synthetic iris image generation techniques, evaluating their strengths and limitations in producing realistic and useful iris images that can be used for both training and testing iris recognition systems and presentation attack detectors. In this regard, we first survey the various methods that have been used for synthetic iris generation and specifically consider generators based on StyleGAN, RaSGAN, CIT-GAN, iWarpGAN, StarGAN, etc. We then analyze the images generated by these models for realism, uniqueness, and biometric utility. This comprehensive analysis highlights the pros and cons of various GANs in the context of developing robust iris matchers and presentation attack detectors.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a method for calculating the three-dimensional (3D) position and orientation of a pallet placed on a shelf on the side of a forklift truck using a 360-degree camera. By using a 360-degree camera mounted on the forklift truck, it is possible to observe both the pallet at the side of the forklift and one several meters ahead. However, the pallet on the obtained image is observed with different distortion depending on its 3D position, so that it is difficult to extract the pallet from the image. To solve this problem, a method [1] has been proposed for detecting a pallet by projecting a 360-degree image on a vertical plane that coincides with the front of the shelf to calculate an image similar to the image seen from the front of the shelf. At the same time as the detection, the approximate position and orientation of the detected pallet can be obtained, but the accuracy is not sufficient for automatic control of the forklift truck. In this paper, we propose a method for accurately detecting the yaw angle, which is the angle of the front surface of the pallet in the horizontal plane, by projecting the 360-degree image on a horizontal plane including the boundary line of the front surface of the detected pallet. The position of the pallet is also determined by moving the vertical plane having the detected yaw angle back and forth, and finding the position at which the degree of coincidence between the projection image on the vertical plane and the actual size of the front surface of the pallet is maximized. Experiments using real images taken in a laboratory and an actual warehouse have confirmed that the proposed method can calculate the position and orientation of a pallet within a reasonable calculation time and with the accuracy necessary for inserting the fork into the hole in the front of the pallet.

- **Summary**: Cooperative perception is essential to enhance the efficiency and safety of future transportation systems, requiring extensive data sharing among vehicles on the road, which raises significant privacy concerns. Federated learning offers a promising solution by enabling data privacy-preserving collaborative enhancements in perception, decision-making, and planning among connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). However, federated learning is impeded by significant challenges arising from data heterogeneity across diverse clients, potentially diminishing model accuracy and prolonging convergence periods. This study introduces a specialized federated learning framework for CP, termed the federated dynamic weighted aggregation (FedDWA) algorithm, facilitated by dynamic adjusting loss (DALoss) function. This framework employs dynamic client weighting to direct model convergence and integrates a novel loss function that utilizes Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) to counteract the detrimental effects of non-independently and identically distributed (Non-IID) and unbalanced data. Utilizing the BEV transformer as the primary model, our rigorous testing on the OpenV2V dataset, augmented with FedBEVT data, demonstrates significant improvements in the average intersection over union (IoU). These results highlight the substantial potential of our federated learning framework to address data heterogeneity challenges in CP, thereby enhancing the accuracy of environmental perception models and facilitating more robust and efficient collaborative learning solutions in the transportation sector.

- **Summary**: Skin distortion is a long standing challenge in fingerprint matching, which causes false non-matches. Previous studies have shown that the recognition rate can be improved by estimating the distortion field from a distorted fingerprint and then rectifying it into a normal fingerprint. However, existing rectification methods are based on principal component representation of distortion fields, which is not accurate and are very sensitive to finger pose. In this paper, we propose a rectification method where a self-reference based network is utilized to directly estimate the dense distortion field of distorted fingerprint instead of its low dimensional representation. This method can output accurate distortion fields of distorted fingerprints with various finger poses. Considering the limited number and variety of distorted fingerprints in the existing public dataset, we collected more distorted fingerprints with diverse finger poses and distortion patterns as a new database. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art rectification performance in terms of distortion field estimation and rectified fingerprint matching.

- **Summary**: In order to make 3D fingerprints compatible with traditional 2D flat fingerprints, a common practice is to unfold the 3D fingerprint into a 2D rolled fingerprint, which is then matched with the flat fingerprints by traditional 2D fingerprint recognition algorithms. The problem with this method is that there may be large elastic deformation between the unfolded rolled fingerprint and flat fingerprint, which affects the recognition rate. In this paper, we propose a pose-specific 3D fingerprint unfolding algorithm to unfold the 3D fingerprint using the same pose as the flat fingerprint. Our experiments show that the proposed unfolding algorithm improves the compatibility between 3D fingerprint and flat fingerprint and thus leads to higher genuine matching scores.

- **Summary**: Bottom-up text detection methods play an important role in arbitrary-shape scene text detection but there are two restrictions preventing them from achieving their great potential, i.e., 1) the accumulation of false text segment detections, which affects subsequent processing, and 2) the difficulty of building reliable connections between text segments. Targeting these two problems, we propose a novel approach, named ``MorphText", to capture the regularity of texts by embedding deep morphology for arbitrary-shape text detection. Towards this end, two deep morphological modules are designed to regularize text segments and determine the linkage between them. First, a Deep Morphological Opening (DMOP) module is constructed to remove false text segment detections generated in the feature extraction process. Then, a Deep Morphological Closing (DMCL) module is proposed to allow text instances of various shapes to stretch their morphology along their most significant orientation while deriving their connections. Extensive experiments conducted on four challenging benchmark datasets (CTW1500, Total-Text, MSRA-TD500 and ICDAR2017) demonstrate that our proposed MorphText outperforms both top-down and bottom-up state-of-the-art arbitrary-shape scene text detection approaches.

- **Summary**: Exploring dense connectivity of convolutional operators establishes critical "synapses" to communicate feature vectors from different levels and enriches the set of transformations on Computer Vision applications. Yet, even with heavy-machinery approaches such as Neural Architecture Search (NAS), discovering effective connectivity patterns requires tremendous efforts due to either constrained connectivity design space or a sub-optimal exploration process induced by an unconstrained search space. In this paper, we propose CSCO, a novel paradigm that fabricates effective connectivity of convolutional operators with minimal utilization of existing design motifs and further utilizes the discovered wiring to construct high-performing ConvNets. CSCO guides the exploration via a neural predictor as a surrogate of the ground-truth performance. We introduce Graph Isomorphism as data augmentation to improve sample efficiency and propose a Metropolis-Hastings Evolutionary Search (MH-ES) to evade locally optimal architectures and advance search quality. Results on ImageNet show ~0.6% performance improvement over hand-crafted and NAS-crafted dense connectivity. Our code is publicly available.

- **Summary**: Fingerprint dense registration aims to finely align fingerprint pairs at the pixel level, thereby reducing intra-class differences caused by distortion. Unfortunately, traditional methods exhibited subpar performance when dealing with low-quality fingerprints while suffering from slow inference speed. Although deep learning based approaches shows significant improvement in these aspects, their registration accuracy is still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a Phase-aggregated Dual-branch Registration Network (PDRNet) to aggregate the advantages of both types of methods. A dual-branch structure with multi-stage interactions is introduced between correlation information at high resolution and texture feature at low resolution, to perceive local fine differences while ensuring global stability. Extensive experiments are conducted on more comprehensive databases compared to previous works. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reaches the state-of-the-art registration performance in terms of accuracy and robustness, while maintaining considerable competitiveness in efficiency.

- **Summary**: No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (IQA) aims at estimating image quality in accordance with subjective human perception. However, most existing NR-IQA methods focus on exploring increasingly complex networks or components to improve the final performance. Such practice imposes great limitations and complexity on IQA methods, especially when they are applied to high-resolution (HR) images in the real world. Actually, most images own high spatial redundancy, especially for those HR data. To further exploit the characteristic and alleviate the issue above, we propose a new framework for Image Quality Assessment with compressive Sampling (dubbed S-IQA), which consists of three components: (1) The Flexible Sampling Module (FSM) samples the image to obtain measurements at an arbitrary ratio. (2) Vision Transformer with the Adaptive Embedding Module (AEM) makes measurements of uniform size and extracts deep features (3) Dual Branch (DB) allocates weight for every patch and predicts the final quality score. Experiments show that our proposed S-IQA achieves state-of-the-art result on various datasets with less data usage.

- **Summary**: In semi-supervised learning, methods that rely on confidence learning to generate pseudo-labels have been widely proposed. However, increasing research finds that when faced with noisy and biased data, the model's representation network is more reliable than the classification network. Additionally, label generation methods based on model predictions often show poor adaptability across different datasets, necessitating customization of the classification network. Therefore, we propose a Hierarchical Dynamic Labeling (HDL) algorithm that does not depend on model predictions and utilizes image embeddings to generate sample labels. We also introduce an adaptive method for selecting hyperparameters in HDL, enhancing its versatility. Moreover, HDL can be combined with general image encoders (e.g., CLIP) to serve as a fundamental data processing module. We extract embeddings from datasets with class-balanced and long-tailed distributions using pre-trained semi-supervised models. Subsequently, samples are re-labeled using HDL, and the re-labeled samples are used to further train the semi-supervised models. Experiments demonstrate improved model performance, validating the motivation that representation networks are more reliable than classifiers or predictors. Our approach has the potential to change the paradigm of pseudo-label generation in semi-supervised learning.

- **Summary**: Recently, integrating video foundation models and large language models to build a video understanding system can overcome the limitations of specific pre-defined vision tasks. Yet, existing methods either employ complex spatial-temporal modules or rely heavily on additional perception models to extract temporal features for video understanding, and they only perform well on short videos. For long videos, the computational complexity and memory costs associated with long-term temporal connections are significantly increased, posing additional challenges.Taking advantage of the Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model, with tokens in Transformers being employed as the carriers of memory in combination with our specially designed memory mechanism, we propose MovieChat to overcome these challenges. We lift pre-trained multi-modal large language models for understanding long videos without incorporating additional trainable temporal modules, employing a zero-shot approach. MovieChat achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video understanding, along with the released MovieChat-1K benchmark with 1K long video, 2K temporal grounding labels, and 14K manual annotations for validation of the effectiveness of our method. The code along with the dataset can be accessed via the following https://github.com/rese1f/MovieChat.

- **Summary**: The popularity of large-scale pre-training has promoted the development of medical foundation models. However, some studies have shown that although foundation models exhibit strong general feature extraction capabilities, their performance on specific tasks is still inferior to task-specific methods. In this paper, we explore a new perspective called ``Knowledge Decomposition'' to improve the performance on specific medical tasks, which deconstruct the foundation model into multiple lightweight expert models, each dedicated to a particular task, with the goal of improving specialization while concurrently mitigating resource expenditure. To accomplish the above objective, we design a novel framework named Low-Rank Knowledge Decomposition (LoRKD), which explicitly separates graidents by incorporating low-rank expert modules and the efficient knowledge separation convolution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the decomposed models perform well in terms of performance and transferability, even surpassing the original foundation models.

- **Summary**: The accurate detection of Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS) is crucial for meteorological monitoring due to their potential to cause significant destruction through severe weather phenomena such as hail, thunderstorms, and heavy rainfall. However, the existing methods for MCS detection mostly targets on single-frame detection, which just considers the static characteristics and ignores the temporal evolution in the life cycle of MCS. In this paper, we propose a novel encoder-decoder neural network for MCS detection(MCSDNet). MCSDNet has a simple architecture and is easy to expand. Different from the previous models, MCSDNet targets on multi-frames detection and leverages multi-scale spatiotemporal information for the detection of MCS regions in remote sensing imagery(RSI). As far as we know, it is the first work to utilize multi-scale spatiotemporal information to detect MCS regions. Firstly, we design a multi-scale spatiotemporal information module to extract multi-level semantic from different encoder levels, which makes our models can extract more detail spatiotemporal features. Secondly, a Spatiotemporal Mix Unit(STMU) is introduced to MCSDNet to capture both intra-frame features and inter-frame correlations, which is a scalable module and can be replaced by other spatiotemporal module, e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer and our proposed Dual Spatiotemporal Attention(DSTA). This means that the future works about spatiotemporal modules can be easily integrated to our model. Finally, we present MCSRSI, the first publicly available dataset for multi-frames MCS detection based on visible channel images from the FY-4A satellite. We also conduct several experiments on MCSRSI and find that our proposed MCSDNet achieve the best performance on MCS detection task when comparing to other baseline methods.

- **Summary**: We introduced "Presidifussion," a novel approach to learning and replicating the unique style of calligraphy of President Xu, using a pretrained diffusion model adapted through a two-stage training process. Initially, our model is pretrained on a diverse dataset containing works from various calligraphers. This is followed by fine-tuning on a smaller, specialized dataset of President Xu's calligraphy, comprising just under 200 images. Our method introduces innovative techniques of font image conditioning and stroke information conditioning, enabling the model to capture the intricate structural elements of Chinese characters. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through a comparison with traditional methods like zi2zi and CalliGAN, with our model achieving comparable performance using significantly smaller datasets and reduced computational resources. This work not only presents a breakthrough in the digital preservation of calligraphic art but also sets a new standard for data-efficient generative modeling in the domain of cultural heritage digitization.

- **Summary**: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a valuable and robust training methodology for contemporary Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), enabling unsupervised pretraining on a `pretext task' that does not require ground-truth labels/annotation. This allows efficient representation learning from massive amounts of unlabeled training data, which in turn leads to increased accuracy in a `downstream task' by exploiting supervised transfer learning. Despite the relatively straightforward conceptualization and applicability of SSL, it is not always feasible to collect and/or to utilize very large pretraining datasets, especially when it comes to real-world application settings. In particular, in cases of specialized and domain-specific application scenarios, it may not be achievable or practical to assemble a relevant image pretraining dataset in the order of millions of instances or it could be computationally infeasible to pretrain at this scale. This motivates an investigation on the effectiveness of common SSL pretext tasks, when the pretraining dataset is of relatively limited/constrained size. In this context, this work introduces a taxonomy of modern visual SSL methods, accompanied by detailed explanations and insights regarding the main categories of approaches, and, subsequently, conducts a thorough comparative experimental evaluation in the low-data regime, targeting to identify: a) what is learnt via low-data SSL pretraining, and b) how do different SSL categories behave in such training scenarios. Interestingly, for domain-specific downstream tasks, in-domain low-data SSL pretraining outperforms the common approach of large-scale pretraining on general datasets. Grounded on the obtained results, valuable insights are highlighted regarding the performance of each category of SSL methods, which in turn suggest straightforward future research directions in the field.

- **Summary**: Emotion recognition aims to discern the emotional state of subjects within an image, relying on subject-centric and contextual visual cues. Current approaches typically follow a two-stage pipeline: first localize subjects by off-the-shelf detectors, then perform emotion classification through the late fusion of subject and context features. However, the complicated paradigm suffers from disjoint training stages and limited interaction between fine-grained subject-context elements. To address the challenge, we present a single-stage emotion recognition approach, employing a Decoupled Subject-Context Transformer (DSCT), for simultaneous subject localization and emotion classification. Rather than compartmentalizing training stages, we jointly leverage box and emotion signals as supervision to enrich subject-centric feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce DSCT to facilitate interactions between fine-grained subject-context cues in a decouple-then-fuse manner. The decoupled query token--subject queries and context queries--gradually intertwine across layers within DSCT, during which spatial and semantic relations are exploited and aggregated. We evaluate our single-stage framework on two widely used context-aware emotion recognition datasets, CAER-S and EMOTIC. Our approach surpasses two-stage alternatives with fewer parameter numbers, achieving a 3.39% accuracy improvement and a 6.46% average precision gain on CAER-S and EMOTIC datasets, respectively.

- **Summary**: Traffic data collection has been an overwhelming task for researchers as well as authorities over the years. With the advancement in technology and introduction of various tools for processing and extracting traffic data the task has been made significantly convenient. Data from Sky (DFS) is one such tool, based on image processing and artificial intelligence (AI), that provides output for macroscopic as well as microscopic variables of the traffic streams. The company claims to provide 98 to 100 percent accuracy on the data exported using DFS tool. The tool is widely used in developed countries where the traffic is homogenous and has lane-based movements. In this study, authors have checked the veracity of DFS tool in heterogenous and area-based traffic movement that is prevailing in most developing countries. The validation is done using various methods using Classified Volume Count (CVC), Space Mean Speeds (SMS) of individual vehicle classes and microscopic trajectory of probe vehicle to verify DFS claim. The error for CVCs for each vehicle class present in the traffic stream is estimated. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values are calculated for average speeds of each vehicle class between manually and DFS extracted space mean speeds (SMSs), and the microscopic trajectories are validated using a GPS based tracker put on probe vehicles. The results are fairly accurate in the case of data taken from a bird eye view with least errors. The other configurations of data collection have some significant errors, that are majorly caused by the varied traffic composition, the view of camera angle, and the direction of traffic.

- **Summary**: Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), i.e., the reconstruction of the environment represented by a (3D) map and the concurrent pose estimation, has made astonishing progress. Meanwhile, large scale applications aiming at the data collection in complex environments like factory halls or construction sites are becoming feasible. However, in contrast to small scale scenarios with building interiors separated to single rooms, shop floors or construction areas require measures at larger distances in potentially texture less areas under difficult illumination. Pose estimation is further aggravated since no GNSS measures are available as it is usual for such indoor applications. In our work, we realize data collection in a large factory hall by a robot system equipped with four stereo cameras as well as a 3D laser scanner. We apply our state-of-the-art LiDAR and visual SLAM approaches and discuss the respective pros and cons of the different sensor types for trajectory estimation and dense map generation in such an environment. Additionally, dense and accurate depth maps are generated by 3D Gaussian splatting, which we plan to use in the context of our project aiming on the automatic construction and site monitoring.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces SAGHOG, a self-supervised pretraining strategy for writer retrieval using HOG features of the binarized input image. Our preprocessing involves the application of the Segment Anything technique to extract handwriting from various datasets, ending up with about 24k documents, followed by training a vision transformer on reconstructing masked patches of the handwriting. SAGHOG is then finetuned by appending NetRVLAD as an encoding layer to the pretrained encoder. Evaluation of our approach on three historical datasets, Historical-WI, HisFrag20, and GRK-Papyri, demonstrates the effectiveness of SAGHOG for writer retrieval. Additionally, we provide ablation studies on our architecture and evaluate un- and supervised finetuning. Notably, on HisFrag20, SAGHOG outperforms related work with a mAP of 57.2 % - a margin of 11.6 % to the current state of the art, showcasing its robustness on challenging data, and is competitive on even small datasets, e.g. GRK-Papyri, where we achieve a Top-1 accuracy of 58.0%.

- **Summary**: We introduce ObjectAdd, a training-free diffusion modification method to add user-expected objects into user-specified area. The motive of ObjectAdd stems from: first, describing everything in one prompt can be difficult, and second, users often need to add objects into the generated image. To accommodate with real world, our ObjectAdd maintains accurate image consistency after adding objects with technical innovations in: (1) embedding-level concatenation to ensure correct text embedding coalesce; (2) object-driven layout control with latent and attention injection to ensure objects accessing user-specified area; (3) prompted image inpainting in an attention refocusing & object expansion fashion to ensure rest of the image stays the same. With a text-prompted image, our ObjectAdd allows users to specify a box and an object, and achieves: (1) adding object inside the box area; (2) exact content outside the box area; (3) flawless fusion between the two areas

- **Summary**: Deep learning has revolutionized medical imaging by providing innovative solutions to complex healthcare challenges. Traditional models often struggle to dynamically adjust feature importance, resulting in suboptimal representation, particularly in tasks like semantic segmentation crucial for accurate structure delineation. Moreover, their static nature incurs high computational costs. To tackle these issues, we introduce Mamba-Ahnet, a novel integration of State Space Model (SSM) and Advanced Hierarchical Network (AHNet) within the MAMBA framework, specifically tailored for semantic segmentation in medical imaging.Mamba-Ahnet combines SSM's feature extraction and comprehension with AHNet's attention mechanisms and image reconstruction, aiming to enhance segmentation accuracy and robustness. By dissecting images into patches and refining feature comprehension through self-attention mechanisms, the approach significantly improves feature resolution. Integration of AHNet into the MAMBA framework further enhances segmentation performance by selectively amplifying informative regions and facilitating the learning of rich hierarchical representations. Evaluation on the Universal Lesion Segmentation dataset demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques, with notable metrics such as a Dice similarity coefficient of approximately 98% and an Intersection over Union of about 83%. These results underscore the potential of our methodology to enhance diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and ultimately, patient outcomes in clinical practice. By addressing the limitations of traditional models and leveraging the power of deep learning, our approach represents a significant step forward in advancing medical imaging technology.

- **Summary**: Document Image Binarization is a well-known problem in Document Analysis and Computer Vision, although it is far from being solved. One of the main challenges of this task is that documents generally exhibit degradations and acquisition artifacts that can greatly vary throughout the page. Nonetheless, even when dealing with a local patch of the document, taking into account the overall appearance of a wide portion of the page can ease the prediction by enriching it with semantic information on the ink and background conditions. In this respect, approaches able to model both local and global information have been proven suitable for this task. In particular, recent applications of Vision Transformer (ViT)-based models, able to model short and long-range dependencies via the attention mechanism, have demonstrated their superiority over standard Convolution-based models, which instead struggle to model global dependencies. In this work, we propose an alternative solution based on the recently introduced Fast Fourier Convolutions, which overcomes the limitation of standard convolutions in modeling global information while requiring fewer parameters than ViTs. We validate the effectiveness of our approach via extensive experimental analysis considering different types of degradations.

- **Summary**: Artificial neural networks often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where learning new concepts leads to a complete loss of previously acquired knowledge. We observe that this issue is particularly magnified in vision transformers (ViTs), where post-pre-training and fine-tuning on new tasks can significantly degrade the model's original general abilities. For instance, a DINO ViT-Base/16 pre-trained on ImageNet-1k loses over 70% accuracy on ImageNet-1k after just 10 iterations of fine-tuning on CIFAR-100. Overcoming this stability-plasticity dilemma is crucial for enabling ViTs to continuously learn and adapt to new domains while preserving their initial knowledge. In this work, we study two new parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies: (1)~Block Expansion, and (2) Low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Our experiments reveal that using either Block Expansion or LoRA on self-supervised pre-trained ViTs surpass fully fine-tuned ViTs in new domains while offering significantly greater parameter efficiency. Notably, we find that Block Expansion experiences only a minimal performance drop in the pre-training domain, thereby effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting in pre-trained ViTs.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a novel formulation for camera motion estimation that integrates RGB-D images and inertial data through scene flow. Our goal is to accurately estimate the camera motion in a rigid 3D environment, along with the state of the inertial measurement unit (IMU). Our proposed method offers the flexibility to operate as a multi-frame optimization or to marginalize older data, thus effectively utilizing past measurements. To assess the performance of our method, we conducted evaluations using both synthetic data from the ICL-NUIM dataset and real data sequences from the OpenLORIS-Scene dataset. Our results show that the fusion of these two sensors enhances the accuracy of camera motion estimation when compared to using only visual data.

- **Summary**: Transferring the weights of a pre-trained model to assist another task has become a crucial part of modern deep learning, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. Pre-training refers to the initial step of training models outside the current task of interest, typically on another dataset. It can be done via supervised models using human-annotated datasets or self-supervised models trained on unlabeled datasets. In both cases, many pre-trained models are available to fine-tune for the task of interest. Interestingly, research has shown that pre-trained models from ImageNet can be helpful for audio tasks despite being trained on image datasets. Hence, it's unclear whether in-domain models would be advantageous compared to competent out-domain models, such as convolutional neural networks from ImageNet. Our experiments will demonstrate the usefulness of in-domain models and datasets for bird species recognition by leveraging VICReg, a recent and powerful self-supervised method.

- **Summary**: We propose a method to remotely verify the authenticity of Optically Variable Devices (OVDs), often referred to as ``holograms'', in identity documents. Our method processes video clips captured with smartphones under common lighting conditions, and is evaluated on two public datasets: MIDV-HOLO and MIDV-2020. Thanks to a weakly-supervised training, we optimize a feature extraction and decision pipeline which achieves a new leading performance on MIDV-HOLO, while maintaining a high recall on documents from MIDV-2020 used as attack samples. It is also the first method, to date, to effectively address the photo replacement attack task, and can be trained on either genuine samples, attack samples, or both for increased performance. By enabling to verify OVD shapes and dynamics with very little supervision, this work opens the way towards the use of massive amounts of unlabeled data to build robust remote identity document verification systems on commodity smartphones.

- **Summary**: Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) techniques, represented by text-to-image generation, have led to a malicious use of deep forgeries, raising concerns about the trustworthiness of multimedia content. Adapting traditional forgery detection methods to diffusion models proves challenging. Thus, this paper proposes a forgery detection method explicitly designed for diffusion models called Trinity Detector. Trinity Detector incorporates coarse-grained text features through a CLIP encoder, coherently integrating them with fine-grained artifacts in the pixel domain for comprehensive multimodal detection. To heighten sensitivity to diffusion-generated image features, a Multi-spectral Channel Attention Fusion Unit (MCAF) is designed, extracting spectral inconsistencies through adaptive fusion of diverse frequency bands and further integrating spatial co-occurrence of the two modalities. Extensive experimentation validates that our Trinity Detector method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, our performance is competitive across all datasets and up to 17.6\% improvement in transferability in the diffusion datasets.

- **Summary**: AI systems rely on extensive training on large datasets to address various tasks. However, image-based systems, particularly those used for demographic attribute prediction, face significant challenges. Many current face image datasets primarily focus on demographic factors such as age, gender, and skin tone, overlooking other crucial facial attributes like hairstyle and accessories. This narrow focus limits the diversity of the data and consequently the robustness of AI systems trained on them. This work aims to address this limitation by proposing a methodology for generating synthetic face image datasets that capture a broader spectrum of facial diversity. Specifically, our approach integrates a systematic prompt formulation strategy, encompassing not only demographics and biometrics but also non-permanent traits like make-up, hairstyle, and accessories. These prompts guide a state-of-the-art text-to-image model in generating a comprehensive dataset of high-quality realistic images and can be used as an evaluation set in face analysis systems. Compared to existing datasets, our proposed dataset proves equally or more challenging in image classification tasks while being much smaller in size.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel visual Semantic-Spatial Self-Highlighting Network (termed 3SHNet) for high-precision, high-efficiency and high-generalization image-sentence retrieval. 3SHNet highlights the salient identification of prominent objects and their spatial locations within the visual modality, thus allowing the integration of visual semantics-spatial interactions and maintaining independence between two modalities. This integration effectively combines object regions with the corresponding semantic and position layouts derived from segmentation to enhance the visual representation. And the modality-independence guarantees efficiency and generalization. Additionally, 3SHNet utilizes the structured contextual visual scene information from segmentation to conduct the local (region-based) or global (grid-based) guidance and achieve accurate hybrid-level retrieval. Extensive experiments conducted on MS-COCO and Flickr30K benchmarks substantiate the superior performances, inference efficiency and generalization of the proposed 3SHNet when juxtaposed with contemporary state-of-the-art methodologies. Specifically, on the larger MS-COCO 5K test set, we achieve 16.3%, 24.8%, and 18.3% improvements in terms of rSum score, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art methods using different image representations, while maintaining optimal retrieval efficiency. Moreover, our performance on cross-dataset generalization improves by 18.6%. Data and code are available at https://github.com/XuriGe1995/3SHNet.

- **Summary**: The practical Domain Adaptation (DA) tasks, e.g., Partial DA (PDA), open-set DA, universal DA, and test-time adaptation, have gained increasing attention in the machine learning community. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, dubbed Adversarial Reweighting with $\alpha$-Power Maximization (ARPM), for PDA where the source domain contains private classes absent in target domain. In ARPM, we propose a novel adversarial reweighting model that adversarially learns to reweight source domain data to identify source-private class samples by assigning smaller weights to them, for mitigating potential negative transfer. Based on the adversarial reweighting, we train the transferable recognition model on the reweighted source distribution to be able to classify common class data. To reduce the prediction uncertainty of the recognition model on the target domain for PDA, we present an $\alpha$-power maximization mechanism in ARPM, which enriches the family of losses for reducing the prediction uncertainty for PDA. Extensive experimental results on five PDA benchmarks, i.e., Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, ImageNet-Caltech, and DomainNet, show that our method is superior to recent PDA methods. Ablation studies also confirm the effectiveness of components in our approach. To theoretically analyze our method, we deduce an upper bound of target domain expected error for PDA, which is approximately minimized in our approach. We further extend ARPM to open-set DA, universal DA, and test time adaptation, and verify the usefulness through experiments.

- **Summary**: Manipulating unseen articulated objects through visual feedback is a critical but challenging task for real robots. Existing learning-based solutions mainly focus on visual affordance learning or other pre-trained visual models to guide manipulation policies, which face challenges for novel instances in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel part-guided 3D RL framework, which can learn to manipulate articulated objects without demonstrations. We combine the strengths of 2D segmentation and 3D RL to improve the efficiency of RL policy training. To improve the stability of the policy on real robots, we design a Frame-consistent Uncertainty-aware Sampling (FUS) strategy to get a condensed and hierarchical 3D representation. In addition, a single versatile RL policy can be trained on multiple articulated object manipulation tasks simultaneously in simulation and shows great generalizability to novel categories and instances. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in both simulation and real-world settings.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in deep learning algorithms have shown impressive progress in image copy-move forgery detection (CMFD). However, these algorithms lack generalizability in practical scenarios where the copied regions are not present in the training images, or the cloned regions are part of the background. Additionally, these algorithms utilize convolution operations to distinguish source and target regions, leading to unsatisfactory results when the target regions blend well with the background. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel end-to-end CMFD framework that integrates the strengths of conventional and deep learning methods. Specifically, the study develops a deep cross-scale PatchMatch (PM) method that is customized for CMFD to locate copy-move regions. Unlike existing deep models, our approach utilizes features extracted from high-resolution scales to seek explicit and reliable point-to-point matching between source and target regions. Furthermore, we propose a novel pairwise rank learning framework to separate source and target regions. By leveraging the strong prior of point-to-point matches, the framework can identify subtle differences and effectively discriminate between source and target regions, even when the target regions blend well with the background. Our framework is fully differentiable and can be trained end-to-end.

- **Summary**: Slippery road weather conditions are prevalent in many regions and cause a regular risk for traffic. Still, there has been less research on how autonomous vehicles could detect slippery driving conditions on the road to drive safely. In this work, we propose a method to predict a dense grip map from the area in front of the car, based on postprocessed multimodal sensor data. We trained a convolutional neural network to predict pixelwise grip values from fused RGB camera, thermal camera, and LiDAR reflectance images, based on weakly supervised ground truth from an optical road weather sensor.   The experiments show that it is possible to predict dense grip values with good accuracy from the used data modalities as the produced grip map follows both ground truth measurements and local weather conditions, such as snowy areas on the road. The model using only the RGB camera or LiDAR reflectance modality provided good baseline results for grip prediction accuracy while using models fusing the RGB camera, thermal camera, and LiDAR modalities improved the grip predictions significantly.

- **Summary**: Depth estimation is crucial for interpreting complex environments, especially in areas such as autonomous vehicle navigation and robotics. Nonetheless, obtaining accurate depth readings from event camera data remains a formidable challenge. Event cameras operate differently from traditional digital cameras, continuously capturing data and generating asynchronous binary spikes that encode time, location, and light intensity. Yet, the unique sampling mechanisms of event cameras render standard image based algorithms inadequate for processing spike data. This necessitates the development of innovative, spike-aware algorithms tailored for event cameras, a task compounded by the irregularity, continuity, noise, and spatial and temporal characteristics inherent in spiking data.Harnessing the strong generalization capabilities of transformer neural networks for spatiotemporal data, we propose a purely spike-driven spike transformer network for depth estimation from spiking camera data. To address performance limitations with Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), we introduce a novel single-stage cross-modality knowledge transfer framework leveraging knowledge from a large vision foundational model of artificial neural networks (ANN) (DINOv2) to enhance the performance of SNNs with limited data. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show substantial improvements over existing models, with notable gains in Absolute Relative and Square Relative errors (49% and 39.77% improvements over the benchmark model Spike-T, respectively). Besides accuracy, the proposed model also demonstrates reduced power consumptions, a critical factor for practical applications.

- **Summary**: Multi-view learning has become a popular research topic in recent years, but research on the cross-application of classic multi-label classification and multi-view learning is still in its early stages. In this paper, we focus on the complex yet highly realistic task of incomplete multi-view weak multi-label learning and propose a masked two-channel decoupling framework based on deep neural networks to solve this problem. The core innovation of our method lies in decoupling the single-channel view-level representation, which is common in deep multi-view learning methods, into a shared representation and a view-proprietary representation. We also design a cross-channel contrastive loss to enhance the semantic property of the two channels. Additionally, we exploit supervised information to design a label-guided graph regularization loss, helping the extracted embedding features preserve the geometric structure among samples. Inspired by the success of masking mechanisms in image and text analysis, we develop a random fragment masking strategy for vector features to improve the learning ability of encoders. Finally, it is important to emphasize that our model is fully adaptable to arbitrary view and label absences while also performing well on the ideal full data. We have conducted sufficient and convincing experiments to confirm the effectiveness and advancement of our model.

- **Summary**: In Autonomous Driving (AD) transparency and safety are paramount, as mistakes are costly. However, neural networks used in AD systems are generally considered black boxes. As a countermeasure, we have methods of explainable AI (XAI), such as feature relevance estimation and dimensionality reduction. Coarse graining techniques can also help reduce dimensionality and find interpretable global patterns. A specific coarse graining method is Renormalization Groups from statistical physics. It has previously been applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) to interpret unsupervised learning. We refine this technique by building a transparent backbone model for convolutional variational autoencoders (VAE) that allows mapping latent values to input features and has performance comparable to trained black box VAEs. Moreover, we propose a custom feature map visualization technique to analyze the internal convolutional layers in the VAE to explain internal causes of poor reconstruction that may lead to dangerous traffic scenarios in AD applications. In a second key contribution, we propose explanation and evaluation techniques for the internal dynamics and feature relevance of prediction networks. We test a long short-term memory (LSTM) network in the computer vision domain to evaluate the predictability and in future applications potentially safety of prediction models. We showcase our methods by analyzing a VAE-LSTM world model that predicts pedestrian perception in an urban traffic situation.

- **Summary**: In clinical practice, tri-modal medical image fusion, compared to the existing dual-modal technique, can provide a more comprehensive view of the lesions, aiding physicians in evaluating the disease's shape, location, and biological activity. However, due to the limitations of imaging equipment and considerations for patient safety, the quality of medical images is usually limited, leading to sub-optimal fusion performance, and affecting the depth of image analysis by the physician. Thus, there is an urgent need for a technology that can both enhance image resolution and integrate multi-modal information. Although current image processing methods can effectively address image fusion and super-resolution individually, solving both problems synchronously remains extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose TFS-Diff, a simultaneously realize tri-modal medical image fusion and super-resolution model. Specially, TFS-Diff is based on the diffusion model generation of a random iterative denoising process. We also develop a simple objective function and the proposed fusion super-resolution loss, effectively evaluates the uncertainty in the fusion and ensures the stability of the optimization process. And the channel attention module is proposed to effectively integrate key information from different modalities for clinical diagnosis, avoiding information loss caused by multiple image processing. Extensive experiments on public Harvard datasets show that TFS-Diff significantly surpass the existing state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and visual evaluations.

- **Summary**: Semantic analysis on visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) images has gained attention for its ability to be more accurate and robust under low-illumination and complex weather conditions. Due to the lack of pre-trained foundation models on the large-scale infrared image datasets, existing methods prefer to design task-specific frameworks and directly fine-tune them with pre-trained foundation models on their RGB-IR semantic relevance datasets, which results in poor scalability and limited generalization. In this work, we propose a scalable and efficient framework called UniRGB-IR to unify RGB-IR downstream tasks, in which a novel adapter is developed to efficiently introduce richer RGB-IR features into the pre-trained RGB-based foundation model. Specifically, our framework consists of a vision transformer (ViT) foundation model, a Multi-modal Feature Pool (MFP) module and a Supplementary Feature Injector (SFI) module. The MFP and SFI modules cooperate with each other as an adpater to effectively complement the ViT features with the contextual multi-scale features. During training process, we freeze the entire foundation model to inherit prior knowledge and only optimize the MFP and SFI modules. Furthermore, to verify the effectiveness of our framework, we utilize the ViT-Base as the pre-trained foundation model to perform extensive experiments. Experimental results on various RGB-IR downstream tasks demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: The goal of image-based virtual try-on is to generate an image of the target person naturally wearing the given clothing. However, most existing methods solely focus on the frontal try-on using the frontal clothing. When the views of the clothing and person are significantly inconsistent, particularly when the person's view is non-frontal, the results are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, we introduce Multi-View Virtual Try-ON (MV-VTON), which aims to reconstruct the dressing results of a person from multiple views using the given clothes. On the one hand, given that single-view clothes provide insufficient information for MV-VTON, we instead employ two images, i.e., the frontal and back views of the clothing, to encompass the complete view as much as possible. On the other hand, the diffusion models that have demonstrated superior abilities are adopted to perform our MV-VTON. In particular, we propose a view-adaptive selection method where hard-selection and soft-selection are applied to the global and local clothing feature extraction, respectively. This ensures that the clothing features are roughly fit to the person's view. Subsequently, we suggest a joint attention block to align and fuse clothing features with person features. Additionally, we collect a MV-VTON dataset, i.e., Multi-View Garment (MVG), in which each person has multiple photos with diverse views and poses. Experiments show that the proposed method not only achieves state-of-the-art results on MV-VTON task using our MVG dataset, but also has superiority on frontal-view virtual try-on task using VITON-HD and DressCode datasets. Codes and datasets will be publicly released at https://github.com/hywang2002/MV-VTON .

- **Summary**: Randomized smoothing (RS) has successfully been used to improve the robustness of predictions for deep neural networks (DNNs) by adding random noise to create multiple variations of an input, followed by deciding the consensus. To understand if an RS-enabled DNN is effective in the sampled input domains, it is mandatory to sample data points within the operational design domain, acquire the point-wise certificate regarding robustness radius, and compare it with pre-defined acceptance criteria. Consequently, ensuring that a point-wise robustness certificate for any given data point is obtained relatively cost-effectively is crucial. This work demonstrates that reducing the number of samples by one or two orders of magnitude can still enable the computation of a slightly smaller robustness radius (commonly ~20% radius reduction) with the same confidence. We provide the mathematical foundation for explaining the phenomenon while experimentally showing promising results on the standard CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.

- **Summary**: We introduce the task of human action anomaly detection (HAAD), which aims to identify anomalous motions in an unsupervised manner given only the pre-determined normal category of training action samples. Compared to prior human-related anomaly detection tasks which primarily focus on unusual events from videos, HAAD involves the learning of specific action labels to recognize semantically anomalous human behaviors. To address this task, we propose a normalizing flow (NF)-based detection framework where the sample likelihood is effectively leveraged to indicate anomalies. As action anomalies often occur in some specific body parts, in addition to the full-body action feature learning, we incorporate extra encoding streams into our framework for a finer modeling of body subsets. Our framework is thus multi-level to jointly discover global and local motion anomalies. Furthermore, to show awareness of the potentially jittery data during recording, we resort to discrete cosine transformation by converting the action samples from the temporal to the frequency domain to mitigate the issue of data instability. Extensive experimental results on two human action datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines formed by adapting state-of-the-art human activity AD approaches to our task of HAAD.

- **Summary**: Low-light remote sensing images generally feature high resolution and high spatial complexity, with continuously distributed surface features in space. This continuity in scenes leads to extensive long-range correlations in spatial domains within remote sensing images. Convolutional Neural Networks, which rely on local correlations for long-distance modeling, struggle to establish long-range correlations in such images. On the other hand, transformer-based methods that focus on global information face high computational complexities when processing high-resolution remote sensing images. From another perspective, Fourier transform can compute global information without introducing a large number of parameters, enabling the network to more efficiently capture the overall image structure and establish long-range correlations. Therefore, we propose a Dual-Domain Feature Fusion Network (DFFN) for low-light remote sensing image enhancement. Specifically, this challenging task of low-light enhancement is divided into two more manageable sub-tasks: the first phase learns amplitude information to restore image brightness, and the second phase learns phase information to refine details. To facilitate information exchange between the two phases, we designed an information fusion affine block that combines data from different phases and scales. Additionally, we have constructed two dark light remote sensing datasets to address the current lack of datasets in dark light remote sensing image enhancement. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/iijjlk/DFFN.

- **Summary**: Using image as prompts for 3D generation demonstrate particularly strong performances compared to using text prompts alone, for images provide a more intuitive guidance for the 3D generation process. In this work, we delve into the potential of using multiple image prompts, instead of a single image prompt, for 3D generation. Specifically, we build on ImageDream, a novel image-prompt multi-view diffusion model, to support multi-view images as the input prompt. Our method, dubbed MultiImageDream, reveals that transitioning from a single-image prompt to multiple-image prompts enhances the performance of multi-view and 3D object generation according to various quantitative evaluation metrics and qualitative assessments. This advancement is achieved without the necessity of fine-tuning the pre-trained ImageDream multi-view diffusion model.

- **Summary**: Image restoration, or inverse problems in image processing, has long been an extensively studied topic. In recent years supervised learning approaches have become a popular strategy attempting to tackle this task. Unfortunately, most supervised learning-based methods are highly demanding in terms of computational resources and training data (sample complexity). In addition, trained models are sensitive to domain changes, such as varying acquisition systems, signal sampling rates, resolution and contrast. In this work, we try to answer a fundamental question: Can supervised learning models generalize well solely by learning from one image or even part of an image? If so, then what is the minimal amount of patches required to achieve acceptable generalization? To this end, we focus on an efficient patch-based learning framework that requires a single image input-output pair for training. Experimental results demonstrate the applicability, robustness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach for supervised image deblurring and super-resolution. Our results showcase significant improvement of learning models' sample efficiency, generalization and time complexity, that can hopefully be leveraged for future real-time applications, and applied to other signals and modalities.

- **Summary**: Object detectors in real-world applications often fail to detect objects due to varying factors such as weather conditions and noisy input. Therefore, a process that mitigates false detections is crucial for both safety and accuracy. While uncertainty-based thresholding shows promise, previous works demonstrate an imperfect correlation between uncertainty and detection errors. This hinders ideal thresholding, prompting us to further investigate the correlation and associated cost with different types of uncertainty. We therefore propose a cost-sensitive framework for object detection tailored to user-defined budgets on the two types of errors, missing and false detections. We derive minimum thresholding requirements to prevent performance degradation and define metrics to assess the applicability of uncertainty for failure recognition. Furthermore, we automate and optimize the thresholding process to maximize the failure recognition rate w.r.t. the specified budget. Evaluation on three autonomous driving datasets demonstrates that our approach significantly enhances safety, particularly in challenging scenarios. Leveraging localization aleatoric uncertainty and softmax-based entropy only, our method boosts the failure recognition rate by 36-60\% compared to conventional approaches.

- **Summary**: Blind Compressed Image Restoration (CIR) has garnered significant attention due to its practical applications. It aims to mitigate compression artifacts caused by unknown quality factors, particularly with JPEG codecs. Existing works on blind CIR often seek assistance from a quality factor prediction network to facilitate their network to restore compressed images. However, the predicted numerical quality factor lacks spatial information, preventing network adaptability toward image contents. Recent studies in prompt-learning-based image restoration have showcased the potential of prompts to generalize across varied degradation types and degrees. This motivated us to design a prompt-learning-based compressed image restoration network, dubbed PromptCIR, which can effectively restore images from various compress levels. Specifically, PromptCIR exploits prompts to encode compression information implicitly, where prompts directly interact with soft weights generated from image features, thus providing dynamic content-aware and distortion-aware guidance for the restoration process. The light-weight prompts enable our method to adapt to different compression levels, while introducing minimal parameter overhead. Overall, PromptCIR leverages the powerful transformer-based backbone with the dynamic prompt module to proficiently handle blind CIR tasks, winning first place in the NTIRE 2024 challenge of blind compressed image enhancement track. Extensive experiments have validated the effectiveness of our proposed PromptCIR. The code is available at https://github.com/lbc12345/PromptCIR-NTIRE24.

- **Summary**: Optical Doppler Tomography (ODT) is a blood flow imaging technique popularly used in bioengineering applications. The fundamental unit of ODT is the 1D frequency response along the A-line (depth), named raw A-scan. A 2D ODT image (B-scan) is obtained by first sensing raw A-scans along the B-line (width), and then constructing the B-scan from these raw A-scans via magnitude-phase analysis and post-processing. To obtain a high-resolution B-scan with a precise flow map, densely sampled A-scans are required in current methods, causing both computational and storage burdens. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a novel sparse reconstruction framework with four main sequential steps: 1) early magnitude-phase fusion that encourages rich interaction of the complementary information in magnitude and phase, 2) State Space Model (SSM)-based representation learning, inspired by recent successes in Mamba and VMamba, to naturally capture both the intra-A-scan sequential information and between-A-scan interactions, 3) an Inception-based Feedforward Network module (IncFFN) to further boost the SSM-module, and 4) a B-line Pixel Shuffle (BPS) layer to effectively reconstruct the final results. In the experiments on real-world animal data, our method shows clear effectiveness in reconstruction accuracy. As the first application of SSM for image reconstruction tasks, we expect our work to inspire related explorations in not only efficient ODT imaging techniques but also generic image enhancement.

- **Summary**: Generating face image with specific gaze information has attracted considerable attention. Existing approaches typically input gaze values directly for face generation, which is unnatural and requires annotated gaze datasets for training, thereby limiting its application. In this paper, we present a novel gaze-controllable face generation task. Our approach inputs textual descriptions that describe human gaze and head behavior and generates corresponding face images. Our work first introduces a text-of-gaze dataset containing over 90k text descriptions spanning a dense distribution of gaze and head poses. We further propose a gaze-controllable text-to-face method. Our method contains a sketch-conditioned face diffusion module and a model-based sketch diffusion module. We define a face sketch based on facial landmarks and eye segmentation map. The face diffusion module generates face images from the face sketch, and the sketch diffusion module employs a 3D face model to generate face sketch from text description. Experiments on the FFHQ dataset show the effectiveness of our method. We will release our dataset and code for future research.

- **Summary**: Preserving the number and diversity of insects is one of our society's most important goals in the area of environmental sustainability. A prerequisite for this is a systematic and up-scaled monitoring in order to detect correlations and identify countermeasures. Therefore, automatized monitoring using live traps is important, but so far there is no system that provides image data of sufficient detailed information for entomological classification.   In this work, we present an imaging method as part of a multisensor system developed as a low-cost, scalable, open-source system that is adaptable to classical trap types. The image quality meets the requirements needed for classification in the taxonomic tree. Therefore, illumination and resolution have been optimized and motion artefacts have been suppressed. The system is evaluated exemplarily on a dataset consisting of 16 insect species of the same as well as different genus, family and order. We demonstrate that standard CNN-architectures like ResNet50 (pretrained on iNaturalist data) or MobileNet perform very well for the prediction task after re-training. Smaller custom made CNNs also lead to promising results. Classification accuracy of $>96\%$ has been achieved. Moreover, it was proved that image cropping of insects is necessary for classification of species with high inter-class similarity.

- **Summary**: We describe a protocol to study text-to-video retrieval training with unlabeled videos, where we assume (i) no access to labels for any videos, i.e., no access to the set of ground-truth captions, but (ii) access to labeled images in the form of text. Using image expert models is a realistic scenario given that annotating images is cheaper therefore scalable, in contrast to expensive video labeling schemes. Recently, zero-shot image experts such as CLIP have established a new strong baseline for video understanding tasks. In this paper, we make use of this progress and instantiate the image experts from two types of models: a text-to-image retrieval model to provide an initial backbone, and image captioning models to provide supervision signal into unlabeled videos. We show that automatically labeling video frames with image captioning allows text-to-video retrieval training. This process adapts the features to the target domain at no manual annotation cost, consequently outperforming the strong zero-shot CLIP baseline. During training, we sample captions from multiple video frames that best match the visual content, and perform a temporal pooling over frame representations by scoring frames according to their relevance to each caption. We conduct extensive ablations to provide insights and demonstrate the effectiveness of this simple framework by outperforming the CLIP zero-shot baselines on text-to-video retrieval on three standard datasets, namely ActivityNet, MSR-VTT, and MSVD.

- **Summary**: Imaging through fog significantly impacts fields such as object detection and recognition. In conditions of extremely low visibility, essential image information can be obscured, rendering standard extraction methods ineffective. Traditional digital processing techniques, such as histogram stretching, aim to mitigate fog effects by enhancing object light contrast diminished by atmospheric scattering. However, these methods often experience reduce effectiveness under inhomogeneous illumination. This paper introduces a novel approach that adaptively filters background illumination under extremely low visibility and preserve only the essential signal information. Additionally, we employ a visual optimization strategy based on image gradients to eliminate grayscale banding. Finally, the image is transformed to achieve high contrast and maintain fidelity to the original information through maximum histogram equalization. Our proposed method significantly enhances signal clarity in conditions of extremely low visibility and outperforms existing algorithms.

- **Summary**: In an era where the volume of data drives the effectiveness of self-supervised learning, the specificity and clarity of data semantics play a crucial role in model training. Addressing this, we introduce HYPerbolic Entailment filtering (HYPE), a novel methodology designed to meticulously extract modality-wise meaningful and well-aligned data from extensive, noisy image-text pair datasets. Our approach leverages hyperbolic embeddings and the concept of entailment cones to evaluate and filter out samples with meaningless or underspecified semantics, focusing on enhancing the specificity of each data sample. HYPE not only demonstrates a significant improvement in filtering efficiency but also sets a new state-of-the-art in the DataComp benchmark when combined with existing filtering techniques. This breakthrough showcases the potential of HYPE to refine the data selection process, thereby contributing to the development of more accurate and efficient self-supervised learning models. Additionally, the image specificity $\epsilon_{i}$ can be independently applied to induce an image-only dataset from an image-text or image-only data pool for training image-only self-supervised models and showed superior performance when compared to the dataset induced by CLIP score.

- **Summary**: Autonomous robotic systems capable of learning novel manipulation tasks are poised to transform industries from manufacturing to service automation. However, modern methods (e.g., VIP and R3M) still face significant hurdles, notably the domain gap among robotic embodiments and the sparsity of successful task executions within specific action spaces, resulting in misaligned and ambiguous task representations. We introduce Ag2Manip (Agent-Agnostic representations for Manipulation), a framework aimed at surmounting these challenges through two key innovations: a novel agent-agnostic visual representation derived from human manipulation videos, with the specifics of embodiments obscured to enhance generalizability; and an agent-agnostic action representation abstracting a robot's kinematics to a universal agent proxy, emphasizing crucial interactions between end-effector and object. Ag2Manip's empirical validation across simulated benchmarks like FrankaKitchen, ManiSkill, and PartManip shows a 325% increase in performance, achieved without domain-specific demonstrations. Ablation studies underline the essential contributions of the visual and action representations to this success. Extending our evaluations to the real world, Ag2Manip significantly improves imitation learning success rates from 50% to 77.5%, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability across both simulated and physical environments.

- **Summary**: Generalizable NeRF aims to synthesize novel views for unseen scenes. Common practices involve constructing variance-based cost volumes for geometry reconstruction and encoding 3D descriptors for decoding novel views. However, existing methods show limited generalization ability in challenging conditions due to inaccurate geometry, sub-optimal descriptors, and decoding strategies. We address these issues point by point. First, we find the variance-based cost volume exhibits failure patterns as the features of pixels corresponding to the same point can be inconsistent across different views due to occlusions or reflections. We introduce an Adaptive Cost Aggregation (ACA) approach to amplify the contribution of consistent pixel pairs and suppress inconsistent ones. Unlike previous methods that solely fuse 2D features into descriptors, our approach introduces a Spatial-View Aggregator (SVA) to incorporate 3D context into descriptors through spatial and inter-view interaction. When decoding the descriptors, we observe the two existing decoding strategies excel in different areas, which are complementary. A Consistency-Aware Fusion (CAF) strategy is proposed to leverage the advantages of both. We incorporate the above ACA, SVA, and CAF into a coarse-to-fine framework, termed Geometry-aware Reconstruction and Fusion-refined Rendering (GeFu). GeFu attains state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/TQTQliu/GeFu .

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are gaining traction for their remarkable ability to process and integrate visual and textual data. Despite their popularity, the capacity of LVLMs to generate precise, fine-grained textual descriptions has not been fully explored. This study addresses this gap by focusing on \textit{distinctiveness} and \textit{fidelity}, assessing how models like Open-Flamingo, IDEFICS, and MiniGPT-4 can distinguish between similar objects and accurately describe visual features. We proposed the Textual Retrieval-Augmented Classification (TRAC) framework, which, by leveraging its generative capabilities, allows us to delve deeper into analyzing fine-grained visual description generation. This research provides valuable insights into the generation quality of LVLMs, enhancing the understanding of multimodal language models. Notably, MiniGPT-4 stands out for its better ability to generate fine-grained descriptions, outperforming the other two models in this aspect.

- **Summary**: Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task in remote sensing (RS) which aims to detect the semantic changes between the same geographical regions at different time stamps. Existing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based approaches often struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Whereas recent transformer-based methods are prone to the dominant global representation and may limit their capabilities to capture the subtle change regions due to the complexity of the objects in the scene. To address these limitations, we propose an effective Siamese-based framework to encode the semantic changes occurring in the bi-temporal RS images. The main focus of our design is to introduce a change encoder that leverages local and global feature representations to capture both subtle and large change feature information from multi-scale features to precisely estimate the change regions. Our experimental study on two challenging CD datasets reveals the merits of our approach and obtains state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: This paper aims to generate materials for 3D meshes from text descriptions. Unlike existing methods that synthesize texture maps, we propose to generate segment-wise procedural material graphs as the appearance representation, which supports high-quality rendering and provides substantial flexibility in editing. Instead of relying on extensive paired data, i.e., 3D meshes with material graphs and corresponding text descriptions, to train a material graph generative model, we propose to leverage the pre-trained 2D diffusion model as a bridge to connect the text and material graphs. Specifically, our approach decomposes a shape into a set of segments and designs a segment-controlled diffusion model to synthesize 2D images that are aligned with mesh parts. Based on generated images, we initialize parameters of material graphs and fine-tune them through the differentiable rendering module to produce materials in accordance with the textual description. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in photorealism, resolution, and editability over existing methods. Project page: https://zhanghe3z.github.io/MaPa/

- **Summary**: Video try-on is a challenging task and has not been well tackled in previous works. The main obstacle lies in preserving the details of the clothing and modeling the coherent motions simultaneously. Faced with those difficulties, we address video try-on by proposing a diffusion-based framework named "Tunnel Try-on." The core idea is excavating a "focus tunnel" in the input video that gives close-up shots around the clothing regions. We zoom in on the region in the tunnel to better preserve the fine details of the clothing. To generate coherent motions, we first leverage the Kalman filter to construct smooth crops in the focus tunnel and inject the position embedding of the tunnel into attention layers to improve the continuity of the generated videos. In addition, we develop an environment encoder to extract the context information outside the tunnels as supplementary cues. Equipped with these techniques, Tunnel Try-on keeps the fine details of the clothing and synthesizes stable and smooth videos. Demonstrating significant advancements, Tunnel Try-on could be regarded as the first attempt toward the commercial-level application of virtual try-on in videos.
