- **Summary**: As one of the emerging challenges in Automated Machine Learning, the Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) tasks can be treated as black-box multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). An important application of HW-NAS is real-time semantic segmentation, which plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving scenarios. The HW-NAS for real-time semantic segmentation inherently needs to balance multiple optimization objectives, including model accuracy, inference speed, and hardware-specific considerations. Despite its importance, benchmarks have yet to be developed to frame such a challenging task as multi-objective optimization. To bridge the gap, we introduce a tailored streamline to transform the task of HW-NAS for real-time semantic segmentation into standard MOPs. Building upon the streamline, we present a benchmark test suite, CitySeg/MOP, comprising fifteen MOPs derived from the Cityscapes dataset. The CitySeg/MOP test suite is integrated into the EvoXBench platform to provide seamless interfaces with various programming languages (e.g., Python and MATLAB) for instant fitness evaluations. We comprehensively assessed the CitySeg/MOP test suite on various multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, showcasing its versatility and practicality.

- **Summary**: Pooling layers (e.g., max and average) may overlook important information encoded in the spatial arrangement of pixel intensity and/or feature values. We propose a novel lacunarity pooling layer that aims to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the feature maps by evaluating the variability within local windows. The layer operates at multiple scales, allowing the network to adaptively learn hierarchical features. The lacunarity pooling layer can be seamlessly integrated into any artificial neural network architecture. Experimental results demonstrate the layer's effectiveness in capturing intricate spatial patterns, leading to improved feature extraction capabilities. The proposed approach holds promise in various domains, especially in agricultural image analysis tasks. This work contributes to the evolving landscape of artificial neural network architectures by introducing a novel pooling layer that enriches the representation of spatial features. Our code is publicly available.

- **Summary**: Procedural noise is a fundamental component of computer graphics pipelines, offering a flexible way to generate textures that exhibit "natural" random variation. Many different types of noise exist, each produced by a separate algorithm. In this paper, we present a single generative model which can learn to generate multiple types of noise as well as blend between them. In addition, it is capable of producing spatially-varying noise blends despite not having access to such data for training. These features are enabled by training a denoising diffusion model using a novel combination of data augmentation and network conditioning techniques. Like procedural noise generators, the model's behavior is controllable via interpretable parameters and a source of randomness. We use our model to produce a variety of visually compelling noise textures. We also present an application of our model to improving inverse procedural material design; using our model in place of fixed-type noise nodes in a procedural material graph results in higher-fidelity material reconstructions without needing to know the type of noise in advance.

- **Summary**: With the development and widespread application of digital image processing technology, image splicing has become a common method of image manipulation, raising numerous security and legal issues. This paper introduces a new splicing image detection algorithm based on the statistical characteristics of natural images, aimed at improving the accuracy and efficiency of splicing image detection. By analyzing the limitations of traditional methods, we have developed a detection framework that integrates advanced statistical analysis techniques and machine learning methods. The algorithm has been validated using multiple public datasets, showing high accuracy in detecting spliced edges and locating tampered areas, as well as good robustness. Additionally, we explore the potential applications and challenges faced by the algorithm in real-world scenarios. This research not only provides an effective technological means for the field of image tampering detection but also offers new ideas and methods for future related research.

- **Summary**: Foundation models contain a wealth of information from their vast number of training samples. However, most prior arts fail to extract this information in a precise and efficient way for small sample sizes. In this work, we propose a framework utilizing reinforcement learning as a control for foundation models, allowing for the granular generation of small, focused synthetic support sets to augment the performance of neural network models on real data classification tasks. We first allow a reinforcement learning agent access to a novel context based dictionary; the agent then uses this dictionary with a novel prompt structure to form and optimize prompts as inputs to generative models, receiving feedback based on a reward function combining the change in validation accuracy and entropy. A support set is formed this way over several exploration steps. Our framework produced excellent results, increasing classification accuracy by significant margins for no additional labelling or data cost.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) refers to the method that utilizes annotated source domain data and unlabeled target domain data to train a model capable of generalizing to the target domain data. Domain discrepancy leads to a significant decrease in the performance of general network models trained on the source domain data when applied to the target domain. We introduce a straightforward approach to mitigate the domain discrepancy, which necessitates no additional parameter calculations and seamlessly integrates with self-training-based UDA methods. Through the transfer of the target domain style to the source domain in the latent feature space, the model is trained to prioritize the target domain style during the decision-making process. We tackle the problem at both the image-level and shallow feature map level by transferring the style information from the target domain to the source domain data. As a result, we obtain a model that exhibits superior performance on the target domain. Our method yields remarkable enhancements in the state-of-the-art performance for synthetic-to-real UDA tasks. For example, our proposed method attains a noteworthy UDA performance of 76.93 mIoU on the GTA->Cityscapes dataset, representing a notable improvement of +1.03 percentage points over the previous state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: Cross-modality images that integrate visible-infrared spectra cues can provide richer complementary information for object detection. Despite this, existing visible-infrared object detection methods severely degrade in severe weather conditions. This failure stems from the pronounced sensitivity of visible images to environmental perturbations, such as rain, haze, and snow, which frequently cause false negatives and false positives in detection. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and challenging task, termed visible-infrared object detection under adverse weather conditions. To foster this task, we have constructed a new Severe Weather Visible-Infrared Dataset (SWVID) with diverse severe weather scenes. Furthermore, we introduce the Cross-modality Fusion Mamba with Weather-removal (CFMW) to augment detection accuracy in adverse weather conditions. Thanks to the proposed Weather Removal Diffusion Model (WRDM) and Cross-modality Fusion Mamba (CFM) modules, CFMW is able to mine more essential information of pedestrian features in cross-modality fusion, thus could transfer to other rarer scenarios with high efficiency and has adequate availability on those platforms with low computing power. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that targeted improvement and integrated both Diffusion and Mamba modules in cross-modality object detection, successfully expanding the practical application of this type of model with its higher accuracy and more advanced architecture. Extensive experiments on both well-recognized and self-created datasets conclusively demonstrate that our CFMW achieves state-of-the-art detection performance, surpassing existing benchmarks. The dataset and source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/lhy-zjut/CFMW.

- **Summary**: Lane detection has made significant progress in recent years, but there is not a unified architecture for its two sub-tasks: 2D lane detection and 3D lane detection. To fill this gap, we introduce B\'{e}zierFormer, a unified 2D and 3D lane detection architecture based on B\'{e}zier curve lane representation. B\'{e}zierFormer formulate queries as B\'{e}zier control points and incorporate a novel B\'{e}zier curve attention mechanism. This attention mechanism enables comprehensive and accurate feature extraction for slender lane curves via sampling and fusing multiple reference points on each curve. In addition, we propose a novel Chamfer IoU-based loss which is more suitable for the B\'{e}zier control points regression. The state-of-the-art performance of B\'{e}zierFormer on widely-used 2D and 3D lane detection benchmarks verifies its effectiveness and suggests the worthiness of further exploration.

- **Summary**: Text-conditioned image-to-video generation (TI2V) aims to synthesize a realistic video starting from a given image (e.g., a woman's photo) and a text description (e.g., "a woman is drinking water."). Existing TI2V frameworks often require costly training on video-text datasets and specific model designs for text and image conditioning. In this paper, we propose TI2V-Zero, a zero-shot, tuning-free method that empowers a pretrained text-to-video (T2V) diffusion model to be conditioned on a provided image, enabling TI2V generation without any optimization, fine-tuning, or introducing external modules. Our approach leverages a pretrained T2V diffusion foundation model as the generative prior. To guide video generation with the additional image input, we propose a "repeat-and-slide" strategy that modulates the reverse denoising process, allowing the frozen diffusion model to synthesize a video frame-by-frame starting from the provided image. To ensure temporal continuity, we employ a DDPM inversion strategy to initialize Gaussian noise for each newly synthesized frame and a resampling technique to help preserve visual details. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both domain-specific and open-domain datasets, where TI2V-Zero consistently outperforms a recent open-domain TI2V model. Furthermore, we show that TI2V-Zero can seamlessly extend to other tasks such as video infilling and prediction when provided with more images. Its autoregressive design also supports long video generation.

- **Summary**: Data augmentation plays a pivotal role in enhancing and diversifying training data. Nonetheless, consistently improving model performance in varied learning scenarios, especially those with inherent data biases, remains challenging. To address this, we propose to augment the deep features of samples by incorporating their adversarial and anti-adversarial perturbation distributions, enabling adaptive adjustment in the learning difficulty tailored to each sample's specific characteristics. We then theoretically reveal that our augmentation process approximates the optimization of a surrogate loss function as the number of augmented copies increases indefinitely. This insight leads us to develop a meta-learning-based framework for optimizing classifiers with this novel loss, introducing the effects of augmentation while bypassing the explicit augmentation process. We conduct extensive experiments across four common biased learning scenarios: long-tail learning, generalized long-tail learning, noisy label learning, and subpopulation shift learning. The empirical results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its broad adaptability.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we study the problem of 3D reconstruction from a single-view RGB image and propose a novel approach called DIG3D for 3D object reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Our method utilizes an encoder-decoder framework which generates 3D Gaussians in decoder with the guidance of depth-aware image features from encoder. In particular, we introduce the use of deformable transformer, allowing efficient and effective decoding through 3D reference point and multi-layer refinement adaptations. By harnessing the benefits of 3D Gaussians, our approach offers an efficient and accurate solution for 3D reconstruction from single-view images. We evaluate our method on the ShapeNet SRN dataset, getting PSNR of 24.21 and 24.98 in car and chair dataset, respectively. The result outperforming the recent method by around 2.25%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in achieving superior results.

- **Summary**: Despite the remarkable success of deep learning in medical imaging analysis, medical image segmentation remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality labeled images for supervision. Further, the significant domain gap between natural and medical images in general and ultrasound images in particular hinders fine-tuning models trained on natural images to the task at hand. In this work, we address the performance degradation of segmentation models in low-data regimes and propose a prompt-less segmentation method harnessing the ability of segmentation foundation models to segment abstract shapes. We do that via our novel prompt point generation algorithm which uses coarse semantic segmentation masks as input and a zero-shot prompt-able foundation model as an optimization target. We demonstrate our method on a segmentation findings task (pathologic anomalies) in ultrasound images. Our method's advantages are brought to light in varying degrees of low-data regime experiments on a small-scale musculoskeletal ultrasound images dataset, yielding a larger performance gain as the training set size decreases.

- **Summary**: Model Weight Averaging (MWA) is a technique that seeks to enhance model's performance by averaging the weights of multiple trained models. This paper first empirically finds that 1) the vanilla MWA can benefit the class-imbalanced learning, and 2) performing model averaging in the early epochs of training yields a greater performance improvement than doing that in later epochs. Inspired by these two observations, in this paper we propose a novel MWA technique for class-imbalanced learning tasks named Iterative Model Weight Averaging (IMWA). Specifically, IMWA divides the entire training stage into multiple episodes. Within each episode, multiple models are concurrently trained from the same initialized model weight, and subsequently averaged into a singular model. Then, the weight of this average model serves as a fresh initialization for the ensuing episode, thus establishing an iterative learning paradigm. Compared to vanilla MWA, IMWA achieves higher performance improvements with the same computational cost. Moreover, IMWA can further enhance the performance of those methods employing EMA strategy, demonstrating that IMWA and EMA can complement each other. Extensive experiments on various class-imbalanced learning tasks, i.e., class-imbalanced image classification, semi-supervised class-imbalanced image classification and semi-supervised object detection tasks showcase the effectiveness of our IMWA.



### FedStyle: Style-Based Federated Learning Crowdsourcing Framework for Art Commissions

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: The unique artistic style is crucial to artists' occupational competitiveness, yet prevailing Art Commission Platforms rarely support style-based retrieval. Meanwhile, the fast-growing generative AI techniques aggravate artists' concerns about releasing personal artworks to public platforms. To achieve artistic style-based retrieval without exposing personal artworks, we propose FedStyle, a style-based federated learning crowdsourcing framework. It allows artists to train local style models and share model parameters rather than artworks for collaboration. However, most artists possess a unique artistic style, resulting in severe model drift among them. FedStyle addresses such extreme data heterogeneity by having artists learn their abstract style representations and align with the server, rather than merely aggregating model parameters lacking semantics. Besides, we introduce contrastive learning to meticulously construct the style representation space, pulling artworks with similar styles closer and keeping different ones apart in the embedding space. Extensive experiments on the proposed datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedStyle.

- **Summary**: Prompt learning has become the most effective paradigm for adapting large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks. Recently, unsupervised prompt tuning methods, such as UPL and POUF, directly leverage pseudo-labels as supervisory information to fine-tune additional adaptation modules on unlabeled data. However, inaccurate pseudo labels easily misguide the tuning process and result in poor representation capabilities. In light of this, we propose Training-Free Unsupervised Prompts (TFUP), which maximally preserves the inherent representation capabilities and enhances them with a residual connection to similarity-based prediction probabilities in a training-free and labeling-free manner. Specifically, we integrate both instance confidence and prototype scores to select representative samples, which are used to customize a reliable Feature Cache Model (FCM) for training-free inference. Then, we design a Multi-level Similarity Measure (MSM) that considers both feature-level and semantic-level similarities to calculate the distance between each test image and the cached sample as the weight of the corresponding cached label to generate similarity-based prediction probabilities. In this way, TFUP achieves surprising performance, even surpassing the training-base method on multiple classification datasets. Based on our TFUP, we propose a training-based approach (TFUP-T) to further boost the adaptation performance. In addition to the standard cross-entropy loss, TFUP-T adopts an additional marginal distribution entropy loss to constrain the model from a global perspective. Our TFUP-T achieves new state-of-the-art classification performance compared to unsupervised and few-shot adaptation approaches on multiple benchmarks. In particular, TFUP-T improves the classification accuracy of POUF by 3.3% on the most challenging Domain-Net dataset.

- **Summary**: Automatic retinal layer segmentation with medical images, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, serves as an important tool for diagnosing ophthalmic diseases. However, it is challenging to achieve accurate segmentation due to low contrast and blood flow noises presented in the images. In addition, the algorithm should be light-weight to be deployed for practical clinical applications. Therefore, it is desired to design a light-weight network with high performance for retinal layer segmentation. In this paper, we propose LightReSeg for retinal layer segmentation which can be applied to OCT images. Specifically, our approach follows an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder part employs multi-scale feature extraction and a Transformer block for fully exploiting the semantic information of feature maps at all scales and making the features have better global reasoning capabilities, while the decoder part, we design a multi-scale asymmetric attention (MAA) module for preserving the semantic information at each encoder scale. The experiments show that our approach achieves a better segmentation performance compared to the current state-of-the-art method TransUnet with 105.7M parameters on both our collected dataset and two other public datasets, with only 3.3M parameters.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot learning has consistently yielded remarkable progress via modeling nuanced one-to-one visual-attribute correlation. Existing studies resort to refining a uniform mapping function to align and correlate the sample regions and subattributes, ignoring two crucial issues: 1) the inherent asymmetry of attributes; and 2) the unutilized channel information. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a simple yet effective approach, dubbed Dual Expert Distillation Network (DEDN), where two experts are dedicated to coarse- and fine-grained visual-attribute modeling, respectively. Concretely, one coarse expert, namely cExp, has a complete perceptual scope to coordinate visual-attribute similarity metrics across dimensions, and moreover, another fine expert, namely fExp, consists of multiple specialized subnetworks, each corresponds to an exclusive set of attributes. Two experts cooperatively distill from each other to reach a mutual agreement during training. Meanwhile, we further equip DEDN with a newly designed backbone network, i.e., Dual Attention Network (DAN), which incorporates both region and channel attention information to fully exploit and leverage visual semantic knowledge. Experiments on various benchmark datasets indicate a new state-of-the-art.

In this paper, we propose an Improved Graph Pooling Network, referred to as IGPN. The main innovations include: Our method incorporates a region-awareness pooling strategy based on structural partitioning. The correlation matrix of the original feature is used to adaptively adjust the weight of information in different regions of the newly generated features, resulting in more flexible and effective processing. To prevent the irreversible loss of discriminative information, we propose a cross fusion module and an information supplement module to provide block-level and input-level information respectively. As a plug-and-play structure, the proposed operation can be seamlessly combined with existing GCN-based models. We conducted extensive evaluations on several challenging benchmarks, and the experimental results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed solutions. For example, in the cross-subject evaluation of the NTU-RGB+D 60 dataset, IGPN achieves a significant improvement in accuracy compared to the baseline while reducing Flops by nearly 70%; a heavier version has also been introduced to further boost accuracy.

- **Summary**: The use of multimodal data in assisted diagnosis and segmentation has emerged as a prominent area of interest in current research. However, one of the primary challenges is how to effectively fuse multimodal features. Most of the current approaches focus on the integration of multimodal features while ignoring the correlation and consistency between different modal features, leading to the inclusion of potentially irrelevant information. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative Multimodal Information Cross Transformer (MicFormer), which employs a dual-stream architecture to simultaneously extract features from each modality. Leveraging the Cross Transformer, it queries features from one modality and retrieves corresponding responses from another, facilitating effective communication between bimodal features. Additionally, we incorporate a deformable Transformer architecture to expand the search space. We conducted experiments on the MM-WHS dataset, and in the CT-MRI multimodal image segmentation task, we successfully improved the whole-heart segmentation DICE score to 85.57 and MIoU to 75.51. Compared to other multimodal segmentation techniques, our method outperforms by margins of 2.83 and 4.23, respectively. This demonstrates the efficacy of MicFormer in integrating relevant information between different modalities in multimodal tasks. These findings hold significant implications for multimodal image tasks, and we believe that MicFormer possesses extensive potential for broader applications across various domains.

- **Summary**: Set-of-Mark (SoM) Prompting unleashes the visual grounding capability of GPT-4V, by enabling the model to associate visual objects with tags inserted on the image. These tags, marked with alphanumerics, can be indexed via text tokens for easy reference. Despite the extraordinary performance from GPT-4V, we observe that other Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle to understand these visual tags. To promote the learning of SoM prompting for open-source models, we propose a new learning paradigm: "list items one by one," which asks the model to enumerate and describe all visual tags placed on the image following the alphanumeric orders of tags. By integrating our curated dataset with other visual instruction tuning datasets, we are able to equip existing MLLMs with the SoM prompting ability. Furthermore, we evaluate our finetuned SoM models on five MLLM benchmarks. We find that this new dataset, even in a relatively small size (10k-30k images with tags), significantly enhances visual reasoning capabilities and reduces hallucinations for MLLMs. Perhaps surprisingly, these improvements persist even when the visual tags are omitted from input images during inference. This suggests the potential of "list items one by one" as a new paradigm for training MLLMs, which strengthens the object-text alignment through the use of visual tags in the training stage. Finally, we conduct analyses by probing trained models to understand the working mechanism of SoM. Our code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/zzxslp/SoM-LLaVA}.

- **Summary**: Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks, primarily for computer vision tasks such as segmentation and classification. Many nonlinear operations, such as activation functions and pooling strategies, are used in DCNNs to enhance their ability to process different signals with different tasks. Conceptional convolution, a linear filter, is the essential component of DCNNs while nonlinear convolution is generally implemented as higher-order Volterra filters, However, for Volterra filtering, significant memory and computational costs pose a primary limitation for its widespread application in DCNN applications. In this study, we propose a novel method to perform higher-order Volterra filtering with lower memory and computation cost in forward and backward pass in DCNN training. The proposed method demonstrates computational advantages compared with conventional Volterra filter implementation. Furthermore, based on the proposed method, a new attention module called Higher-order Local Attention Block (HLA) is proposed and tested on CIFAR-100 dataset, which shows competitive improvement for classification task.

- **Summary**: In the realm of Medical Visual Language Models (Med-VLMs), the quest for universal efficient fine-tuning mechanisms remains paramount, especially given researchers in interdisciplinary fields are often extremely short of training resources, yet largely unexplored. Given the unique challenges in the medical domain, such as limited data scope and significant domain-specific requirements, evaluating and adapting Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods specifically for Med-VLMs is essential. Most of the current PEFT methods on Med-VLMs have yet to be comprehensively investigated but mainly focus on adding some components to the model's structure or input. However, fine-tuning intrinsic model components often yields better generality and consistency, and its impact on the ultimate performance of Med-VLMs has been widely overlooked and remains understudied. In this paper, we endeavour to explore an alternative to traditional PEFT methods, especially the impact of fine-tuning LayerNorm layers, FFNs and Attention layers on the Med-VLMs. Our comprehensive studies span both small-scale and large-scale Med-VLMs, evaluating their performance under various fine-tuning paradigms across tasks such as Medical Visual Question Answering and Medical Imaging Report Generation. The findings reveal unique insights into the effects of intrinsic parameter fine-tuning methods on fine-tuning Med-VLMs to downstream tasks and expose fine-tuning solely the LayerNorm layers not only surpasses the efficiency of traditional PEFT methods but also retains the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities across a spectrum of medical downstream tasks. The experiments show LayerNorm fine-tuning's superior adaptability and scalability, particularly in the context of large-scale Med-VLMs.

- **Summary**: Recently, the performance of monocular depth estimation (MDE) has been significantly boosted with the integration of transformer models. However, the transformer models are usually computationally-expensive, and their effectiveness in light-weight models are limited compared to convolutions. This limitation hinders their deployment on resource-limited devices. In this paper, we propose a cross-architecture knowledge distillation method for MDE, dubbed DisDepth, to enhance efficient CNN models with the supervision of state-of-the-art transformer models. Concretely, we first build a simple framework of convolution-based MDE, which is then enhanced with a novel local-global convolution module to capture both local and global information in the image. To effectively distill valuable information from the transformer teacher and bridge the gap between convolution and transformer features, we introduce a method to acclimate the teacher with a ghost decoder. The ghost decoder is a copy of the student's decoder, and adapting the teacher with the ghost decoder aligns the features to be student-friendly while preserving their original performance. Furthermore, we propose an attentive knowledge distillation loss that adaptively identifies features valuable for depth estimation. This loss guides the student to focus more on attentive regions, improving its performance. Extensive experiments on KITTI and NYU Depth V2 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DisDepth. Our method achieves significant improvements on various efficient backbones, showcasing its potential for efficient monocular depth estimation.

- **Summary**: The interactions between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) dictate therapeutic efficacy of radiation and many systemic therapies in breast cancer. However, to date, there is not a widely available method to reproducibly measure tumor and immune phenotypes for each patient's tumor. Given this unmet clinical need, we applied multiple instance learning (MIL) algorithms to assess activity of ten biologically relevant pathways from the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slide of primary breast tumors. We employed different feature extraction approaches and state-of-the-art model architectures. Using binary classification, our models attained area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) scores above 0.70 for nearly all gene expression pathways and on some cases, exceeded 0.80. Attention maps suggest that our trained models recognize biologically relevant spatial patterns of cell sub-populations from H&E. These efforts represent a first step towards developing computational H&E biomarkers that reflect facets of the TME and hold promise for augmenting precision oncology.

- **Summary**: Many image retrieval studies use metric learning to train an image encoder. However, metric learning cannot handle differences in users' preferences, and requires data to train an image encoder. To overcome these limitations, we revisit relevance feedback, a classic technique for interactive retrieval systems, and propose an interactive CLIP-based image retrieval system with relevance feedback. Our retrieval system first executes the retrieval, collects each user's unique preferences through binary feedback, and returns images the user prefers. Even when users have various preferences, our retrieval system learns each user's preference through the feedback and adapts to the preference. Moreover, our retrieval system leverages CLIP's zero-shot transferability and achieves high accuracy without training. We empirically show that our retrieval system competes well with state-of-the-art metric learning in category-based image retrieval, despite not training image encoders specifically for each dataset. Furthermore, we set up two additional experimental settings where users have various preferences: one-label-based image retrieval and conditioned image retrieval. In both cases, our retrieval system effectively adapts to each user's preferences, resulting in improved accuracy compared to image retrieval without feedback. Overall, our work highlights the potential benefits of integrating CLIP with classic relevance feedback techniques to enhance image retrieval.

- **Summary**: Satellite imaging generally presents a trade-off between the frequency of acquisitions and the spatial resolution of the images. Super-resolution is often advanced as a way to get the best of both worlds. In this work, we investigate multi-image super-resolution of satellite image time series, i.e. how multiple images of the same area acquired at different dates can help reconstruct a higher resolution observation. In particular, we extend state-of-the-art deep single and multi-image super-resolution algorithms, such as SRDiff and HighRes-net, to deal with irregularly sampled Sentinel-2 time series. We introduce BreizhSR, a new dataset for 4x super-resolution of Sentinel-2 time series using very high-resolution SPOT-6 imagery of Brittany, a French region. We show that using multiple images significantly improves super-resolution performance, and that a well-designed temporal positional encoding allows us to perform super-resolution for different times of the series. In addition, we observe a trade-off between spectral fidelity and perceptual quality of the reconstructed HR images, questioning future directions for super-resolution of Earth Observation data.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised action recognition aims to improve spatio-temporal reasoning ability with a few labeled data in conjunction with a large amount of unlabeled data. Albeit recent advancements, existing powerful methods are still prone to making ambiguous predictions under scarce labeled data, embodied as the limitation of distinguishing different actions with similar spatio-temporal information. In this paper, we approach this problem by empowering the model two aspects of capability, namely discriminative spatial modeling and temporal structure modeling for learning discriminative spatio-temporal representations. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Contrastive Learning~(ACL) strategy. It assesses the confidence of all unlabeled samples by the class prototypes of the labeled data, and adaptively selects positive-negative samples from a pseudo-labeled sample bank to construct contrastive learning. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-scale Temporal Learning~(MTL) strategy. It could highlight informative semantics from long-term clips and integrate them into the short-term clip while suppressing noisy information. Afterwards, both of these two new techniques are integrated in a unified framework to encourage the model to make accurate predictions. Extensive experiments on UCF101, HMDB51 and Kinetics400 show the superiority of our method over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Cell tracking remains a pivotal yet challenging task in biomedical research. The full potential of deep learning for this purpose is often untapped due to the limited availability of comprehensive and varied training data sets. In this paper, we present SynCellFactory, a generative cell video augmentation. At the heart of SynCellFactory lies the ControlNet architecture, which has been fine-tuned to synthesize cell imagery with photorealistic accuracy in style and motion patterns. This technique enables the creation of synthetic yet realistic cell videos that mirror the complexity of authentic microscopy time-lapses. Our experiments demonstrate that SynCellFactory boosts the performance of well-established deep learning models for cell tracking, particularly when original training data is sparse.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a robust fine-tuning method designed for pre-trained 3D point cloud models, to enhance feature robustness in downstream fine-tuned models. We highlight the limitations of current fine-tuning methods and the challenges of learning robust models. The proposed method, named Weight-Space Ensembles for Fine-Tuning then Linear Probing (WiSE-FT-LP), integrates the original pre-training and fine-tuning models through weight space integration followed by Linear Probing. This approach significantly enhances the performance of downstream fine-tuned models under distribution shifts, improving feature robustness while maintaining high performance on the target distribution. We apply this robust fine-tuning method to mainstream 3D point cloud pre-trained models and evaluate the quality of model parameters and the degradation of downstream task performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of WiSE-FT-LP in enhancing model robustness, effectively balancing downstream task performance and model feature robustness without altering the model structures.

- **Summary**: Image-guided object assembly represents a burgeoning research topic in computer vision. This paper introduces a novel task: translating multi-view images of a structural 3D model (for example, one constructed with building blocks drawn from a 3D-object library) into a detailed sequence of assembly instructions executable by a robotic arm. Fed with multi-view images of the target 3D model for replication, the model designed for this task must address several sub-tasks, including recognizing individual components used in constructing the 3D model, estimating the geometric pose of each component, and deducing a feasible assembly order adhering to physical rules. Establishing accurate 2D-3D correspondence between multi-view images and 3D objects is technically challenging. To tackle this, we propose an end-to-end model known as the Neural Assembler. This model learns an object graph where each vertex represents recognized components from the images, and the edges specify the topology of the 3D model, enabling the derivation of an assembly plan. We establish benchmarks for this task and conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations of Neural Assembler and alternative solutions. Our experiments clearly demonstrate the superiority of Neural Assembler.

- **Summary**: While originally developed for novel view synthesis, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have recently emerged as an alternative to multi-view stereo (MVS). Triggered by a manifold of research activities, promising results have been gained especially for texture-less, transparent, and reflecting surfaces, while such scenarios remain challenging for traditional MVS-based approaches. However, most of these investigations focus on close-range scenarios, with studies for airborne scenarios still missing. For this task, NeRFs face potential difficulties at areas of low image redundancy and weak data evidence, as often found in street canyons, facades or building shadows. Furthermore, training such networks is computationally expensive. Thus, the aim of our work is twofold: First, we investigate the applicability of NeRFs for aerial image blocks representing different characteristics like nadir-only, oblique and high-resolution imagery. Second, during these investigations we demonstrate the benefit of integrating depth priors from tie-point measures, which are provided during presupposed Bundle Block Adjustment. Our work is based on the state-of-the-art framework VolSDF, which models 3D scenes by signed distance functions (SDFs), since this is more applicable for surface reconstruction compared to the standard volumetric representation in vanilla NeRFs. For evaluation, the NeRF-based reconstructions are compared to results of a publicly available benchmark dataset for airborne images.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in self-supervised learning in the point cloud domain have demonstrated significant potential. However, these methods often suffer from drawbacks, including lengthy pre-training time, the necessity of reconstruction in the input space, or the necessity of additional modalities. In order to address these issues, we introduce Point-JEPA, a joint embedding predictive architecture designed specifically for point cloud data. To this end, we introduce a sequencer that orders point cloud tokens to efficiently compute and utilize tokens proximity based on their indices during target and context selection. The sequencer also allows shared computations of the tokens proximity between context and target selection, further improving the efficiency. Experimentally, our method achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art methods while avoiding the reconstruction in the input space or additional modality.

- **Summary**: The recent work Local Implicit Image Function (LIIF) and subsequent Implicit Neural Representation (INR) based works have achieved remarkable success in Arbitrary-Scale Super-Resolution (ASSR) by using MLP to decode Low-Resolution (LR) features. However, these continuous image representations typically implement decoding in High-Resolution (HR) High-Dimensional (HD) space, leading to a quadratic increase in computational cost and seriously hindering the practical applications of ASSR. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Latent Modulated Function (LMF), which decouples the HR-HD decoding process into shared latent decoding in LR-HD space and independent rendering in HR Low-Dimensional (LD) space, thereby realizing the first computational optimal paradigm of continuous image representation. Specifically, LMF utilizes an HD MLP in latent space to generate latent modulations of each LR feature vector. This enables a modulated LD MLP in render space to quickly adapt to any input feature vector and perform rendering at arbitrary resolution. Furthermore, we leverage the positive correlation between modulation intensity and input image complexity to design a Controllable Multi-Scale Rendering (CMSR) algorithm, offering the flexibility to adjust the decoding efficiency based on the rendering precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that converting existing INR-based ASSR methods to LMF can reduce the computational cost by up to 99.9%, accelerate inference by up to 57 times, and save up to 76% of parameters, while maintaining competitive performance.

- **Summary**: Adversarial patch attacks present a significant threat to real-world object detectors due to their practical feasibility. Existing defense methods, which rely on attack data or prior knowledge, struggle to effectively address a wide range of adversarial patches. In this paper, we show two inherent characteristics of adversarial patches, semantic independence and spatial heterogeneity, independent of their appearance, shape, size, quantity, and location. Semantic independence indicates that adversarial patches operate autonomously within their semantic context, while spatial heterogeneity manifests as distinct image quality of the patch area that differs from original clean image due to the independent generation process. Based on these observations, we propose PAD, a novel adversarial patch localization and removal method that does not require prior knowledge or additional training. PAD offers patch-agnostic defense against various adversarial patches, compatible with any pre-trained object detectors. Our comprehensive digital and physical experiments involving diverse patch types, such as localized noise, printable, and naturalistic patches, exhibit notable improvements over state-of-the-art works.

- **Summary**: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to understand human sentiment through multimodal data. Most MSA efforts are based on the assumption of modality completeness. However, in real-world applications, some practical factors cause uncertain modality missingness, which drastically degrades the model's performance. To this end, we propose a Correlation-decoupled Knowledge Distillation (CorrKD) framework for the MSA task under uncertain missing modalities. Specifically, we present a sample-level contrastive distillation mechanism that transfers comprehensive knowledge containing cross-sample correlations to reconstruct missing semantics. Moreover, a category-guided prototype distillation mechanism is introduced to capture cross-category correlations using category prototypes to align feature distributions and generate favorable joint representations. Eventually, we design a response-disentangled consistency distillation strategy to optimize the sentiment decision boundaries of the student network through response disentanglement and mutual information maximization. Comprehensive experiments on three datasets indicate that our framework can achieve favorable improvements compared with several baselines.

- **Summary**: We present a generic algorithm for scoring pose estimation methods that rely on single image semantic analysis. The algorithm employs a lightweight putative shape representation using a combination of multiple Gaussian Processes. Each Gaussian Process (GP) yields distance normal distributions from multiple reference points in the object's coordinate system to its surface, thus providing a geometric evaluation framework for scoring predicted poses. Our confidence measure comprises the average mixture probability of pixel back-projections onto the shape template. In the reported experiments, we compare the accuracy of our GP based representation of objects versus the actual geometric models and demonstrate the ability of our method to capture the influence of outliers as opposed to the corresponding intrinsic measures that ship with the segmentation and pose estimation methods.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised medical image segmentation (MIS) using generative models is crucial for clinical diagnosis. However, the accuracy of the segmentation results is often limited by insufficient supervision and the complex nature of medical imaging. Existing models also only provide a single outcome, which does not allow for the measurement of uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce DiffSeg, a segmentation model for skin lesions based on diffusion difference which exploits diffusion model principles to ex-tract noise-based features from images with diverse semantic information. By discerning difference between these noise features, the model identifies diseased areas. Moreover, its multi-output capability mimics doctors' annotation behavior, facilitating the visualization of segmentation result consistency and ambiguity. Additionally, it quantifies output uncertainty using Generalized Energy Distance (GED), aiding interpretability and decision-making for physicians. Finally, the model integrates outputs through the Dense Conditional Random Field (DenseCRF) algorithm to refine the segmentation boundaries by considering inter-pixel correlations, which improves the accuracy and optimizes the segmentation results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffSeg on the ISIC 2018 Challenge dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art U-Net-based methods.

- **Summary**: A central question for cognitive science is to understand how humans process visual objects, i.e, to uncover human low-dimensional concept representation space from high-dimensional visual stimuli. Generating visual stimuli with controlling concepts is the key. However, there are currently no generative models in AI to solve this problem. Here, we present the Concept based Controllable Generation (CoCoG) framework. CoCoG consists of two components, a simple yet efficient AI agent for extracting interpretable concept and predicting human decision-making in visual similarity judgment tasks, and a conditional generation model for generating visual stimuli given the concepts. We quantify the performance of CoCoG from two aspects, the human behavior prediction accuracy and the controllable generation ability. The experiments with CoCoG indicate that 1) the reliable concept embeddings in CoCoG allows to predict human behavior with 64.07\% accuracy in the THINGS-similarity dataset; 2) CoCoG can generate diverse objects through the control of concepts; 3) CoCoG can manipulate human similarity judgment behavior by intervening key concepts. CoCoG offers visual objects with controlling concepts to advance our understanding of causality in human cognition. The code of CoCoG is available at \url{https://github.com/ncclab-sustech/CoCoG}.

- **Summary**: The prevalent approaches of unsupervised 3D object detection follow cluster-based pseudo-label generation and iterative self-training processes. However, the challenge arises due to the sparsity of LiDAR scans, which leads to pseudo-labels with erroneous size and position, resulting in subpar detection performance. To tackle this problem, this paper introduces a Commonsense Prototype-based Detector, termed CPD, for unsupervised 3D object detection. CPD first constructs Commonsense Prototype (CProto) characterized by high-quality bounding box and dense points, based on commonsense intuition. Subsequently, CPD refines the low-quality pseudo-labels by leveraging the size prior from CProto. Furthermore, CPD enhances the detection accuracy of sparsely scanned objects by the geometric knowledge from CProto. CPD outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised 3D detectors on Waymo Open Dataset (WOD), PandaSet, and KITTI datasets by a large margin. Besides, by training CPD on WOD and testing on KITTI, CPD attains 90.85% and 81.01% 3D Average Precision on easy and moderate car classes, respectively. These achievements position CPD in close proximity to fully supervised detectors, highlighting the significance of our method. The code will be available at https://github.com/hailanyi/CPD.



### 360SFUDA++: Towards Source-free UDA for Panoramic Segmentation by Learning Reliable Category Prototypes

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the challenging source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) for pinhole-to-panoramic semantic segmentation, given only a pinhole image pre-trained model (i.e., source) and unlabeled panoramic images (i.e., target). Tackling this problem is non-trivial due to three critical challenges: 1) semantic mismatches from the distinct Field-of-View (FoV) between domains, 2) style discrepancies inherent in the UDA problem, and 3) inevitable distortion of the panoramic images. To tackle these problems, we propose 360SFUDA++ that effectively extracts knowledge from the source pinhole model with only unlabeled panoramic images and transfers the reliable knowledge to the target panoramic domain. Specifically, we first utilize Tangent Projection (TP) as it has less distortion and meanwhile slits the equirectangular projection (ERP) to patches with fixed FoV projection (FFP) to mimic the pinhole images. Both projections are shown effective in extracting knowledge from the source model. However, as the distinct projections make it less possible to directly transfer knowledge between domains, we then propose Reliable Panoramic Prototype Adaptation Module (RP2AM) to transfer knowledge at both prediction and prototype levels. RP$^2$AM selects the confident knowledge and integrates panoramic prototypes for reliable knowledge adaptation. Moreover, we introduce Cross-projection Dual Attention Module (CDAM), which better aligns the spatial and channel characteristics across projections at the feature level between domains. Both knowledge extraction and transfer processes are synchronously updated to reach the best performance. Extensive experiments on the synthetic and real-world benchmarks, including outdoor and indoor scenarios, demonstrate that our 360SFUDA++ achieves significantly better performance than prior SFUDA methods.



### Semantic-aware Next-Best-View for Multi-DoFs Mobile System in Search-and-Acquisition based Visual Perception

- **Summary**: Efficient visual perception using mobile systems is crucial, particularly in unknown environments such as search and rescue operations, where swift and comprehensive perception of objects of interest is essential. In such real-world applications, objects of interest are often situated in complex environments, making the selection of the 'Next Best' view based solely on maximizing visibility gain suboptimal. Semantics, providing a higher-level interpretation of perception, should significantly contribute to the selection of the next viewpoint for various perception tasks. In this study, we formulate a novel information gain that integrates both visibility gain and semantic gain in a unified form to select the semantic-aware Next-Best-View. Additionally, we design an adaptive strategy with termination criterion to support a two-stage search-and-acquisition manoeuvre on multiple objects of interest aided by a multi-degree-of-freedoms (Multi-DoFs) mobile system. Several semantically relevant reconstruction metrics, including perspective directivity and region of interest (ROI)-to-full reconstruction volume ratio, are introduced to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Simulation experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach over existing methods, achieving improvements of up to 27.13% for the ROI-to-full reconstruction volume ratio and a 0.88234 average perspective directivity. Furthermore, the planned motion trajectory exhibits better perceiving coverage toward the target.

- **Summary**: 3D object generation has undergone significant advancements, yielding high-quality results. However, fall short of achieving precise user control, often yielding results that do not align with user expectations, thus limiting their applicability. User-envisioning 3D object generation faces significant challenges in realizing its concepts using current generative models due to limited interaction capabilities. Existing methods mainly offer two approaches: (i) interpreting textual instructions with constrained controllability, or (ii) reconstructing 3D objects from 2D images. Both of them limit customization to the confines of the 2D reference and potentially introduce undesirable artifacts during the 3D lifting process, restricting the scope for direct and versatile 3D modifications. In this work, we introduce Interactive3D, an innovative framework for interactive 3D generation that grants users precise control over the generative process through extensive 3D interaction capabilities. Interactive3D is constructed in two cascading stages, utilizing distinct 3D representations. The first stage employs Gaussian Splatting for direct user interaction, allowing modifications and guidance of the generative direction at any intermediate step through (i) Adding and Removing components, (ii) Deformable and Rigid Dragging, (iii) Geometric Transformations, and (iv) Semantic Editing. Subsequently, the Gaussian splats are transformed into InstantNGP. We introduce a novel (v) Interactive Hash Refinement module to further add details and extract the geometry in the second stage. Our experiments demonstrate that Interactive3D markedly improves the controllability and quality of 3D generation. Our project webpage is available at \url{https://interactive-3d.github.io/}.

- **Summary**: Laboratory processes involving small volumes of solutions and active ingredients are often performed manually due to challenges in automation, such as high initial costs, semi-structured environments and protocol variability. In this work, we develop a flexible and cost-effective approach to address this gap by introducing a vision-based system for liquid volume estimation and a simulation-driven pouring method particularly designed for containers with small openings. We evaluate both components individually, followed by an applied real-world integration of cell culture automation using a UR5 robotic arm.

- **Summary**: Generative 3D face models featuring disentangled controlling factors hold immense potential for diverse applications in computer vision and computer graphics. However, previous 3D face modeling methods face a challenge as they demand specific labels to effectively disentangle these factors. This becomes particularly problematic when integrating multiple 3D face datasets to improve the generalization of the model. Addressing this issue, this paper introduces a Weakly-Supervised Disentanglement Framework, denoted as WSDF, to facilitate the training of controllable 3D face models without an overly stringent labeling requirement. Adhering to the paradigm of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), the proposed model achieves disentanglement of identity and expression controlling factors through a two-branch encoder equipped with dedicated identity-consistency prior. It then faithfully re-entangles these factors via a tensor-based combination mechanism. Notably, the introduction of the Neutral Bank allows precise acquisition of subject-specific information using only identity labels, thereby averting degeneration due to insufficient supervision. Additionally, the framework incorporates a label-free second-order loss function for the expression factor to regulate deformation space and eliminate extraneous information, resulting in enhanced disentanglement. Extensive experiments have been conducted to substantiate the superior performance of WSDF. Our code is available at https://github.com/liguohao96/WSDF.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in Vision and Language Models (VLMs) have improved open-world 3D representation, facilitating 3D zero-shot capability in unseen categories. Existing open-world methods pre-train an extra 3D encoder to align features from 3D data (e.g., depth maps or point clouds) with CAD-rendered images and corresponding texts. However, the limited color and texture variations in CAD images can compromise the alignment robustness. Furthermore, the volume discrepancy between pre-training datasets of the 3D encoder and VLM leads to sub-optimal 2D to 3D knowledge transfer. To overcome these issues, we propose OpenDlign, a novel framework for learning open-world 3D representations, that leverages depth-aligned images generated from point cloud-projected depth maps. Unlike CAD-rendered images, our generated images provide rich, realistic color and texture diversity while preserving geometric and semantic consistency with the depth maps. OpenDlign also optimizes depth map projection and integrates depth-specific text prompts, improving 2D VLM knowledge adaptation for 3D learning efficient fine-tuning. Experimental results show that OpenDlign significantly outperforms existing benchmarks in zero-shot and few-shot 3D tasks, exceeding prior scores by 8.0% on ModelNet40 and 16.4% on OmniObject3D with just 6 million tuned parameters. Moreover, integrating generated depth-aligned images into existing 3D learning pipelines consistently improves their performance.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address the problem of camera and radar sensor fusion for 3D object detection in autonomous vehicle perception systems. Our approach builds on recent advances in deep learning and leverages the strengths of both sensors to improve object detection performance. Precisely, we extract 2D features from camera images using a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture and then apply a novel Cross-Domain Spatial Matching (CDSM) transformation method to convert these features into 3D space. We then fuse them with extracted radar data using a complementary fusion strategy to produce a final 3D object representation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate it on the NuScenes dataset. We compare our approach to both single-sensor performance and current state-of-the-art fusion methods. Our results show that the proposed approach achieves superior performance over single-sensor solutions and could directly compete with other top-level fusion methods.

- **Summary**: We revisit certain problems of pose estimation based on 3D--2D correspondences between features which may be points or lines. Specifically, we address the two previously-studied minimal problems of estimating camera extrinsics from $p \in \{ 1, 2 \}$ point--point correspondences and $l=3-p$ line--line correspondences. To the best of our knowledge, all of the previously-known practical solutions to these problems required computing the roots of degree $\ge 4$ (univariate) polynomials when $p=2$, or degree $\ge 8$ polynomials when $p=1.$ We describe and implement two elementary solutions which reduce the degrees of the needed polynomials from $4$ to $2$ and from $8$ to $4$, respectively. We show experimentally that the resulting solvers are numerically stable and fast: when compared to the previous state-of-the art, we may obtain nearly an order of magnitude speedup.

- **Summary**: Few-shot image synthesis entails generating diverse and realistic images of novel categories using only a few example images. While multiple recent efforts in this direction have achieved impressive results, the existing approaches are dependent only upon the few novel samples available at test time in order to generate new images, which restricts the diversity of the generated images. To overcome this limitation, we propose Conditional Distribution Modelling (CDM) -- a framework which effectively utilizes Diffusion models for few-shot image generation. By modelling the distribution of the latent space used to condition a Diffusion process, CDM leverages the learnt statistics of the training data to get a better approximation of the unseen class distribution, thereby removing the bias arising due to limited number of few shot samples. Simultaneously, we devise a novel inversion based optimization strategy that further improves the approximated unseen class distribution, and ensures the fidelity of the generated samples to the unseen class. The experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CDM for few-shot generation.

- **Summary**: Despite the exceptional performance of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), their deployment requires substantial computational resources. Once malicious users induce high energy consumption and latency time (energy-latency cost), it will exhaust computational resources and harm availability of service. In this paper, we investigate this vulnerability for MLLMs, particularly image-based and video-based ones, and aim to induce high energy-latency cost during inference by crafting an imperceptible perturbation. We find that high energy-latency cost can be manipulated by maximizing the length of generated sequences, which motivates us to propose verbose samples, including verbose images and videos. Concretely, two modality non-specific losses are proposed, including a loss to delay end-of-sequence (EOS) token and an uncertainty loss to increase the uncertainty over each generated token. In addition, improving diversity is important to encourage longer responses by increasing the complexity, which inspires the following modality specific loss. For verbose images, a token diversity loss is proposed to promote diverse hidden states. For verbose videos, a frame feature diversity loss is proposed to increase the feature diversity among frames. To balance these losses, we propose a temporal weight adjustment algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our verbose samples can largely extend the length of generated sequences.

The traditional geometry recognition technology is relatively backward and the recognition rate is low. In the face of massive information database, the traditional algorithm model inevitably has the problems of low recognition accuracy and poor performance. Deep learning theory has gradually become a very important part of machine learning. The implementation of convolutional neural network (CNN) reduces the difficulty of graphics generation algorithm. In this paper, using the advantages of lenet-5 architecture sharing weights and feature extraction and classification, the proposed geometric pattern recognition algorithm model is faster in the training data set. By constructing the shared feature parameters of the algorithm model, the cross-entropy loss function is used in the recognition process to improve the generalization of the model and improve the average recognition accuracy of the test data set.

- **Summary**: Photometric constraint is indispensable for self-supervised monocular depth estimation. It involves warping a source image onto a target view using estimated depth&pose, and then minimizing the difference between the warped and target images. However, the endoscopic built-in light causes significant brightness fluctuations, and thus makes the photometric constraint unreliable. Previous efforts only mitigate this relying on extra models to calibrate image brightness. In this paper, we propose MonoPCC to address the brightness inconsistency radically by reshaping the photometric constraint into a cycle form. Instead of only warping the source image, MonoPCC constructs a closed loop consisting of two opposite forward-backward warping paths: from target to source and then back to target. Thus, the target image finally receives an image cycle-warped from itself, which naturally makes the constraint invariant to brightness changes. Moreover, MonoPCC transplants the source image's phase-frequency into the intermediate warped image to avoid structure lost, and also stabilizes the training via an exponential moving average (EMA) strategy to avoid frequent changes in the forward warping. The comprehensive and extensive experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that our proposed MonoPCC shows a great robustness to the brightness inconsistency, and exceeds other state-of-the-arts by reducing the absolute relative error by at least 7.27%.

- **Summary**: Multi-scale learning is central to semantic segmentation. We visualize the effective receptive field (ERF) of canonical multi-scale representations and point out two risks in learning them: scale inadequacy and field inactivation. A novel multi-scale learner, varying window attention (VWA), is presented to address these issues. VWA leverages the local window attention (LWA) and disentangles LWA into the query window and context window, allowing the context's scale to vary for the query to learn representations at multiple scales. However, varying the context to large-scale windows (enlarging ratio R) can significantly increase the memory footprint and computation cost (R^2 times larger than LWA). We propose a simple but professional re-scaling strategy to zero the extra induced cost without compromising performance. Consequently, VWA uses the same cost as LWA to overcome the receptive limitation of the local window. Furthermore, depending on VWA and employing various MLPs, we introduce a multi-scale decoder (MSD), VWFormer, to improve multi-scale representations for semantic segmentation. VWFormer achieves efficiency competitive with the most compute-friendly MSDs, like FPN and MLP decoder, but performs much better than any MSDs. For instance, using nearly half of UPerNet's computation, VWFormer outperforms it by 1.0%-2.5% mIoU on ADE20K. With little extra overhead, ~10G FLOPs, Mask2Former armed with VWFormer improves by 1.0%-1.3%.

- **Summary**: In below freezing winter conditions, road surface friction can greatly vary based on the mixture of snow, ice, and water on the road. Friction between the road and vehicle tyres is a critical parameter defining vehicle dynamics, and therefore road surface friction information is essential to acquire for several intelligent transportation applications, such as safe control of automated vehicles or alerting drivers of slippery road conditions. This paper explores computer vision-based evaluation of road surface friction from roadside cameras. Previous studies have extensively investigated the application of convolutional neural networks for the task of evaluating the road surface condition from images. Here, we propose a hybrid deep learning architecture, WCamNet, consisting of a pretrained visual transformer model and convolutional blocks. The motivation of the architecture is to combine general visual features provided by the transformer model, as well as finetuned feature extraction properties of the convolutional blocks. To benchmark the approach, an extensive dataset was gathered from national Finnish road infrastructure network of roadside cameras and optical road surface friction sensors. Acquired results highlight that the proposed WCamNet outperforms previous approaches in the task of predicting the road surface friction from the roadside camera images.

- **Summary**: Audio-driven visual scene editing endeavors to manipulate the visual background while leaving the foreground content unchanged, according to the given audio signals. Unlike current efforts focusing primarily on image editing, audio-driven video scene editing has not been extensively addressed. In this paper, we introduce AudioScenic, an audio-driven framework designed for video scene editing. AudioScenic integrates audio semantics into the visual scene through a temporal-aware audio semantic injection process. As our focus is on background editing, we further introduce a SceneMasker module, which maintains the integrity of the foreground content during the editing process. AudioScenic exploits the inherent properties of audio, namely, audio magnitude and frequency, to guide the editing process, aiming to control the temporal dynamics and enhance the temporal consistency. First, we present an audio Magnitude Modulator module that adjusts the temporal dynamics of the scene in response to changes in audio magnitude, enhancing the visual dynamics. Second, the audio Frequency Fuser module is designed to ensure temporal consistency by aligning the frequency of the audio with the dynamics of the video scenes, thus improving the overall temporal coherence of the edited videos. These integrated features enable AudioScenic to not only enhance visual diversity but also maintain temporal consistency throughout the video. We present a new metric named temporal score for more comprehensive validation of temporal consistency. We demonstrate substantial advancements of AudioScenic over competing methods on DAVIS and Audioset datasets.

- **Summary**: The task of spatiotemporal action localization in chaotic scenes is a challenging task toward advanced video understanding. Paving the way with high-quality video feature extraction and enhancing the precision of detector-predicted anchors can effectively improve model performance. To this end, we propose a high-performance dual-stream spatiotemporal feature extraction network SFMViT with an anchor pruning strategy. The backbone of our SFMViT is composed of ViT and SlowFast with prior knowledge of spatiotemporal action localization, which fully utilizes ViT's excellent global feature extraction capabilities and SlowFast's spatiotemporal sequence modeling capabilities. Secondly, we introduce the confidence maximum heap to prune the anchors detected in each frame of the picture to filter out the effective anchors. These designs enable our SFMViT to achieve a mAP of 26.62% in the Chaotic World dataset, far exceeding existing models. Code is available at https://github.com/jfightyr/SlowFast-Meet-ViT.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained large text-to-image (T2I) models with an appropriate text prompt has attracted growing interests in customized images generation field. However, catastrophic forgetting issue make it hard to continually synthesize new user-provided styles while retaining the satisfying results amongst learned styles. In this paper, we propose MuseumMaker, a method that enables the synthesis of images by following a set of customized styles in a never-end manner, and gradually accumulate these creative artistic works as a Museum. When facing with a new customization style, we develop a style distillation loss module to transfer the style of the whole dataset into generation of images. It can minimize the learning biases caused by content of images, and address the catastrophic overfitting issue induced by few-shot images. To deal with catastrophic forgetting amongst past learned styles, we devise a dual regularization for shared-LoRA module to optimize the direction of model update, which could regularize the diffusion model from both weight and feature aspects, respectively. Meanwhile, a unique token embedding corresponding to this new style is learned by a task-wise token learning module, which could preserve historical knowledge from past styles with the limitation of LoRA parameter quantity. As any new user-provided style come, our MuseumMaker can capture the nuances of the new styles while maintaining the details of learned styles. Experimental results on diverse style datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed MuseumMaker method, showcasing its robustness and versatility across various scenarios.

- **Summary**: This paper aims to explore the evolution of image denoising in a pedagological way. We briefly review classical methods such as Fourier analysis and wavelet bases, highlighting the challenges they faced until the emergence of neural networks, notably the U-Net, in the 2010s. The remarkable performance of these networks has been demonstrated in studies such as Kadkhodaie et al. (2024). They exhibit adaptability to various image types, including those with fixed regularity, facial images, and bedroom scenes, achieving optimal results and biased towards geometry-adaptive harmonic basis. The introduction of score diffusion has played a crucial role in image generation. In this context, denoising becomes essential as it facilitates the estimation of probability density scores. We discuss the prerequisites for genuine learning of probability densities, offering insights that extend from mathematical research to the implications of universal structures.

- **Summary**: Low-shot counters estimate the number of objects corresponding to a selected category, based on only few or no exemplars annotated in the image. The current state-of-the-art estimates the total counts as the sum over the object location density map, but does not provide individual object locations and sizes, which are crucial for many applications. This is addressed by detection-based counters, which, however fall behind in the total count accuracy. Furthermore, both approaches tend to overestimate the counts in the presence of other object classes due to many false positives. We propose DAVE, a low-shot counter based on a detect-and-verify paradigm, that avoids the aforementioned issues by first generating a high-recall detection set and then verifying the detections to identify and remove the outliers. This jointly increases the recall and precision, leading to accurate counts. DAVE outperforms the top density-based counters by ~20% in the total count MAE, it outperforms the most recent detection-based counter by ~20% in detection quality and sets a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot as well as text-prompt-based counting.

- **Summary**: Current state-of-the-art two-stage models on instance segmentation task suffer from several types of imbalances. In this paper, we address the Intersection over the Union (IoU) distribution imbalance of positive input Regions of Interest (RoIs) during the training of the second stage. Our Self-Balanced R-CNN (SBR-CNN), an evolved version of the Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC) model, brings brand new loop mechanisms of bounding box and mask refinements. With an improved Generic RoI Extraction (GRoIE), we also address the feature-level imbalance at the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) level, originated by a non-uniform integration between low- and high-level features from the backbone layers. In addition, the redesign of the architecture heads toward a fully convolutional approach with FCC further reduces the number of parameters and obtains more clues to the connection between the task to solve and the layers used. Moreover, our SBR-CNN model shows the same or even better improvements if adopted in conjunction with other state-of-the-art models. In fact, with a lightweight ResNet-50 as backbone, evaluated on COCO minival 2017 dataset, our model reaches 45.3% and 41.5% AP for object detection and instance segmentation, with 12 epochs and without extra tricks.

- **Summary**: Charts are important for presenting and explaining complex data relationships. Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various chart understanding tasks. However, the sheer size of these models in terms of parameters and computational requirements limits their use in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we present TinyChart, an efficient MLLM for chart understanding with only 3B parameters. TinyChart overcomes two key challenges in efficient chart understanding: (1) reduce the burden of learning numerical computations through a Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) learning strategy, which trains the model to generate Python programs for numerical calculations, and (2) reduce lengthy vision feature sequences produced by the vision transformer for high-resolution images through a Vision Token Merging module, which gradually merges most similar vision tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 3B TinyChart achieves SOTA performance on a variety of chart understanding benchmarks including ChartQA, Chart-to-Text, Chart-to-Table, OpenCQA, and ChartX. It outperforms several chart understanding MLLM with up to 13B parameters such as ChartLlama and ChartAst, and close-sourced general-purpose MLLM GPT-4V on ChartQA. It also demonstrates its superior efficiency with higher throughput during inference due to a smaller model scale and more efficient vision encoding.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal foundation models such as CLIP have showcased impressive zero-shot capabilities. However, their applicability in resource-constrained environments is limited due to their large number of parameters and high inference time. While existing approaches have scaled down the entire CLIP architecture, we focus on training smaller variants of the image encoder, which suffices for efficient zero-shot classification. The use of synthetic data has shown promise in distilling representations from larger teachers, resulting in strong few-shot and linear probe performance. However, we find that this approach surprisingly fails in true zero-shot settings when using contrastive losses. We identify the exploitation of spurious features as being responsible for poor generalization between synthetic and real data. However, by using the image feature-based L2 distillation loss, we mitigate these problems and train students that achieve zero-shot performance which on four domain-specific datasets is on-par with a ViT-B/32 teacher model trained on DataCompXL, while featuring up to 92% fewer parameters.

- **Summary**: While neural implicit representations have gained popularity in multi-view 3D reconstruction, previous work struggles to yield physically plausible results, thereby limiting their applications in physics-demanding domains like embodied AI and robotics. The lack of plausibility originates from both the absence of physics modeling in the existing pipeline and their inability to recover intricate geometrical structures. In this paper, we introduce PhyRecon, which stands as the first approach to harness both differentiable rendering and differentiable physics simulation to learn implicit surface representations. Our framework proposes a novel differentiable particle-based physical simulator seamlessly integrated with the neural implicit representation. At its core is an efficient transformation between SDF-based implicit representation and explicit surface points by our proposed algorithm, Surface Points Marching Cubes (SP-MC), enabling differentiable learning with both rendering and physical losses. Moreover, we model both rendering and physical uncertainty to identify and compensate for the inconsistent and inaccurate monocular geometric priors. The physical uncertainty additionally enables a physics-guided pixel sampling to enhance the learning of slender structures. By amalgamating these techniques, our model facilitates efficient joint modeling with appearance, geometry, and physics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhyRecon significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction quality. Our reconstruction results also yield superior physical stability, verified by Isaac Gym, with at least a 40% improvement across all datasets, opening broader avenues for future physics-based applications.

- **Summary**: Visual Instruction Tuning represents a novel learning paradigm involving the fine-tuning of pre-trained language models using task-specific instructions. This paradigm shows promising zero-shot results in various natural language processing tasks but is still unexplored in vision emotion understanding. In this work, we focus on enhancing the model's proficiency in understanding and adhering to instructions related to emotional contexts. Initially, we identify key visual clues critical to visual emotion recognition. Subsequently, we introduce a novel GPT-assisted pipeline for generating emotion visual instruction data, effectively addressing the scarcity of annotated instruction data in this domain. Expanding on the groundwork established by InstructBLIP, our proposed EmoVIT architecture incorporates emotion-specific instruction data, leveraging the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models to enhance performance. Through extensive experiments, our model showcases its proficiency in emotion classification, adeptness in affective reasoning, and competence in comprehending humor. The comparative analysis provides a robust benchmark for Emotion Visual Instruction Tuning in the era of LLMs, providing valuable insights and opening avenues for future exploration in this domain.

- **Summary**: Colorizing grayscale images offers an engaging visual experience. Existing automatic colorization methods often fail to generate satisfactory results due to incorrect semantic colors and unsaturated colors. In this work, we propose an automatic colorization pipeline to overcome these challenges. We leverage the extraordinary generative ability of the diffusion prior to synthesize color with plausible semantics. To overcome the artifacts introduced by the diffusion prior, we apply the luminance conditional guidance. Moreover, we adopt multimodal high-level semantic priors to help the model understand the image content and deliver saturated colors. Besides, a luminance-aware decoder is designed to restore details and enhance overall visual quality. The proposed pipeline synthesizes saturated colors while maintaining plausible semantics. Experiments indicate that our proposed method considers both diversity and fidelity, surpassing previous methods in terms of perceptual realism and gain most human preference.

- **Summary**: The NIR-to-RGB spectral domain translation is a formidable task due to the inherent spectral mapping ambiguities within NIR inputs and RGB outputs. Thus, existing methods fail to reconcile the tension between maintaining texture detail fidelity and achieving diverse color variations. In this paper, we propose a Multi-scale HSV Color Feature Embedding Network (MCFNet) that decomposes the mapping process into three sub-tasks, including NIR texture maintenance, coarse geometry reconstruction, and RGB color prediction. Thus, we propose three key modules for each corresponding sub-task: the Texture Preserving Block (TPB), the HSV Color Feature Embedding Module (HSV-CFEM), and the Geometry Reconstruction Module (GRM). These modules contribute to our MCFNet methodically tackling spectral translation through a series of escalating resolutions, progressively enriching images with color and texture fidelity in a scale-coherent fashion. The proposed MCFNet demonstrates substantial performance gains over the NIR image colorization task. Code is released at: https://github.com/AlexYangxx/MCFNet.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel multi-stage trans-dimensional architecture for multi-view cardiac image segmentation. Our method exploits the relationship between long-axis (2D) and short-axis (3D) magnetic resonance (MR) images to perform a sequential 3D-to-2D-to-3D segmentation, segmenting the long-axis and short-axis images. In the first stage, 3D segmentation is performed using the short-axis image, and the prediction is transformed to the long-axis view and used as a segmentation prior in the next stage. In the second step, the heart region is localized and cropped around the segmentation prior using a Heart Localization and Cropping (HLC) module, focusing the subsequent model on the heart region of the image, where a 2D segmentation is performed. Similarly, we transform the long-axis prediction to the short-axis view, localize and crop the heart region and again perform a 3D segmentation to refine the initial short-axis segmentation. We evaluate our proposed method on the Multi-Disease, Multi-View & Multi-Center Right Ventricular Segmentation in Cardiac MRI (M&Ms-2) dataset, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmenting cardiac regions of interest in both short-axis and long-axis images. The pre-trained models, source code, and implementation details will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models enable open-world classification of objects without the need for any retraining. While this zero-shot paradigm marks a significant advance, even today's best models exhibit skewed performance when objects are dissimilar from their typical depiction. Real world objects such as pears appear in a variety of forms -- from diced to whole, on a table or in a bowl -- yet standard VLM classifiers map all instances of a class to a \it{single vector based on the class label}. We argue that to represent this rich diversity within a class, zero-shot classification should move beyond a single vector. We propose a method to encode and account for diversity within a class using inferred attributes, still in the zero-shot setting without retraining. We find our method consistently outperforms standard zero-shot classification over a large suite of datasets encompassing hierarchies, diverse object states, and real-world geographic diversity, as well finer-grained datasets where intra-class diversity may be less prevalent. Importantly, our method is inherently interpretable, offering faithful explanations for each inference to facilitate model debugging and enhance transparency. We also find our method scales efficiently to a large number of attributes to account for diversity -- leading to more accurate predictions for atypical instances. Finally, we characterize a principled trade-off between overall and worst class accuracy, which can be tuned via a hyperparameter of our method. We hope this work spurs further research into the promise of zero-shot classification beyond a single class vector for capturing diversity in the world, and building transparent AI systems without compromising performance.

- **Summary**: Detection of malignant lesions on mammography images is extremely important for early breast cancer diagnosis. In clinical practice, images are acquired from two different angles, and radiologists can fully utilize information from both views, simultaneously locating the same lesion. However, for automatic detection approaches such information fusion remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a new model called MAMM-Net, which allows the processing of both mammography views simultaneously by sharing information not only on an object level, as seen in existing works, but also on a feature level. MAMM-Net's key component is the Fusion Layer, based on deformable attention and designed to increase detection precision while keeping high recall. Our experiments show superior performance on the public DDSM dataset compared to the previous state-of-the-art model, while introducing new helpful features such as lesion annotation on pixel-level and classification of lesions malignancy.

- **Summary**: Cancelable Biometric is a challenging research field in which security of an original biometric image is ensured by transforming the original biometric into another irreversible domain. Several approaches have been suggested in literature for generating cancelable biometric templates. In this paper, two novel and simple cancelable biometric template generation methods based on Random Walk (CBRW) have been proposed. By employing random walk and other steps given in the proposed two algorithms viz. CBRW-BitXOR and CBRW-BitCMP, the original biometric is transformed into a cancellable template. The performance of the proposed methods is compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Experiments have been performed on eight publicly available gray and color datasets i.e. CP (ear) (gray and color), UTIRIS (iris) (gray and color), ORL (face) (gray), IIT Delhi (iris) (gray and color), and AR (face) (color). Performance of the generated templates is measured in terms of Correlation Coefficient (Cr), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity (SSIM), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Number of Pixel Change Rate (NPCR), and Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI). By experimental results, it has been proved that proposed methods are superior than other state-of-the-art methods in qualitative as well as quantitative analysis. Furthermore, CBRW performs better on both gray as well as color images.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the task of 3D clothed human generation from textural descriptions. Previous works usually encode the human body and clothes as a holistic model and generate the whole model in a single-stage optimization, which makes them struggle for clothing editing and meanwhile lose fine-grained control over the whole generation process. To solve this, we propose a layer-wise clothed human representation combined with a progressive optimization strategy, which produces clothing-disentangled 3D human models while providing control capacity for the generation process. The basic idea is progressively generating a minimal-clothed human body and layer-wise clothes. During clothing generation, a novel stratified compositional rendering method is proposed to fuse multi-layer human models, and a new loss function is utilized to help decouple the clothing model from the human body. The proposed method achieves high-quality disentanglement, which thereby provides an effective way for 3D garment generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art 3D clothed human generation while also supporting cloth editing applications such as virtual try-on.

- **Summary**: We address the problem of regressing 3D human pose and shape from a single image, with a focus on 3D accuracy. The current best methods leverage large datasets of 3D pseudo-ground-truth (p-GT) and 2D keypoints, leading to robust performance. With such methods, we observe a paradoxical decline in 3D pose accuracy with increasing 2D accuracy. This is caused by biases in the p-GT and the use of an approximate camera projection model. We quantify the error induced by current camera models and show that fitting 2D keypoints and p-GT accurately causes incorrect 3D poses. Our analysis defines the invalid distances within which minimizing 2D and p-GT losses is detrimental. We use this to formulate a new loss Threshold-Adaptive Loss Scaling (TALS) that penalizes gross 2D and p-GT losses but not smaller ones. With such a loss, there are many 3D poses that could equally explain the 2D evidence. To reduce this ambiguity we need a prior over valid human poses but such priors can introduce unwanted bias. To address this, we exploit a tokenized representation of human pose and reformulate the problem as token prediction. This restricts the estimated poses to the space of valid poses, effectively providing a uniform prior. Extensive experiments on the EMDB and 3DPW datasets show that our reformulated keypoint loss and tokenization allows us to train on in-the-wild data while improving 3D accuracy over the state-of-the-art. Our models and code are available for research at https://tokenhmr.is.tue.mpg.de.

- **Summary**: Developing generalist foundation model has recently attracted tremendous attention among researchers in the field of AI for Medicine (AI4Medicine). A pivotal insight in developing these models is their reliance on dataset scaling, which emphasizes the requirements on developing open-source medical image datasets that incorporate diverse supervision signals across various imaging modalities. In this paper, we introduce RadGenome-Chest CT, a comprehensive, large-scale, region-guided 3D chest CT interpretation dataset based on CT-RATE. Specifically, we leverage the latest powerful universal segmentation and large language models, to extend the original datasets (over 25,692 non-contrast 3D chest CT volume and reports from 20,000 patients) from the following aspects: (i) organ-level segmentation masks covering 197 categories, which provide intermediate reasoning visual clues for interpretation; (ii) 665 K multi-granularity grounded reports, where each sentence of the report is linked to the corresponding anatomical region of CT volume in the form of a segmentation mask; (iii) 1.3 M grounded VQA pairs, where questions and answers are all linked with reference segmentation masks, enabling models to associate visual evidence with textual explanations. All grounded reports and VQA pairs in the validation set have gone through manual verification to ensure dataset quality. We believe that RadGenome-Chest CT can significantly advance the development of multimodal medical foundation models, by training to generate texts based on given segmentation regions, which is unattainable with previous relevant datasets. We will release all segmentation masks, grounded reports, and VQA pairs to facilitate further research and development in this field.

- **Summary**: While originally developed for continuous control problems, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has emerged as the work-horse of a variety of reinforcement learning (RL) applications including the fine-tuning of generative models. Unfortunately, PPO requires multiple heuristics to enable stable convergence (e.g. value networks, clipping) and is notorious for its sensitivity to the precise implementation of these components. In response, we take a step back and ask what a minimalist RL algorithm for the era of generative models would look like. We propose REBEL, an algorithm that cleanly reduces the problem of policy optimization to regressing the relative rewards via a direct policy parameterization between two completions to a prompt, enabling strikingly lightweight implementation. In theory, we prove that fundamental RL algorithms like Natural Policy Gradient can be seen as variants of REBEL, which allows us to match the strongest known theoretical guarantees in terms of convergence and sample complexity in the RL literature. REBEL can also cleanly incorporate offline data and handle the intransitive preferences we frequently see in practice. Empirically, we find that REBEL provides a unified approach to language modeling and image generation with stronger or similar performance as PPO and DPO, all while being simpler to implement and more computationally tractable than PPO.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based technologies have made significant strides, particularly in personalized and customized facialgeneration. However, existing methods face challenges in achieving high-fidelity and detailed identity (ID)consistency, primarily due to insufficient fine-grained control over facial areas and the lack of a comprehensive strategy for ID preservation by fully considering intricate facial details and the overall face. To address these limitations, we introduce ConsistentID, an innovative method crafted for diverseidentity-preserving portrait generation under fine-grained multimodal facial prompts, utilizing only a single reference image. ConsistentID comprises two key components: a multimodal facial prompt generator that combines facial features, corresponding facial descriptions and the overall facial context to enhance precision in facial details, and an ID-preservation network optimized through the facial attention localization strategy, aimed at preserving ID consistency in facial regions. Together, these components significantly enhance the accuracy of ID preservation by introducing fine-grained multimodal ID information from facial regions. To facilitate training of ConsistentID, we present a fine-grained portrait dataset, FGID, with over 500,000 facial images, offering greater diversity and comprehensiveness than existing public facial datasets. % such as LAION-Face, CelebA, FFHQ, and SFHQ. Experimental results substantiate that our ConsistentID achieves exceptional precision and diversity in personalized facial generation, surpassing existing methods in the MyStyle dataset. Furthermore, while ConsistentID introduces more multimodal ID information, it maintains a fast inference speed during generation.

In this regard, it has seen extensive use in image registration and, more recently, in the particular field of medical image registration. In this work, we propose to test and extend and improve a state-of-the-art framework for color fundus image registration, ConKeD. Using the ConKeD framework we test multiple loss functions, adapting them to the framework and the application domain. Furthermore, we evaluate our models using the standarized benchmark dataset FIRE as well as several datasets that have never been used before for color fundus registration, for which we are releasing the pairing data as well as a standardized evaluation approach. Our work demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across all datasets and metrics demonstrating several advantages over current SOTA color fundus registration methods

- **Summary**: In human neuroimaging studies, atlas registration enables mapping MRI scans to a common coordinate frame, which is necessary to aggregate data from multiple subjects. Machine learning registration methods have achieved excellent speed and accuracy but lack interpretability. More recently, keypoint-based methods have been proposed to tackle this issue, but their accuracy is still subpar, particularly when fitting nonlinear transforms. Here we propose Registration by Regression (RbR), a novel atlas registration framework that is highly robust and flexible, conceptually simple, and can be trained with cheaply obtained data. RbR predicts the (x,y,z) atlas coordinates for every voxel of the input scan (i.e., every voxel is a keypoint), and then uses closed-form expressions to quickly fit transforms using a wide array of possible deformation models, including affine and nonlinear (e.g., Bspline, Demons, invertible diffeomorphic models, etc.). Robustness is provided by the large number of voxels informing the registration and can be further increased by robust estimators like RANSAC. Experiments on independent public datasets show that RbR yields more accurate registration than competing keypoint approaches, while providing full control of the deformation model.

- **Summary**: Comprehending text-rich visual content is paramount for the practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), since text-rich scenarios are ubiquitous in the real world, which are characterized by the presence of extensive texts embedded within images. Recently, the advent of MLLMs with impressive versatility has raised the bar for what we can expect from MLLMs. However, their proficiency in text-rich scenarios has yet to be comprehensively and objectively assessed, since current MLLM benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating general visual comprehension. In this work, we introduce SEED-Bench-2-Plus, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating \textbf{text-rich visual comprehension} of MLLMs. Our benchmark comprises 2.3K multiple-choice questions with precise human annotations, spanning three broad categories: Charts, Maps, and Webs, each of which covers a wide spectrum of text-rich scenarios in the real world. These categories, due to their inherent complexity and diversity, effectively simulate real-world text-rich environments. We further conduct a thorough evaluation involving 34 prominent MLLMs (including GPT-4V, Gemini-Pro-Vision and Claude-3-Opus) and emphasize the current limitations of MLLMs in text-rich visual comprehension. We hope that our work can serve as a valuable addition to existing MLLM benchmarks, providing insightful observations and inspiring further research in the area of text-rich visual comprehension with MLLMs. The dataset and evaluation code can be accessed at https://github.com/AILab-CVC/SEED-Bench.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in large pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on zero-shot downstream tasks. Building upon this, recent studies, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, have proposed the use of prompt learning, where context within a prompt is replaced with learnable vectors, leading to significant improvements over manually crafted prompts. However, the performance improvement for unseen classes is still marginal, and to tackle this problem, data augmentation has been frequently used in traditional zero-shot learning techniques. Through our experiments, we have identified important issues in CoOp and CoCoOp: the context learned through traditional image augmentation is biased toward seen classes, negatively impacting generalization to unseen classes. To address this problem, we propose adversarial token embedding to disentangle low-level visual augmentation features from high-level class information when inducing bias in learnable prompts. Through our novel mechanism called "Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning", AAPL, we guide the learnable context to effectively extract text features by focusing on high-level features for unseen classes. We have conducted experiments across 11 datasets, and overall, AAPL shows favorable performances compared to the existing methods in few-shot learning, zero-shot learning, cross-dataset, and domain generalization tasks.

- **Summary**: Addressing the challenges of rare diseases is difficult, especially with the limited number of reference images and a small patient population. This is more evident in rare skin diseases, where we encounter long-tailed data distributions that make it difficult to develop unbiased and broadly effective models. The diverse ways in which image datasets are gathered and their distinct purposes also add to these challenges. Our study conducts a detailed examination of the benefits and drawbacks of episodic and conventional training methodologies, adopting a few-shot learning approach alongside transfer learning. We evaluated our models using the ISIC2018, Derm7pt, and SD-198 datasets. With minimal labeled examples, our models showed substantial information gains and better performance compared to previously trained models. Our research emphasizes the improved ability to represent features in DenseNet121 and MobileNetV2 models, achieved by using pre-trained models on ImageNet to increase similarities within classes. Moreover, our experiments, ranging from 2-way to 5-way classifications with up to 10 examples, showed a growing success rate for traditional transfer learning methods as the number of examples increased. The addition of data augmentation techniques significantly improved our transfer learning based model performance, leading to higher performances than existing methods, especially in the SD-198 and ISIC2018 datasets.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised semantic segmentation aims to automatically partition images into semantically meaningful regions by identifying global categories within an image corpus without any form of annotation. Building upon recent advances in self-supervised representation learning, we focus on how to leverage these large pre-trained models for the downstream task of unsupervised segmentation. We present PriMaPs - Principal Mask Proposals - decomposing images into semantically meaningful masks based on their feature representation. This allows us to realize unsupervised semantic segmentation by fitting class prototypes to PriMaPs with a stochastic expectation-maximization algorithm, PriMaPs-EM. Despite its conceptual simplicity, PriMaPs-EM leads to competitive results across various pre-trained backbone models, including DINO and DINOv2, and across datasets, such as Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff, and Potsdam-3. Importantly, PriMaPs-EM is able to boost results when applied orthogonally to current state-of-the-art unsupervised semantic segmentation pipelines.

- **Summary**: While text-to-image (T2I) generative models have become ubiquitous, they do not necessarily generate images that align with a given prompt. While previous work has evaluated T2I alignment by proposing metrics, benchmarks, and templates for collecting human judgements, the quality of these components is not systematically measured. Human-rated prompt sets are generally small and the reliability of the ratings -- and thereby the prompt set used to compare models -- is not evaluated. We address this gap by performing an extensive study evaluating auto-eval metrics and human templates. We provide three main contributions: (1) We introduce a comprehensive skills-based benchmark that can discriminate models across different human templates. This skills-based benchmark categorises prompts into sub-skills, allowing a practitioner to pinpoint not only which skills are challenging, but at what level of complexity a skill becomes challenging. (2) We gather human ratings across four templates and four T2I models for a total of >100K annotations. This allows us to understand where differences arise due to inherent ambiguity in the prompt and where they arise due to differences in metric and model quality. (3) Finally, we introduce a new QA-based auto-eval metric that is better correlated with human ratings than existing metrics for our new dataset, across different human templates, and on TIFA160.

- **Summary**: In this report, we introduce InternVL 1.5, an open-source multimodal large language model (MLLM) to bridge the capability gap between open-source and proprietary commercial models in multimodal understanding. We introduce three simple improvements: (1) Strong Vision Encoder: we explored a continuous learning strategy for the large-scale vision foundation model -- InternViT-6B, boosting its visual understanding capabilities, and making it can be transferred and reused in different LLMs. (2) Dynamic High-Resolution: we divide images into tiles ranging from 1 to 40 of 448$\times$448 pixels according to the aspect ratio and resolution of the input images, which supports up to 4K resolution input. (3) High-Quality Bilingual Dataset: we carefully collected a high-quality bilingual dataset that covers common scenes, document images, and annotated them with English and Chinese question-answer pairs, significantly enhancing performance in OCR- and Chinese-related tasks. We evaluate InternVL 1.5 through a series of benchmarks and comparative studies. Compared to both open-source and proprietary models, InternVL 1.5 shows competitive performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in 8 of 18 benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Aiming to replicate human-like dexterity, perceptual experiences, and motion patterns, we explore learning from human demonstrations using a bimanual system with multifingered hands and visuotactile data. Two significant challenges exist: the lack of an affordable and accessible teleoperation system suitable for a dual-arm setup with multifingered hands, and the scarcity of multifingered hand hardware equipped with touch sensing. To tackle the first challenge, we develop HATO, a low-cost hands-arms teleoperation system that leverages off-the-shelf electronics, complemented with a software suite that enables efficient data collection; the comprehensive software suite also supports multimodal data processing, scalable policy learning, and smooth policy deployment. To tackle the latter challenge, we introduce a novel hardware adaptation by repurposing two prosthetic hands equipped with touch sensors for research. Using visuotactile data collected from our system, we learn skills to complete long-horizon, high-precision tasks which are difficult to achieve without multifingered dexterity and touch feedback. Furthermore, we empirically investigate the effects of dataset size, sensing modality, and visual input preprocessing on policy learning. Our results mark a promising step forward in bimanual multifingered manipulation from visuotactile data. Videos, code, and datasets can be found at https://toruowo.github.io/hato/ .

- **Summary**: AI-generated video has revolutionized short video production, filmmaking, and personalized media, making video local editing an essential tool. However, this progress also blurs the line between reality and fiction, posing challenges in multimedia forensics. To solve this urgent issue, V2A-Mark is proposed to address the limitations of current video tampering forensics, such as poor generalizability, singular function, and single modality focus. Combining the fragility of video-into-video steganography with deep robust watermarking, our method can embed invisible visual-audio localization watermarks and copyright watermarks into the original video frames and audio, enabling precise manipulation localization and copyright protection. We also design a temporal alignment and fusion module and degradation prompt learning to enhance the localization accuracy and decoding robustness. Meanwhile, we introduce a sample-level audio localization method and a cross-modal copyright extraction mechanism to couple the information of audio and video frames. The effectiveness of V2A-Mark has been verified on a visual-audio tampering dataset, emphasizing its superiority in localization precision and copyright accuracy, crucial for the sustainable development of video editing in the AIGC video era.

- **Summary**: With the advent of virtual reality technology, omnidirectional image (ODI) rescaling techniques are increasingly embraced for reducing transmitted and stored file sizes while preserving high image quality. Despite this progress, current ODI rescaling methods predominantly focus on enhancing the quality of images in equirectangular projection (ERP) format, which overlooks the fact that the content viewed on head mounted displays (HMDs) is actually a rendered viewport instead of an ERP image. In this work, we emphasize that focusing solely on ERP quality results in inferior viewport visual experiences for users. Thus, we propose ResVR, which is the first comprehensive framework for the joint Rescaling and Viewport Rendering of ODIs. ResVR allows obtaining LR ERP images for transmission while rendering high-quality viewports for users to watch on HMDs. In our ResVR, a novel discrete pixel sampling strategy is developed to tackle the complex mapping between the viewport and ERP, enabling end-to-end training of ResVR pipeline. Furthermore, a spherical pixel shape representation technique is innovatively derived from spherical differentiation to significantly improve the visual quality of rendered viewports. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ResVR outperforms existing methods in viewport rendering tasks across different fields of view, resolutions, and view directions while keeping a low transmission overhead.

- **Summary**: Our objective is to discover and localize monotonic temporal changes in a sequence of images. To achieve this, we exploit a simple proxy task of ordering a shuffled image sequence, with `time' serving as a supervisory signal since only changes that are monotonic with time can give rise to the correct ordering. We also introduce a flexible transformer-based model for general-purpose ordering of image sequences of arbitrary length with built-in attribution maps. After training, the model successfully discovers and localizes monotonic changes while ignoring cyclic and stochastic ones. We demonstrate applications of the model in multiple video settings covering different scene and object types, discovering both object-level and environmental changes in unseen sequences. We also demonstrate that the attention-based attribution maps function as effective prompts for segmenting the changing regions, and that the learned representations can be used for downstream applications. Finally, we show that the model achieves the state of the art on standard benchmarks for ordering a set of images.

- **Summary**: Physically realistic materials are pivotal in augmenting the realism of 3D assets across various applications and lighting conditions. However, existing 3D assets and generative models often lack authentic material properties. Manual assignment of materials using graphic software is a tedious and time-consuming task. In this paper, we exploit advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly GPT-4V, to present a novel approach, Make-it-Real: 1) We demonstrate that GPT-4V can effectively recognize and describe materials, allowing the construction of a detailed material library. 2) Utilizing a combination of visual cues and hierarchical text prompts, GPT-4V precisely identifies and aligns materials with the corresponding components of 3D objects. 3) The correctly matched materials are then meticulously applied as reference for the new SVBRDF material generation according to the original diffuse map, significantly enhancing their visual authenticity. Make-it-Real offers a streamlined integration into the 3D content creation workflow, showcasing its utility as an essential tool for developers of 3D assets.
