- **Summary**: The Vision Transformer (ViT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for 3D medical image analysis. Mask AutoEncoder (MAE) for feature pre-training can further unleash the potential of ViT on various medical vision tasks. However, due to large spatial sizes with much higher dimensions of 3D medical images, the lack of hierarchical design for MAE may hinder the performance of downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel \textit{Mask in Mask (MiM)} pre-training framework for 3D medical images, which aims to advance MAE by learning discriminative representation from hierarchical visual tokens across varying scales. We introduce multiple levels of granularity for masked inputs from the volume, which are then reconstructed simultaneously ranging at both fine and coarse levels. Additionally, a cross-level alignment mechanism is applied to adjacent level volumes to enforce anatomical similarity hierarchically. Furthermore, we adopt a hybrid backbone to enhance the hierarchical representation learning efficiently during the pre-training. MiM was pre-trained on a large scale of available 3D volumetric images, \textit{i.e.,} Computed Tomography (CT) images containing various body parts. Extensive experiments on thirteen public datasets demonstrate the superiority of MiM over other SSL methods in organ/lesion/tumor segmentation and disease classification. We further scale up the MiM to large pre-training datasets with more than 10k volumes, showing that large-scale pre-training can further enhance the performance of downstream tasks. The improvement also concluded that the research community should pay more attention to the scale of the pre-training dataset towards the healthcare foundation model for 3D medical images.

- **Summary**: In Learned Image Compression (LIC), a model is trained at encoding and decoding images sampled from a source domain, often outperforming traditional codecs on natural images; yet its performance may be far from optimal on images sampled from different domains. In this work, we tackle the problem of adapting a pre-trained model to multiple target domains by plugging into the decoder an adapter module for each of them, including the source one. Each adapter improves the decoder performance on a specific domain, without the model forgetting about the images seen at training time. A gate network computes the weights to optimally blend the contributions from the adapters when the bitstream is decoded. We experimentally validate our method over two state-of-the-art pre-trained models, observing improved rate-distortion efficiency on the target domains without penalties on the source domain. Furthermore, the gate's ability to find similarities with the learned target domains enables better encoding efficiency also for images outside them.

- **Summary**: Existing datasets for attribute value extraction (AVE) predominantly focus on explicit attribute values while neglecting the implicit ones, lack product images, are often not publicly available, and lack an in-depth human inspection across diverse domains. To address these limitations, we present ImplicitAVE, the first, publicly available multimodal dataset for implicit attribute value extraction. ImplicitAVE, sourced from the MAVE dataset, is carefully curated and expanded to include implicit AVE and multimodality, resulting in a refined dataset of 68k training and 1.6k testing data across five domains. We also explore the application of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to implicit AVE, establishing a comprehensive benchmark for MLLMs on the ImplicitAVE dataset. Six recent MLLMs with eleven variants are evaluated across diverse settings, revealing that implicit value extraction remains a challenging task for MLLMs. The contributions of this work include the development and release of ImplicitAVE, and the exploration and benchmarking of various MLLMs for implicit AVE, providing valuable insights and potential future research directions.

- **Summary**: Our study provides evidence that CNNs struggle to effectively extract orientation features. We show that the use of Complex Structure Tensor, which contains compact orientation features with certainties, as input to CNNs consistently improves identification accuracy compared to using grayscale inputs alone. Experiments also demonstrated that our inputs, which were provided by mini complex conv-nets, combined with reduced CNN sizes, outperformed full-fledged, prevailing CNN architectures. This suggests that the upfront use of orientation features in CNNs, a strategy seen in mammalian vision, not only mitigates their limitations but also enhances their explainability and relevance to thin-clients. Experiments were done on publicly available data sets comprising periocular images for biometric identification and verification (Close and Open World) using 6 State of the Art CNN architectures. We reduced SOA Equal Error Rate (EER) on the PolyU dataset by 5-26% depending on data and scenario.

- **Summary**: Addressing pedestrian safety at intersections is one of the paramount concerns in the field of transportation research, driven by the urgency of reducing traffic-related injuries and fatalities. With advances in computer vision technologies and predictive models, the pursuit of developing real-time proactive protection systems is increasingly recognized as vital to improving pedestrian safety at intersections. The core of these protection systems lies in the prediction-based evaluation of pedestrian's potential risks, which plays a significant role in preventing the occurrence of accidents. The major challenges in the current prediction-based potential risk evaluation research can be summarized into three aspects: the inadequate progress in creating a real-time framework for the evaluation of pedestrian's potential risks, the absence of accurate and explainable safety indicators that can represent the potential risk, and the lack of tailor-made evaluation criteria specifically for each category of pedestrians. To address these research challenges, in this study, a framework with computer vision technologies and predictive models is developed to evaluate the potential risk of pedestrians in real time. Integral to this framework is a novel surrogate safety measure, the Predicted Post-Encroachment Time (P-PET), derived from deep learning models capable to predict the arrival time of pedestrians and vehicles at intersections. To further improve the effectiveness and reliability of pedestrian risk evaluation, we classify pedestrians into distinct categories and apply specific evaluation criteria for each group. The results demonstrate the framework's ability to effectively identify potential risks through the use of P-PET, indicating its feasibility for real-time applications and its improved performance in risk evaluation across different categories of pedestrians.

- **Summary**: Hazy images degrade visual quality, and dehazing is a crucial prerequisite for subsequent processing tasks. Most current dehazing methods rely on neural networks and face challenges such as high computational parameter pressure and weak generalization capabilities. This paper introduces PriorNet--a novel, lightweight, and highly applicable dehazing network designed to significantly improve the clarity and visual quality of hazy images while avoiding excessive detail extraction issues. The core of PriorNet is the original Multi-Dimensional Interactive Attention (MIA) mechanism, which effectively captures a wide range of haze characteristics, substantially reducing the computational load and generalization difficulties associated with complex systems. By utilizing a uniform convolutional kernel size and incorporating skip connections, we have streamlined the feature extraction process. Simplifying the number of layers and architecture not only enhances dehazing efficiency but also facilitates easier deployment on edge devices. Extensive testing across multiple datasets has demonstrated PriorNet's exceptional performance in dehazing and clarity restoration, maintaining image detail and color fidelity in single-image dehazing tasks. Notably, with a model size of just 18Kb, PriorNet showcases superior dehazing generalization capabilities compared to other methods. Our research makes a significant contribution to advancing image dehazing technology, providing new perspectives and tools for the field and related domains, particularly emphasizing the importance of improving universality and deployability.

- **Summary**: With the rapid advancement of 3D sensing technologies, obtaining 3D shape information of objects has become increasingly convenient. Lidar technology, with its capability to accurately capture the 3D information of objects at long distances, has been widely applied in the collection of 3D data in urban scenes. However, the collected point cloud data often exhibit incompleteness due to factors such as occlusion, signal absorption, and specular reflection. This paper explores the application of point cloud completion technologies in processing these incomplete data and establishes a new real-world benchmark Building-PCC dataset, to evaluate the performance of existing deep learning methods in the task of urban building point cloud completion. Through a comprehensive evaluation of different methods, we analyze the key challenges faced in building point cloud completion, aiming to promote innovation in the field of 3D geoinformation applications.

- **Summary**: Contrastive learning has emerged as a transformative method for learning effective visual representations through the alignment of image and text embeddings. However, pairwise similarity computation in contrastive loss between image and text pairs poses computational challenges. This paper presents a novel weakly supervised pre-training of vision models on web-scale image-text data. The proposed method reframes pre-training on image-text data as a classification task. Consequently, it eliminates the need for pairwise similarity computations in contrastive loss, achieving a remarkable $2.7\times$ acceleration in training speed compared to contrastive learning on web-scale data. Through extensive experiments spanning diverse vision tasks, including detection and segmentation, we demonstrate that the proposed method maintains high representation quality. Our source code along with pre-trained model weights and training recipes is available at \url{https://github.com/apple/corenet}.

- **Summary**: Multiple clustering has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to reveal multiple hidden structures of data from different perspectives. The advent of deep multiple clustering techniques has notably advanced the performance by uncovering complex patterns and relationships within large datasets. However, a major challenge arises as users often do not need all the clusterings that algorithms generate, and figuring out the one needed requires a substantial understanding of each clustering result. Traditionally, aligning a user's brief keyword of interest with the corresponding vision components was challenging, but the emergence of multi-modal and large language models (LLMs) has begun to bridge this gap. In response, given unlabeled target visual data, we propose Multi-MaP, a novel method employing a multi-modal proxy learning process. It leverages CLIP encoders to extract coherent text and image embeddings, with GPT-4 integrating users' interests to formulate effective textual contexts. Moreover, reference word constraint and concept-level constraint are designed to learn the optimal text proxy according to the user's interest. Multi-MaP not only adeptly captures a user's interest via a keyword but also facilitates identifying relevant clusterings. Our extensive experiments show that Multi-MaP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all benchmark multi-clustering vision tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/Alexander-Yao/Multi-MaP.

- **Summary**: In mesh simplification, common requirements like accuracy, triangle quality, and feature alignment are often considered as a trade-off. Existing algorithms concentrate on just one or a few specific aspects of these requirements. For example, the well-known Quadric Error Metrics (QEM) approach prioritizes accuracy and can preserve strong feature lines/points as well but falls short in ensuring high triangle quality and may degrade weak features that are not as distinctive as strong ones. In this paper, we propose a smooth functional that simultaneously considers all of these requirements. The functional comprises a normal anisotropy term and a Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT) energy term, with the variables being a set of movable points lying on the surface. The former inherits the spirit of QEM but operates in a continuous setting, while the latter encourages even point distribution, allowing various surface metrics. We further introduce a decaying weight to automatically balance the two terms. We selected 100 CAD models from the ABC dataset, along with 21 organic models, to compare the existing mesh simplification algorithms with ours. Experimental results reveal an important observation: the introduction of a decaying weight effectively reduces the conflict between the two terms and enables the alignment of weak features. This distinctive feature sets our approach apart from most existing mesh simplification methods and demonstrates significant potential in shape understanding.



### Representing Part-Whole Hierarchies in Foundation Models by Learning Localizability, Composability, and Decomposability from Anatomy via Self-Supervision

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Humans effortlessly interpret images by parsing them into part-whole hierarchies; deep learning excels in learning multi-level feature spaces, but they often lack explicit coding of part-whole relations, a prominent property of medical imaging. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Adam-v2, a new self-supervised learning framework extending Adam [79] by explicitly incorporating part-whole hierarchies into its learning objectives through three key branches: (1) Localizability, acquiring discriminative representations to distinguish different anatomical patterns; (2) Composability, learning each anatomical structure in a parts-to-whole manner; and (3) Decomposability, comprehending each anatomical structure in a whole-to-parts manner. Experimental results across 10 tasks, compared to 11 baselines in zero-shot, few-shot transfer, and full fine-tuning settings, showcase Adam-v2's superior performance over large-scale medical models and existing SSL methods across diverse downstream tasks. The higher generality and robustness of Adam-v2's representations originate from its explicit construction of hierarchies for distinct anatomical structures from unlabeled medical images. Adam-v2 preserves a semantic balance of anatomical diversity and harmony in its embedding, yielding representations that are both generic and semantically meaningful, yet overlooked in existing SSL methods. All code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/JLiangLab/Eden.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in text-to-image models have opened new frontiers in human-centric generation. However, these models cannot be directly employed to generate images with consistent newly coined identities. In this work, we propose CharacterFactory, a framework that allows sampling new characters with consistent identities in the latent space of GANs for diffusion models. More specifically, we consider the word embeddings of celeb names as ground truths for the identity-consistent generation task and train a GAN model to learn the mapping from a latent space to the celeb embedding space. In addition, we design a context-consistent loss to ensure that the generated identity embeddings can produce identity-consistent images in various contexts. Remarkably, the whole model only takes 10 minutes for training, and can sample infinite characters end-to-end during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate excellent performance of the proposed CharacterFactory on character creation in terms of identity consistency and editability. Furthermore, the generated characters can be seamlessly combined with the off-the-shelf image/video/3D diffusion models. We believe that the proposed CharacterFactory is an important step for identity-consistent character generation. Project page is available at: https://qinghew.github.io/CharacterFactory/.

- **Summary**: Weakly-supervised diffusion models (DM) in anomaly segmentation, leveraging image-level labels, have attracted significant attention for their superior performance compared to unsupervised methods. It eliminates the need for pixel-level labels in training, offering a more cost-effective alternative to supervised methods. However, existing methods are not fully weakly-supervised because they heavily rely on costly pixel-level labels for hyperparameter tuning in inference. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Anomaly Segmentation with Forward Process of Diffusion Models (AnoFPDM), a fully weakly-supervised framework that operates without the need for pixel-level labels. Leveraging the unguided forward process as a reference, we identify suitable hyperparameters, i.e., noise scale and threshold, for each input image. We aggregate anomaly maps from each step in the forward process, enhancing the signal strength of anomalous regions. Remarkably, our proposed method outperforms recent state-of-the-art weakly-supervised approaches, even without utilizing pixel-level labels.

- **Summary**: Deepfakes, synthetic images generated by deep learning algorithms, represent one of the biggest challenges in the field of Digital Forensics. The scientific community is working to develop approaches that can discriminate the origin of digital images (real or AI-generated). However, these methodologies face the challenge of generalization, that is, the ability to discern the nature of an image even if it is generated by an architecture not seen during training. This usually leads to a drop in performance. In this context, we propose a novel approach based on three blocks called Base Models, each of which is responsible for extracting the discriminative features of a specific image class (Diffusion Model-generated, GAN-generated, or real) as it is trained by exploiting deliberately unbalanced datasets. The features extracted from each block are then concatenated and processed to discriminate the origin of the input image. Experimental results showed that this approach not only demonstrates good robust capabilities to JPEG compression but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods in several generalization tests. Code, models and dataset are available at https://github.com/opontorno/block-based_deepfake-detection.

- **Summary**: Recently, Segment Anything Model (SAM) shows exceptional performance in generating high-quality object masks and achieving zero-shot image segmentation. However, as a versatile vision model, SAM is primarily trained with large-scale natural light images. In underwater scenes, it exhibits substantial performance degradation due to the light scattering and absorption. Meanwhile, the simplicity of the SAM's decoder might lead to the loss of fine-grained object details. To address the above issues, we propose a novel feature learning framework named MAS-SAM for marine animal segmentation, which involves integrating effective adapters into the SAM's encoder and constructing a pyramidal decoder. More specifically, we first build a new SAM's encoder with effective adapters for underwater scenes. Then, we introduce a Hypermap Extraction Module (HEM) to generate multi-scale features for a comprehensive guidance. Finally, we propose a Progressive Prediction Decoder (PPD) to aggregate the multi-scale features and predict the final segmentation results. When grafting with the Fusion Attention Module (FAM), our method enables to extract richer marine information from global contextual cues to fine-grained local details. Extensive experiments on four public MAS datasets demonstrate that our MAS-SAM can obtain better results than other typical segmentation methods.

- **Summary**: Existing NeRF-based inverse rendering methods suppose that scenes are exclusively illuminated by distant light sources, neglecting the potential influence of emissive sources within a scene. In this work, we confront this limitation using LDR multi-view images captured with emissive sources turned on and off. Two key issues must be addressed: 1) ambiguity arising from the limited dynamic range along with unknown lighting details, and 2) the expensive computational cost in volume rendering to backtrace the paths leading to final object colors. We present a novel approach, ESR-NeRF, leveraging neural networks as learnable functions to represent ray-traced fields. By training networks to satisfy light transport segments, we regulate outgoing radiances, progressively identifying emissive sources while being aware of reflection areas. The results on scenes encompassing emissive sources with various properties demonstrate the superiority of ESR-NeRF in qualitative and quantitative ways. Our approach also extends its applicability to the scenes devoid of emissive sources, achieving lower CD metrics on the DTU dataset.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In this work, we aim to learn a unified vision-based policy for a multi-fingered robot hand to manipulate different objects in diverse poses. Though prior work has demonstrated that human videos can benefit policy learning, performance improvement has been limited by physically implausible trajectories extracted from videos. Moreover, reliance on privileged object information such as ground-truth object states further limits the applicability in realistic scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework ViViDex to improve vision-based policy learning from human videos. It first uses reinforcement learning with trajectory guided rewards to train state-based policies for each video, obtaining both visually natural and physically plausible trajectories from the video. We then rollout successful episodes from state-based policies and train a unified visual policy without using any privileged information. A coordinate transformation method is proposed to significantly boost the performance. We evaluate our method on three dexterous manipulation tasks and demonstrate a large improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms.

- **Summary**: Facial expression recognition (FER) plays a significant role in our daily life. However, annotation ambiguity in the datasets could greatly hinder the performance. In this paper, we address FER task via label distribution learning paradigm, and develop a dual-branch Adaptive Distribution Fusion (Ada-DF) framework. One auxiliary branch is constructed to obtain the label distributions of samples. The class distributions of emotions are then computed through the label distributions of each emotion. Finally, those two distributions are adaptively fused according to the attention weights to train the target branch. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets, RAF-DB, AffectNet and SFEW, where our Ada-DF shows advantages over the state-of-the-art works.

- **Summary**: Despite considerable strides in developing deep learning models for 3D medical image segmentation, the challenge of effectively generalizing across diverse image distributions persists. While domain generalization is acknowledged as vital for robust application in clinical settings, the challenges stemming from training with a limited Field of View (FOV) remain unaddressed. This limitation leads to false predictions when applied to body regions beyond the FOV of the training data. In response to this problem, we propose a novel loss function that penalizes predictions in implausible body regions, applicable in both single-dataset and multi-dataset training schemes. It is realized with a Body Part Regression model that generates axial slice positional scores. Through comprehensive evaluation using a test set featuring varying FOVs, our approach demonstrates remarkable improvements in generalization capabilities. It effectively mitigates false positive tumor predictions up to 85% and significantly enhances overall segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: Skeleton-based action recognition has gained considerable traction thanks to its utilization of succinct and robust skeletal representations. Nonetheless, current methodologies often lean towards utilizing a solitary backbone to model skeleton modality, which can be limited by inherent flaws in the network backbone. To address this and fully leverage the complementary characteristics of various network architectures, we propose a novel Hybrid Dual-Branch Network (HDBN) for robust skeleton-based action recognition, which benefits from the graph convolutional network's proficiency in handling graph-structured data and the powerful modeling capabilities of Transformers for global information. In detail, our proposed HDBN is divided into two trunk branches: MixGCN and MixFormer. The two branches utilize GCNs and Transformers to model both 2D and 3D skeletal modalities respectively. Our proposed HDBN emerged as one of the top solutions in the Multi-Modal Video Reasoning and Analyzing Competition (MMVRAC) of 2024 ICME Grand Challenge, achieving accuracies of 47.95% and 75.36% on two benchmarks of the UAV-Human dataset by outperforming most existing methods. Our code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/liujf69/ICMEW2024-Track10.

- **Summary**: Selective attention helps us focus on task-relevant aspects in the constant flood of our sensory input. This constraint in our perception allows us to robustly generalize under distractions and to new compositions of perceivable concepts. Transformers employ a similar notion of attention in their architecture, but representation learning models with transformer backbones like CLIP and DINO often fail to demonstrate robustness and compositionality. We highlight a missing architectural prior: unlike human perception, transformer encodings do not separately attend over individual concepts. In response, we propose SPARO, a read-out mechanism that partitions encodings into separately-attended slots, each produced by a single attention head. Using SPARO with CLIP imparts an inductive bias that the vision and text modalities are different views of a shared compositional world with the same corresponding concepts. Using SPARO, we demonstrate improvements on downstream recognition, robustness, retrieval, and compositionality benchmarks with CLIP (up to +14% for ImageNet, +4% for SugarCrepe), and on nearest neighbors and linear probe for ImageNet with DINO (+3% each). We also showcase a powerful ability to intervene and select individual SPARO concepts to further improve downstream task performance (up from +4% to +9% for SugarCrepe) and use this ability to study the robustness of SPARO's representation structure. Finally, we provide insights through ablation experiments and visualization of learned concepts.

- **Summary**: Accurate prediction of metro traffic is crucial for optimizing metro scheduling and enhancing overall transport efficiency. Analyzing fine-grained and comprehensive relations among stations effectively is imperative for metro Origin-Destination (OD) prediction. However, existing metro OD models either mix information from multiple OD pairs from the station's perspective or exclusively focus on a subset of OD pairs. These approaches may overlook fine-grained relations among OD pairs, leading to difficulties in predicting potential anomalous conditions. To address these challenges, we analyze traffic variations from the perspective of all OD pairs and propose a fine-grained spatial-temporal MLP architecture for metro OD prediction, namely ODMixer. Specifically, our ODMixer has double-branch structure and involves the Channel Mixer, the Multi-view Mixer, and the Bidirectional Trend Learner. The Channel Mixer aims to capture short-term temporal relations among OD pairs, the Multi-view Mixer concentrates on capturing relations from both origin and destination perspectives. To model long-term temporal relations, we introduce the Bidirectional Trend Learner. Extensive experiments on two large-scale metro OD prediction datasets HZMOD and SHMO demonstrate the advantages of our ODMixer. The code will be available.

- **Summary**: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks, exhibiting the capacity to swiftly acquire new skills, such as through In-Context Learning (ICL) with minimal demonstration examples. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for investigating Multimodal ICL (M-ICL) in the context of Large Multimodal Models. We consider the best open-source multimodal models (e.g., IDEFICS, OpenFlamingo) and a wide range of multimodal tasks. Our study unveils several noteworthy findings: (1) M-ICL primarily relies on text-driven mechanisms, showing little to no influence from the image modality. (2) When used with advanced-ICL strategy (like RICES), M-ICL is not better than a simple strategy based on majority voting over context examples. Moreover, we identify several biases and limitations of M-ICL that warrant consideration prior to deployment. Code available at https://gitlab.com/folbaeni/multimodal-icl

- **Summary**: This paper handles the problem of converting real pictures into traditional Chinese ink-wash paintings, i.e., Chinese ink-wash painting style transfer. Though this problem could be realized by a wide range of image-to-image translation models, a notable issue with all these methods is that the original image content details could be easily erased or corrupted due to transfer of ink-wash style elements. To solve or ameliorate this issue, we propose to incorporate saliency detection into the unpaired image-to-image translation framework to regularize content information of the generated paintings. The saliency map is utilized for content regularization from two aspects, both explicitly and implicitly: (\romannumeral1) we propose saliency IOU (SIOU) loss to explicitly regularize saliency consistency before and after stylization; (\romannumeral2) we propose saliency adaptive normalization (SANorm) which implicitly enhances content integrity of the generated paintings by injecting saliency information to the generator network to guide painting generation. Besides, we also propose saliency attended discriminator network which harnesses saliency mask to focus generative adversarial attention onto salient image regions, it contributes to producing finer ink-wash stylization effect for salient objects of images. Qualitative and quantitative experiments consistently demonstrate superiority of our model over related advanced methods for Chinese ink-wash painting style transfer.

- **Summary**: Face Recognition Systems (FRS) are widely used in commercial environments, such as e-commerce and e-banking, owing to their high accuracy in real-world conditions. However, these systems are vulnerable to facial morphing attacks, which are generated by blending face color images of different subjects. This paper presents a new method for generating 3D face morphs from two bona fide point clouds. The proposed method first selects bona fide point clouds with neutral expressions. The two input point clouds were then registered using a Bayesian Coherent Point Drift (BCPD) without optimization, and the geometry and color of the registered point clouds were averaged to generate a face morphing point cloud. The proposed method generates 388 face-morphing point clouds from 200 bona fide subjects. The effectiveness of the method was demonstrated through extensive vulnerability experiments, achieving a Generalized Morphing Attack Potential (G-MAP) of 97.93%, which is superior to the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) with a G-MAP of 81.61%.

- **Summary**: Report generation models offer fine-grained textual interpretations of medical images like chest X-rays, yet they often lack interactivity (i.e. the ability to steer the generation process through user queries) and localized interpretability (i.e. visually grounding their predictions), which we deem essential for future adoption in clinical practice. While there have been efforts to tackle these issues, they are either limited in their interactivity by not supporting textual queries or fail to also offer localized interpretability. Therefore, we propose a novel multitask architecture and training paradigm integrating textual prompts and bounding boxes for diverse aspects like anatomical regions and pathologies. We call this approach the Chest X-Ray Explainer (ChEX). Evaluations across a heterogeneous set of 9 chest X-ray tasks, including localized image interpretation and report generation, showcase its competitiveness with SOTA models while additional analysis demonstrates ChEX's interactive capabilities.

- **Summary**: Fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) is to learn visual representations that distinguish visually similar objects while maintaining generalization. Existing methods propose to generate discriminative features, but rarely consider the particularity of the FGIR task itself. This paper presents a meticulous analysis leading to the proposal of practical guidelines to identify subcategory-specific discrepancies and generate discriminative features to design effective FGIR models. These guidelines include emphasizing the object (G1), highlighting subcategory-specific discrepancies (G2), and employing effective training strategy (G3). Following G1 and G2, we design a novel Dual Visual Filtering mechanism for the plain visual transformer, denoted as DVF, to capture subcategory-specific discrepancies. Specifically, the dual visual filtering mechanism comprises an object-oriented module and a semantic-oriented module. These components serve to magnify objects and identify discriminative regions, respectively. Following G3, we implement a discriminative model training strategy to improve the discriminability and generalization ability of DVF. Extensive analysis and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of our proposed guidelines. Without bells and whistles, the proposed DVF achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely-used fine-grained datasets in closed-set and open-set settings.

- **Summary**: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) heavily rely on LiDAR perception for environment understanding and navigation. LiDAR intensity provides valuable information about the reflected laser signals and plays a crucial role in enhancing the perception capabilities of AVs. However, accurately simulating LiDAR intensity remains a challenge due to the unavailability of material properties of the objects in the environment, and complex interactions between the laser beam and the environment. The proposed method aims to improve the accuracy of intensity simulation by incorporating physics-based modalities within the deep learning framework. One of the key entities that captures the interaction between the laser beam and the objects is the angle of incidence. In this work we demonstrate that the addition of the LiDAR incidence angle as a separate input to the deep neural networks significantly enhances the results. We present a comparative study between two prominent deep learning architectures: U-NET a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Pix2Pix a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We implemented these two architectures for the intensity prediction task and used SemanticKITTI and VoxelScape datasets for experiments. The comparative analysis reveals that both architectures benefit from the incidence angle as an additional input. Moreover, the Pix2Pix architecture outperforms U-NET, especially when the incidence angle is incorporated.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the challenges associated with hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction from miniaturized satellites, which often suffer from stripe effects and are computationally resource-limited. We propose a Real-Time Compressed Sensing (RTCS) network designed to be lightweight and require only relatively few training samples for efficient and robust HSI reconstruction in the presence of the stripe effect and under noisy transmission conditions. The RTCS network features a simplified architecture that reduces the required training samples and allows for easy implementation on integer-8-based encoders, facilitating rapid compressed sensing for stripe-like HSI, which exactly matches the moderate design of miniaturized satellites on push broom scanning mechanism. This contrasts optimization-based models that demand high-precision floating-point operations, making them difficult to deploy on edge devices. Our encoder employs an integer-8-compatible linear projection for stripe-like HSI data transmission, ensuring real-time compressed sensing. Furthermore, based on the novel two-streamed architecture, an efficient HSI restoration decoder is proposed for the receiver side, allowing for edge-device reconstruction without needing a sophisticated central server. This is particularly crucial as an increasing number of miniaturized satellites necessitates significant computing resources on the ground station. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our approach, offering new and vital capabilities for existing miniaturized satellite systems.

- **Summary**: Benefiting from strong generalization ability, pre-trained vision language models (VLMs), e.g., CLIP, have been widely utilized in zero-shot scene understanding. Unlike simple recognition tasks, grounded situation recognition (GSR) requires the model not only to classify salient activity (verb) in the image, but also to detect all semantic roles that participate in the action. This complex task usually involves three steps: verb recognition, semantic role grounding, and noun recognition. Directly employing class-based prompts with VLMs and grounding models for this task suffers from several limitations, e.g., it struggles to distinguish ambiguous verb concepts, accurately localize roles with fixed verb-centric template1 input, and achieve context-aware noun predictions. In this paper, we argue that these limitations stem from the mode's poor understanding of verb/noun classes. To this end, we introduce a new approach for zero-shot GSR via Language EXplainer (LEX), which significantly boosts the model's comprehensive capabilities through three explainers: 1) verb explainer, which generates general verb-centric descriptions to enhance the discriminability of different verb classes; 2) grounding explainer, which rephrases verb-centric templates for clearer understanding, thereby enhancing precise semantic role localization; and 3) noun explainer, which creates scene-specific noun descriptions to ensure context-aware noun recognition. By equipping each step of the GSR process with an auxiliary explainer, LEX facilitates complex scene understanding in real-world scenarios. Our extensive validations on the SWiG dataset demonstrate LEX's effectiveness and interoperability in zero-shot GSR.

- **Summary**: The integration of deep learning based systems in clinical practice is often impeded by challenges rooted in limited and heterogeneous medical datasets. In addition, prioritization of marginal performance improvements on a few, narrowly scoped benchmarks over clinical applicability has slowed down meaningful algorithmic progress. This trend often results in excessive fine-tuning of existing methods to achieve state-of-the-art performance on selected datasets rather than fostering clinically relevant innovations. In response, this work presents a comprehensive benchmark for the MedMNIST+ database to diversify the evaluation landscape and conduct a thorough analysis of common convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based architectures, for medical image classification. Our evaluation encompasses various medical datasets, training methodologies, and input resolutions, aiming to reassess the strengths and limitations of widely used model variants. Our findings suggest that computationally efficient training schemes and modern foundation models hold promise in bridging the gap between expensive end-to-end training and more resource-refined approaches. Additionally, contrary to prevailing assumptions, we observe that higher resolutions may not consistently improve performance beyond a certain threshold, advocating for the use of lower resolutions, particularly in prototyping stages, to expedite processing. Notably, our analysis reaffirms the competitiveness of convolutional models compared to ViT-based architectures emphasizing the importance of comprehending the intrinsic capabilities of different model architectures. Moreover, we hope that our standardized evaluation framework will help enhance transparency, reproducibility, and comparability on the MedMNIST+ dataset collection as well as future research within the field. Code will be released soon.

- **Summary**: The emergence of diffusion models has greatly propelled the progress in image and video generation. Recently, some efforts have been made in controllable video generation, including text-to-video generation and video motion control, among which camera motion control is an important topic. However, existing camera motion control methods rely on training a temporal camera module, and necessitate substantial computation resources due to the large amount of parameters in video generation models. Moreover, existing methods pre-define camera motion types during training, which limits their flexibility in camera control. Therefore, to reduce training costs and achieve flexible camera control, we propose COMD, a novel training-free video motion transfer model, which disentangles camera motions and object motions in source videos and transfers the extracted camera motions to new videos. We first propose a one-shot camera motion disentanglement method to extract camera motion from a single source video, which separates the moving objects from the background and estimates the camera motion in the moving objects region based on the motion in the background by solving a Poisson equation. Furthermore, we propose a few-shot camera motion disentanglement method to extract the common camera motion from multiple videos with similar camera motions, which employs a window-based clustering technique to extract the common features in temporal attention maps of multiple videos. Finally, we propose a motion combination method to combine different types of camera motions together, enabling our model a more controllable and flexible camera control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our training-free approach can effectively decouple camera-object motion and apply the decoupled camera motion to a wide range of controllable video generation tasks, achieving flexible and diverse camera motion control.

- **Summary**: Multimodal search has become increasingly important in providing users with a natural and effective way to ex-press their search intentions. Images offer fine-grained details of the desired products, while text allows for easily incorporating search modifications. However, some existing multimodal search systems are unreliable and fail to address simple queries. The problem becomes harder with the large variability of natural language text queries, which may contain ambiguous, implicit, and irrelevant in-formation. Addressing these issues may require systems with enhanced matching capabilities, reasoning abilities, and context-aware query parsing and rewriting. This paper introduces a novel multimodal search model that achieves a new performance milestone on the Fashion200K dataset. Additionally, we propose a novel search interface integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate natural language interaction. This interface routes queries to search systems while conversationally engaging with users and considering previous searches. When coupled with our multimodal search model, it heralds a new era of shopping assistants capable of offering human-like interaction and enhancing the overall search experience.

- **Summary**: Video Wire Inpainting (VWI) is a prominent application in video inpainting, aimed at flawlessly removing wires in films or TV series, offering significant time and labor savings compared to manual frame-by-frame removal. However, wire removal poses greater challenges due to the wires being longer and slimmer than objects typically targeted in general video inpainting tasks, and often intersecting with people and background objects irregularly, which adds complexity to the inpainting process. Recognizing the limitations posed by existing video wire datasets, which are characterized by their small size, poor quality, and limited variety of scenes, we introduce a new VWI dataset with a novel mask generation strategy, namely Wire Removal Video Dataset 2 (WRV2) and Pseudo Wire-Shaped (PWS) Masks. WRV2 dataset comprises over 4,000 videos with an average length of 80 frames, designed to facilitate the development and efficacy of inpainting models. Building upon this, our research proposes the Redundancy-Aware Transformer (Raformer) method that addresses the unique challenges of wire removal in video inpainting. Unlike conventional approaches that indiscriminately process all frame patches, Raformer employs a novel strategy to selectively bypass redundant parts, such as static background segments devoid of valuable information for inpainting. At the core of Raformer is the Redundancy-Aware Attention (RAA) module, which isolates and accentuates essential content through a coarse-grained, window-based attention mechanism. This is complemented by a Soft Feature Alignment (SFA) module, which refines these features and achieves end-to-end feature alignment. Extensive experiments on both the traditional video inpainting datasets and our proposed WRV2 dataset demonstrate that Raformer outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The Sentinel-2 (S2) mission from the European Space Agency's Copernicus program provides essential data for Earth surface analysis. Its Level-2A products deliver high-to-medium resolution (10-60 m) surface reflectance (SR) data through the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI). To enhance the accuracy and comparability of SR data, adjustments simulating a nadir viewing perspective are essential. These corrections address the anisotropic nature of SR and the variability in sun and observation angles, ensuring consistent image comparisons over time and under different conditions. The $c$-factor method, a simple yet effective algorithm, adjusts observed S2 SR by using the MODIS BRDF model to achieve Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR). Despite the straightforward application of the $c$-factor to individual images, a cohesive Python framework for its application across multiple S2 images and Earth System Data Cubes (ESDCs) from cloud-stored data has been lacking. Here we introduce sen2nbar, a Python package crafted to convert S2 SR data to NBAR, supporting both individual images and ESDCs derived from cloud-stored data. This package simplifies the conversion of S2 SR data to NBAR via a single function, organized into modules for efficient process management. By facilitating NBAR conversion for both SAFE files and ESDCs from SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC), sen2nbar is developed as a flexible tool that can handle diverse data format requirements. We anticipate that sen2nbar will considerably contribute to the standardization and harmonization of S2 data, offering a robust solution for a diverse range of users across various applications. sen2nbar is an open-source tool available at https://github.com/ESDS-Leipzig/sen2nbar.

- **Summary**: In this work, we explore a novel task of generating human grasps based on single-view scene point clouds, which more accurately mirrors the typical real-world situation of observing objects from a single viewpoint. Due to the incompleteness of object point clouds and the presence of numerous scene points, the generated hand is prone to penetrating into the invisible parts of the object and the model is easily affected by scene points. Thus, we introduce S2HGrasp, a framework composed of two key modules: the Global Perception module that globally perceives partial object point clouds, and the DiffuGrasp module designed to generate high-quality human grasps based on complex inputs that include scene points. Additionally, we introduce S2HGD dataset, which comprises approximately 99,000 single-object single-view scene point clouds of 1,668 unique objects, each annotated with one human grasp. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that S2HGrasp can not only generate natural human grasps regardless of scene points, but also effectively prevent penetration between the hand and invisible parts of the object. Moreover, our model showcases strong generalization capability when applied to unseen objects. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/iSEE-Laboratory/S2HGrasp.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. The most recent UDA methods always resort to adversarial training to yield state-of-the-art results and a dominant number of existing UDA methods employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as feature extractors to learn domain invariant features. Vision transformer (ViT) has attracted tremendous attention since its emergence and has been widely used in various computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, yet its potential in adversarial domain adaptation has never been investigated. In this paper, we fill this gap by employing the ViT as the feature extractor in adversarial domain adaptation. Moreover, we empirically demonstrate that ViT can be a plug-and-play component in adversarial domain adaptation, which means directly replacing the CNN-based feature extractor in existing UDA methods with the ViT-based feature extractor can easily obtain performance improvement.

- **Summary**: Patellofemoral joint (PFJ) issues affect one in four people, with 20% experiencing chronic knee pain despite treatment. Poor outcomes and pain after knee replacement surgery are often linked to patellar mal-tracking. Traditional imaging methods like CT and MRI face challenges, including cost and metal artefacts, and there's currently no ideal way to observe joint motion without issues such as soft tissue artefacts or radiation exposure. A new system to monitor joint motion could significantly improve understanding of PFJ dynamics, aiding in better patient care and outcomes. Combining 2D ultrasound with motion tracking for 3D reconstruction of the joint using semantic segmentation and position registration can be a solution. However, the need for expensive external infrastructure to estimate the trajectories of the scanner remains the main limitation to implementing 3D bone reconstruction from handheld ultrasound scanning clinically. We proposed the Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and the deep learning-based inertial-only odometry methods as alternatives to motion capture for tracking a handheld ultrasound scanner. The 3D reconstruction generated by these methods has demonstrated potential for assessing the PFJ and for further measurements from free-hand ultrasound scans. The results show that the VIO method performs as well as the motion capture method, with average reconstruction errors of 1.25 mm and 1.21 mm, respectively. The VIO method is the first infrastructure-free method for 3D reconstruction of bone from wireless handheld ultrasound scanning with an accuracy comparable to methods that require external infrastructure.

- **Summary**: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on mobile devices makes all the capabilities of natural language processing available on the device. An important use case of LLMs is question answering, which can provide accurate and contextually relevant answers to a wide array of user queries. We describe how we managed to port state of the art LLMs to mobile devices, enabling them to operate natively on the device. We employ the llama.cpp framework, a flexible and self-contained C++ framework for LLM inference. We selected a 6-bit quantized version of the Orca-Mini-3B model with 3 billion parameters and present the correct prompt format for this model. Experimental results show that LLM inference runs in interactive speed on a Galaxy S21 smartphone and that the model delivers high-quality answers to user queries related to questions from different subjects like politics, geography or history.

- **Summary**: Reflectance Confocal Microscopy (RCM) is a non-invasive imaging technique used in biomedical research and clinical dermatology. It provides virtual high-resolution images of the skin and superficial tissues, reducing the need for physical biopsies. RCM employs a laser light source to illuminate the tissue, capturing the reflected light to generate detailed images of microscopic structures at various depths. Recent studies explored AI and machine learning, particularly CNNs, for analyzing RCM images. Our study proposes a segmentation strategy based on textural features to identify clinically significant regions, empowering dermatologists in effective image interpretation and boosting diagnostic confidence. This approach promises to advance dermatological diagnosis and treatment.

- **Summary**: LiDAR-based 3D object detection has become an essential part of automated driving due to its ability to localize and classify objects precisely in 3D. However, object detectors face a critical challenge when dealing with unknown foreground objects, particularly those that were not present in their original training data. These out-of-distribution (OOD) objects can lead to misclassifications, posing a significant risk to the safety and reliability of automated vehicles. Currently, LiDAR-based OOD object detection has not been well studied. We address this problem by generating synthetic training data for OOD objects by perturbing known object categories. Our idea is that these synthetic OOD objects produce different responses in the feature map of an object detector compared to in-distribution (ID) objects. We then extract features using a pre-trained and fixed object detector and train a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) to classify each detection as either ID or OOD. In addition, we propose a new evaluation protocol that allows the use of existing datasets without modifying the point cloud, ensuring a more authentic evaluation of real-world scenarios. The effectiveness of our method is validated through experiments on the newly proposed nuScenes OOD benchmark. The source code is available at https://github.com/uulm-mrm/mmood3d.

- **Summary**: Latency attacks against object detection represent a variant of adversarial attacks that aim to inflate the inference time by generating additional ghost objects in a target image. However, generating ghost objects in the black-box scenario remains a challenge since information about these unqualified objects remains opaque. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of generating ghost objects in adversarial examples by extending the concept of "steal now, decrypt later" attacks. These adversarial examples, once produced, can be employed to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the AI service, giving rise to significant security concerns. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed attack achieves successful attacks across various commonly used models and Google Vision API without any prior knowledge about the target model. Additionally, the average cost of each attack is less than \$ 1 dollars, posing a significant threat to AI security.

- **Summary**: Computer vision applications predict on digital images acquired by a camera from physical scenes through light. However, conventional robustness benchmarks rely on perturbations in digitized images, diverging from distribution shifts occurring in the image acquisition process. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new distribution shift dataset, ImageNet-ES, comprising variations in environmental and camera sensor factors by directly capturing 202k images with a real camera in a controllable testbed. With the new dataset, we evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and model robustness. We find that existing OOD detection methods do not cope with the covariate shifts in ImageNet-ES, implying that the definition and detection of OOD should be revisited to embrace real-world distribution shifts. We also observe that the model becomes more robust in both ImageNet-C and -ES by learning environment and sensor variations in addition to existing digital augmentations. Lastly, our results suggest that effective shift mitigation via camera sensor control can significantly improve performance without increasing model size. With these findings, our benchmark may aid future research on robustness, OOD, and camera sensor control for computer vision. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Edw2n/ImageNet-ES.

- **Summary**: Geometry- and appearance-controlled full-body human image generation is an interesting but challenging task. Existing solutions are either unconditional or dependent on coarse conditions (e.g., pose, text), thus lacking explicit geometry and appearance control of body and garment. Sketching offers such editing ability and has been adopted in various sketch-based face generation and editing solutions. However, directly adapting sketch-based face generation to full-body generation often fails to produce high-fidelity and diverse results due to the high complexity and diversity in the pose, body shape, and garment shape and texture. Recent geometrically controllable diffusion-based methods mainly rely on prompts to generate appearance and it is hard to balance the realism and the faithfulness of their results to the sketch when the input is coarse. This work presents Sketch2Human, the first system for controllable full-body human image generation guided by a semantic sketch (for geometry control) and a reference image (for appearance control). Our solution is based on the latent space of StyleGAN-Human with inverted geometry and appearance latent codes as input. Specifically, we present a sketch encoder trained with a large synthetic dataset sampled from StyleGAN-Human's latent space and directly supervised by sketches rather than real images. Considering the entangled information of partial geometry and texture in StyleGAN-Human and the absence of disentangled datasets, we design a novel training scheme that creates geometry-preserved and appearance-transferred training data to tune a generator to achieve disentangled geometry and appearance control. Although our method is trained with synthetic data, it can handle hand-drawn sketches as well. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our method to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction technologies have paved the way for high-quality and real-time rendering of complex 3D scenes. Despite these achievements, a notable challenge persists: it is difficult to precisely reconstruct specific objects from large scenes. Current scene reconstruction techniques frequently result in the loss of object detail textures and are unable to reconstruct object portions that are occluded or unseen in views. To address this challenge, we delve into the meticulous 3D reconstruction of specific objects within large scenes and propose a framework termed OMEGAS: Object Mesh Extraction from Large Scenes Guided by GAussian Segmentation. OMEGAS employs a multi-step approach, grounded in several excellent off-the-shelf methodologies. Specifically, initially, we utilize the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to guide the segmentation of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), thereby creating a basic 3DGS model of the target object. Then, we leverage large-scale diffusion priors to further refine the details of the 3DGS model, especially aimed at addressing invisible or occluded object portions from the original scene views. Subsequently, by re-rendering the 3DGS model onto the scene views, we achieve accurate object segmentation and effectively remove the background. Finally, these target-only images are used to improve the 3DGS model further and extract the definitive 3D object mesh by the SuGaR model. In various scenarios, our experiments demonstrate that OMEGAS significantly surpasses existing scene reconstruction methods. Our project page is at: https://github.com/CrystalWlz/OMEGAS

- **Summary**: Etruscan mirrors constitute a significant category within Etruscan art and, therefore, undergo systematic examinations to obtain insights into ancient times. A crucial aspect of their analysis involves the labor-intensive task of manually tracing engravings from the backside. Additionally, this task is inherently challenging due to the damage these mirrors have sustained, introducing subjectivity into the process. We address these challenges by automating the process through photometric-stereo scanning in conjunction with deep segmentation networks which, however, requires effective usage of the limited data at hand. We accomplish this by incorporating predictions on a per-patch level, and various data augmentations, as well as exploring self-supervised learning. Compared to our baseline, we improve predictive performance w.r.t. the pseudo-F-Measure by around 16%. When assessing performance on complete mirrors against a human baseline, our approach yields quantitative similar performance to a human annotator and significantly outperforms existing binarization methods. With our proposed methodology, we streamline the annotation process, enhance its objectivity, and reduce overall workload, offering a valuable contribution to the examination of these historical artifacts and other non-traditional documents.

- **Summary**: Concepts involved in long-form videos such as people, objects, and their interactions, can be viewed as following an implicit prior. They are notably complex and continue to pose challenges to be comprehensively learned. In recent years, generative pre-training (GPT) has exhibited versatile capacities in modeling any kind of text content even visual locations. Can this manner work for learning long-form video prior? Instead of operating on pixel space, it is efficient to employ visual locations like bounding boxes and keypoints to represent key information in videos, which can be simply discretized and then tokenized for consumption by GPT. Due to the scarcity of suitable data, we create a new dataset called \textbf{Storyboard20K} from movies to serve as a representative. It includes synopses, shot-by-shot keyframes, and fine-grained annotations of film sets and characters with consistent IDs, bounding boxes, and whole body keypoints. In this way, long-form videos can be represented by a set of tokens and be learned via generative pre-training. Experimental results validate that our approach has great potential for learning long-form video prior. Code and data will be released at \url{https://github.com/showlab/Long-form-Video-Prior}.

- **Summary**: A well-known retinal disease that feels blurry visions to the affected patients is Macular Degeneration. This research is based on classifying the healthy and macular degeneration fundus with localizing the affected region of the fundus. A CNN architecture and CNN with ResNet architecture (ResNet50, ResNet50v2, ResNet101, ResNet101v2, ResNet152, ResNet152v2) as the backbone are used to classify the two types of fundus. The data are split into three categories including (a) Training set is 90% and Testing set is 10% (b) Training set is 80% and Testing set is 20%, (c) Training set is 50% and Testing set is 50%. After the training, the best model has been selected from the evaluation metrics. Among the models, CNN with backbone of ResNet50 performs best which gives the training accuracy of 98.7\% for 90\% train and 10\% test data split. With this model, we have performed the Grad-CAM visualization to get the region of affected area of fundus.

- **Summary**: Federated learning (FL) is a powerful Machine Learning (ML) paradigm that enables distributed clients to collaboratively learn a shared global model while keeping the data on the original device, thereby preserving privacy. A central challenge in FL is the effective aggregation of local model weights from disparate and potentially unbalanced participating clients. Existing methods often treat each client indiscriminately, applying a single proportion to the entire local model. However, it is empirically advantageous for each weight to be assigned a specific proportion. This paper introduces an innovative Element-Wise Weights Aggregation Method for Federated Learning (EWWA-FL) aimed at optimizing learning performance and accelerating convergence speed. Unlike traditional FL approaches, EWWA-FL aggregates local weights to the global model at the level of individual elements, thereby allowing each participating client to make element-wise contributions to the learning process. By taking into account the unique dataset characteristics of each client, EWWA-FL enhances the robustness of the global model to different datasets while also achieving rapid convergence. The method is flexible enough to employ various weighting strategies. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the advanced capabilities of EWWA-FL, showing significant improvements in both accuracy and convergence speed across a range of backbones and benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Although fusion of information from multiple views of mammograms plays an important role to increase accuracy of breast cancer detection, developing multi-view mammograms-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) schemes still faces challenges and no such CAD schemes have been used in clinical practice. To overcome the challenges, we investigate a new approach based on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), which has sparked interest across various medical imaging tasks. By solving the challenges in (1) effectively adapting the single-view CLIP for multi-view feature fusion and (2) efficiently fine-tuning this parameter-dense model with limited samples and computational resources, we introduce Mammo-CLIP, the first multi-modal framework to process multi-view mammograms and corresponding simple texts. Mammo-CLIP uses an early feature fusion strategy to learn multi-view relationships in four mammograms acquired from the CC and MLO views of the left and right breasts. To enhance learning efficiency, plug-and-play adapters are added into CLIP image and text encoders for fine-tuning parameters and limiting updates to about 1% of the parameters. For framework evaluation, we assembled two datasets retrospectively. The first dataset, comprising 470 malignant and 479 benign cases, was used for few-shot fine-tuning and internal evaluation of the proposed Mammo-CLIP via 5-fold cross-validation. The second dataset, including 60 malignant and 294 benign cases, was used to test generalizability of Mammo-CLIP. Study results show that Mammo-CLIP outperforms the state-of-art cross-view transformer in AUC (0.841 vs. 0.817, 0.837 vs. 0.807) on both datasets. It also surpasses previous two CLIP-based methods by 20.3% and 14.3%. This study highlights the potential of applying the finetuned vision-language models for developing next-generation, image-text-based CAD schemes of breast cancer.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in generative AI have led to the development of techniques to generate visually realistic synthetic video. While a number of techniques have been developed to detect AI-generated synthetic images, in this paper we show that synthetic image detectors are unable to detect synthetic videos. We demonstrate that this is because synthetic video generators introduce substantially different traces than those left by image generators. Despite this, we show that synthetic video traces can be learned, and used to perform reliable synthetic video detection or generator source attribution even after H.264 re-compression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that while detecting videos from new generators through zero-shot transferability is challenging, accurate detection of videos from a new generator can be achieved through few-shot learning.

- **Summary**: State space models (SSMs) with selection mechanisms and hardware-aware architectures, namely Mamba, have recently demonstrated significant promise in long-sequence modeling. Since the self-attention mechanism in transformers has quadratic complexity with image size and increasing computational demands, the researchers are now exploring how to adapt Mamba for computer vision tasks. This paper is the first comprehensive survey aiming to provide an in-depth analysis of Mamba models in the field of computer vision. It begins by exploring the foundational concepts contributing to Mamba's success, including the state space model framework, selection mechanisms, and hardware-aware design. Next, we review these vision mamba models by categorizing them into foundational ones and enhancing them with techniques such as convolution, recurrence, and attention to improve their sophistication. We further delve into the widespread applications of Mamba in vision tasks, which include their use as a backbone in various levels of vision processing. This encompasses general visual tasks, Medical visual tasks (e.g., 2D / 3D segmentation, classification, and image registration, etc.), and Remote Sensing visual tasks. We specially introduce general visual tasks from two levels: High/Mid-level vision (e.g., Object detection, Segmentation, Video classification, etc.) and Low-level vision (e.g., Image super-resolution, Image restoration, Visual generation, etc.). We hope this endeavor will spark additional interest within the community to address current challenges and further apply Mamba models in computer vision.

- **Summary**: Analyzing volumetric data with rotational invariance or equivariance is an active topic in current research. Existing deep-learning approaches utilize either group convolutional networks limited to discrete rotations or steerable convolutional networks with constrained filter structures. This work proposes a novel equivariant neural network architecture that achieves analytical Equivariance to Local Pattern Orientation on the continuous SO(3) group while allowing unconstrained trainable filters - EquiLoPO Network. Our key innovations are a group convolutional operation leveraging irreducible representations as the Fourier basis and a local activation function in the SO(3) space that provides a well-defined mapping from input to output functions, preserving equivariance. By integrating these operations into a ResNet-style architecture, we propose a model that overcomes the limitations of prior methods. A comprehensive evaluation on diverse 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, which consistently outperforms state of the art. This work suggests the benefits of true rotational equivariance on SO(3) and flexible unconstrained filters enabled by the local activation function, providing a flexible framework for equivariant deep learning on volumetric data with potential applications across domains.

- **Summary**: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to preserve thermal radiation information from infrared images while integrating texture details from visible images, enabling the capture of important features and hidden details of subjects in complex scenes and disturbed environments. Consequently, IVIF offers distinct advantages in practical applications such as video surveillance, night navigation, and target recognition. However, prevailing methods often face challenges in simultaneously capturing thermal region features and detailed information due to the disparate characteristics of infrared and visible images. Consequently, fusion outcomes frequently entail a compromise between thermal target area information and texture details. In this study, we introduce a novel heterogeneous dual-discriminator generative adversarial network (HDDGAN) to address this issue. Specifically, the generator is structured as a multi-scale skip-connected structure, facilitating the extraction of essential features from different source images. To enhance the information representation ability of the fusion result, an attention mechanism is employed to construct the information fusion layer within the generator, leveraging the disparities between the source images. Moreover, recognizing the distinct learning requirements of information in infrared and visible images, we design two discriminators with differing structures. This approach aims to guide the model to learn salient information from infrared images while simultaneously capturing detailed information from visible images. Extensive experiments conducted on various public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed HDDGAN over other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms, highlighting its enhanced potential for practical applications.

- **Summary**: While the field of medical image analysis has undergone a transformative shift with the integration of machine learning techniques, the main challenge of these techniques is often the scarcity of large, diverse, and well-annotated datasets. Medical images vary in format, size, and other parameters and therefore require extensive preprocessing and standardization, for usage in machine learning. Addressing these challenges, we introduce the Medical Imaging Meta-Dataset (MedIMeta), a novel multi-domain, multi-task meta-dataset. MedIMeta contains 19 medical imaging datasets spanning 10 different domains and encompassing 54 distinct medical tasks, all of which are standardized to the same format and readily usable in PyTorch or other ML frameworks. We perform a technical validation of MedIMeta, demonstrating its utility through fully supervised and cross-domain few-shot learning baselines.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show significant strides in general-purpose multimodal applications such as visual dialogue and embodied navigation. However, existing multimodal evaluation benchmarks cover a limited number of multimodal tasks testing rudimentary capabilities, falling short in tracking LVLM development. In this study, we present MMT-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess LVLMs across massive multimodal tasks requiring expert knowledge and deliberate visual recognition, localization, reasoning, and planning. MMT-Bench comprises $31,325$ meticulously curated multi-choice visual questions from various multimodal scenarios such as vehicle driving and embodied navigation, covering $32$ core meta-tasks and $162$ subtasks in multimodal understanding. Due to its extensive task coverage, MMT-Bench enables the evaluation of LVLMs using a task map, facilitating the discovery of in- and out-of-domain tasks. Evaluation results involving $30$ LVLMs such as the proprietary GPT-4V, GeminiProVision, and open-sourced InternVL-Chat, underscore the significant challenges posed by MMT-Bench. We anticipate that MMT-Bench will inspire the community to develop next-generation multimodal foundation models aimed at achieving general-purpose multimodal intelligence.

- **Summary**: We propose GaussianTalker, a novel framework for real-time generation of pose-controllable talking heads. It leverages the fast rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) while addressing the challenges of directly controlling 3DGS with speech audio. GaussianTalker constructs a canonical 3DGS representation of the head and deforms it in sync with the audio. A key insight is to encode the 3D Gaussian attributes into a shared implicit feature representation, where it is merged with audio features to manipulate each Gaussian attribute. This design exploits the spatial-aware features and enforces interactions between neighboring points. The feature embeddings are then fed to a spatial-audio attention module, which predicts frame-wise offsets for the attributes of each Gaussian. It is more stable than previous concatenation or multiplication approaches for manipulating the numerous Gaussians and their intricate parameters. Experimental results showcase GaussianTalker's superiority in facial fidelity, lip synchronization accuracy, and rendering speed compared to previous methods. Specifically, GaussianTalker achieves a remarkable rendering speed up to 120 FPS, surpassing previous benchmarks. Our code is made available at https://github.com/KU-CVLAB/GaussianTalker/ .

- **Summary**: We introduce the RetinaRegNet model, which can achieve state-of-the-art performance across various retinal image registration tasks. RetinaRegNet does not require training on any retinal images. It begins by establishing point correspondences between two retinal images using image features derived from diffusion models. This process involves the selection of feature points from the moving image using the SIFT algorithm alongside random point sampling. For each selected feature point, a 2D correlation map is computed by assessing the similarity between the feature vector at that point and the feature vectors of all pixels in the fixed image. The pixel with the highest similarity score in the correlation map corresponds to the feature point in the moving image. To remove outliers in the estimated point correspondences, we first applied an inverse consistency constraint, followed by a transformation-based outlier detector. This method proved to outperform the widely used random sample consensus (RANSAC) outlier detector by a significant margin. To handle large deformations, we utilized a two-stage image registration framework. A homography transformation was used in the first stage and a more accurate third-order polynomial transformation was used in the second stage. The model's effectiveness was demonstrated across three retinal image datasets: color fundus images, fluorescein angiography images, and laser speckle flowgraphy images. RetinaRegNet outperformed current state-of-the-art methods in all three datasets. It was especially effective for registering image pairs with large displacement and scaling deformations. This innovation holds promise for various applications in retinal image analysis. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/mirthAI/RetinaRegNet.

- **Summary**: We propose Pure and Lightning ID customization (PuLID), a novel tuning-free ID customization method for text-to-image generation. By incorporating a Lightning T2I branch with a standard diffusion one, PuLID introduces both contrastive alignment loss and accurate ID loss, minimizing disruption to the original model and ensuring high ID fidelity. Experiments show that PuLID achieves superior performance in both ID fidelity and editability. Another attractive property of PuLID is that the image elements (e.g., background, lighting, composition, and style) before and after the ID insertion are kept as consistent as possible.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have made significant advances in text-guided synthesis tasks. However, editing user-provided images remains challenging, as the high dimensional noise input space of diffusion models is not naturally suited for image inversion or spatial editing. In this work, we propose an image representation that promotes spatial editing of input images using a diffusion model. Concretely, we learn to encode an input into "image elements" that can faithfully reconstruct an input image. These elements can be intuitively edited by a user, and are decoded by a diffusion model into realistic images. We show the effectiveness of our representation on various image editing tasks, such as object resizing, rearrangement, dragging, de-occlusion, removal, variation, and image composition.

- **Summary**: The success of contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) relies on the supervision from the pairing between images and captions, which tends to be noisy in web-crawled data. We present Mixture of Data Experts (MoDE) and learn a system of CLIP data experts via clustering. Each data expert is trained on one data cluster, being less sensitive to false negative noises in other clusters. At inference time, we ensemble their outputs by applying weights determined through the correlation between task metadata and cluster conditions. To estimate the correlation precisely, the samples in one cluster should be semantically similar, but the number of data experts should still be reasonable for training and inference. As such, we consider the ontology in human language and propose to use fine-grained cluster centers to represent each data expert at a coarse-grained level. Experimental studies show that four CLIP data experts on ViT-B/16 outperform the ViT-L/14 by OpenAI CLIP and OpenCLIP on zero-shot image classification but with less ($<$35\%) training cost. Meanwhile, MoDE can train all data expert asynchronously and can flexibly include new data experts. The code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/MetaCLIP/tree/main/mode.

- **Summary**: With the advent of large language models(LLMs) enhanced by the chain-of-thought(CoT) methodology, visual reasoning problem is usually decomposed into manageable sub-tasks and tackled sequentially with various external tools. However, such a paradigm faces the challenge of the potential "determining hallucinations" in decision-making due to insufficient visual information and the limitation of low-level perception tools that fail to provide abstract summaries necessary for comprehensive reasoning. We argue that converging visual context acquisition and logical reasoning is pivotal for tackling visual reasoning tasks. This paper delves into the realm of multimodal CoT to solve intricate visual reasoning tasks with multimodal large language models(MLLMs) and their cognitive capability. To this end, we propose an innovative multimodal CoT framework, termed Cantor, characterized by a perception-decision architecture. Cantor first acts as a decision generator and integrates visual inputs to analyze the image and problem, ensuring a closer alignment with the actual context. Furthermore, Cantor leverages the advanced cognitive functions of MLLMs to perform as multifaceted experts for deriving higher-level information, enhancing the CoT generation process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, showing significant improvements in multimodal CoT performance across two complex visual reasoning datasets, without necessitating fine-tuning or ground-truth rationales.

- **Summary**: Human matting is a foundation task in image and video processing, where human foreground pixels are extracted from the input. Prior works either improve the accuracy by additional guidance or improve the temporal consistency of a single instance across frames. We propose a new framework MaGGIe, Masked Guided Gradual Human Instance Matting, which predicts alpha mattes progressively for each human instances while maintaining the computational cost, precision, and consistency. Our method leverages modern architectures, including transformer attention and sparse convolution, to output all instance mattes simultaneously without exploding memory and latency. Although keeping constant inference costs in the multiple-instance scenario, our framework achieves robust and versatile performance on our proposed synthesized benchmarks. With the higher quality image and video matting benchmarks, the novel multi-instance synthesis approach from publicly available sources is introduced to increase the generalization of models in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Sequence modeling is a crucial area across various domains, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, time series forecasting, music generation, and bioinformatics. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) have historically dominated sequence modeling tasks like Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition (NER), etc. However, the advancement of transformers has led to a shift in this paradigm, given their superior performance. Yet, transformers suffer from $O(N^2)$ attention complexity and challenges in handling inductive bias. Several variations have been proposed to address these issues which use spectral networks or convolutions and have performed well on a range of tasks. However, they still have difficulty in dealing with long sequences. State Space Models(SSMs) have emerged as promising alternatives for sequence modeling paradigms in this context, especially with the advent of S4 and its variants, such as S4nd, Hippo, Hyena, Diagnol State Spaces (DSS), Gated State Spaces (GSS), Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU), Liquid-S4, Mamba, etc. In this survey, we categorize the foundational SSMs based on three paradigms namely, Gating architectures, Structural architectures, and Recurrent architectures. This survey also highlights diverse applications of SSMs across domains such as vision, video, audio, speech, language (especially long sequence modeling), medical (including genomics), chemical (like drug design), recommendation systems, and time series analysis, including tabular data. Moreover, we consolidate the performance of SSMs on benchmark datasets like Long Range Arena (LRA), WikiText, Glue, Pile, ImageNet, Kinetics-400, sstv2, as well as video datasets such as Breakfast, COIN, LVU, and various time series datasets.

- **Summary**: Recent dataset deduplication techniques have demonstrated that content-aware dataset pruning can dramatically reduce the cost of training Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models without significant performance losses compared to training on the original dataset. These results have been based on pruning commonly used image-caption datasets collected from the web -- datasets that are known to harbor harmful social biases that may then be codified in trained models. In this work, we evaluate how deduplication affects the prevalence of these biases in the resulting trained models and introduce an easy-to-implement modification to the recent SemDeDup algorithm that can reduce the negative effects that we observe. When examining CLIP-style models trained on deduplicated variants of LAION-400M, we find our proposed FairDeDup algorithm consistently leads to improved fairness metrics over SemDeDup on the FairFace and FACET datasets while maintaining zero-shot performance on CLIP benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Purpose: This study explores the feasibility of using generative machine learning (ML) to translate Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images into Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) images, potentially bypassing the need for specialized OCTA hardware. Methods: The method involved implementing a generative adversarial network framework that includes a 2D vascular segmentation model and a 2D OCTA image translation model. The study utilizes a public dataset of 500 patients, divided into subsets based on resolution and disease status, to validate the quality of TR-OCTA images. The validation employs several quality and quantitative metrics to compare the translated images with ground truth OCTAs (GT-OCTA). We then quantitatively characterize vascular features generated in TR-OCTAs with GT-OCTAs to assess the feasibility of using TR-OCTA for objective disease diagnosis. Result: TR-OCTAs showed high image quality in both 3 and 6 mm datasets (high-resolution, moderate structural similarity and contrast quality compared to GT-OCTAs). There were slight discrepancies in vascular metrics, especially in diseased patients. Blood vessel features like tortuosity and vessel perimeter index showed a better trend compared to density features which are affected by local vascular distortions. Conclusion: This study presents a promising solution to the limitations of OCTA adoption in clinical practice by using vascular features from TR-OCTA for disease detection. Translation relevance: This study has the potential to significantly enhance the diagnostic process for retinal diseases by making detailed vascular imaging more widely available and reducing dependency on costly OCTA equipment.

- **Summary**: In the field of 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE), accurately estimating human pose, especially in scenarios with occlusions, is a significant challenge. This work identifies and addresses a gap in the current state of the art in 3D HPE concerning the scarcity of data and strategies for handling occlusions. We introduce our novel BlendMimic3D dataset, designed to mimic real-world situations where occlusions occur for seamless integration in 3D HPE algorithms. Additionally, we propose a 3D pose refinement block, employing a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to enhance pose representation through a graph model. This GCN block acts as a plug-and-play solution, adaptable to various 3D HPE frameworks without requiring retraining them. By training the GCN with occluded data from BlendMimic3D, we demonstrate significant improvements in resolving occluded poses, with comparable results for non-occluded ones.

- **Summary**: We introduce an assessment procedure for interactive segmentation models. Based on concepts from Bayesian Experimental Design, the procedure measures a model's understanding of point prompts and their correspondence with the desired segmentation mask. We show that Oracle Dice index measurements are insensitive or even misleading in measuring this property. We demonstrate the use of the proposed procedure on three interactive segmentation models and subsets of two large image segmentation datasets.

- **Summary**: The recent prevalence of publicly accessible, large medical imaging datasets has led to a proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) models for cardiovascular image classification and analysis. At the same time, the potentially significant impacts of these models have motivated the development of a range of explainable AI (XAI) methods that aim to explain model predictions given certain image inputs. However, many of these methods are not developed or evaluated with domain experts, and explanations are not contextualized in terms of medical expertise or domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel framework and python library, MiMICRI, that provides domain-centered counterfactual explanations of cardiovascular image classification models. MiMICRI helps users interactively select and replace segments of medical images that correspond to morphological structures. From the counterfactuals generated, users can then assess the influence of each segment on model predictions, and validate the model against known medical facts. We evaluate this library with two medical experts. Our evaluation demonstrates that a domain-centered XAI approach can enhance the interpretability of model explanations, and help experts reason about models in terms of relevant domain knowledge. However, concerns were also surfaced about the clinical plausibility of the counterfactuals generated. We conclude with a discussion on the generalizability and trustworthiness of the MiMICRI framework, as well as the implications of our findings on the development of domain-centered XAI methods for model interpretability in healthcare contexts.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models, while effective in general domains and showing strong performance in diverse multi-modal applications like visual question-answering (VQA), struggle to maintain the same level of effectiveness in more specialized domains, e.g., medical. We propose a medical vision-language model that integrates large vision and language models adapted for the medical domain. This model goes through three stages of parameter-efficient training using three separate biomedical and radiology multi-modal visual and text datasets. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SLAKE 1.0 medical VQA (MedVQA) dataset with an overall accuracy of 87.5% and demonstrates strong performance on another MedVQA dataset, VQA-RAD, achieving an overall accuracy of 73.2%.

- **Summary**: Multi-label Recognition (MLR) involves the identification of multiple objects within an image. To address the additional complexity of this problem, recent works have leveraged information from vision-language models (VLMs) trained on large text-images datasets for the task. These methods learn an independent classifier for each object (class), overlooking correlations in their occurrences. Such co-occurrences can be captured from the training data as conditional probabilities between a pair of classes. We propose a framework to extend the independent classifiers by incorporating the co-occurrence information for object pairs to improve the performance of independent classifiers. We use a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to enforce the conditional probabilities between classes, by refining the initial estimates derived from image and text sources obtained using VLMs. We validate our method on four MLR datasets, where our approach outperforms all state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Deepfake or synthetic images produced using deep generative models pose serious risks to online platforms. This has triggered several research efforts to accurately detect deepfake images, achieving excellent performance on publicly available deepfake datasets. In this work, we study 8 state-of-the-art detectors and argue that they are far from being ready for deployment due to two recent developments. First, the emergence of lightweight methods to customize large generative models, can enable an attacker to create many customized generators (to create deepfakes), thereby substantially increasing the threat surface. We show that existing defenses fail to generalize well to such \emph{user-customized generative models} that are publicly available today. We discuss new machine learning approaches based on content-agnostic features, and ensemble modeling to improve generalization performance against user-customized models. Second, the emergence of \textit{vision foundation models} -- machine learning models trained on broad data that can be easily adapted to several downstream tasks -- can be misused by attackers to craft adversarial deepfakes that can evade existing defenses. We propose a simple adversarial attack that leverages existing foundation models to craft adversarial samples \textit{without adding any adversarial noise}, through careful semantic manipulation of the image content. We highlight the vulnerabilities of several defenses against our attack, and explore directions leveraging advanced foundation models and adversarial training to defend against this new threat.

- **Summary**: An environment acoustic model represents how sound is transformed by the physical characteristics of an indoor environment, for any given source/receiver location. Traditional methods for constructing acoustic models involve expensive and time-consuming collection of large quantities of acoustic data at dense spatial locations in the space, or rely on privileged knowledge of scene geometry to intelligently select acoustic data sampling locations. We propose active acoustic sampling, a new task for efficiently building an environment acoustic model of an unmapped environment in which a mobile agent equipped with visual and acoustic sensors jointly constructs the environment acoustic model and the occupancy map on-the-fly. We introduce ActiveRIR, a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that leverages information from audio-visual sensor streams to guide agent navigation and determine optimal acoustic data sampling positions, yielding a high quality acoustic model of the environment from a minimal set of acoustic samples. We train our policy with a novel RL reward based on information gain in the environment acoustic model. Evaluating on diverse unseen indoor environments from a state-of-the-art acoustic simulation platform, ActiveRIR outperforms an array of methods--both traditional navigation agents based on spatial novelty and visual exploration as well as existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: We present NeRF-XL, a principled method for distributing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) across multiple GPUs, thus enabling the training and rendering of NeRFs with an arbitrarily large capacity. We begin by revisiting existing multi-GPU approaches, which decompose large scenes into multiple independently trained NeRFs, and identify several fundamental issues with these methods that hinder improvements in reconstruction quality as additional computational resources (GPUs) are used in training. NeRF-XL remedies these issues and enables the training and rendering of NeRFs with an arbitrary number of parameters by simply using more hardware. At the core of our method lies a novel distributed training and rendering formulation, which is mathematically equivalent to the classic single-GPU case and minimizes communication between GPUs. By unlocking NeRFs with arbitrarily large parameter counts, our approach is the first to reveal multi-GPU scaling laws for NeRFs, showing improvements in reconstruction quality with larger parameter counts and speed improvements with more GPUs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NeRF-XL on a wide variety of datasets, including the largest open-source dataset to date, MatrixCity, containing 258K images covering a 25km^2 city area.

- **Summary**: Comparing a user video to a reference how-to video is a key requirement for AR/VR technology delivering personalized assistance tailored to the user's progress. However, current approaches for language-based assistance can only answer questions about a single video. We propose an approach that first automatically generates large amounts of visual instruction tuning data involving pairs of videos from HowTo100M by leveraging existing step annotations and accompanying narrations, and then trains a video-conditioned language model to jointly reason across multiple raw videos. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance at identifying differences between video pairs and ranking videos based on the severity of these differences, and shows promising ability to perform general reasoning over multiple videos.

- **Summary**: Modern face recognition systems utilize deep neural networks to extract salient features from a face. These features denote embeddings in latent space and are often stored as templates in a face recognition system. These embeddings are susceptible to data leakage and, in some cases, can even be used to reconstruct the original face image. To prevent compromising identities, template protection schemes are commonly employed. However, these schemes may still not prevent the leakage of soft biometric information such as age, gender and race. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel technique that combines Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) with an existing template protection scheme known as PolyProtect. We show that the embeddings can be compressed and encrypted using FHE and transformed into a secure PolyProtect template using polynomial transformation, for additional protection. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach through extensive experiments on multiple datasets. Our proposed approach ensures irreversibility and unlinkability, effectively preventing the leakage of soft biometric attributes from face embeddings without compromising recognition accuracy.
