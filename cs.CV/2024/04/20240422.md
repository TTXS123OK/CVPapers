- **Summary**: 3D rendering of dynamic face captures is a challenging problem, and it demands improvements on several fronts$\unicode{x2014}$photorealism, efficiency, compatibility, and configurability. We present a novel representation that enables high-quality volumetric rendering of an actor's dynamic facial performances with minimal compute and memory footprint. It runs natively on commodity graphics soft- and hardware, and allows for a graceful trade-off between quality and efficiency. Our method utilizes recent advances in neural rendering, particularly learning discrete radiance manifolds to sparsely sample the scene to model volumetric effects. We achieve efficient modeling by learning a single set of manifolds for the entire dynamic sequence, while implicitly modeling appearance changes as temporal canonical texture. We export a single layered mesh and view-independent RGBA texture video that is compatible with legacy graphics renderers without additional ML integration. We demonstrate our method by rendering dynamic face captures of real actors in a game engine, at comparable photorealism to state-of-the-art neural rendering techniques at previously unseen frame rates.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry due to its intrinsic advantages, particularly its implicit representation and novel view synthesis capabilities. With the rapid advancements in deep learning, a multitude of methods have emerged to explore the potential applications of NeRF in the domain of Autonomous Driving (AD). However, a conspicuous void is apparent within the current literature. To bridge this gap, this paper conducts a comprehensive survey of NeRF's applications in the context of AD. Our survey is structured to categorize NeRF's applications in Autonomous Driving (AD), specifically encompassing perception, 3D reconstruction, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and simulation. We delve into in-depth analysis and summarize the findings for each application category, and conclude by providing insights and discussions on future directions in this field. We hope this paper serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers in this domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey specifically focused on the applications of NeRF in the Autonomous Driving domain.

- **Summary**: We address the challenging task of identifying, segmenting, and tracking hand-held objects, which is crucial for applications such as human action segmentation and performance evaluation. This task is particularly challenging due to heavy occlusion, rapid motion, and the transitory nature of objects being hand-held, where an object may be held, released, and subsequently picked up again. To tackle these challenges, we have developed a novel transformer-based architecture called HOIST-Former. HOIST-Former is adept at spatially and temporally segmenting hands and objects by iteratively pooling features from each other, ensuring that the processes of identification, segmentation, and tracking of hand-held objects depend on the hands' positions and their contextual appearance. We further refine HOIST-Former with a contact loss that focuses on areas where hands are in contact with objects. Moreover, we also contribute an in-the-wild video dataset called HOIST, which comprises 4,125 videos complete with bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and tracking IDs for hand-held objects. Through experiments on the HOIST dataset and two additional public datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of HOIST-Former in segmenting and tracking hand-held objects.

- **Summary**: Video-based eye trackers capture the iris biometric and enable authentication to secure user identity. However, biometric authentication is susceptible to spoofing another user's identity through physical or digital manipulation. The current standard to identify physical spoofing attacks on eye-tracking sensors uses liveness detection. Liveness detection classifies gaze data as real or fake, which is sufficient to detect physical presentation attacks. However, such defenses cannot detect a spoofing attack when real eye image inputs are digitally manipulated to swap the iris pattern of another person. We propose IrisSwap as a novel attack on gaze-based liveness detection. IrisSwap allows attackers to segment and digitally swap in a victim's iris pattern to fool iris authentication. Both offline and online attacks produce gaze data that deceives the current state-of-the-art defense models at rates up to 58% and motivates the need to develop more advanced authentication methods for eye trackers.

- **Summary**: Point cloud registration (PCR) involves determining a rigid transformation that aligns one point cloud to another. Despite the plethora of outstanding deep learning (DL)-based registration methods proposed, comprehensive and systematic studies on DL-based PCR techniques are still lacking. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey and taxonomy of recently proposed PCR methods. Firstly, we conduct a taxonomy of commonly utilized datasets and evaluation metrics. Secondly, we classify the existing research into two main categories: supervised and unsupervised registration, providing insights into the core concepts of various influential PCR models. Finally, we highlight open challenges and potential directions for future research. A curated collection of valuable resources is made available at https://github.com/yxzhang15/PCR.

- **Summary**: A high-precision feature extraction model is crucial for change detection (CD). In the past, many deep learning-based supervised CD methods learned to recognize change feature patterns from a large number of labelled bi-temporal images, whereas labelling bi-temporal remote sensing images is very expensive and often time-consuming; therefore, we propose a coarse-to-fine semi-supervised CD method based on consistency regularization (C2F-SemiCD), which includes a coarse-to-fine CD network with a multiscale attention mechanism (C2FNet) and a semi-supervised update method. Among them, the C2FNet network gradually completes the extraction of change features from coarse-grained to fine-grained through multiscale feature fusion, channel attention mechanism, spatial attention mechanism, global context module, feature refine module, initial aggregation module, and final aggregation module. The semi-supervised update method uses the mean teacher method. The parameters of the student model are updated to the parameters of the teacher Model by using the exponential moving average (EMA) method. Through extensive experiments on three datasets and meticulous ablation studies, including crossover experiments across datasets, we verify the significant effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed C2F-SemiCD method. The code will be open at: https://github.com/ChengxiHAN/C2F-SemiCDand-C2FNet.

- **Summary**: Over the years, scene understanding has attracted a growing interest in computer vision, providing the semantic and physical scene information necessary for robots to complete some particular tasks autonomously. In 3D scenes, rich spatial geometric and topological information are often ignored by RGB-based approaches for scene understanding. In this study, we develop a bottom-up approach for scene understanding that infers support relations between objects from a point cloud. Our approach utilizes the spatial topology information of the plane pairs in the scene, consisting of three major steps. 1) Detection of pairwise spatial configuration: dividing primitive pairs into local support connection and local inner connection; 2) primitive classification: a combinatorial optimization method applied to classify primitives; and 3) support relations inference and hierarchy graph construction: bottom-up support relations inference and scene hierarchy graph construction containing primitive level and object level. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the algorithm achieves excellent performance in primitive classification and support relations inference. Additionally, we show that the scene hierarchy graph contains rich geometric and topological information of objects, and it possesses great scalability for scene understanding.

- **Summary**: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) is a cognitive task, challenging models to answer visual questions requiring human commonsense, and to provide rationales explaining why the answers are correct. With emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is natural and imperative to explore their applicability to VCR. However, VCR task demands more external knowledge to tackle its challenging questions, necessitating special designs to activate LLMs' commonsense reasoning abilities. Also, most existing Multimodal LLMs adopted an abstraction of entire input image, which makes it difficult to comprehend VCR's unique co-reference tags between image regions and text, posing challenges for fine-grained alignment. To address these issues, we propose EventLens that leverages Event-Aware Pretraining and Cross-modal Linking and EnhanceS VCR. First, by emulating the cognitive process of human reasoning, an Event-Aware Pretraining auxiliary task is introduced to better activate LLM's global comprehension of intricate scenarios. Second, during fine-tuning, we further utilize reference tags to bridge RoI features with texts, while preserving both modality semantics. Finally, we use instruct-style prompts to narrow the gap between pretraining and fine-tuning, and task-specific adapters to better integrate LLM's inherent knowledge with new commonsense. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed auxiliary task and fine-grained linking strategy.

- **Summary**: Domain generalization faces challenges due to the distribution shift between training and testing sets, and the presence of unseen target domains. Common solutions include domain alignment, meta-learning, data augmentation, or ensemble learning, all of which rely on domain labels or domain adversarial techniques. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Stream Separation and Reconstruction Network, dubbed DSDRNet. It is a disentanglement-reconstruction approach that integrates features of both inter-instance and intra-instance through dual-stream fusion. The method introduces novel supervised signals by combining inter-instance semantic distance and intra-instance similarity. Incorporating Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) into a two-stage cyclic reconstruction process enhances self-disentangled reconstruction signals to facilitate model convergence. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSDRNet outperforms other popular methods in terms of domain generalization capabilities.

- **Summary**: Nighttime self-supervised monocular depth estimation has received increasing attention in recent years. However, using night images for self-supervision is unreliable because the photometric consistency assumption is usually violated in the videos taken under complex lighting conditions. Even with domain adaptation or photometric loss repair, performance is still limited by the poor supervision of night images on trainable networks. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised nighttime monocular depth estimation method that does not use any night images during training. Our framework utilizes day images as a stable source for self-supervision and applies physical priors (e.g., wave optics, reflection model and read-shot noise model) to compensate for some key day-night differences. With day-to-night data distribution compensation, our framework can be trained in an efficient one-stage self-supervised manner. Though no nighttime images are considered during training, qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method achieves SoTA depth estimating results on the challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night compared with existing methods.

- **Summary**: Building fair deep neural networks (DNNs) is a crucial step towards achieving trustworthy artificial intelligence. Delving into deeper factors that affect the fairness of DNNs is paramount and serves as the foundation for mitigating model biases. However, current methods are limited in accurately predicting DNN biases, relying solely on the number of training samples and lacking more precise measurement tools. Here, we establish a geometric perspective for analyzing the fairness of DNNs, comprehensively exploring how DNNs internally shape the intrinsic geometric characteristics of datasets-the intrinsic dimensions (IDs) of perceptual manifolds, and the impact of IDs on the fairness of DNNs. Based on multiple findings, we propose Intrinsic Dimension Regularization (IDR), which enhances the fairness and performance of models by promoting the learning of concise and ID-balanced class perceptual manifolds. In various image recognition benchmark tests, IDR significantly mitigates model bias while improving its performance.

- **Summary**: Recent techniques on implicit geometry representation learning and neural rendering have shown promising results for 3D clothed human reconstruction from sparse video inputs. However, it is still challenging to reconstruct detailed surface geometry and even more difficult to synthesize photorealistic novel views with animated human poses. In this work, we introduce PGAHum, a prior-guided geometry and appearance learning framework for high-fidelity animatable human reconstruction. We thoroughly exploit 3D human priors in three key modules of PGAHum to achieve high-quality geometry reconstruction with intricate details and photorealistic view synthesis on unseen poses. First, a prior-based implicit geometry representation of 3D human, which contains a delta SDF predicted by a tri-plane network and a base SDF derived from the prior SMPL model, is proposed to model the surface details and the body shape in a disentangled manner. Second, we introduce a novel prior-guided sampling strategy that fully leverages the prior information of the human pose and body to sample the query points within or near the body surface. By avoiding unnecessary learning in the empty 3D space, the neural rendering can recover more appearance details. Last, we propose a novel iterative backward deformation strategy to progressively find the correspondence for the query point in observation space. A skinning weights prediction model is learned based on the prior provided by the SMPL model to achieve the iterative backward LBS deformation. Extensive quantitative and qualitative comparisons on various datasets are conducted and the results demonstrate the superiority of our framework. Ablation studies also verify the effectiveness of each scheme for geometry and appearance learning.

- **Summary**: Labeling pixel-wise object masks in videos is a resource-intensive and laborious process. Box-supervised Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) methods have emerged as a viable solution to mitigate the labor-intensive annotation process. . In practical applications, the two-step approach is not only more flexible but also exhibits a higher recognition accuracy. Inspired by the recent success of Segment Anything Model (SAM), we introduce a novel approach that aims at harnessing instance box annotations from multiple perspectives to generate high-quality instance pseudo masks, thus enriching the information contained in instance annotations. We leverage ground-truth boxes to create three types of pseudo masks using the HQ-SAM model, the box-supervised VIS model (IDOL-BoxInst), and the VOS model (DeAOT) separately, along with three corresponding optimization mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce two ground-truth data filtering methods, assisted by high-quality pseudo masks, to further enhance the training dataset quality and improve the performance of fully supervised VIS methods. To fully capitalize on the obtained high-quality Pseudo Masks, we introduce a novel algorithm, PM-VIS, to integrate mask losses into IDOL-BoxInst. Our PM-VIS model, trained with high-quality pseudo mask annotations, demonstrates strong ability in instance mask prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, and OVIS validation sets, notably narrowing the gap between box-supervised and fully supervised VIS methods.

- **Summary**: The Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithm is popular for inverse image problem-solving. However, this algorithm lacks theoretical analysis of its convergence with more advanced plug-in denoisers. We demonstrate that discrete PnP iteration can be described by a continuous stochastic differential equation (SDE). We can also achieve this transformation through Markov process formulation of PnP. Then, we can take a higher standpoint of PnP algorithms from stochastic differential equations, and give a unified framework for the convergence property of PnP according to the solvability condition of its corresponding SDE. We reveal that a much weaker condition, bounded denoiser with Lipschitz continuous measurement function would be enough for its convergence guarantee, instead of previous Lipschitz continuous denoiser condition.

- **Summary**: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a critical and challenging task in computer vision, particularly in situations involving objects with similar appearances but diverse movements, as seen in team sports. Current methods, largely reliant on object detection and appearance, often fail to track targets in such complex scenarios accurately. This limitation is further exacerbated by the lack of comprehensive and diverse datasets covering the full view of sports pitches. Addressing these issues, we introduce TeamTrack, a pioneering benchmark dataset specifically designed for MOT in sports. TeamTrack is an extensive collection of full-pitch video data from various sports, including soccer, basketball, and handball. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive analysis and benchmarking effort to underscore TeamTrack's utility and potential impact. Our work signifies a crucial step forward, promising to elevate the precision and effectiveness of MOT in complex, dynamic settings such as team sports. The dataset, project code and competition is released at: https://atomscott.github.io/TeamTrack/.

- **Summary**: Generating synthetic fake faces, known as pseudo-fake faces, is an effective way to improve the generalization of DeepFake detection. Existing methods typically generate these faces by blending real or fake faces in color space. While these methods have shown promise, they overlook the simulation of frequency distribution in pseudo-fake faces, limiting the learning of generic forgery traces in-depth. To address this, this paper introduces {\em FreqBlender}, a new method that can generate pseudo-fake faces by blending frequency knowledge. Specifically, we investigate the major frequency components and propose a Frequency Parsing Network to adaptively partition frequency components related to forgery traces. Then we blend this frequency knowledge from fake faces into real faces to generate pseudo-fake faces. Since there is no ground truth for frequency components, we describe a dedicated training strategy by leveraging the inner correlations among different frequency knowledge to instruct the learning process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enhancing DeepFake detection, making it a potential plug-and-play strategy for other methods.

- **Summary**: Sequential DeepFake detection is an emerging task that aims to predict the manipulation sequence in order. Existing methods typically formulate it as an image-to-sequence problem, employing conventional Transformer architectures for detection. However, these methods lack dedicated design and consequently result in limited performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Texture-aware and Shape-guided Transformer to enhance detection performance. Our method features four major improvements. Firstly, we describe a texture-aware branch that effectively captures subtle manipulation traces with the Diversiform Pixel Difference Attention module. Then we introduce a Bidirectional Interaction Cross-attention module that seeks deep correlations among spatial and sequential features, enabling effective modeling of complex manipulation traces. To further enhance the cross-attention, we describe a Shape-guided Gaussian mapping strategy, providing initial priors of the manipulation shape. Finally, observing that the latter manipulation in a sequence may influence traces left in the earlier one, we intriguingly invert the prediction order from forward to backward, leading to notable gains as expected. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms others by a large margin, highlighting the superiority of our method.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from hallucination issues, wherein the models generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect outputs, undermining their reliability. A comprehensive quantitative evaluation is necessary to identify and understand the extent of hallucinations in these models. However, existing benchmarks are often limited in scope, focusing mainly on object hallucinations. Furthermore, current evaluation methods struggle to effectively address the subtle semantic distinctions between model outputs and reference data, as well as the balance between hallucination and informativeness. To address these issues, we introduce a multi-dimensional benchmark covering objects, attributes, and relations, with challenging images selected based on associative biases. Moreover, we propose an large language model (LLM)-based two-stage evaluation framework that generalizes the popular CHAIR metric and incorporates both faithfulness and coverage into the evaluation. Experiments on 10 established LVLMs demonstrate that our evaluation metric is more comprehensive and better correlated with humans than existing work when evaluating on our challenging human annotated benchmark dataset. Our work also highlights the critical balance between faithfulness and coverage of model outputs, and encourages future works to address hallucinations in LVLMs while keeping their outputs informative.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel contribution to the field of regional style transfer. Existing methods often suffer from the drawback of applying style homogeneously across the entire image, leading to stylistic inconsistencies or foreground object twisted when applied to image with foreground elements such as person figures. To address this limitation, we propose a new approach that leverages a segmentation network to precisely isolate foreground objects within the input image. Subsequently, style transfer is applied exclusively to the background region. The isolated foreground objects are then carefully reintegrated into the style-transferred background. To enhance the visual coherence between foreground and background, a color transfer step is employed on the foreground elements prior to their rein-corporation. Finally, we utilize feathering techniques to achieve a seamless amalgamation of foreground and background, resulting in a visually unified and aesthetically pleasing final composition. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proposed approach yields significantly more natural stylistic transformations compared to conventional methods.

- **Summary**: Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) techniques aim to address the problem of underwater image degradation due to light absorption and scattering. In recent years, both Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-based and Transformer-based methods have been widely explored. In addition, combining CNN and Transformer can effectively combine global and local information for enhancement. However, this approach is still affected by the secondary complexity of the Transformer and cannot maximize the performance. Recently, the state-space model (SSM) based architecture Mamba has been proposed, which excels in modeling long distances while maintaining linear complexity. This paper explores the potential of this SSM-based model for UIE from both efficiency and effectiveness perspectives. However, the performance of directly applying Mamba is poor because local fine-grained features, which are crucial for image enhancement, cannot be fully utilized. Specifically, we customize the MambaUIE architecture for efficient UIE. Specifically, we introduce visual state space (VSS) blocks to capture global contextual information at the macro level while mining local information at the micro level. Also, for these two kinds of information, we propose a Dynamic Interaction Block (DIB) and Spatial feed-forward Network (SGFN) for intra-block feature aggregation. MambaUIE is able to efficiently synthesize global and local information and maintains a very small number of parameters with high accuracy. Experiments on UIEB datasets show that our method reduces GFLOPs by 67.4% (2.715G) relative to the SOTA method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first UIE model constructed based on SSM that breaks the limitation of FLOPs on accuracy in UIE.

- **Summary**: Neural radiance field (NeRF) has achieved impressive results in high-quality 3D scene reconstruction. However, NeRF heavily relies on precise camera poses. While recent works like BARF have introduced camera pose optimization within NeRF, their applicability is limited to simple trajectory scenes. Existing methods struggle while tackling complex trajectories involving large rotations. To address this limitation, we propose CT-NeRF, an incremental reconstruction optimization pipeline using only RGB images without pose and depth input. In this pipeline, we first propose a local-global bundle adjustment under a pose graph connecting neighboring frames to enforce the consistency between poses to escape the local minima caused by only pose consistency with the scene structure. Further, we instantiate the consistency between poses as a reprojected geometric image distance constraint resulting from pixel-level correspondences between input image pairs. Through the incremental reconstruction, CT-NeRF enables the recovery of both camera poses and scene structure and is capable of handling scenes with complex trajectories. We evaluate the performance of CT-NeRF on two real-world datasets, NeRFBuster and Free-Dataset, which feature complex trajectories. Results show CT-NeRF outperforms existing methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation accuracy.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have significantly advanced the state of the art in image, audio, and video generation tasks. However, their applications in practical scenarios are hindered by slow inference speed. Drawing inspiration from the approximation strategies utilized in consistency models, we propose the Sub-path Linear Approximation Model (SLAM), which accelerates diffusion models while maintaining high-quality image generation. SLAM treats the PF-ODE trajectory as a series of PF-ODE sub-paths divided by sampled points, and harnesses sub-path linear (SL) ODEs to form a progressive and continuous error estimation along each individual PF-ODE sub-path. The optimization on such SL-ODEs allows SLAM to construct denoising mappings with smaller cumulative approximated errors. An efficient distillation method is also developed to facilitate the incorporation of more advanced diffusion models, such as latent diffusion models. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that SLAM achieves an efficient training regimen, requiring only 6 A100 GPU days to produce a high-quality generative model capable of 2 to 4-step generation with high performance. Comprehensive evaluations on LAION, MS COCO 2014, and MS COCO 2017 datasets also illustrate that SLAM surpasses existing acceleration methods in few-step generation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance both on FID and the quality of the generated images.

- **Summary**: Most works studying representation learning focus only on classification and neglect regression. Yet, the learning objectives and therefore the representation topologies of the two tasks are fundamentally different: classification targets class separation, leading to disconnected representations, whereas regression requires ordinality with respect to the target, leading to continuous representations. We thus wonder how the effectiveness of a regression representation is influenced by its topology, with evaluation based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle.   The IB principle is an important framework that provides principles for learning effectiveness representations. We establish two connections between it and the topology of regression representations. The first connection reveals that a lower intrinsic dimension of the feature space implies a reduced complexity of the representation Z. This complexity can be quantified as the conditional entropy of Z on the target space Y and serves as an upper bound on the generalization error. The second connection suggests learning a feature space that is topologically similar to the target space will better align with the IB principle. Based on these two connections, we introduce PH-Reg, a regularizer specific to regression that matches the intrinsic dimension and topology of the feature space with the target space. Experiments on synthetic and real-world regression tasks demonstrate the benefits of PH-Reg.

- **Summary**: Understanding how buildings are distributed globally is crucial to revealing the human footprint on our home planet. This built environment affects local climate, land surface albedo, resource distribution, and many other key factors that influence well-being and human health. Despite this, quantitative and comprehensive data on the distribution and properties of buildings worldwide is lacking. To this end, by using a big data analytics approach and nearly 800,000 satellite images, we generated the highest resolution and highest accuracy building map ever created: the Global OpenBuildingMap (Global OBM). A joint analysis of building maps and solar potentials indicates that rooftop solar energy can supply the global energy consumption need at a reasonable cost. Specifically, if solar panels were placed on the roofs of all buildings, they could supply 1.1-3.3 times -- depending on the efficiency of the solar device -- the global energy consumption in 2020, which is the year with the highest consumption on record. We also identified a clear geospatial correlation between building areas and key socioeconomic variables, which indicates our global building map can serve as an important input to modeling global socioeconomic needs and drivers.

- **Summary**: As a preliminary work, NeRF-Det unifies the tasks of novel view synthesis and 3D perception, demonstrating that perceptual tasks can benefit from novel view synthesis methods like NeRF, significantly improving the performance of indoor multi-view 3D object detection. Using the geometry MLP of NeRF to direct the attention of detection head to crucial parts and incorporating self-supervised loss from novel view rendering contribute to the achieved improvement. To better leverage the notable advantages of the continuous representation through neural rendering in space, we introduce a novel 3D perception network structure, NeRF-DetS. The key component of NeRF-DetS is the Multi-level Sampling-Adaptive Network, making the sampling process adaptively from coarse to fine. Also, we propose a superior multi-view information fusion method, known as Multi-head Weighted Fusion. This fusion approach efficiently addresses the challenge of losing multi-view information when using arithmetic mean, while keeping low computational costs. NeRF-DetS outperforms competitive NeRF-Det on the ScanNetV2 dataset, by achieving +5.02% and +5.92% improvement in mAP@.25 and mAP@.50, respectively.

- **Summary**: Driven by powerful image diffusion models, recent research has achieved the automatic creation of 3D objects from textual or visual guidance. By performing score distillation sampling (SDS) iteratively across different views, these methods succeed in lifting 2D generative prior to the 3D space. However, such a 2D generative image prior bakes the effect of illumination and shadow into the texture. As a result, material maps optimized by SDS inevitably involve spurious correlated components. The absence of precise material definition makes it infeasible to relight the generated assets reasonably in novel scenes, which limits their application in downstream scenarios. In contrast, humans can effortlessly circumvent this ambiguity by deducing the material of the object from its appearance and semantics. Motivated by this insight, we propose MaterialSeg3D, a 3D asset material generation framework to infer underlying material from the 2D semantic prior. Based on such a prior model, we devise a mechanism to parse material in 3D space. We maintain a UV stack, each map of which is unprojected from a specific viewpoint. After traversing all viewpoints, we fuse the stack through a weighted voting scheme and then employ region unification to ensure the coherence of the object parts. To fuel the learning of semantics prior, we collect a material dataset, named Materialized Individual Objects (MIO), which features abundant images, diverse categories, and accurate annotations. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor among women and the second cause of cancer-related death. Early diagnosis in clinical practice is crucial for timely treatment and prognosis. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) has revealed great usability in the preoperative diagnosis and assessing therapy effects thanks to its capability to reflect the morphology and dynamic characteristics of breast lesions. However, most existing computer-assisted diagnosis algorithms only consider conventional radiomic features when classifying benign and malignant lesions in DCE-MRI. In this study, we propose to fully leverage the dynamic characteristics from the kinetic curves as well as the radiomic features to boost the classification accuracy of benign and malignant breast lesions. The proposed method is a fully automated solution by directly analyzing the 3D features from the DCE-MRI. The proposed method is evaluated on an in-house dataset including 200 DCE-MRI scans with 298 breast tumors (172 benign and 126 malignant tumors), achieving favorable classification accuracy with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.94. By simultaneously considering the dynamic and radiomic features, it is beneficial to effectively distinguish between benign and malignant breast lesions.

- **Summary**: Contemporary makeup transfer methods primarily focus on replicating makeup from one face to another, considerably limiting their use in creating diverse and creative character makeup essential for visual storytelling. Such methods typically fail to address the need for uniqueness and contextual relevance, specifically aligning with character and story settings as they depend heavily on existing facial makeup in reference images. This approach also presents a significant challenge when attempting to source a perfectly matched facial makeup style, further complicating the creation of makeup designs inspired by various story elements, such as theme, background, and props that do not necessarily feature faces. To address these limitations, we introduce $Gorgeous$, a novel diffusion-based makeup application method that goes beyond simple transfer by innovatively crafting unique and thematic facial makeup. Unlike traditional methods, $Gorgeous$ does not require the presence of a face in the reference images. Instead, it draws artistic inspiration from a minimal set of three to five images, which can be of any type, and transforms these elements into practical makeup applications directly on the face. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that $Gorgeous$ can effectively generate distinctive character facial makeup inspired by the chosen thematic reference images. This approach opens up new possibilities for integrating broader story elements into character makeup, thereby enhancing the narrative depth and visual impact in storytelling.

- **Summary**: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires models to incorporate external knowledge to respond to questions about visual content. Previous methods mostly follow the "retrieve and generate" paradigm. Initially, they utilize a pre-trained retriever to fetch relevant knowledge documents, subsequently employing them to generate answers. While these methods have demonstrated commendable performance in the task, they possess limitations: (1) they employ an independent retriever to acquire knowledge solely based on the similarity between the query and knowledge embeddings, without assessing whether the knowledge document is truly conducive to helping answer the question; (2) they convert the image into text and then conduct retrieval and answering in natural language space, which may not ensure comprehensive acquisition of all image information. To address these limitations, we propose Boter, a novel framework designed to bootstrap knowledge selection and question answering by leveraging the robust multimodal perception capabilities of the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). The framework consists of two modules: Selector and Answerer, where both are initialized by the MLLM and parameter-efficiently finetuned in a simple cycle: find key knowledge in the retrieved knowledge documents using the Selector, and then use them to finetune the Answerer to predict answers; obtain the pseudo-labels of key knowledge documents based on the predictions of the Answerer and weak supervision labels, and then finetune the Selector to select key knowledge; repeat. Our framework significantly enhances the performance of the baseline on the challenging open-domain Knowledge-based VQA benchmark, OK-VQA, achieving a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.83%.

- **Summary**: RGB-D cameras are crucial in robotic perception, given their ability to produce images augmented with depth data. However, their limited FOV often requires multiple cameras to cover a broader area. In multi-camera RGB-D setups, the goal is typically to reduce camera overlap, optimizing spatial coverage with as few cameras as possible. The extrinsic calibration of these systems introduces additional complexities. Existing methods for extrinsic calibration either necessitate specific tools or highly depend on the accuracy of camera motion estimation. To address these issues, we present PeLiCal, a novel line-based calibration approach for RGB-D camera systems exhibiting limited overlap. Our method leverages long line features from surroundings, and filters out outliers with a novel convergence voting algorithm, achieving targetless, real-time, and outlier-robust performance compared to existing methods. We open source our implementation on https://github.com/joomeok/PeLiCal.git.

- **Summary**: Visual object tracking and segmentation in omnidirectional videos are challenging due to the wide field-of-view and large spherical distortion brought by 360{\deg} images. To alleviate these problems, we introduce a novel representation, extended bounding field-of-view (eBFoV), for target localization and use it as the foundation of a general 360 tracking framework which is applicable for both omnidirectional visual object tracking and segmentation tasks. Building upon our previous work on omnidirectional visual object tracking (360VOT), we propose a comprehensive dataset and benchmark that incorporates a new component called omnidirectional video object segmentation (360VOS). The 360VOS dataset includes 290 sequences accompanied by dense pixel-wise masks and covers a broader range of target categories. To support both the development and evaluation of algorithms in this domain, we divide the dataset into a training subset with 170 sequences and a testing subset with 120 sequences. Furthermore, we tailor evaluation metrics for both omnidirectional tracking and segmentation to ensure rigorous assessment. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed 360 tracking framework and training dataset.

- **Summary**: By leveraging the blur-noise trade-off, imaging with non-uniform exposures largely extends the image acquisition flexibility in harsh environments. However, the limitation of conventional cameras in perceiving intra-frame dynamic information prevents existing methods from being implemented in the real-world frame acquisition for real-time adaptive camera shutter control. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Neuromorphic Shutter Control (NSC) system to avoid motion blurs and alleviate instant noises, where the extremely low latency of events is leveraged to monitor the real-time motion and facilitate the scene-adaptive exposure. Furthermore, to stabilize the inconsistent Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) caused by the non-uniform exposure times, we propose an event-based image denoising network within a self-supervised learning paradigm, i.e., SEID, exploring the statistics of image noises and inter-frame motion information of events to obtain artificial supervision signals for high-quality imaging in real-world scenes. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed NSC, we implement it in hardware by building a hybrid-camera imaging prototype system, with which we collect a real-world dataset containing well-synchronized frames and events in diverse scenarios with different target scenes and motion patterns. Experiments on the synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches.



### Structure-Aware Human Body Reshaping with Adaptive Affinity-Graph Network

- **Summary**: Given a source portrait, the automatic human body reshaping task aims at editing it to an aesthetic body shape. As the technology has been widely used in media, several methods have been proposed mainly focusing on generating optical flow to warp the body shape. However, those previous works only consider the local transformation of different body parts (arms, torso, and legs), ignoring the global affinity, and limiting the capacity to ensure consistency and quality across the entire body. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Affinity-Graph Network (AAGN), which extracts the global affinity between different body parts to enhance the quality of the generated optical flow. Specifically, our AAGN primarily introduces the following designs: (1) we propose an Adaptive Affinity-Graph (AAG) Block that leverages the characteristic of a fully connected graph. AAG represents different body parts as nodes in an adaptive fully connected graph and captures all the affinities between nodes to obtain a global affinity map. The design could better improve the consistency between body parts. (2) Besides, for high-frequency details are crucial for photo aesthetics, a Body Shape Discriminator (BSD) is designed to extract information from both high-frequency and spatial domain. Particularly, an SRM filter is utilized to extract high-frequency details, which are combined with spatial features as input to the BSD. With this design, BSD guides the Flow Generator (FG) to pay attention to various fine details rather than rigid pixel-level fitting. Extensive experiments conducted on the BR-5K dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the aesthetic appeal of reshaped photos, marginally surpassing all previous work to achieve state-of-the-art in all evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Although diffusion models can generate high-quality human images, their applications are limited by the instability in generating hands with correct structures. Some previous works mitigate the problem by considering hand structure yet struggle to maintain style consistency between refined malformed hands and other image regions. In this paper, we aim to solve the problem of inconsistency regarding hand structure and style. We propose a conditional diffusion-based framework RHanDS to refine the hand region with the help of decoupled structure and style guidance. Specifically, the structure guidance is the hand mesh reconstructed from the malformed hand, serving to correct the hand structure. The style guidance is a hand image, e.g., the malformed hand itself, and is employed to furnish the style reference for hand refining. In order to suppress the structure leakage when referencing hand style and effectively utilize hand data to improve the capability of the model, we build a multi-style hand dataset and introduce a twostage training strategy. In the first stage, we use paired hand images for training to generate hands with the same style as the reference. In the second stage, various hand images generated based on the human mesh are used for training to enable the model to gain control over the hand structure. We evaluate our method and counterparts on the test dataset of the proposed multi-style hand dataset. The experimental results show that RHanDS can effectively refine hands structure- and style- correctly compared with previous methods. The codes and datasets will be available soon.

- **Summary**: Crowd localization targets on predicting each instance precise location within an image. Current advanced methods propose the pixel-wise binary classification to tackle the congested prediction, in which the pixel-level thresholds binarize the prediction confidence of being the pedestrian head. Since the crowd scenes suffer from extremely varying contents, counts and scales, the confidence-threshold learner is fragile and under-generalized encountering domain knowledge shift. Moreover, at the most time, the target domain is agnostic in training. Hence, it is imperative to exploit how to enhance the generalization of confidence-threshold locator to the latent target domain. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Proxy Domain (DPD) method to generalize the learner under domain shift. Concretely, based on the theoretical analysis to the generalization error risk upper bound on the latent target domain to a binary classifier, we propose to introduce a generated proxy domain to facilitate generalization. Then, based on the theory, we design a DPD algorithm which is composed by a training paradigm and proxy domain generator to enhance the domain generalization of the confidence-threshold learner. Besides, we conduct our method on five kinds of domain shift scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness on generalizing the crowd localization.

- **Summary**: Recognizing characters and predicting speakers of dialogue are critical for comic processing tasks, such as voice generation or translation. However, because characters vary by comic title, supervised learning approaches like training character classifiers which require specific annotations for each comic title are infeasible. This motivates us to propose a novel zero-shot approach, allowing machines to identify characters and predict speaker names based solely on unannotated comic images. In spite of their importance in real-world applications, these task have largely remained unexplored due to challenges in story comprehension and multimodal integration. Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown great capability for text understanding and reasoning, while their application to multimodal content analysis is still an open problem. To address this problem, we propose an iterative multimodal framework, the first to employ multimodal information for both character identification and speaker prediction tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, establishing a robust baseline for these tasks. Furthermore, since our method requires no training data or annotations, it can be used as-is on any comic series.

- **Summary**: With the advent of multispectral imagery and AI, there have been numerous works on automatic plant segmentation for purposes such as counting, picking, health monitoring, localized pesticide delivery, etc. In this paper, we tackle the related problem of automatic and selective plant-clearing in a sustainable forestry context, where an autonomous machine has to detect and avoid specific plants while clearing any weeds which may compete with the species being cultivated. Such an autonomous system requires a high level of robustness to weather conditions, plant variability, terrain and weeds while remaining cheap and easy to maintain. We notably discuss the lack of robustness of spectral imagery, investigate the impact of the reference database's size and discuss issues specific to AI systems operating in uncontrolled environments.

- **Summary**: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) is pivotal for quantifying actions across domains like sports and medical care. Existing methods often rely on pre-trained backbones from large-scale action recognition datasets to boost performance on smaller AQA datasets. However, this common strategy yields suboptimal results due to the inherent struggle of these backbones to capture the subtle cues essential for AQA. Moreover, fine-tuning on smaller datasets risks overfitting. To address these issues, we propose Coarse-to-Fine Instruction Alignment (CoFInAl). Inspired by recent advances in large language model tuning, CoFInAl aligns AQA with broader pre-trained tasks by reformulating it as a coarse-to-fine classification task. Initially, it learns grade prototypes for coarse assessment and then utilizes fixed sub-grade prototypes for fine-grained assessment. This hierarchical approach mirrors the judging process, enhancing interpretability within the AQA framework. Experimental results on two long-term AQA datasets demonstrate CoFInAl achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant correlation gains of 5.49% and 3.55% on Rhythmic Gymnastics and Fis-V, respectively.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of large-scale AI models trained on extensive datasets has revolutionized machine learning. With these models taking on increasingly central roles in various applications, the need to understand their behavior and enhance interpretability has become paramount. To investigate the impact of changes in training data on a pre-trained model, a common approach is leave-one-out retraining. This entails systematically altering the training dataset by removing specific samples to observe resulting changes within the model. However, retraining the model for each altered dataset presents a significant computational challenge, given the need to perform this operation for every dataset variation. In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework for assessing data impact, comprising offline training and online evaluation stages. During the offline training phase, we approximate the influence of training data on the target model through a distilled synset, formulated as a reversed gradient matching problem. For online evaluation, we expedite the leave-one-out process using the synset, which is then utilized to compute the attribution matrix based on the evaluation objective. Experimental evaluations, including training data attribution and assessments of data quality, demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable model behavior evaluation while significantly speeding up the process compared to the direct retraining method.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) customization aims to create images that embody specific visual concepts delineated in textual descriptions. However, existing works still face a main challenge, concept overfitting. To tackle this challenge, we first analyze overfitting, categorizing it into concept-agnostic overfitting, which undermines non-customized concept knowledge, and concept-specific overfitting, which is confined to customize on limited modalities, i.e, backgrounds, layouts, styles. To evaluate the overfitting degree, we further introduce two metrics, i.e, Latent Fisher divergence and Wasserstein metric to measure the distribution changes of non-customized and customized concept respectively. Drawing from the analysis, we propose Infusion, a T2I customization method that enables the learning of target concepts to avoid being constrained by limited training modalities, while preserving non-customized knowledge. Remarkably, Infusion achieves this feat with remarkable efficiency, requiring a mere 11KB of trained parameters. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both single and multi-concept customized generation.

- **Summary**: The training of contemporary deep learning models heavily relies on publicly available data, posing a risk of unauthorized access to online data and raising concerns about data privacy. Current approaches to creating unlearnable data involve incorporating small, specially designed noises, but these methods strictly limit data usability, overlooking its potential usage in authorized scenarios. In this paper, we extend the concept of unlearnable data to conditional data learnability and introduce \textbf{U}n\textbf{G}eneralizable \textbf{E}xamples (UGEs). UGEs exhibit learnability for authorized users while maintaining unlearnability for potential hackers. The protector defines the authorized network and optimizes UGEs to match the gradients of the original data and its ungeneralizable version, ensuring learnability. To prevent unauthorized learning, UGEs are trained by maximizing a designated distance loss in a common feature space. Additionally, to further safeguard the authorized side from potential attacks, we introduce additional undistillation optimization. Experimental results on multiple datasets and various networks demonstrate that the proposed UGEs framework preserves data usability while reducing training performance on hacker networks, even under different types of attacks.

- **Summary**: Existing brain tumor segmentation methods usually utilize multiple Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities in brain tumor images for segmentation, which can achieve better segmentation performance. However, in clinical applications, some modalities are missing due to resource constraints, leading to severe degradation in the performance of methods applying complete modality segmentation. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal feature distillation with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Transformer hybrid network (MCTSeg) for accurate brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities. We first design a Multimodal Feature Distillation (MFD) module to distill feature-level multimodal knowledge into different unimodality to extract complete modality information. We further develop a Unimodal Feature Enhancement (UFE) module to model the relationship between global and local information semantically. Finally, we build a Cross-Modal Fusion (CMF) module to explicitly align the global correlations among different modalities even when some modalities are missing. Complementary features within and across different modalities are refined via the CNN-Transformer hybrid architectures in both the UFE and CMF modules, where local and global dependencies are both captured. Our ablation study demonstrates the importance of the proposed modules with CNN-Transformer networks and the convolutional blocks in Transformer for improving the performance of brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2018 and BraTS2020 datasets show that the proposed MCTSeg framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in missing modalities cases.

- **Summary**: Multi-person pose estimation (MPPE) presents a formidable yet crucial challenge in computer vision. Most existing methods predominantly concentrate on isolated interaction either between instances or joints, which is inadequate for scenarios demanding concurrent localization of both instances and joints. This paper introduces a novel CNN-based single-stage method, named Dual-path Hierarchical Relation Network (DHRNet), to extract instance-to-joint and joint-to-instance interactions concurrently. Specifically, we design a dual-path interaction modeling module (DIM) that strategically organizes cross-instance and cross-joint interaction modeling modules in two complementary orders, enriching interaction information by integrating merits from different correlation modeling branches. Notably, DHRNet excels in joint localization by leveraging information from other instances and joints. Extensive evaluations on challenging datasets, including COCO, CrowdPose, and OCHuman datasets, showcase DHRNet's state-of-the-art performance. The code will be released at https://github.com/YHDang/dhrnet-multi-pose-estimation.

- **Summary**: We introduce a self-supervised pretraining method, called OcFeat, for camera-only Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) segmentation networks. With OccFeat, we pretrain a BEV network via occupancy prediction and feature distillation tasks. Occupancy prediction provides a 3D geometric understanding of the scene to the model. However, the geometry learned is class-agnostic. Hence, we add semantic information to the model in the 3D space through distillation from a self-supervised pretrained image foundation model. Models pretrained with our method exhibit improved BEV semantic segmentation performance, particularly in low-data scenarios. Moreover, empirical results affirm the efficacy of integrating feature distillation with 3D occupancy prediction in our pretraining approach.

- **Summary**: Point cloud registration is a fundamental technique in 3-D computer vision with applications in graphics, autonomous driving, and robotics. However, registration tasks under challenging conditions, under which noise or perturbations are prevalent, can be difficult. We propose a robust point cloud registration approach that leverages graph neural partial differential equations (PDEs) and heat kernel signatures. Our method first uses graph neural PDE modules to extract high dimensional features from point clouds by aggregating information from the 3-D point neighborhood, thereby enhancing the robustness of the feature representations. Then, we incorporate heat kernel signatures into an attention mechanism to efficiently obtain corresponding keypoints. Finally, a singular value decomposition (SVD) module with learnable weights is used to predict the transformation between two point clouds. Empirical experiments on a 3-D point cloud dataset demonstrate that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance for point cloud registration but also exhibits better robustness to additive noise or 3-D shape perturbations.

- **Summary**: Recent works on audio-driven talking head synthesis using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved impressive results. However, due to inadequate pose and expression control caused by NeRF implicit representation, these methods still have some limitations, such as unsynchronized or unnatural lip movements, and visual jitter and artifacts. In this paper, we propose GaussianTalker, a novel method for audio-driven talking head synthesis based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. With the explicit representation property of 3D Gaussians, intuitive control of the facial motion is achieved by binding Gaussians to 3D facial models. GaussianTalker consists of two modules, Speaker-specific Motion Translator and Dynamic Gaussian Renderer. Speaker-specific Motion Translator achieves accurate lip movements specific to the target speaker through universalized audio feature extraction and customized lip motion generation. Dynamic Gaussian Renderer introduces Speaker-specific BlendShapes to enhance facial detail representation via a latent pose, delivering stable and realistic rendered videos. Extensive experimental results suggest that GaussianTalker outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in talking head synthesis, delivering precise lip synchronization and exceptional visual quality. Our method achieves rendering speeds of 130 FPS on NVIDIA RTX4090 GPU, significantly exceeding the threshold for real-time rendering performance, and can potentially be deployed on other hardware platforms.

- **Summary**: Purpose: The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive performance with point, text or bounding box prompts, in various applications. However, in safety-critical surgical tasks, prompting is not possible due to (i) the lack of per-frame prompts for supervised learning, (ii) it is unrealistic to prompt frame-by-frame in a real-time tracking application, and (iii) it is expensive to annotate prompts for offline applications.   Methods: We develop Surgical-DeSAM to generate automatic bounding box prompts for decoupling SAM to obtain instrument segmentation in real-time robotic surgery. We utilise a commonly used detection architecture, DETR, and fine-tuned it to obtain bounding box prompt for the instruments. We then empolyed decoupling SAM (DeSAM) by replacing the image encoder with DETR encoder and fine-tune prompt encoder and mask decoder to obtain instance segmentation for the surgical instruments. To improve detection performance, we adopted the Swin-transformer to better feature representation.   Results: The proposed method has been validated on two publicly available datasets from the MICCAI surgical instruments segmentation challenge EndoVis 2017 and 2018. The performance of our method is also compared with SOTA instrument segmentation methods and demonstrated significant improvements with dice metrics of 89.62 and 90.70 for the EndoVis 2017 and 2018.   Conclusion: Our extensive experiments and validations demonstrate that Surgical-DeSAM enables real-time instrument segmentation without any additional prompting and outperforms other SOTA segmentation methods.

- **Summary**: The increasing adoption of 3D point cloud data in various applications, such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and virtual reality, has brought about significant advancements in object recognition and scene understanding. However, this progress is accompanied by new security challenges, particularly in the form of backdoor attacks. These attacks involve inserting malicious information into the training data of machine learning models, potentially compromising the model's behavior. In this paper, we propose CloudFort, a novel defense mechanism designed to enhance the robustness of 3D point cloud classifiers against backdoor attacks. CloudFort leverages spatial partitioning and ensemble prediction techniques to effectively mitigate the impact of backdoor triggers while preserving the model's performance on clean data. We evaluate the effectiveness of CloudFort through extensive experiments, demonstrating its strong resilience against the Point Cloud Backdoor Attack (PCBA). Our results show that CloudFort significantly enhances the security of 3D point cloud classification models without compromising their accuracy on benign samples. Furthermore, we explore the limitations of CloudFort and discuss potential avenues for future research in the field of 3D point cloud security. The proposed defense mechanism represents a significant step towards ensuring the trustworthiness and reliability of point-cloud-based systems in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the problem of efficient point searching and sampling for volume neural rendering. Within this realm, two typical approaches are employed: rasterization and ray tracing. The rasterization-based methods enable real-time rendering at the cost of increased memory and lower fidelity. In contrast, the ray-tracing-based methods yield superior quality but demand longer rendering time. We solve this problem by our HashPoint method combining these two strategies, leveraging rasterization for efficient point searching and sampling, and ray marching for rendering. Our method optimizes point searching by rasterizing points within the camera's view, organizing them in a hash table, and facilitating rapid searches. Notably, we accelerate the rendering process by adaptive sampling on the primary surface encountered by the ray. Our approach yields substantial speed-up for a range of state-of-the-art ray-tracing-based methods, maintaining equivalent or superior accuracy across synthetic and real test datasets. The code will be available at https://jiahao-ma.github.io/hashpoint/.

- **Summary**: We revisit Tree-Ring Watermarking, a recent diffusion model watermarking method that demonstrates great robustness to various attacks. We conduct an in-depth study on it and reveal that the distribution shift unintentionally introduced by the watermarking process, apart from watermark pattern matching, contributes to its exceptional robustness. Our investigation further exposes inherent flaws in its original design, particularly in its ability to identify multiple distinct keys, where distribution shift offers no assistance. Based on these findings and analysis, we present RingID for enhanced multi-key identification. It consists of a novel multi-channel heterogeneous watermarking approach designed to seamlessly amalgamate distinctive advantages from diverse watermarks. Coupled with a series of suggested enhancements, RingID exhibits substantial advancements in multi-key identification. Github Page: https://github.com/showlab/RingID

- **Summary**: The Handwritten Text Recognition problem has been a challenge for researchers for the last few decades, especially in the domain of computer vision, a subdomain of pattern recognition. Variability of texts amongst writers, cursiveness, and different font styles of handwritten texts with degradation of historical text images make it a challenging problem. Recognizing scanned document images in neural network-based systems typically involves a two-step approach: segmentation and recognition. However, this method has several drawbacks. These shortcomings encompass challenges in identifying text regions, analyzing layout diversity within pages, and establishing accurate ground truth segmentation. Consequently, these processes are prone to errors, leading to bottlenecks in achieving high recognition accuracies. Thus, in this study, we present an end-to-end paragraph recognition system that incorporates internal line segmentation and gated convolutional layers based encoder. The gating is a mechanism that controls the flow of information and allows to adaptively selection of the more relevant features in handwritten text recognition models. The attention module plays an important role in performing internal line segmentation, allowing the page to be processed line-by-line. During the decoding step, we have integrated a connectionist temporal classification-based word beam search decoder as a post-processing step.

- **Summary**: The performance of image-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can vary depending on the position of the camera used to capture the images. Training on multiple cameras simultaneously, including a first-person egocentric camera, can leverage information from different camera perspectives to improve the performance of RL. However, hardware constraints may limit the availability of multiple cameras in real-world deployment. Additionally, cameras may become damaged in the real-world preventing access to all cameras that were used during training. To overcome these hardware constraints, we propose Multi-View Disentanglement (MVD), which uses multiple cameras to learn a policy that achieves zero-shot generalisation to any single camera from the training set. Our approach is a self-supervised auxiliary task for RL that learns a disentangled representation from multiple cameras, with a shared representation that is aligned across all cameras to allow generalisation to a single camera, and a private representation that is camera-specific. We show experimentally that an RL agent trained on a single third-person camera is unable to learn an optimal policy in many control tasks; but, our approach, benefiting from multiple cameras during training, is able to solve the task using only the same single third-person camera.

- **Summary**: The user base of short video apps has experienced unprecedented growth in recent years, resulting in a significant demand for video content analysis. In particular, text-video retrieval, which aims to find the top matching videos given text descriptions from a vast video corpus, is an essential function, the primary challenge of which is to bridge the modality gap. Nevertheless, most existing approaches treat texts merely as discrete tokens and neglect their syntax structures. Moreover, the abundant spatial and temporal clues in videos are often underutilized due to the lack of interaction with text. To address these issues, we argue that using texts as guidance to focus on relevant temporal frames and spatial regions within videos is beneficial. In this paper, we propose a novel Syntax-Hierarchy-Enhanced text-video retrieval method (SHE-Net) that exploits the inherent semantic and syntax hierarchy of texts to bridge the modality gap from two perspectives. First, to facilitate a more fine-grained integration of visual content, we employ the text syntax hierarchy, which reveals the grammatical structure of text descriptions, to guide the visual representations. Second, to further enhance the multi-modal interaction and alignment, we also utilize the syntax hierarchy to guide the similarity calculation. We evaluated our method on four public text-video retrieval datasets of MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet. The experimental results and ablation studies confirm the advantages of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: Soft targets combined with the cross-entropy loss have shown to improve generalization performance of deep neural networks on supervised classification tasks. The standard cross-entropy loss however assumes data to be categorically distributed, which may often not be the case in practice. In contrast, InfoNCE does not rely on such an explicit assumption but instead implicitly estimates the true conditional through negative sampling. Unfortunately, it cannot be combined with soft targets in its standard formulation, hindering its use in combination with sophisticated training strategies. In this paper, we address this limitation by proposing a principled loss function that is compatible with probabilistic targets. Our new soft target InfoNCE loss is conceptually simple, efficient to compute, and can be derived within the framework of noise contrastive estimation. Using a toy example, we demonstrate shortcomings of the categorical distribution assumption of cross-entropy, and discuss implications of sampling from soft distributions. We observe that soft target InfoNCE performs on par with strong soft target cross-entropy baselines and outperforms hard target NLL and InfoNCE losses on popular benchmarks, including ImageNet. Finally, we provide a simple implementation of our loss, geared towards supervised classification and fully compatible with deep classification model trained with cross-entropy.

- **Summary**: This project has conducted research on robot path planning based on Visual SLAM. The main work of this project is as follows: (1) Construction of Visual SLAM system. Research has been conducted on the basic architecture of Visual SLAM. A Visual SLAM system is developed based on ORB-SLAM3 system, which can conduct dense point cloud mapping. (2) The map suitable for two-dimensional path planning is obtained through map conversion. This part converts the dense point cloud map obtained by Visual SLAM system into an octomap and then performs projection transformation to the grid map. The map conversion converts the dense point cloud map containing a large amount of redundant map information into an extremely lightweight grid map suitable for path planning. (3) Research on path planning algorithm based on reinforcement learning. This project has conducted experimental comparisons between the Q-learning algorithm, the DQN algorithm, and the SARSA algorithm, and found that DQN is the algorithm with the fastest convergence and best performance in high-dimensional complex environments. This project has conducted experimental verification of the Visual SLAM system in a simulation environment. The experimental results obtained based on open-source dataset and self-made dataset prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the designed Visual SLAM system. At the same time, this project has also conducted comparative experiments on the three reinforcement learning algorithms under the same experimental condition to obtain the optimal algorithm under the experimental condition.

- **Summary**: Continual learning, the ability to acquire knowledge from new data while retaining previously learned information, is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Various approaches, including memory replay, knowledge distillation, model regularization, and dynamic network expansion, have been proposed to address this issue. Thus far, dynamic network expansion methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance at the cost of incurring significant computational overhead. This is due to the need for additional model buffers, which makes it less feasible in resource-constrained settings, particularly in the medical domain. To overcome this challenge, we propose Dynamic Model Merging, DynaMMo, a method that merges multiple networks at different stages of model training to achieve better computational efficiency. Specifically, we employ lightweight learnable modules for each task and combine them into a unified model to minimize computational overhead. DynaMMo achieves this without compromising performance, offering a cost-effective solution for continual learning in medical applications. We evaluate DynaMMo on three publicly available datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing approaches. DynaMMo offers around 10-fold reduction in GFLOPS with a small drop of 2.76 in average accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art dynamic-based approaches. The code implementation of this work will be available upon the acceptance of this work at https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/DynaMMo.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a simple yet effective contrastive knowledge distillation approach, which can be formulated as a sample-wise alignment problem with intra- and inter-sample constraints. Unlike traditional knowledge distillation methods that concentrate on maximizing feature similarities or preserving class-wise semantic correlations between teacher and student features, our method attempts to recover the "dark knowledge" by aligning sample-wise teacher and student logits. Specifically, our method first minimizes logit differences within the same sample by considering their numerical values, thus preserving intra-sample similarities. Next, we bridge semantic disparities by leveraging dissimilarities across different samples. Note that constraints on intra-sample similarities and inter-sample dissimilarities can be efficiently and effectively reformulated into a contrastive learning framework with newly designed positive and negative pairs. The positive pair consists of the teacher's and student's logits derived from an identical sample, while the negative pairs are formed by using logits from different samples. With this formulation, our method benefits from the simplicity and efficiency of contrastive learning through the optimization of InfoNCE, yielding a run-time complexity that is far less than $O(n^2)$, where $n$ represents the total number of training samples. Furthermore, our method can eliminate the need for hyperparameter tuning, particularly related to temperature parameters and large batch sizes. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three datasets including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and MS COCO. Experimental results clearly confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method on both image classification and object detection tasks.

- **Summary**: The main objective of this paper is to address the mobile robot localization problem with Triplet Convolutional Neural Networks and test their robustness against changes of the lighting conditions. We have used omnidirectional images from real indoor environments captured in dynamic conditions that have been converted to panoramic format. Two approaches are proposed to address localization by means of triplet neural networks. First, hierarchical localization, which consists in estimating the robot position in two stages: a coarse localization, which involves a room retrieval task, and a fine localization is addressed by means of image retrieval in the previously selected room. Second, global localization, which consists in estimating the position of the robot inside the entire map in a unique step. Besides, an exhaustive study of the loss function influence on the network learning process has been made. The experimental section proves that triplet neural networks are an efficient and robust tool to address the localization of mobile robots in indoor environments, considering real operation conditions.

- **Summary**: In real-world scenarios, images captured often suffer from blurring, noise, and other forms of image degradation, and due to sensor limitations, people usually can only obtain low dynamic range images. To achieve high-quality images, researchers have attempted various image restoration and enhancement operations on photographs, including denoising, deblurring, and high dynamic range imaging. However, merely performing a single type of image enhancement still cannot yield satisfactory images. In this paper, to deal with the challenge above, we propose the Composite Refinement Network (CRNet) to address this issue using multiple exposure images. By fully integrating information-rich multiple exposure inputs, CRNet can perform unified image restoration and enhancement. To improve the quality of image details, CRNet explicitly separates and strengthens high and low-frequency information through pooling layers, using specially designed Multi-Branch Blocks for effective fusion of these frequencies. To increase the receptive field and fully integrate input features, CRNet employs the High-Frequency Enhancement Module, which includes large kernel convolutions and an inverted bottleneck ConvFFN. Our model secured third place in the first track of the Bracketing Image Restoration and Enhancement Challenge, surpassing previous SOTA models in both testing metrics and visual quality.

- **Summary**: Extremely low-light text images are common in natural scenes, making scene text detection and recognition challenging. One solution is to enhance these images using low-light image enhancement methods before text extraction. However, previous methods often do not try to particularly address the significance of low-level features, which are crucial for optimal performance on downstream scene text tasks. Further research is also hindered by the lack of extremely low-light text datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel encoder-decoder framework with an edge-aware attention module to focus on scene text regions during enhancement. Our proposed method uses novel text detection and edge reconstruction losses to emphasize low-level scene text features, leading to successful text extraction. Additionally, we present a Supervised Deep Curve Estimation (Supervised-DCE) model to synthesize extremely low-light images based on publicly available scene text datasets such as ICDAR15 (IC15). We also labeled texts in the extremely low-light See In the Dark (SID) and ordinary LOw-Light (LOL) datasets to allow for objective assessment of extremely low-light image enhancement through scene text tasks. Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both image quality and scene text metrics on the widely-used LOL, SID, and synthetic IC15 datasets. Code and dataset will be released publicly at https://github.com/chunchet-ng/Text-in-the-Dark.

- **Summary**: Despite their impressive generative performance, latent diffusion model-based virtual try-on (VTON) methods lack faithfulness to crucial details of the clothes, such as style, pattern, and text. To alleviate these issues caused by the diffusion stochastic nature and latent supervision, we propose a novel Faithful Latent Diffusion Model for VTON, termed FLDM-VTON. FLDM-VTON improves the conventional latent diffusion process in three major aspects. First, we propose incorporating warped clothes as both the starting point and local condition, supplying the model with faithful clothes priors. Second, we introduce a novel clothes flattening network to constrain generated try-on images, providing clothes-consistent faithful supervision. Third, we devise a clothes-posterior sampling for faithful inference, further enhancing the model performance over conventional clothes-agnostic Gaussian sampling. Extensive experimental results on the benchmark VITON-HD and Dress Code datasets demonstrate that our FLDM-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and is able to generate photo-realistic try-on images with faithful clothing details.

- **Summary**: With the popularity of social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok, and the widespread availability and convenience of retouching tools, an increasing number of individuals are utilizing these tools to beautify their facial photographs. This poses challenges for fields that place high demands on the authenticity of photographs, such as identity verification and social media. By altering facial images, users can easily create deceptive images, leading to the dissemination of false information. This may pose challenges to the reliability of identity verification systems and social media, and even lead to online fraud. To address this issue, some work has proposed makeup removal methods, but they still lack the ability to restore images involving geometric deformations caused by retouching. To tackle the problem of facial retouching restoration, we propose a framework, dubbed Face2Face, which consists of three components: a facial retouching detector, an image restoration model named FaceR, and a color correction module called Hierarchical Adaptive Instance Normalization (H-AdaIN). Firstly, the facial retouching detector predicts a retouching label containing three integers, indicating the retouching methods and their corresponding degrees. Then FaceR restores the retouched image based on the predicted retouching label. Finally, H-AdaIN is applied to address the issue of color shift arising from diffusion models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and each module.

- **Summary**: The automobile plays an important role in the economic activities of mankind, especially in the metropolis. Under the circumstances, the demand of quick search for available parking spaces has become a major concern for the automobile drivers. Meanwhile, the public sense of privacy is also awaking, the image-based parking space recognition methods lack the attention of privacy protection. In this paper, we proposed a binary convolutional neural network with lightweight design structure named BCFPL, which can be used to train with low-resolution parking space images and offer a reasonable recognition result. The images of parking space were collected from various complex environments, including different weather, occlusion conditions, and various camera angles. We conducted the training and testing progresses among different datasets and partial subsets. The experimental results show that the accuracy of BCFPL does not decrease compared with the original resolution image directly, and can reach the average level of the existing mainstream method. BCFPL also has low hardware requirements and fast recognition speed while meeting the privacy requirements, so it has application potential in intelligent city construction and automatic driving field.

- **Summary**: While recent advancements in animatable human rendering have achieved remarkable results, they require test-time optimization for each subject which can be a significant limitation for real-world applications. To address this, we tackle the challenging task of learning a Generalizable Neural Human Renderer (GNH), a novel method for rendering animatable humans from monocular video without any test-time optimization. Our core method focuses on transferring appearance information from the input video to the output image plane by utilizing explicit body priors and multi-view geometry. To render the subject in the intended pose, we utilize a straightforward CNN-based image renderer, foregoing the more common ray-sampling or rasterizing-based rendering modules. Our GNH achieves remarkable generalizable, photorealistic rendering with unseen subjects with a three-stage process. We quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that GNH significantly surpasses current state-of-the-art methods, notably achieving a 31.3% improvement in LPIPS.

- **Summary**: The rapidly developing Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have shown notable capabilities on a range of multi-modal tasks, but still face the hallucination phenomena where the generated texts do not align with the given contexts, significantly restricting the usages of LVLMs. Most previous work detects and mitigates hallucination at the coarse-grained level or requires expensive annotation (e.g., labeling by proprietary models or human experts). To address these issues, we propose detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs via fine-grained AI feedback. The basic idea is that we generate a small-size sentence-level hallucination annotation dataset by proprietary models, whereby we train a hallucination detection model which can perform sentence-level hallucination detection, covering primary hallucination types (i.e., object, attribute, and relationship). Then, we propose a detect-then-rewrite pipeline to automatically construct preference dataset for training hallucination mitigating model. Furthermore, we propose differentiating the severity of hallucinations, and introducing a Hallucination Severity-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (HSA-DPO) for mitigating hallucination in LVLMs by incorporating the severity of hallucinations into preference learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces MultiBooth, a novel and efficient technique for multi-concept customization in image generation from text. Despite the significant advancements in customized generation methods, particularly with the success of diffusion models, existing methods often struggle with multi-concept scenarios due to low concept fidelity and high inference cost. MultiBooth addresses these issues by dividing the multi-concept generation process into two phases: a single-concept learning phase and a multi-concept integration phase. During the single-concept learning phase, we employ a multi-modal image encoder and an efficient concept encoding technique to learn a concise and discriminative representation for each concept. In the multi-concept integration phase, we use bounding boxes to define the generation area for each concept within the cross-attention map. This method enables the creation of individual concepts within their specified regions, thereby facilitating the formation of multi-concept images. This strategy not only improves concept fidelity but also reduces additional inference cost. MultiBooth surpasses various baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, showcasing its superior performance and computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: Urbanization challenges underscore the necessity for effective satellite image-text retrieval methods to swiftly access specific information enriched with geographic semantics for urban applications. However, existing methods often overlook significant domain gaps across diverse urban landscapes, primarily focusing on enhancing retrieval performance within single domains. To tackle this issue, we present UrbanCross, a new framework for cross-domain satellite image-text retrieval. UrbanCross leverages a high-quality, cross-domain dataset enriched with extensive geo-tags from three countries to highlight domain diversity. It employs the Large Multimodal Model (LMM) for textual refinement and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for visual augmentation, achieving a fine-grained alignment of images, segments and texts, yielding a 10% improvement in retrieval performance. Additionally, UrbanCross incorporates an adaptive curriculum-based source sampler and a weighted adversarial cross-domain fine-tuning module, progressively enhancing adaptability across various domains. Extensive experiments confirm UrbanCross's superior efficiency in retrieval and adaptation to new urban environments, demonstrating an average performance increase of 15% over its version without domain adaptation mechanisms, effectively bridging the domain gap.

- **Summary**: Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR) focuses on matching faces from different domains, for instance, thermal to visible images, making Face Recognition (FR) systems more versatile for challenging scenarios. However, the domain gap between these domains and the limited large-scale datasets in the target HFR modalities make it challenging to develop robust HFR models from scratch. In our work, we view different modalities as distinct styles and propose a method to modulate feature maps of the target modality to address the domain gap. We present a new Conditional Adaptive Instance Modulation (CAIM ) module that seamlessly fits into existing FR networks, turning them into HFR-ready systems. The CAIM block modulates intermediate feature maps, efficiently adapting to the style of the source modality and bridging the domain gap. Our method enables end-to-end training using a small set of paired samples.

- **Summary**: The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) exhibits high-quality and real-time synthesis of novel views in 3D scenes. Currently, it primarily focuses on geometry and appearance modeling, while lacking the semantic understanding of scenes. To bridge this gap, we present CLIP-GS, which integrates semantics from Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) into Gaussian Splatting to efficiently comprehend 3D environments without annotated semantic data. In specific, rather than straightforwardly learning and rendering high-dimensional semantic features of 3D Gaussians, which significantly diminishes the efficiency, we propose a Semantic Attribute Compactness (SAC) approach. SAC exploits the inherent unified semantics within objects to learn compact yet effective semantic representations of 3D Gaussians, enabling highly efficient rendering (>100 FPS). Additionally, to address the semantic ambiguity, caused by utilizing view-inconsistent 2D CLIP semantics to supervise Gaussians, we introduce a 3D Coherent Self-training (3DCS) strategy, resorting to the multi-view consistency originated from the 3D model. 3DCS imposes cross-view semantic consistency constraints by leveraging refined, self-predicted pseudo-labels derived from the trained 3D Gaussian model, thereby enhancing precise and view-consistent segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method remarkably outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving improvements of 17.29% and 20.81% in mIoU metric on Replica and ScanNet datasets, respectively, while maintaining real-time rendering speed. Furthermore, our approach exhibits superior performance even with sparse input data, verifying the robustness of our method.

- **Summary**: Eye-tracking technology is integral to numerous consumer electronics applications, particularly in the realm of virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR). These applications demand solutions that excel in three crucial aspects: low-latency, low-power consumption, and precision. Yet, achieving optimal performance across all these fronts presents a formidable challenge, necessitating a balance between sophisticated algorithms and efficient backend hardware implementations. In this study, we tackle this challenge through a synergistic software/hardware co-design of the system with an event camera. Leveraging the inherent sparsity of event-based input data, we integrate a novel sparse FPGA dataflow accelerator customized for submanifold sparse convolution neural networks (SCNN). The SCNN implemented on the accelerator can efficiently extract the embedding feature vector from each representation of event slices by only processing the non-zero activations. Subsequently, these vectors undergo further processing by a gated recurrent unit (GRU) and a fully connected layer on the host CPU to generate the eye centers. Deployment and evaluation of our system reveal outstanding performance metrics. On the Event-based Eye-Tracking-AIS2024 dataset, our system achieves 81% p5 accuracy, 99.5% p10 accuracy, and 3.71 Mean Euclidean Distance with 0.7 ms latency while only consuming 2.29 mJ per inference. Notably, our solution opens up opportunities for future eye-tracking systems. Code is available at https://github.com/CASR-HKU/ESDA/tree/eye_tracking.

- **Summary**: Multiview Structure from Motion is a fundamental and challenging computer vision problem. A recent deep-based approach was proposed utilizing matrix equivariant architectures for the simultaneous recovery of camera pose and 3D scene structure from large image collections. This work however made the unrealistic assumption that the point tracks given as input are clean of outliers. Here we propose an architecture suited to dealing with outliers by adding an inlier/outlier classifying module that respects the model equivariance and by adding a robust bundle adjustment step. Experiments demonstrate that our method can be successfully applied in realistic settings that include large image collections and point tracks extracted with common heuristics and include many outliers.

- **Summary**: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology has proven to be an important part of many robotics systems. Surface normals estimated from LiDAR data are commonly used for a variety of tasks in such systems. As most of the today's mechanical LiDAR sensors produce sparse data, estimating normals from a single scan in a robust manner poses difficulties.   In this paper, we address the problem of estimating normals for sparse LiDAR data avoiding the typical issues of smoothing out the normals in high curvature areas.   Mechanical LiDARs rotate a set of rigidly mounted lasers. One firing of such a set of lasers produces an array of points where each point's neighbor is known due to the known firing pattern of the scanner. We use this knowledge to connect these points to their neighbors and label them using the angles of the lines connecting them. When estimating normals at these points, we only consider points with the same label as neighbors. This allows us to avoid estimating normals in high curvature areas.   We evaluate our approach on various data, both self-recorded and publicly available, acquired using various sparse LiDAR sensors. We show that using our method for normal estimation leads to normals that are more robust in areas with high curvature which leads to maps of higher quality. We also show that our method only incurs a constant factor runtime overhead with respect to a lightweight baseline normal estimation procedure and is therefore suited for operation in computationally demanding environments.

- **Summary**: Recently, diffusion-based purification (DBP) has emerged as a promising approach for defending against adversarial attacks. However, previous studies have used questionable methods to evaluate the robustness of DBP models, their explanations of DBP robustness also lack experimental support. We re-examine DBP robustness using precise gradient, and discuss the impact of stochasticity on DBP robustness. To better explain DBP robustness, we assess DBP robustness under a novel attack setting, Deterministic White-box, and pinpoint stochasticity as the main factor in DBP robustness. Our results suggest that DBP models rely on stochasticity to evade the most effective attack direction, rather than directly countering adversarial perturbations. To improve the robustness of DBP models, we propose Adversarial Denoising Diffusion Training (ADDT). This technique uses Classifier-Guided Perturbation Optimization (CGPO) to generate adversarial perturbation through guidance from a pre-trained classifier, and uses Rank-Based Gaussian Mapping (RBGM) to convert adversarial pertubation into a normal Gaussian distribution. Empirical results show that ADDT improves the robustness of DBP models. Further experiments confirm that ADDT equips DBP models with the ability to directly counter adversarial perturbations.

- **Summary**: Lung segmentation in chest X-ray images is of paramount importance as it plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of various lung diseases. This paper presents a novel approach for lung segmentation in chest X-ray images by integrating U-net with attention mechanisms. The proposed method enhances the U-net architecture by incorporating a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), which unifies three distinct attention mechanisms: channel attention, spatial attention, and pixel attention. The channel attention mechanism enables the model to concentrate on the most informative features across various channels. The spatial attention mechanism enhances the model's precision in localization by focusing on significant spatial locations. Lastly, the pixel attention mechanism empowers the model to focus on individual pixels, further refining the model's focus and thereby improving the accuracy of segmentation. The adoption of the proposed CBAM in conjunction with the U-net architecture marks a significant advancement in the field of medical imaging, with potential implications for improving diagnostic precision and patient outcomes. The efficacy of this method is validated against contemporary state-of-the-art techniques, showcasing its superiority in segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: Imaging sites around the world generate growing amounts of medical scan data with ever more versatile and affordable technology. Large-scale studies acquire MRI for tens of thousands of participants, together with metadata ranging from lifestyle questionnaires to biochemical assays, genetic analyses and more. These large datasets encode substantial information about human health and hold considerable potential for machine learning training and analysis. This chapter examines ongoing large-scale studies and the challenge of distribution shifts between them. Transfer learning for overcoming such shifts is discussed, together with federated learning for safe access to distributed training data securely held at multiple institutions. Finally, representation learning is reviewed as a methodology for encoding embeddings that express abstract relationships in multi-modal input formats.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce X-Ray, an innovative approach to 3D generation that employs a new sequential representation, drawing inspiration from the depth-revealing capabilities of X-Ray scans to meticulously capture both the external and internal features of objects. Central to our method is the utilization of ray casting techniques originating from the camera's viewpoint, meticulously recording the geometric and textural details encountered across all intersected surfaces. This process efficiently condenses complete objects or scenes into a multi-frame format, just like videos. Such a structure ensures the 3D representation is composed solely of critical surface information. Highlighting the practicality and adaptability of our X-Ray representation, we showcase its utility in synthesizing 3D objects, employing a network architecture akin to that used in video diffusion models. The outcomes reveal our representation's superior performance in enhancing both the accuracy and efficiency of 3D synthesis, heralding new directions for ongoing research and practical implementations in the field.

- **Summary**: Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR) aims to expand the applicability of Face Recognition (FR) systems to challenging scenarios, enabling the matching of face images across different domains, such as matching thermal images to visible spectra. However, the development of HFR systems is challenging because of the significant domain gap between modalities and the lack of availability of large-scale paired multi-channel data. In this work, we leverage a pretrained face recognition model as a teacher network to learn domaininvariant network layers called Domain-Invariant Units (DIU) to reduce the domain gap. The proposed DIU can be trained effectively even with a limited amount of paired training data, in a contrastive distillation framework. This proposed approach has the potential to enhance pretrained models, making them more adaptable to a wider range of variations in data. We extensively evaluate our approach on multiple challenging benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Purpose: In medical research, deep learning models rely on high-quality annotated data, a process often laborious and timeconsuming. This is particularly true for detection tasks where bounding box annotations are required. The need to adjust two corners makes the process inherently frame-by-frame. Given the scarcity of experts' time, efficient annotation methods suitable for clinicians are needed. Methods: We propose an on-the-fly method for live video annotation to enhance the annotation efficiency. In this approach, a continuous single-point annotation is maintained by keeping the cursor on the object in a live video, mitigating the need for tedious pausing and repetitive navigation inherent in traditional annotation methods. This novel annotation paradigm inherits the point annotation's ability to generate pseudo-labels using a point-to-box teacher model. We empirically evaluate this approach by developing a dataset and comparing on-the-fly annotation time against traditional annotation method. Results: Using our method, annotation speed was 3.2x faster than the traditional annotation technique. We achieved a mean improvement of 6.51 +- 0.98 AP@50 over conventional method at equivalent annotation budgets on the developed dataset. Conclusion: Without bells and whistles, our approach offers a significant speed-up in annotation tasks. It can be easily implemented on any annotation platform to accelerate the integration of deep learning in video-based medical research.

- **Summary**: To date, most discoveries of network subcomponents that implement human-interpretable computations in deep vision models have involved close study of single units and large amounts of human labor. We explore scalable methods for extracting the subgraph of a vision model's computational graph that underlies recognition of a specific visual concept. We introduce a new method for identifying these subgraphs: specifying a visual concept using a few examples, and then tracing the interdependence of neuron activations across layers, or their functional connectivity. We find that our approach extracts circuits that causally affect model output, and that editing these circuits can defend large pretrained models from adversarial attacks.

- **Summary**: We address the task of estimating camera parameters from a set of images depicting a scene. Popular feature-based structure-from-motion (SfM) tools solve this task by incremental reconstruction: they repeat triangulation of sparse 3D points and registration of more camera views to the sparse point cloud. We re-interpret incremental structure-from-motion as an iterated application and refinement of a visual relocalizer, that is, of a method that registers new views to the current state of the reconstruction. This perspective allows us to investigate alternative visual relocalizers that are not rooted in local feature matching. We show that scene coordinate regression, a learning-based relocalization approach, allows us to build implicit, neural scene representations from unposed images. Different from other learning-based reconstruction methods, we do not require pose priors nor sequential inputs, and we optimize efficiently over thousands of images. Our method, ACE0 (ACE Zero), estimates camera poses to an accuracy comparable to feature-based SfM, as demonstrated by novel view synthesis. Project page: https://nianticlabs.github.io/acezero/

- **Summary**: In the field of graphic design, automating the integration of design elements into a cohesive multi-layered artwork not only boosts productivity but also paves the way for the democratization of graphic design. One existing practice is Graphic Layout Generation (GLG), which aims to layout sequential design elements. It has been constrained by the necessity for a predefined correct sequence of layers, thus limiting creative potential and increasing user workload. In this paper, we present Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG) as a more flexible and pragmatic setup, which creates graphic composition from unordered sets of design elements. To tackle the HLG task, we introduce Graphist, the first layout generation model based on large multimodal models. Graphist efficiently reframes the HLG as a sequence generation problem, utilizing RGB-A images as input, outputs a JSON draft protocol, indicating the coordinates, size, and order of each element. We develop new evaluation metrics for HLG. Graphist outperforms prior arts and establishes a strong baseline for this field. Project homepage: https://github.com/graphic-design-ai/graphist

- **Summary**: The Text to Audible-Video Generation (TAVG) task involves generating videos with accompanying audio based on text descriptions. Achieving this requires skillful alignment of both audio and video elements. To support research in this field, we have developed a comprehensive Text to Audible-Video Generation Benchmark (TAVGBench), which contains over 1.7 million clips with a total duration of 11.8 thousand hours. We propose an automatic annotation pipeline to ensure each audible video has detailed descriptions for both its audio and video contents. We also introduce the Audio-Visual Harmoni score (AVHScore) to provide a quantitative measure of the alignment between the generated audio and video modalities. Additionally, we present a baseline model for TAVG called TAVDiffusion, which uses a two-stream latent diffusion model to provide a fundamental starting point for further research in this area. We achieve the alignment of audio and video by employing cross-attention and contrastive learning. Through extensive experiments and evaluations on TAVGBench, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model under both conventional metrics and our proposed metrics.

- **Summary**: Spatiotemporal networks' observational capabilities are crucial for accurate data gathering and informed decisions across multiple sectors. This study focuses on the Spatiotemporal Ranged Observer-Observable Bipartite Network (STROOBnet), linking observational nodes (e.g., surveillance cameras) to events within defined geographical regions, enabling efficient monitoring. Using data from Real-Time Crime Camera (RTCC) systems and Calls for Service (CFS) in New Orleans, where RTCC combats rising crime amidst reduced police presence, we address the network's initial observational imbalances. Aiming for uniform observational efficacy, we propose the Proximal Recurrence approach. It outperformed traditional clustering methods like k-means and DBSCAN by offering holistic event frequency and spatial consideration, enhancing observational coverage.

- **Summary**: This paper describes MAIA, a Multimodal Automated Interpretability Agent. MAIA is a system that uses neural models to automate neural model understanding tasks like feature interpretation and failure mode discovery. It equips a pre-trained vision-language model with a set of tools that support iterative experimentation on subcomponents of other models to explain their behavior. These include tools commonly used by human interpretability researchers: for synthesizing and editing inputs, computing maximally activating exemplars from real-world datasets, and summarizing and describing experimental results. Interpretability experiments proposed by MAIA compose these tools to describe and explain system behavior. We evaluate applications of MAIA to computer vision models. We first characterize MAIA's ability to describe (neuron-level) features in learned representations of images. Across several trained models and a novel dataset of synthetic vision neurons with paired ground-truth descriptions, MAIA produces descriptions comparable to those generated by expert human experimenters. We then show that MAIA can aid in two additional interpretability tasks: reducing sensitivity to spurious features, and automatically identifying inputs likely to be mis-classified.

- **Summary**: The rapid evolution of multimodal foundation model has demonstrated significant progresses in vision-language understanding and generation, e.g., our previous work SEED-LLaMA. However, there remains a gap between its capability and the real-world applicability, primarily due to the model's limited capacity to effectively respond to various user instructions and interact with diverse visual data. In this work, we focus on bridging this gap through integrating two enhanced features: (1) comprehending images of arbitrary sizes and ratios, and (2) enabling multi-granularity image generation. We present a unified and versatile foundation model, namely, SEED-X, which is able to model multi-granularity visual semantics for comprehension and generation tasks. Besides the competitive results on public benchmarks, SEED-X demonstrates its effectiveness in handling real-world applications across various domains after instruction tuning. We hope that our work will inspire future research into what can be achieved by versatile multimodal foundation models in real-world applications. The models, codes, and datasets will be released in https://github.com/AILab-CVC/SEED-X.

- **Summary**: The success of image generative models has enabled us to build methods that can edit images based on text or other user input. However, these methods are bespoke, imprecise, require additional information, or are limited to only 2D image edits. We present GeoDiffuser, a zero-shot optimization-based method that unifies common 2D and 3D image-based object editing capabilities into a single method. Our key insight is to view image editing operations as geometric transformations. We show that these transformations can be directly incorporated into the attention layers in diffusion models to implicitly perform editing operations. Our training-free optimization method uses an objective function that seeks to preserve object style but generate plausible images, for instance with accurate lighting and shadows. It also inpaints disoccluded parts of the image where the object was originally located. Given a natural image and user input, we segment the foreground object using SAM and estimate a corresponding transform which is used by our optimization approach for editing. GeoDiffuser can perform common 2D and 3D edits like object translation, 3D rotation, and removal. We present quantitative results, including a perceptual study, that shows how our approach is better than existing methods.

- **Summary**: Face recognition technology has become an integral part of modern security systems and user authentication processes. However, these systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks and can easily be circumvented. Most prior research in face anti-spoofing (FAS) approaches it as a two-class classification task where models are trained on real samples and known spoof attacks and tested for detection performance on unknown spoof attacks. However, in practice, FAS should be treated as a one-class classification task where, while training, one cannot assume any knowledge regarding the spoof samples a priori. In this paper, we reformulate the face anti-spoofing task from a one-class perspective and propose a novel hyperbolic one-class classification framework. To train our network, we use a pseudo-negative class sampled from the Gaussian distribution with a weighted running mean and propose two novel loss functions: (1) Hyp-PC: Hyperbolic Pairwise Confusion loss, and (2) Hyp-CE: Hyperbolic Cross Entropy loss, which operate in the hyperbolic space. Additionally, we employ Euclidean feature clipping and gradient clipping to stabilize the training in the hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work extending hyperbolic embeddings for face anti-spoofing in a one-class manner. With extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets: Rose-Youtu, MSU-MFSD, CASIA-MFSD, Idiap Replay-Attack, and OULU-NPU, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving better spoof detection performance.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel cross-reference image quality assessment method that effectively fills the gap in the image assessment landscape, complementing the array of established evaluation schemes -- ranging from full-reference metrics like SSIM, no-reference metrics such as NIQE, to general-reference metrics including FID, and Multi-modal-reference metrics, e.g., CLIPScore. Utilising a neural network with the cross-attention mechanism and a unique data collection pipeline from NVS optimisation, our method enables accurate image quality assessment without requiring ground truth references. By comparing a query image against multiple views of the same scene, our method addresses the limitations of existing metrics in novel view synthesis (NVS) and similar tasks where direct reference images are unavailable. Experimental results show that our method is closely correlated to the full-reference metric SSIM, while not requiring ground truth references.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a method to reconstruct the world and multiple dynamic humans in 3D from a monocular video input. As a key idea, we represent both the world and multiple humans via the recently emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) representation, enabling to conveniently and efficiently compose and render them together. In particular, we address the scenarios with severely limited and sparse observations in 3D human reconstruction, a common challenge encountered in the real world. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel approach to optimize the 3D-GS representation in a canonical space by fusing the sparse cues in the common space, where we leverage a pre-trained 2D diffusion model to synthesize unseen views while keeping the consistency with the observed 2D appearances. We demonstrate our method can reconstruct high-quality animatable 3D humans in various challenging examples, in the presence of occlusion, image crops, few-shot, and extremely sparse observations. After reconstruction, our method is capable of not only rendering the scene in any novel views at arbitrary time instances, but also editing the 3D scene by removing individual humans or applying different motions for each human. Through various experiments, we demonstrate the quality and efficiency of our methods over alternative existing approaches.

- **Summary**: Generating Audio Description (AD) for movies is a challenging task that requires fine-grained visual understanding and an awareness of the characters and their names. Currently, visual language models for AD generation are limited by a lack of suitable training data, and also their evaluation is hampered by using performance measures not specialized to the AD domain. In this paper, we make three contributions: (i) We propose two approaches for constructing AD datasets with aligned video data, and build training and evaluation datasets using these. These datasets will be publicly released; (ii) We develop a Q-former-based architecture which ingests raw video and generates AD, using frozen pre-trained visual encoders and large language models; and (iii) We provide new evaluation metrics to benchmark AD quality that are well-matched to human performance. Taken together, we improve the state of the art on AD generation.
