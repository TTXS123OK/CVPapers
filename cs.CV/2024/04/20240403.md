- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Computer Assisted Diagnosis have shown promising performance in medical imaging tasks, particularly in chest X-ray analysis. However, the interaction between these models and radiologists has been primarily limited to input images. This work proposes a novel approach to enhance human-computer interaction in chest X-ray analysis using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enhanced with radiologists' attention by incorporating eye gaze data alongside textual prompts. Our approach leverages heatmaps generated from eye gaze data, overlaying them onto medical images to highlight areas of intense radiologist's focus during chest X-ray evaluation. We evaluate this methodology in tasks such as visual question answering, chest X-ray report automation, error detection, and differential diagnosis. Our results demonstrate the inclusion of eye gaze information significantly enhances the accuracy of chest X-ray analysis. Also, the impact of eye gaze on fine-tuning was confirmed as it outperformed other medical VLMs in all tasks except visual question answering. This work marks the potential of leveraging both the VLM's capabilities and the radiologist's domain knowledge to improve the capabilities of AI models in medical imaging, paving a novel way for Computer Assisted Diagnosis with a human-centred AI.

- **Summary**: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used for visual classification tasks, but their complex computation process and black-box nature hinder decision transparency and interpretability. Class activation maps (CAMs) and recent variants provide ways to visually explain the DNN decision-making process by displaying 'attention' heatmaps of the DNNs. Nevertheless, the CAM explanation only offers relative attention information, that is, on an attention heatmap, we can interpret which image region is more or less important than the others. However, these regions cannot be meaningfully compared across classes, and the contribution of each region to the model's class prediction is not revealed. To address these challenges that ultimately lead to better DNN Interpretation, in this paper, we propose CAPE, a novel reformulation of CAM that provides a unified and probabilistically meaningful assessment of the contributions of image regions. We quantitatively and qualitatively compare CAPE with state-of-the-art CAM methods on CUB and ImageNet benchmark datasets to demonstrate enhanced interpretability. We also test on a cytology imaging dataset depicting a challenging Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) diagnosis problem. Code is available at: https://github.com/AIML-MED/CAPE.

- **Summary**: The benefits of having digital twins of urban buildings are numerous. However, a major difficulty encountered in their creation from airborne LiDAR point clouds is the effective means of accurately reconstructing significant occlusions amidst point density variations and noise. To bridge the noise/sparsity/occlusion gap and generate high fidelity 3D building models, we propose APC2Mesh which integrates point completion into a 3D reconstruction pipeline, enabling the learning of dense geometrically accurate representation of buildings. Specifically, we leveraged complete points generated from occluded ones as input to a linearized skip attention-based deformation network for 3D mesh reconstruction. In our experiments, conducted on 3 different scenes, we demonstrate that: (1) APC2Mesh delivers comparatively superior results, indicating its efficacy in handling the challenges of occluded airborne building points of diverse styles and complexities. (2) The combination of point completion with typical deep learning-based 3D point cloud reconstruction methods offers a direct and effective solution for reconstructing significantly occluded airborne building points. As such, this neural integration holds promise for advancing the creation of digital twins for urban buildings with greater accuracy and fidelity.

- **Summary**: Recently, we have witnessed impressive achievements in cancer survival analysis by integrating multimodal data, e.g., pathology images and genomic profiles. However, the heterogeneity and high dimensionality of these modalities pose significant challenges for extracting discriminative representations while maintaining good generalization. In this paper, we propose a Cohort-individual Cooperative Learning (CCL) framework to advance cancer survival analysis by collaborating knowledge decomposition and cohort guidance. Specifically, first, we propose a Multimodal Knowledge Decomposition (MKD) module to explicitly decompose multimodal knowledge into four distinct components: redundancy, synergy and uniqueness of the two modalities. Such a comprehensive decomposition can enlighten the models to perceive easily overlooked yet important information, facilitating an effective multimodal fusion. Second, we propose a Cohort Guidance Modeling (CGM) to mitigate the risk of overfitting task-irrelevant information. It can promote a more comprehensive and robust understanding of the underlying multimodal data, while avoiding the pitfalls of overfitting and enhancing the generalization ability of the model. By cooperating the knowledge decomposition and cohort guidance methods, we develop a robust multimodal survival analysis model with enhanced discrimination and generalization abilities. Extensive experimental results on five cancer datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in integrating multimodal data for survival analysis.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have been popular for point cloud generation tasks. Existing works utilize the forward diffusion process to convert the original point distribution into a noise distribution and then learn the reverse diffusion process to recover the point distribution from the noise distribution. However, the reverse diffusion process can produce samples with non-smooth points on the surface because of the ignorance of the point cloud geometric properties. We propose alleviating the problem by incorporating the local smoothness constraint into the diffusion framework for point cloud generation. Experiments demonstrate the proposed model can generate realistic shapes and smoother point clouds, outperforming multiple state-of-the-art methods.



### TE-TAD: Towards Full End-to-End Temporal Action Detection via Time-Aligned Coordinate Expression

- **Summary**: In this paper, we investigate that the normalized coordinate expression is a key factor as reliance on hand-crafted components in query-based detectors for temporal action detection (TAD). Despite significant advancements towards an end-to-end framework in object detection, query-based detectors have been limited in achieving full end-to-end modeling in TAD. To address this issue, we propose \modelname{}, a full end-to-end temporal action detection transformer that integrates time-aligned coordinate expression. We reformulate coordinate expression utilizing actual timeline values, ensuring length-invariant representations from the extremely diverse video duration environment. Furthermore, our proposed adaptive query selection dynamically adjusts the number of queries based on video length, providing a suitable solution for varying video durations compared to a fixed query set. Our approach not only simplifies the TAD process by eliminating the need for hand-crafted components but also significantly improves the performance of query-based detectors. Our TE-TAD outperforms the previous query-based detectors and achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Most 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) based methods for urban scenes initialize 3D Gaussians directly with 3D LiDAR points, which not only underutilizes LiDAR data capabilities but also overlooks the potential advantages of fusing LiDAR with camera data. In this paper, we design a novel tightly coupled LiDAR-Camera Gaussian Splatting (TCLC-GS) to fully leverage the combined strengths of both LiDAR and camera sensors, enabling rapid, high-quality 3D reconstruction and novel view RGB/depth synthesis. TCLC-GS designs a hybrid explicit (colorized 3D mesh) and implicit (hierarchical octree feature) 3D representation derived from LiDAR-camera data, to enrich the properties of 3D Gaussians for splatting. 3D Gaussian's properties are not only initialized in alignment with the 3D mesh which provides more completed 3D shape and color information, but are also endowed with broader contextual information through retrieved octree implicit features. During the Gaussian Splatting optimization process, the 3D mesh offers dense depth information as supervision, which enhances the training process by learning of a robust geometry. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes Dataset validate our method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Utilizing a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 Ti, our method demonstrates fast training and achieves real-time RGB and depth rendering at 90 FPS in resolution of 1920x1280 (Waymo), and 120 FPS in resolution of 1600x900 (nuScenes) in urban scenarios.

- **Summary**: Vision-language (VL) models, pretrained on colossal image-text datasets, have attained broad VL competence that is difficult to evaluate. A common belief is that a small number of VL skills underlie the variety of VL tests. In this paper, we perform a large-scale transfer learning experiment aimed at discovering latent VL skills from data. We reveal interesting characteristics that have important implications for test suite design. First, generation tasks suffer from a length bias, suggesting benchmarks should balance tasks with varying output lengths. Second, we demonstrate that factor analysis successfully identifies reasonable yet surprising VL skill factors, suggesting benchmarks could leverage similar analyses for task selection. Finally, we present a new dataset, OLIVE (https://github.com/jq-zh/olive-dataset), which simulates user instructions in the wild and presents challenges dissimilar to all datasets we tested. Our findings contribute to the design of balanced and broad-coverage vision-language evaluation methods.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), integrating diverse information from multiple modalities, have shown remarkable success across various tasks. However, deploying VLMs, comprising large-scale vision and language models poses challenges in resource-constrained scenarios. While pruning followed by finetuning offers a potential solution to maintain performance with smaller model sizes, its application to VLMs remains relatively unexplored, presenting two main questions: how to distribute sparsity across different modality-specific models, and how to repair the performance of pruned sparse VLMs. To answer the first question, we conducted preliminary studies on VLM pruning and found that pruning vision models and language models with the same sparsity ratios contribute to nearly optimal performance. For the second question, unlike finetuning unimodal sparse models, sparse VLMs involve cross-modality interactions, requiring specialized techniques for post-pruning performance repair. Moreover, while parameter-efficient LoRA finetuning has been proposed to repair the performance of sparse models, a significant challenge of weights merging arises due to the incompatibility of dense LoRA modules with sparse models that destroy the sparsity of pruned models. To tackle these challenges, we propose to Repair Sparse Vision-Language Models via Sparse Cross-modality Adaptation (RESSA). RESSA utilizes cross-modality finetuning to enhance task-specific performance and facilitate knowledge distillation from original dense models. Additionally, we introduce SparseLoRA, which applies sparsity directly to LoRA weights, enabling seamless integration with sparse models. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of RESSA, showcasing significant enhancements, such as an 11.3\% improvement under 2:4 sparsity and a remarkable 47.6\% enhancement under unstructured 70\% sparsity.

- **Summary**: Breast cancer classification stands as a pivotal pillar in ensuring timely diagnosis and effective treatment. This study with histopathological images underscores the profound significance of harnessing the synergistic capabilities of colour space ensembling and quantum-classical stacking to elevate the precision of breast cancer classification. By delving into the distinct colour spaces of RGB, HSV and CIE L*u*v, the authors initiated a comprehensive investigation guided by advanced methodologies. Employing the DenseNet121 architecture for feature extraction the authors have capitalized on the robustness of Random Forest, SVM, QSVC, and VQC classifiers. This research encompasses a unique feature fusion technique within the colour space ensemble. This approach not only deepens our comprehension of breast cancer classification but also marks a milestone in personalized medical assessment. The amalgamation of quantum and classical classifiers through stacking emerges as a potent catalyst, effectively mitigating the inherent constraints of individual classifiers, paving a robust path towards more dependable and refined breast cancer identification. Through rigorous experimentation and meticulous analysis, fusion of colour spaces like RGB with HSV and RGB with CIE L*u*v, presents an classification accuracy, nearing the value of unity. This underscores the transformative potential of our approach, where the fusion of diverse colour spaces and the synergy of quantum and classical realms converge to establish a new horizon in medical diagnostics. Thus the implications of this research extend across medical disciplines, offering promising avenues for advancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images is a fundamental task in geoscience research. However, there are some significant shortcomings for the widely used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers. The former is limited by its insufficient long-range modeling capabilities, while the latter is hampered by its computational complexity. Recently, a novel visual state space (VSS) model represented by Mamba has emerged, capable of modeling long-range relationships with linear computability. In this work, we propose a novel dual-branch network named remote sensing images semantic segmentation Mamba (RS3Mamba) to incorporate this innovative technology into remote sensing tasks. Specifically, RS3Mamba utilizes VSS blocks to construct an auxiliary branch, providing additional global information to convolution-based main branch. Moreover, considering the distinct characteristics of the two branches, we introduce a collaborative completion module (CCM) to enhance and fuse features from the dual-encoder. Experimental results on two widely used datasets, ISPRS Vaihingen and LoveDA Urban, demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed RS3Mamba. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first vision Mamba specifically designed for remote sensing images semantic segmentation.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Image dehazing has been a popular topic of research for a long time. Previous deep learning-based image dehazing methods have failed to achieve satisfactory dehazing effects on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets, exhibiting poor generalization. Moreover, single-stage networks often result in many regions with artifacts and color distortion in output images. To address these issues, this paper proposes a two-stage image dehazing network called TSNet, mainly consisting of the multi-scale fusion module (MSFM) and the adaptive learning module (ALM). Specifically, MSFM and ALM enhance the generalization of TSNet. The MSFM can obtain large receptive fields at multiple scales and integrate features at different frequencies to reduce the differences between inputs and learning objectives. The ALM can actively learn of regions of interest in images and restore texture details more effectively. Additionally, TSNet is designed as a two-stage network, where the first-stage network performs image dehazing, and the second-stage network is employed to improve issues such as artifacts and color distortion present in the results of the first-stage network. We also change the learning objective from ground truth images to opposite fog maps, which improves the learning efficiency of TSNet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSNet exhibits superior dehazing performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning shows promise in harnessing extensive unlabeled data, but it also confronts significant privacy concerns, especially in vision. In this paper, we aim to perform membership inference on visual self-supervised models in a more realistic setting: self-supervised training method and details are unknown for an adversary when attacking as he usually faces a black-box system in practice. In this setting, considering that self-supervised model could be trained by completely different self-supervised paradigms, e.g., masked image modeling and contrastive learning, with complex training details, we propose a unified membership inference method called PartCrop. It is motivated by the shared part-aware capability among models and stronger part response on the training data. Specifically, PartCrop crops parts of objects in an image to query responses with the image in representation space. We conduct extensive attacks on self-supervised models with different training protocols and structures using three widely used image datasets. The results verify the effectiveness and generalization of PartCrop. Moreover, to defend against PartCrop, we evaluate two common approaches, i.e., early stop and differential privacy, and propose a tailored method called shrinking crop scale range. The defense experiments indicate that all of them are effective. Our code is available at https://github.com/JiePKU/PartCrop

- **Summary**: Individuals with visual impairments, encompassing both partial and total difficulties in visual perception, are referred to as visually impaired (VI) people. An estimated 2.2 billion individuals worldwide are affected by visual impairments. Recent advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have showcased their extraordinary capabilities across various domains. It is desirable to help VI individuals with MLLMs' great capabilities of visual understanding and reasoning. However, it is challenging for VI people to use MLLMs due to the difficulties in capturing the desirable images to fulfill their daily requests. For example, the target object is not fully or partially placed in the image. This paper explores how to leverage MLLMs for VI individuals to provide visual-question answers. VIAssist can identify undesired images and provide detailed actions. Finally, VIAssist can provide reliable answers to users' queries based on the images. Our results show that VIAssist provides +0.21 and +0.31 higher BERTScore and ROUGE scores than the baseline, respectively.

- **Summary**: This paper enables high-fidelity, transferable NeRF editing by frequency decomposition. Recent NeRF editing pipelines lift 2D stylization results to 3D scenes while suffering from blurry results, and fail to capture detailed structures caused by the inconsistency between 2D editings. Our critical insight is that low-frequency components of images are more multiview-consistent after editing compared with their high-frequency parts. Moreover, the appearance style is mainly exhibited on the low-frequency components, and the content details especially reside in high-frequency parts. This motivates us to perform editing on low-frequency components, which results in high-fidelity edited scenes. In addition, the editing is performed in the low-frequency feature space, enabling stable intensity control and novel scene transfer. Comprehensive experiments conducted on photorealistic datasets demonstrate the superior performance of high-fidelity and transferable NeRF editing.

- **Summary**: Three-dimensional perception from multi-view cameras is a crucial component in autonomous driving systems, which involves multiple tasks like 3D object detection and bird's-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation. To improve perception precision, large image encoders, high-resolution images, and long-term temporal inputs have been adopted in recent 3D perception models, bringing remarkable performance gains. However, these techniques are often incompatible in training and inference scenarios due to computational resource constraints. Besides, modern autonomous driving systems prefer to adopt an end-to-end framework for multi-task 3D perception, which can simplify the overall system architecture and reduce the implementation complexity. However, conflict between tasks often arises when optimizing multiple tasks jointly within an end-to-end 3D perception model. To alleviate these issues, we present an end-to-end framework named HENet for multi-task 3D perception in this paper. Specifically, we propose a hybrid image encoding network, using a large image encoder for short-term frames and a small image encoder for long-term temporal frames. Then, we introduce a temporal feature integration module based on the attention mechanism to fuse the features of different frames extracted by the two aforementioned hybrid image encoders. Finally, according to the characteristics of each perception task, we utilize BEV features of different grid sizes, independent BEV encoders, and task decoders for different tasks. Experimental results show that HENet achieves state-of-the-art end-to-end multi-task 3D perception results on the nuScenes benchmark, including 3D object detection and BEV semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: We introduce the CPAISD: Core-Penumbra Acute Ischemic Stroke Dataset, aimed at enhancing the early detection and segmentation of ischemic stroke using Non-Contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) scans. Addressing the challenges in diagnosing acute ischemic stroke during its early stages due to often non-revealing native CT findings, the dataset provides a collection of segmented NCCT images. These include annotations of ischemic core and penumbra regions, critical for developing machine learning models for rapid stroke identification and assessment. By offering a carefully collected and annotated dataset, we aim to facilitate the development of advanced diagnostic tools, contributing to improved patient care and outcomes in stroke management. Our dataset's uniqueness lies in its focus on the acute phase of ischemic stroke, with non-informative native CT scans, and includes a baseline model to demonstrate the dataset's application, encouraging further research and innovation in the field of medical imaging and stroke diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Visual affordance learning is a key component for robots to understand how to interact with objects. Conventional approaches in this field rely on pre-defined objects and actions, falling short of capturing diverse interactions in realworld scenarios. The key idea of our approach is employing textual instruction, targeting various affordances for a wide range of objects. This approach covers both hand-object and tool-object interactions. We introduce text-driven affordance learning, aiming to learn contact points and manipulation trajectories from an egocentric view following textual instruction. In our task, contact points are represented as heatmaps, and the manipulation trajectory as sequences of coordinates that incorporate both linear and rotational movements for various manipulations. However, when we gather data for this task, manual annotations of these diverse interactions are costly. To this end, we propose a pseudo dataset creation pipeline and build a large pseudo-training dataset: TextAFF80K, consisting of over 80K instances of the contact points, trajectories, images, and text tuples. We extend existing referring expression comprehension models for our task, and experimental results show that our approach robustly handles multiple affordances, serving as a new standard for affordance learning in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Learning to build 3D scene graphs is essential for real-world perception in a structured and rich fashion. However, previous 3D scene graph generation methods utilize a fully supervised learning manner and require a large amount of entity-level annotation data of objects and relations, which is extremely resource-consuming and tedious to obtain. To tackle this problem, we propose 3D-VLAP, a weakly-supervised 3D scene graph generation method via Visual-Linguistic Assisted Pseudo-labeling. Specifically, our 3D-VLAP exploits the superior ability of current large-scale visual-linguistic models to align the semantics between texts and 2D images, as well as the naturally existing correspondences between 2D images and 3D point clouds, and thus implicitly constructs correspondences between texts and 3D point clouds. First, we establish the positional correspondence from 3D point clouds to 2D images via camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, thereby achieving alignment of 3D point clouds and 2D images. Subsequently, a large-scale cross-modal visual-linguistic model is employed to indirectly align 3D instances with the textual category labels of objects by matching 2D images with object category labels. The pseudo labels for objects and relations are then produced for 3D-VLAP model training by calculating the similarity between visual embeddings and textual category embeddings of objects and relations encoded by the visual-linguistic model, respectively. Ultimately, we design an edge self-attention based graph neural network to generate scene graphs of 3D point cloud scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 3D-VLAP achieves comparable results with current advanced fully supervised methods, meanwhile significantly alleviating the pressure of data annotation.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models are gaining wide popularity, especially in public domains. However, their intrinsic bias and potential malicious manipulations remain under-explored. Charting the susceptibility of T2I models to such manipulation, we first expose the new possibility of a dynamic and computationally efficient exploitation of model bias by targeting the embedded language models. By leveraging mathematical foundations of vector algebra, our technique enables a scalable and convenient control over the severity of output manipulation through model bias. As a by-product, this control also allows a form of precise prompt engineering to generate images which are generally implausible with regular text prompts. We also demonstrate a constructive application of our manipulation for balancing the frequency of generated classes - as in model debiasing. Our technique does not require training and is also framed as a backdoor attack with severity control using semantically-null text triggers in the prompts. With extensive analysis, we present interesting qualitative and quantitative results to expose potential manipulation possibilities for T2I models.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Existing head pose estimation datasets are either composed of numerous samples by non-realistic synthesis or lab collection, or limited images by labor-intensive annotating. This makes deep supervised learning based solutions compromised due to the reliance on generous labeled data. To alleviate it, we propose the first semi-supervised unconstrained head pose estimation (SemiUHPE) method, which can leverage a large amount of unlabeled wild head images. Specifically, we follow the recent semi-supervised rotation regression, and focus on the diverse and complex head pose domain. Firstly, we claim that the aspect-ratio invariant cropping of heads is superior to the previous landmark-based affine alignment, which does not fit unlabeled natural heads or practical applications where landmarks are often unavailable. Then, instead of using an empirically fixed threshold to filter out pseudo labels, we propose the dynamic entropy-based filtering by updating thresholds for adaptively removing unlabeled outliers. Moreover, we revisit the design of weak-strong augmentations, and further exploit its superiority by devising two novel head-oriented strong augmentations named pose-irrelevant cut-occlusion and pose-altering rotation consistency. Extensive experiments show that SemiUHPE can surpass SOTAs with remarkable improvements on public benchmarks under both front-range and full-range.

- **Summary**: Advances in Artificial Intelligence are challenged by the biases rooted in the datasets used to train the models. In image geolocation estimation, models are mostly trained using data from specific geographic regions, notably the Western world, and as a result, they may struggle to comprehend the complexities of underrepresented regions. To assess this issue, we apply a state-of-the-art image geolocation estimation model (ISNs) to a crowd-sourced dataset of geolocated images from the African continent (SCA100), and then explore the regional and socioeconomic biases underlying the model's predictions. Our findings show that the ISNs model tends to over-predict image locations in high-income countries of the Western world, which is consistent with the geographic distribution of its training data, i.e., the IM2GPS3k dataset. Accordingly, when compared to the IM2GPS3k benchmark, the accuracy of the ISNs model notably decreases at all scales. Additionally, we cluster images of the SCA100 dataset based on how accurately they are predicted by the ISNs model and show the model's difficulties in correctly predicting the locations of images in low income regions, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, our results suggest that using IM2GPS3k as a training set and benchmark for image geolocation estimation and other computer vision models overlooks its potential application in the African context.

- **Summary**: Achieving high-performance in multi-object tracking algorithms heavily relies on modeling spatio-temporal relationships during the data association stage. Mainstream approaches encompass rule-based and deep learning-based methods for spatio-temporal relationship modeling. While the former relies on physical motion laws, offering wider applicability but yielding suboptimal results for complex object movements, the latter, though achieving high-performance, lacks interpretability and involves complex module designs. This work aims to simplify deep learning-based spatio-temporal relationship models and introduce interpretability into features for data association. Specifically, a lightweight single-layer transformer encoder is utilized to model spatio-temporal relationships. To make features more interpretative, two contrastive regularization losses based on representation alignment are proposed, derived from spatio-temporal consistency rules. By applying weighted summation to affinity matrices, the aligned features can seamlessly integrate into the data association stage of the original tracking workflow. Experimental results showcase that our model enhances the majority of existing tracking networks' performance without excessive complexity, with minimal increase in training overhead and nearly negligible computational and storage costs.

- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising yet challenging model compression technique that transfers rich learning representations from a well-performing but cumbersome teacher model to a compact student model. Previous methods for image super-resolution (SR) mostly compare the feature maps directly or after standardizing the dimensions with basic algebraic operations (e.g. average, dot-product). However, the intrinsic semantic differences among feature maps are overlooked, which are caused by the disparate expressive capacity between the networks. This work presents MiPKD, a multi-granularity mixture of prior KD framework, to facilitate efficient SR model through the feature mixture in a unified latent space and stochastic network block mixture. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MiPKD method.

- **Summary**: Optimizing deep learning models requires large amounts of annotated images, a process that is both time-intensive and costly. Especially for semantic segmentation models in which every pixel must be annotated. A potential strategy to mitigate annotation effort is active learning. Active learning facilitates the identification and selection of the most informative images from a large unlabelled pool. The underlying premise is that these selected images can improve the model's performance faster than random selection to reduce annotation effort. While active learning has demonstrated promising results on benchmark datasets like Cityscapes, its performance in the agricultural domain remains largely unexplored. This study addresses this research gap by conducting a comparative study of three active learning-based acquisition functions: Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD), stochastic-based BALD (PowerBALD), and Random. The acquisition functions were tested on two agricultural datasets: Sugarbeet and Corn-Weed, both containing three semantic classes: background, crop and weed. Our results indicated that active learning, especially PowerBALD, yields a higher performance than Random sampling on both datasets. But due to the relatively large standard deviations, the differences observed were minimal; this was partly caused by high image redundancy and imbalanced classes. Specifically, more than 89\% of the pixels belonged to the background class on both datasets. The absence of significant results on both datasets indicates that further research is required for applying active learning on agricultural datasets, especially if they contain a high-class imbalance and redundant images. Recommendations and insights are provided in this paper to potentially resolve such issues.

- **Summary**: Foundation segmentation models, while powerful, pose a significant risk: they enable users to effortlessly extract any objects from any digital content with a single click, potentially leading to copyright infringement or malicious misuse. To mitigate this risk, we introduce a new task "Anything Unsegmentable" to grant any image "the right to be unsegmented". The ambitious pursuit of the task is to achieve highly transferable adversarial attacks against all prompt-based segmentation models, regardless of model parameterizations and prompts. We highlight the non-transferable and heterogeneous nature of prompt-specific adversarial noises. Our approach focuses on disrupting image encoder features to achieve prompt-agnostic attacks. Intriguingly, targeted feature attacks exhibit better transferability compared to untargeted ones, suggesting the optimal update direction aligns with the image manifold. Based on the observations, we design a novel attack named Unsegment Anything by Simulating Deformation (UAD). Our attack optimizes a differentiable deformation function to create a target deformed image, which alters structural information while preserving achievable feature distance by adversarial example. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our approach, compromising a variety of promptable segmentation models with different architectures and prompt interfaces. We release the code at https://github.com/jiahaolu97/anything-unsegmentable.

- **Summary**: Vestibular schwannomas (VS) are benign tumors that are generally managed by active surveillance with MRI examination. To further assist clinical decision-making and avoid overtreatment, an accurate prediction of tumor growth based on longitudinal imaging is highly desirable. In this paper, we introduce DeepGrowth, a deep learning method that incorporates neural fields and recurrent neural networks for prospective tumor growth prediction. In the proposed method, each tumor is represented as a signed distance function (SDF) conditioned on a low-dimensional latent code. Unlike previous studies that perform tumor shape prediction directly in the image space, we predict the latent codes instead and then reconstruct future shapes from it. To deal with irregular time intervals, we introduce a time-conditioned recurrent module based on a ConvLSTM and a novel temporal encoding strategy, which enables the proposed model to output varying tumor shapes over time. The experiments on an in-house longitudinal VS dataset showed that the proposed model significantly improved the performance ($\ge 1.6\%$ Dice score and $\ge0.20$ mm 95\% Hausdorff distance), in particular for top 20\% tumors that grow or shrink the most ($\ge 4.6\%$ Dice score and $\ge 0.73$ mm 95\% Hausdorff distance).

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) give rise to learning-based 3D reconstruction methods widely used in industrial applications. Although prevalent methods achieve considerable improvements in small-scale scenes, accomplishing reconstruction in complex and large-scale scenes is still challenging. First, the background in complex scenes shows a large variance among different views. Second, the current inference pattern, $i.e.$, a pixel only relies on an individual camera ray, fails to capture contextual information. To solve these problems, we propose to enlarge the ray perception field and build up the sample points interactions. In this paper, we design a novel inference pattern that encourages a single camera ray possessing more contextual information, and models the relationship among sample points on each camera ray. To hold contextual information,a camera ray in our proposed method can render a patch of pixels simultaneously. Moreover, we replace the MLP in neural radiance field models with distance-aware convolutions to enhance the feature propagation among sample points from the same camera ray. To summarize, as a torchlight, a ray in our proposed method achieves rendering a patch of image. Thus, we call the proposed method, Torch-NeRF. Extensive experiments on KITTI-360 and LLFF show that the Torch-NeRF exhibits excellent performance.

- **Summary**: We present DiffExplainer, a novel framework that, leveraging language-vision models, enables multimodal global explainability. DiffExplainer employs diffusion models conditioned on optimized text prompts, synthesizing images that maximize class outputs and hidden features of a classifier, thus providing a visual tool for explaining decisions. Moreover, the analysis of generated visual descriptions allows for automatic identification of biases and spurious features, as opposed to traditional methods that often rely on manual intervention. The cross-modal transferability of language-vision models also enables the possibility to describe decisions in a more human-interpretable way, i.e., through text. We conduct comprehensive experiments, which include an extensive user study, demonstrating the effectiveness of DiffExplainer on 1) the generation of high-quality images explaining model decisions, surpassing existing activation maximization methods, and 2) the automated identification of biases and spurious features.

- **Summary**: Skeleton-based gesture recognition methods have achieved high success using Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). In addition, context-dependent adaptive topology as a neighborhood vertex information and attention mechanism leverages a model to better represent actions. In this paper, we propose self-attention GCN hybrid model, Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal self-attention (MSST)-GCN to effectively improve modeling ability to achieve state-of-the-art results on several datasets. We utilize spatial self-attention module with adaptive topology to understand intra-frame interactions within a frame among different body parts, and temporal self-attention module to examine correlations between frames of a node. These two are followed by multi-scale convolution network with dilations, which not only captures the long-range temporal dependencies of joints but also the long-range spatial dependencies (i.e., long-distance dependencies) of node temporal behaviors. They are combined into high-level spatial-temporal representations and output the predicted action with the softmax classifier.

- **Summary**: 3D stylization, which entails the application of specific styles to three-dimensional objects, holds significant commercial potential as it enables the creation of diverse 3D objects with distinct moods and styles, tailored to specific demands of different scenes. With recent advancements in text-driven methods and artificial intelligence, the stylization process is increasingly intuitive and automated, thereby diminishing the reliance on manual labor and expertise. However, existing methods have predominantly focused on holistic stylization, thereby leaving the application of styles to individual components of a 3D object unexplored. In response, we introduce 3DStyleGLIP, a novel framework specifically designed for text-driven, part-tailored 3D stylization. Given a 3D mesh and a text prompt, 3DStyleGLIP leverages the vision-language embedding space of the Grounded Language-Image Pre-training (GLIP) model to localize the individual parts of the 3D mesh and modify their colors and local geometries to align them with the desired styles specified in the text prompt. 3DStyleGLIP is effectively trained for 3D stylization tasks through a part-level style loss working in GLIP's embedding space, supplemented by two complementary learning techniques. Extensive experimental validation confirms that our method achieves significant part-wise stylization capabilities, demonstrating promising potential in advancing the field of 3D stylization.

- **Summary**: This paper aims at achieving fine-grained building attribute segmentation in a cross-view scenario, i.e., using satellite and street-view image pairs. The main challenge lies in overcoming the significant perspective differences between street views and satellite views. In this work, we introduce SG-BEV, a novel approach for satellite-guided BEV fusion for cross-view semantic segmentation. To overcome the limitations of existing cross-view projection methods in capturing the complete building facade features, we innovatively incorporate Bird's Eye View (BEV) method to establish a spatially explicit mapping of street-view features. Moreover, we fully leverage the advantages of multiple perspectives by introducing a novel satellite-guided reprojection module, optimizing the uneven feature distribution issues associated with traditional BEV methods. Our method demonstrates significant improvements on four cross-view datasets collected from multiple cities, including New York, San Francisco, and Boston. On average across these datasets, our method achieves an increase in mIOU by 10.13% and 5.21% compared with the state-of-the-art satellite-based and cross-view methods. The code and datasets of this work will be released at https://github.com/yejy53/SG-BEV.

- **Summary**: Unlike typical visual scene recognition domains, in which massive datasets are accessible to deep neural networks, medical image interpretations are often obstructed by the paucity of data. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of data-based few-shot learning in medical imaging by exploring different data attribute representations in a low-dimensional space. We introduce different types of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) in few-shot learning, addressing the data scarcity issue in medical image classification. Extensive empirical studies are conducted in terms of validating the effectiveness of NMF, especially its supervised variants (e.g., discriminative NMF, and supervised and constrained NMF with sparseness), and the comparison with principal component analysis (PCA), i.e., the collaborative representation-based dimensionality reduction technique derived from eigenvectors. With 14 different datasets covering 11 distinct illness categories, thorough experimental results and comparison with related techniques demonstrate that NMF is a competitive alternative to PCA for few-shot learning in medical imaging, and the supervised NMF algorithms are more discriminative in the subspace with greater effectiveness. Furthermore, we show that the part-based representation of NMF, especially its supervised variants, is dramatically impactful in detecting lesion areas in medical imaging with limited samples.

- **Summary**: The conservation of tropical forests is a topic of significant social and ecological relevance due to their crucial role in the global ecosystem. Unfortunately, deforestation and degradation impact millions of hectares annually, necessitating government or private initiatives for effective forest monitoring. This study introduces a novel framework that employs the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA) to select spectral bands from Landsat-8 satellite, optimizing the representation of deforested areas. This selection guides a semantic segmentation architecture, DeepLabv3+, enhancing its performance. Experimental results revealed several band compositions that achieved superior balanced accuracy compared to commonly adopted combinations for deforestation detection, utilizing segment classification via a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Moreover, the optimal band compositions identified by the UMDA-based approach improved the performance of the DeepLabv3+ architecture, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches compared in this study. The observation that a few selected bands outperform the total contradicts the data-driven paradigm prevalent in the deep learning field. Therefore, this suggests an exception to the conventional wisdom that 'more is always better'.

- **Summary**: The spatial resolution of remote sensing images is becoming increasingly higher, posing challenges in handling large very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images for dense prediction tasks. Models based on convolutional neural networks are limited in their ability to model global features of remote sensing images due to local convolution operations. Transformer based models, despite their global modeling capabilities, face computational challenges with large VHR images due to their quadratic complexity. The common practice of cropping large images into smaller patches leads to a significant loss of contextual information. To address these issues, we propose the Remote Sensing Mamba (RSM) for dense prediction tasks in VHR remote sensing. RSM is designed to model global features of remote sensing images with linear complexity, enabling it to process large VHR images effectively. It employs an omnidirectional selective scan module to globally model the images in multiple directions, capturing large spatial features from various directions. Experiments on semantic segmentation and change detection tasks across various objects demonstrate the effectiveness of RSM. With simple model architecture and training approach, RSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the dense prediction tasks of VHR remote sensing.

- **Summary**: Semantic correspondence remains a challenging task for establishing correspondences between a pair of images with the same category or similar scenes due to the large intra-class appearance. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem called 'Small Object Semantic Correspondence (SOSC).' This problem is challenging due to the close proximity of keypoints associated with small objects, which results in the fusion of these respective features. It is difficult to identify the corresponding key points of the fused features, and it is also difficult to be recognized. To address this challenge, we propose the Keypoint Bounding box-centered Cropping (KBC) method, which aims to increase the spatial separation between keypoints of small objects, thereby facilitating independent learning of these keypoints. The KBC method is seamlessly integrated into our proposed inference pipeline and can be easily incorporated into other methodologies, resulting in significant performance enhancements. Additionally, we introduce a novel framework, named KBCNet, which serves as our baseline model. KBCNet comprises a Cross-Scale Feature Alignment (CSFA) module and an efficient 4D convolutional decoder. The CSFA module is designed to align multi-scale features, enriching keypoint representations by integrating fine-grained features and deep semantic features. Meanwhile, the 4D convolutional decoder, based on efficient 4D convolution, ensures efficiency and rapid convergence. To empirically validate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology, extensive experiments are conducted on three widely used benchmarks: PF-PASCAL, PF-WILLOW, and SPair-71k. Our KBC method demonstrates a substantial performance improvement of 7.5\% on the SPair-71K dataset, providing compelling evidence of its efficacy.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there has been a significant shift in the field of digital avatar research, towards modeling, animating and reconstructing clothed human representations, as a key step towards creating realistic avatars. However, current 3D cloth generation methods are garment specific or trained completely on synthetic data, hence lacking fine details and realism. In this work, we make a step towards automatic realistic garment design and propose Design2Cloth, a high fidelity 3D generative model trained on a real world dataset from more than 2000 subject scans. To provide vital contribution to the fashion industry, we developed a user-friendly adversarial model capable of generating diverse and detailed clothes simply by drawing a 2D cloth mask. Under a series of both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we showcase that Design2Cloth outperforms current state-of-the-art cloth generative models by a large margin. In addition to the generative properties of our network, we showcase that the proposed method can be used to achieve high quality reconstructions from single in-the-wild images and 3D scans. Dataset, code and pre-trained model will become publicly available.

- **Summary**: Recent progress in visual generative models enables the generation of high-quality images. To prevent the misuse of generated images, it is important to identify the origin model that generates them. In this work, we study the origin attribution of generated images in a practical setting where only a few images generated by a source model are available and the source model cannot be accessed. The goal is to check if a given image is generated by the source model. We first formulate this problem as a few-shot one-class classification task. To solve the task, we propose OCC-CLIP, a CLIP-based framework for few-shot one-class classification, enabling the identification of an image's source model, even among multiple candidates. Extensive experiments corresponding to various generative models verify the effectiveness of our OCC-CLIP framework. Furthermore, an experiment based on the recently released DALL-E 3 API verifies the real-world applicability of our solution.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the emergence of models capable of generating images from text has attracted considerable interest, offering the possibility of creating realistic images from text descriptions. Yet these advances have also raised concerns about the potential misuse of these images, including the creation of misleading content such as fake news and propaganda. This study investigates the effectiveness of using advanced vision-language models (VLMs) for synthetic image identification. Specifically, the focus is on tuning state-of-the-art image captioning models for synthetic image detection. By harnessing the robust understanding capabilities of large VLMs, the aim is to distinguish authentic images from synthetic images produced by diffusion-based models. This study contributes to the advancement of synthetic image detection by exploiting the capabilities of visual language models such as BLIP-2 and ViTGPT2. By tailoring image captioning models, we address the challenges associated with the potential misuse of synthetic images in real-world applications. Results described in this paper highlight the promising role of VLMs in the field of synthetic image detection, outperforming conventional image-based detection techniques.

- **Summary**: Recent research has highlighted improvements in high-quality imaging guided by event cameras, with most of these efforts concentrating on the RGB domain. However, these advancements frequently neglect the unique challenges introduced by the inherent flaws in the sensor design of event cameras in the RAW domain. Specifically, this sensor design results in the partial loss of pixel values, posing new challenges for RAW domain processes like demosaicing. The challenge intensifies as most research in the RAW domain is based on the premise that each pixel contains a value, making the straightforward adaptation of these methods to event camera demosaicing problematic. To end this, we present a Swin-Transformer-based backbone and a pixel-focus loss function for demosaicing with missing pixel values in RAW domain processing. Our core motivation is to refine a general and widely applicable foundational model from the RGB domain for RAW domain processing, thereby broadening the model's applicability within the entire imaging process. Our method harnesses multi-scale processing and space-to-depth techniques to ensure efficiency and reduce computing complexity. We also proposed the Pixel-focus Loss function for network fine-tuning to improve network convergence based on our discovery of a long-tailed distribution in training loss. Our method has undergone validation on the MIPI Demosaic Challenge dataset, with subsequent analytical experimentation confirming its efficacy.

- **Summary**: Tuning-free diffusion-based models have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of image personalization and customization. However, despite this notable progress, current models continue to grapple with several complex challenges in producing style-consistent image generation. Firstly, the concept of style is inherently underdetermined, encompassing a multitude of elements such as color, material, atmosphere, design, and structure, among others. Secondly, inversion-based methods are prone to style degradation, often resulting in the loss of fine-grained details. Lastly, adapter-based approaches frequently require meticulous weight tuning for each reference image to achieve a balance between style intensity and text controllability. In this paper, we commence by examining several compelling yet frequently overlooked observations. We then proceed to introduce InstantStyle, a framework designed to address these issues through the implementation of two key strategies: 1) A straightforward mechanism that decouples style and content from reference images within the feature space, predicated on the assumption that features within the same space can be either added to or subtracted from one another. 2) The injection of reference image features exclusively into style-specific blocks, thereby preventing style leaks and eschewing the need for cumbersome weight tuning, which often characterizes more parameter-heavy designs.Our work demonstrates superior visual stylization outcomes, striking an optimal balance between the intensity of style and the controllability of textual elements. Our codes will be available at https://github.com/InstantStyle/InstantStyle.

- **Summary**: The joint utilization of diverse data sources for medical imaging segmentation has emerged as a crucial area of research, aiming to address challenges such as data heterogeneity, domain shift, and data quality discrepancies. Integrating information from multiple data domains has shown promise in improving model generalizability and adaptability. However, this approach often demands substantial computational resources, hindering its practicality. In response, knowledge distillation (KD) has garnered attention as a solution. KD involves training light-weight models to emulate the behavior of more resource-intensive models, thereby mitigating the computational burden while maintaining performance. This paper addresses the pressing need to develop a lightweight and generalizable model for medical imaging segmentation that can effectively handle data integration challenges. Our proposed approach introduces a novel relation-based knowledge framework by seamlessly combining adaptive affinity-based and kernel-based distillation through a gram matrix that can capture the style representation across features. This methodology empowers the student model to accurately replicate the feature representations of the teacher model, facilitating robust performance even in the face of domain shift and data heterogeneity. To validate our innovative approach, we conducted experiments on publicly available multi-source prostate MRI data. The results demonstrate a significant enhancement in segmentation performance using lightweight networks. Notably, our method achieves this improvement while reducing both inference time and storage usage, rendering it a practical and efficient solution for real-time medical imaging segmentation.

- **Summary**: Although neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have achieved triumphs in image novel view synthesis (NVS), LiDAR NVS remains largely unexplored. Previous LiDAR NVS methods employ a simple shift from image NVS methods while ignoring the dynamic nature and the large-scale reconstruction problem of LiDAR point clouds. In light of this, we propose LiDAR4D, a differentiable LiDAR-only framework for novel space-time LiDAR view synthesis. In consideration of the sparsity and large-scale characteristics, we design a 4D hybrid representation combined with multi-planar and grid features to achieve effective reconstruction in a coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore, we introduce geometric constraints derived from point clouds to improve temporal consistency. For the realistic synthesis of LiDAR point clouds, we incorporate the global optimization of ray-drop probability to preserve cross-region patterns. Extensive experiments on KITTI-360 and NuScenes datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in accomplishing geometry-aware and time-consistent dynamic reconstruction. Codes are available at https://github.com/ispc-lab/LiDAR4D.

- **Summary**: This study explores the role of cross-attention during inference in text-conditional diffusion models. We find that cross-attention outputs converge to a fixed point after few inference steps. Accordingly, the time point of convergence naturally divides the entire inference process into two stages: an initial semantics-planning stage, during which, the model relies on cross-attention to plan text-oriented visual semantics, and a subsequent fidelity-improving stage, during which the model tries to generate images from previously planned semantics. Surprisingly, ignoring text conditions in the fidelity-improving stage not only reduces computation complexity, but also maintains model performance. This yields a simple and training-free method called TGATE for efficient generation, which caches the cross-attention output once it converges and keeps it fixed during the remaining inference steps. Our empirical study on the MS-COCO validation set confirms its effectiveness. The source code of TGATE is available at https://github.com/HaozheLiu-ST/T-GATE.

- **Summary**: We present Dive Into the BoundarieS (DIBS), a novel pretraining framework for dense video captioning (DVC), that elaborates on improving the quality of the generated event captions and their associated pseudo event boundaries from unlabeled videos. By leveraging the capabilities of diverse large language models (LLMs), we generate rich DVC-oriented caption candidates and optimize the corresponding pseudo boundaries under several meticulously designed objectives, considering diversity, event-centricity, temporal ordering, and coherence. Moreover, we further introduce a novel online boundary refinement strategy that iteratively improves the quality of pseudo boundaries during training. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to examine the effectiveness of the proposed technique components. By leveraging a substantial amount of unlabeled video data, such as HowTo100M, we achieve a remarkable advancement on standard DVC datasets like YouCook2 and ActivityNet. We outperform the previous state-of-the-art Vid2Seq across a majority of metrics, achieving this with just 0.4% of the unlabeled video data used for pre-training by Vid2Seq.

- **Summary**: Implicit Neural Representations have gained prominence as a powerful framework for capturing complex data modalities, encompassing a wide range from 3D shapes to images and audio. Within the realm of 3D shape representation, Neural Signed Distance Functions (SDF) have demonstrated remarkable potential in faithfully encoding intricate shape geometry. However, learning SDFs from 3D point clouds in the absence of ground truth supervision remains a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose a method to infer occupancy fields instead of SDFs as they are easier to learn from sparse inputs. We leverage a margin-based uncertainty measure to differentially sample from the decision boundary of the occupancy function and supervise the sampled boundary points using the input point cloud. We further stabilize the optimization process at the early stages of the training by biasing the occupancy function towards minimal entropy fields while maximizing its entropy at the input point cloud. Through extensive experiments and evaluations, we illustrate the efficacy of our proposed method, highlighting its capacity to improve implicit shape inference with respect to baselines and the state-of-the-art using synthetic and real data.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence but often lack performance when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) data, a common scenario due to the inevitable domain shifts in real-world applications. This limitation stems from the common assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution-an assumption frequently violated in practice. Despite their effectiveness with large amounts of data and computational power, DNNs struggle with distributional shifts and limited labeled data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization across various tasks and domains. Meta-learning presents a promising approach by employing algorithms that acquire transferable knowledge across various tasks for fast adaptation, eliminating the need to learn each task from scratch. This survey paper delves into the realm of meta-learning with a focus on its contribution to domain generalization. We first clarify the concept of meta-learning for domain generalization and introduce a novel taxonomy based on the feature extraction strategy and the classifier learning methodology, offering a granular view of methodologies. Through an exhaustive review of existing methods and underlying theories, we map out the fundamentals of the field. Our survey provides practical insights and an informed discussion on promising research directions, paving the way for future innovation in meta-learning for domain generalization.

- **Summary**: We present GenN2N, a unified NeRF-to-NeRF translation framework for various NeRF translation tasks such as text-driven NeRF editing, colorization, super-resolution, inpainting, etc. Unlike previous methods designed for individual translation tasks with task-specific schemes, GenN2N achieves all these NeRF editing tasks by employing a plug-and-play image-to-image translator to perform editing in the 2D domain and lifting 2D edits into the 3D NeRF space. Since the 3D consistency of 2D edits may not be assured, we propose to model the distribution of the underlying 3D edits through a generative model that can cover all possible edited NeRFs. To model the distribution of 3D edited NeRFs from 2D edited images, we carefully design a VAE-GAN that encodes images while decoding NeRFs. The latent space is trained to align with a Gaussian distribution and the NeRFs are supervised through an adversarial loss on its renderings. To ensure the latent code does not depend on 2D viewpoints but truly reflects the 3D edits, we also regularize the latent code through a contrastive learning scheme. Extensive experiments on various editing tasks show GenN2N, as a universal framework, performs as well or better than task-specific specialists while possessing flexible generative power.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image generation has achieved astonishing results, yet precise spatial controllability and prompt fidelity remain highly challenging. This limitation is typically addressed through cumbersome prompt engineering, scene layout conditioning, or image editing techniques which often require hand drawn masks. Nonetheless, pre-existing works struggle to take advantage of the natural instance-level compositionality of scenes due to the typically flat nature of rasterized RGB output images. Towards adressing this challenge, we introduce MuLAn: a novel dataset comprising over 44K MUlti-Layer ANnotations of RGB images as multilayer, instance-wise RGBA decompositions, and over 100K instance images. To build MuLAn, we developed a training free pipeline which decomposes a monocular RGB image into a stack of RGBA layers comprising of background and isolated instances. We achieve this through the use of pretrained general-purpose models, and by developing three modules: image decomposition for instance discovery and extraction, instance completion to reconstruct occluded areas, and image re-assembly. We use our pipeline to create MuLAn-COCO and MuLAn-LAION datasets, which contain a variety of image decompositions in terms of style, composition and complexity. With MuLAn, we provide the first photorealistic resource providing instance decomposition and occlusion information for high quality images, opening up new avenues for text-to-image generative AI research. With this, we aim to encourage the development of novel generation and editing technology, in particular layer-wise solutions.

- **Summary**: Microvascular networks are challenging to model because these structures are currently near the diffraction limit for most advanced three-dimensional imaging modalities, including confocal and light sheet microscopy. This makes semantic segmentation difficult, because individual components of these networks fluctuate within the confines of individual pixels. Level set methods are ideally suited to solve this problem by providing surface and topological constraints on the resulting model, however these active contour techniques are extremely time intensive and impractical for terabyte-scale images. We propose a reformulation and implementation of the region-scalable fitting (RSF) level set model that makes it amenable to three-dimensional evaluation using both single-instruction multiple data (SIMD) and single-program multiple-data (SPMD) parallel processing. This enables evaluation of the level set equation on independent regions of the data set using graphics processing units (GPUs), making large-scale segmentation of high-resolution networks practical and inexpensive.   We tested this 3D parallel RSF approach on multiple data sets acquired using state-of-the-art imaging techniques to acquire microvascular data, including micro-CT, light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) and milling microscopy. To assess the performance and accuracy of the RSF model, we conducted a Monte-Carlo-based validation technique to compare results to other segmentation methods. We also provide a rigorous profiling to show the gains in processing speed leveraging parallel hardware. This study showcases the practical application of the RSF model, emphasizing its utility in the challenging domain of segmenting large-scale high-topology network structures with a particular focus on building microvascular models.

- **Summary**: Vertebral fracture grading classifies the severity of vertebral fractures, which is a challenging task in medical imaging and has recently attracted Deep Learning (DL) models. Only a few works attempted to make such models human-interpretable despite the need for transparency and trustworthiness in critical use cases like DL-assisted medical diagnosis. Moreover, such models either rely on post-hoc methods or additional annotations. In this work, we propose a novel interpretable-by-design method, ProtoVerse, to find relevant sub-parts of vertebral fractures (prototypes) that reliably explain the model's decision in a human-understandable way. Specifically, we introduce a novel diversity-promoting loss to mitigate prototype repetitions in small datasets with intricate semantics. We have experimented with the VerSe'19 dataset and outperformed the existing prototype-based method. Further, our model provides superior interpretability against the post-hoc method. Importantly, expert radiologists validated the visual interpretability of our results, showing clinical applicability.

- **Summary**: Recent developments underscore the potential of textual information in enhancing learning models for a deeper understanding of medical visual semantics. However, language-guided medical image segmentation still faces a challenging issue. Previous works employ implicit and ambiguous architectures to embed textual information. This leads to segmentation results that are inconsistent with the semantics represented by the language, sometimes even diverging significantly. To this end, we propose a novel cross-modal conditioned Reconstruction for Language-guided Medical Image Segmentation (RecLMIS) to explicitly capture cross-modal interactions, which assumes that well-aligned medical visual features and medical notes can effectively reconstruct each other. We introduce conditioned interaction to adaptively predict patches and words of interest. Subsequently, they are utilized as conditioning factors for mutual reconstruction to align with regions described in the medical notes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our RecLMIS, surpassing LViT by 3.74% mIoU on the publicly available MosMedData+ dataset and achieving an average increase of 1.89% mIoU for cross-domain tests on our QATA-CoV19 dataset. Simultaneously, we achieve a relative reduction of 20.2% in parameter count and a 55.5% decrease in computational load. The code will be available at https://github.com/ShashankHuang/RecLMIS.

- **Summary**: Object detection in remotely sensed satellite pictures is fundamental in many fields such as biophysical, and environmental monitoring. While deep learning algorithms are constantly evolving, they have been mostly implemented and tested on popular ground-based taken photos. This paper critically evaluates and compares a suite of advanced object detection algorithms customized for the task of identifying aircraft within satellite imagery. Using the large HRPlanesV2 dataset, together with a rigorous validation with the GDIT dataset, this research encompasses an array of methodologies including YOLO versions 5 and 8, Faster RCNN, CenterNet, RetinaNet, RTMDet, and DETR, all trained from scratch. This exhaustive training and validation study reveal YOLOv5 as the preeminent model for the specific case of identifying airplanes from remote sensing data, showcasing high precision and adaptability across diverse imaging conditions. This research highlight the nuanced performance landscapes of these algorithms, with YOLOv5 emerging as a robust solution for aerial object detection, underlining its importance through superior mean average precision, Recall, and Intersection over Union scores. The findings described here underscore the fundamental role of algorithm selection aligned with the specific demands of satellite imagery analysis and extend a comprehensive framework to evaluate model efficacy.

- **Summary**: Scaling up model and data size has been quite successful for the evolution of LLMs. However, the scaling law for the diffusion based text-to-image (T2I) models is not fully explored. It is also unclear how to efficiently scale the model for better performance at reduced cost. The different training settings and expensive training cost make a fair model comparison extremely difficult. In this work, we empirically study the scaling properties of diffusion based T2I models by performing extensive and rigours ablations on scaling both denoising backbones and training set, including training scaled UNet and Transformer variants ranging from 0.4B to 4B parameters on datasets upto 600M images. For model scaling, we find the location and amount of cross attention distinguishes the performance of existing UNet designs. And increasing the transformer blocks is more parameter-efficient for improving text-image alignment than increasing channel numbers. We then identify an efficient UNet variant, which is 45% smaller and 28% faster than SDXL's UNet. On the data scaling side, we show the quality and diversity of the training set matters more than simply dataset size. Increasing caption density and diversity improves text-image alignment performance and the learning efficiency. Finally, we provide scaling functions to predict the text-image alignment performance as functions of the scale of model size, compute and dataset size.

- **Summary**: We present a novel end-to-end algorithm (PoCo) for the indoor RGB-D place recognition task, aimed at identifying the most likely match for a given query frame within a reference database. The task presents inherent challenges attributed to the constrained field of view and limited range of perception sensors. We propose a new network architecture, which generalizes the recent Context of Clusters (CoCs) to extract global descriptors directly from the noisy point clouds through end-to-end learning. Moreover, we develop the architecture by integrating both color and geometric modalities into the point features to enhance the global descriptor representation. We conducted evaluations on public datasets ScanNet-PR and ARKit with 807 and 5047 scenarios, respectively. PoCo achieves SOTA performance: on ScanNet-PR, we achieve R@1 of 64.63%, a 5.7% improvement from the best-published result CGis (61.12%); on Arkit, we achieve R@1 of 45.12%, a 13.3% improvement from the best-published result CGis (39.82%). In addition, PoCo shows higher efficiency than CGis in inference time (1.75X-faster), and we demonstrate the effectiveness of PoCo in recognizing places within a real-world laboratory environment.

- **Summary**: Ensuring the legal usage of deep models is crucial to promoting trustable, accountable, and responsible artificial intelligence innovation. Current passport-based methods that obfuscate model functionality for license-to-use and ownership verifications suffer from capacity and quality constraints, as they require retraining the owner model for new users. They are also vulnerable to advanced Expanded Residual Block ambiguity attacks. We propose Steganographic Passport, which uses an invertible steganographic network to decouple license-to-use from ownership verification by hiding the user's identity images into the owner-side passport and recovering them from their respective user-side passports. An irreversible and collision-resistant hash function is used to avoid exposing the owner-side passport from the derived user-side passports and increase the uniqueness of the model signature. To safeguard both the passport and model's weights against advanced ambiguity attacks, an activation-level obfuscation is proposed for the verification branch of the owner's model. By jointly training the verification and deployment branches, their weights become tightly coupled. The proposed method supports agile licensing of deep models by providing a strong ownership proof and license accountability without requiring a separate model retraining for the admission of every new user. Experiment results show that our Steganographic Passport outperforms other passport-based deep model protection methods in robustness against various known attacks.

- **Summary**: Image forgery is a topic that has been studied for many years. Before the breakthrough of deep learning, forged images were detected using handcrafted features that did not require training. These traditional methods failed to perform satisfactorily even on datasets much worse in quality than real-life image manipulations. Advances in deep learning have impacted image forgery detection as much as they have impacted other areas of computer vision and have improved the state of the art. Deep learning models require large amounts of labeled data for training. In the case of image forgery, labeled data at the pixel level is a very important factor for the models to learn. None of the existing datasets have sufficient size, realism and pixel-level labeling at the same time. This is due to the high cost of producing and labeling quality images. It can take hours for an image editing expert to manipulate just one image. To bridge this gap, we automate data generation using image composition techniques that are very related to image forgery. Unlike other automated data generation frameworks, we use state of the art image composition deep learning models to generate spliced images close to the quality of real-life manipulations. Finally, we test the generated dataset on the SOTA image manipulation detection model and show that its prediction performance is lower compared to existing datasets, i.e. we produce realistic images that are more difficult to detect.

- **Summary**: We present MatAtlas, a method for consistent text-guided 3D model texturing. Following recent progress we leverage a large scale text-to-image generation model (e.g., Stable Diffusion) as a prior to texture a 3D model. We carefully design an RGB texturing pipeline that leverages a grid pattern diffusion, driven by depth and edges. By proposing a multi-step texture refinement process, we significantly improve the quality and 3D consistency of the texturing output. To further address the problem of baked-in lighting, we move beyond RGB colors and pursue assigning parametric materials to the assets. Given the high-quality initial RGB texture, we propose a novel material retrieval method capitalized on Large Language Models (LLM), enabling editabiliy and relightability. We evaluate our method on a wide variety of geometries and show that our method significantly outperform prior arts. We also analyze the role of each component through a detailed ablation study.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a prominent architecture for various computer vision tasks. In ViT, we divide the input image into patch tokens and process them through a stack of self attention blocks. However, unlike Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), ViTs simple architecture has no informative inductive bias (e.g., locality,etc. ). Due to this, ViT requires a large amount of data for pre-training. Various data efficient approaches (DeiT) have been proposed to train ViT on balanced datasets effectively. However, limited literature discusses the use of ViT for datasets with long-tailed imbalances. In this work, we introduce DeiT-LT to tackle the problem of training ViTs from scratch on long-tailed datasets. In DeiT-LT, we introduce an efficient and effective way of distillation from CNN via distillation DIST token by using out-of-distribution images and re-weighting the distillation loss to enhance focus on tail classes. This leads to the learning of local CNN-like features in early ViT blocks, improving generalization for tail classes. Further, to mitigate overfitting, we propose distilling from a flat CNN teacher, which leads to learning low-rank generalizable features for DIST tokens across all ViT blocks. With the proposed DeiT-LT scheme, the distillation DIST token becomes an expert on the tail classes, and the classifier CLS token becomes an expert on the head classes. The experts help to effectively learn features corresponding to both the majority and minority classes using a distinct set of tokens within the same ViT architecture. We show the effectiveness of DeiT-LT for training ViT from scratch on datasets ranging from small-scale CIFAR-10 LT to large-scale iNaturalist-2018.

- **Summary**: We present LidarDM, a novel LiDAR generative model capable of producing realistic, layout-aware, physically plausible, and temporally coherent LiDAR videos. LidarDM stands out with two unprecedented capabilities in LiDAR generative modeling: (i) LiDAR generation guided by driving scenarios, offering significant potential for autonomous driving simulations, and (ii) 4D LiDAR point cloud generation, enabling the creation of realistic and temporally coherent sequences. At the heart of our model is a novel integrated 4D world generation framework. Specifically, we employ latent diffusion models to generate the 3D scene, combine it with dynamic actors to form the underlying 4D world, and subsequently produce realistic sensory observations within this virtual environment. Our experiments indicate that our approach outperforms competing algorithms in realism, temporal coherency, and layout consistency. We additionally show that LidarDM can be used as a generative world model simulator for training and testing perception models.

- **Summary**: Despite recent advances in multimodal pre-training for visual description, state-of-the-art models still produce captions containing errors, such as hallucinating objects not present in a scene. The existing prominent metric for object hallucination, CHAIR, is limited to a fixed set of MS COCO objects and synonyms. In this work, we propose a modernized open-vocabulary metric, ALOHa, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to measure object hallucinations. Specifically, we use an LLM to extract groundable objects from a candidate caption, measure their semantic similarity to reference objects from captions and object detections, and use Hungarian matching to produce a final hallucination score. We show that ALOHa correctly identifies 13.6% more hallucinated objects than CHAIR on HAT, a new gold-standard subset of MS COCO Captions annotated for hallucinations, and 30.8% more on nocaps, where objects extend beyond MS COCO categories. Our code is available at https://davidmchan.github.io/aloha/.

- **Summary**: We present Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR), a new generation paradigm that redefines the autoregressive learning on images as coarse-to-fine "next-scale prediction" or "next-resolution prediction", diverging from the standard raster-scan "next-token prediction". This simple, intuitive methodology allows autoregressive (AR) transformers to learn visual distributions fast and generalize well: VAR, for the first time, makes AR models surpass diffusion transformers in image generation. On ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VAR significantly improve AR baseline by improving Frechet inception distance (FID) from 18.65 to 1.80, inception score (IS) from 80.4 to 356.4, with around 20x faster inference speed. It is also empirically verified that VAR outperforms the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) in multiple dimensions including image quality, inference speed, data efficiency, and scalability. Scaling up VAR models exhibits clear power-law scaling laws similar to those observed in LLMs, with linear correlation coefficients near -0.998 as solid evidence. VAR further showcases zero-shot generalization ability in downstream tasks including image in-painting, out-painting, and editing. These results suggest VAR has initially emulated the two important properties of LLMs: Scaling Laws and zero-shot task generalization. We have released all models and codes to promote the exploration of AR/VAR models for visual generation and unified learning.

- **Summary**: We present the first systematic investigation of supervised scaling laws outside of an ImageNet-like context - on images of galaxies. We use 840k galaxy images and over 100M annotations by Galaxy Zoo volunteers, comparable in scale to Imagenet-1K. We find that adding annotated galaxy images provides a power law improvement in performance across all architectures and all tasks, while adding trainable parameters is effective only for some (typically more subjectively challenging) tasks. We then compare the downstream performance of finetuned models pretrained on either ImageNet-12k alone vs. additionally pretrained on our galaxy images. We achieve an average relative error rate reduction of 31% across 5 downstream tasks of scientific interest. Our finetuned models are more label-efficient and, unlike their ImageNet-12k-pretrained equivalents, often achieve linear transfer performance equal to that of end-to-end finetuning. We find relatively modest additional downstream benefits from scaling model size, implying that scaling alone is not sufficient to address our domain gap, and suggest that practitioners with qualitatively different images might benefit more from in-domain adaption followed by targeted downstream labelling.

- **Summary**: Generative image models have emerged as a promising technology to produce realistic images. Despite potential benefits, concerns grow about its misuse, particularly in generating deceptive images that could raise significant ethical, legal, and societal issues. Consequently, there is growing demand to empower users to effectively discern and comprehend patterns of AI-generated images. To this end, we developed ASAP, an interactive visualization system that automatically extracts distinct patterns of AI-generated images and allows users to interactively explore them via various views. To uncover fake patterns, ASAP introduces a novel image encoder, adapted from CLIP, which transforms images into compact "distilled" representations, enriched with information for differentiating authentic and fake images. These representations generate gradients that propagate back to the attention maps of CLIP's transformer block. This process quantifies the relative importance of each pixel to image authenticity or fakeness, exposing key deceptive patterns. ASAP enables the at scale interactive analysis of these patterns through multiple, coordinated visualizations. This includes a representation overview with innovative cell glyphs to aid in the exploration and qualitative evaluation of fake patterns across a vast array of images, as well as a pattern view that displays authenticity-indicating patterns in images and quantifies their impact. ASAP supports the analysis of cutting-edge generative models with the latest architectures, including GAN-based models like proGAN and diffusion models like the latent diffusion model. We demonstrate ASAP's usefulness through two usage scenarios using multiple fake image detection benchmark datasets, revealing its ability to identify and understand hidden patterns in AI-generated images, especially in detecting fake human faces produced by diffusion-based techniques.

- **Summary**: Style transfer is a promising approach to close the sim-to-real gap in medical endoscopy. Rendering realistic endoscopic videos by traversing pre-operative scans (such as MRI or CT) can generate realistic simulations as well as ground truth camera poses and depth maps. Although image-to-image (I2I) translation models such as CycleGAN perform well, they are unsuitable for video-to-video synthesis due to the lack of temporal consistency, resulting in artifacts between frames. We propose MeshBrush, a neural mesh stylization method to synthesize temporally consistent videos with differentiable rendering. MeshBrush uses the underlying geometry of patient imaging data while leveraging existing I2I methods. With learned per-vertex textures, the stylized mesh guarantees consistency while producing high-fidelity outputs. We demonstrate that mesh stylization is a promising approach for creating realistic simulations for downstream tasks such as training and preoperative planning. Although our method is tested and designed for ureteroscopy, its components are transferable to general endoscopic and laparoscopic procedures.

- **Summary**: Accurately segmenting thin tubular structures, such as vessels, nerves, roads or concrete cracks, is a crucial task in computer vision. Standard deep learning-based segmentation loss functions, such as Dice or Cross-Entropy, focus on volumetric overlap, often at the expense of preserving structural connectivity or topology. This can lead to segmentation errors that adversely affect downstream tasks, including flow calculation, navigation, and structural inspection. Although current topology-focused losses mark an improvement, they introduce significant computational and memory overheads. This is particularly relevant for 3D data, rendering these losses infeasible for larger volumes as well as increasingly important multi-class segmentation problems. To mitigate this, we propose a novel Skeleton Recall Loss, which effectively addresses these challenges by circumventing intensive GPU-based calculations with inexpensive CPU operations. It demonstrates overall superior performance to current state-of-the-art approaches on five public datasets for topology-preserving segmentation, while substantially reducing computational overheads by more than 90%. In doing so, we introduce the first multi-class capable loss function for thin structure segmentation, excelling in both efficiency and efficacy for topology-preservation.

- **Summary**: The perception of autonomous vehicles has to be efficient, robust, and cost-effective. However, cameras are not robust against severe weather conditions, lidar sensors are expensive, and the performance of radar-based perception is still inferior to the others. Camera-radar fusion methods have been proposed to address this issue, but these are constrained by the typical sparsity of radar point clouds and often designed for radars without elevation information. We propose a novel camera-radar fusion approach called Dual Perspective Fusion Transformer (DPFT), designed to overcome these limitations. Our method leverages lower-level radar data (the radar cube) instead of the processed point clouds to preserve as much information as possible and employs projections in both the camera and ground planes to effectively use radars with elevation information and simplify the fusion with camera data. As a result, DPFT has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the K-Radar dataset while showing remarkable robustness against adverse weather conditions and maintaining a low inference time. The code is made available as open-source software under https://github.com/TUMFTM/DPFT.

  Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2024) @ NAACL 2024

- **Summary**: Memes, combining text and images, frequently use metaphors to convey persuasive messages, shaping public opinion. Motivated by this, our team engaged in SemEval-2024 Task 4, a hierarchical multi-label classification task designed to identify rhetorical and psychological persuasion techniques embedded within memes. To tackle this problem, we introduced a caption generation step to assess the modality gap and the impact of additional semantic information from images, which improved our result. Our best model utilizes GPT-4 generated captions alongside meme text to fine-tune RoBERTa as the text encoder and CLIP as the image encoder. It outperforms the baseline by a large margin in all 12 subtasks. In particular, it ranked in top-3 across all languages in Subtask 2a, and top-4 in Subtask 2b, demonstrating quantitatively strong performance. The improvement achieved by the introduced intermediate step is likely attributable to the metaphorical essence of images that challenges visual encoders. This highlights the potential for improving abstract visual semantics encoding.

- **Summary**: Many classical parametric 3D shape models exist, but creating novel shapes with such models requires expert knowledge of their parameters. For example, imagine creating a specific type of tree using procedural graphics or a new kind of animal from a statistical shape model. Our key idea is to leverage language to control such existing models to produce novel shapes. This involves learning a mapping between the latent space of a vision-language model and the parameter space of the 3D model, which we do using a small set of shape and text pairs. Our hypothesis is that mapping from language to parameters allows us to generate parameters for objects that were never seen during training. If the mapping between language and parameters is sufficiently smooth, then interpolation or generalization in language should translate appropriately into novel 3D shapes. We test our approach with two very different types of parametric shape models (quadrupeds and arboreal trees). We use a learned statistical shape model of quadrupeds and show that we can use text to generate new animals not present during training. In particular, we demonstrate state-of-the-art shape estimation of 3D dogs. This work also constitutes the first language-driven method for generating 3D trees. Finally, embedding images in the CLIP latent space enables us to generate animals and trees directly from images.

- **Summary**: An accurate detection of the centerlines of linear objects is a challenging topic in many sensitive real-world applications such X-ray imaging, remote sensing and lane marking detection in road traffic. Model-based approaches using Hough and Radon transforms are often used but, are not recommended for thick line detection, whereas approaches based on image derivatives need further step-by-step processing, making their efficiency dependent on each step outcomes. In this paper, we aim to detect linear structures found in images by considering the 3D representation of the image gray levels as a finite mixture model of statistical distribution. The latter, which we named linear anchored Gaussian distribution could be parametrized by a scale value {\sigma} describing the linear structure thickness and a line equation, parametrized, in turn, by a radius \r{ho} and an orientation angle {\theta}, describing the linear structure centerline location. Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used for the mixture model parameter estimation, where a new paradigm, using the background subtraction for the likelihood function computation, is proposed. For the EM algorithm, two {\theta} parameter initialization schemes are used: the first one is based on a random choice of the first component of {\theta} vector, whereas the second is based on the image Hessian with a simultaneous computation of the mixture model components number. Experiments on real world images and synthetic images corrupted by blur and additive noise show the good performance of the proposed methods, where the algorithm using background subtraction and Hessian-based {\theta} initialization provides an outstanding accuracy of the linear structure detection despite irregular image background and presence of blur and noise.

- **Summary**: Most existing 6-DoF robot grasping solutions depend on strong supervision on grasp pose to ensure satisfactory performance, which could be laborious and impractical when the robot works in some restricted area. To this end, we propose a self-supervised 6-DoF grasp pose detection framework via an Augmented Reality (AR) teleoperation system that can efficiently learn human demonstrations and provide 6-DoF grasp poses without grasp pose annotations. Specifically, the system collects the human demonstration from the AR environment and contrastively learns the grasping strategy from the demonstration. For the real-world experiment, the proposed system leads to satisfactory grasping abilities and learning to grasp unknown objects within three demonstrations.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a novel indoor 3D reconstruction method with occluded surface completion, given a sequence of depth readings. Prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods only focus on the reconstruction of the visible areas in a scene, neglecting the invisible areas due to the occlusions, e.g., the contact surface between furniture, occluded wall and floor. Our method tackles the task of completing the occluded scene surfaces, resulting in a complete 3D scene mesh. The core idea of our method is learning 3D geometry prior from various complete scenes to infer the occluded geometry of an unseen scene from solely depth measurements. We design a coarse-fine hierarchical octree representation coupled with a dual-decoder architecture, i.e., Geo-decoder and 3D Inpainter, which jointly reconstructs the complete 3D scene geometry. The Geo-decoder with detailed representation at fine levels is optimized online for each scene to reconstruct visible surfaces. The 3D Inpainter with abstract representation at coarse levels is trained offline using various scenes to complete occluded surfaces. As a result, while the Geo-decoder is specialized for an individual scene, the 3D Inpainter can be generally applied across different scenes. We evaluate the proposed method on the 3D Completed Room Scene (3D-CRS) and iTHOR datasets, significantly outperforming the SOTA methods by a gain of 16.8% and 24.2% in terms of the completeness of 3D reconstruction. 3D-CRS dataset including a complete 3D mesh of each scene is provided at project webpage.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in video saliency prediction (VSP) have shown promising performance compared to the human visual system, whose emulation is the primary goal of VSP. However, current state-of-the-art models employ spatio-temporal transformers trained on limited amounts of data, hindering generalizability adaptation to downstream tasks. The benefits of vision foundation models present a potential solution to improve the VSP process. However, adapting image foundation models to the video domain presents significant challenges in modeling scene dynamics and capturing temporal information. To address these challenges, and as the first initiative to design a VSP model based on video foundation models, we introduce SalFoM, a novel encoder-decoder video transformer architecture. Our model employs UnMasked Teacher (UMT) as feature extractor and presents a heterogeneous decoder which features a locality-aware spatio-temporal transformer and integrates local and global spatio-temporal information from various perspectives to produce the final saliency map. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments on the challenging VSP benchmark datasets of DHF1K, Hollywood-2 and UCF-Sports demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in image generation have made significant progress, yet existing models present limitations in perceiving and generating an arbitrary number of interrelated images within a broad context. This limitation becomes increasingly critical as the demand for multi-image scenarios, such as multi-view images and visual narratives, grows with the expansion of multimedia platforms. This paper introduces a domain-general framework for many-to-many image generation, capable of producing interrelated image series from a given set of images, offering a scalable solution that obviates the need for task-specific solutions across different multi-image scenarios. To facilitate this, we present MIS, a novel large-scale multi-image dataset, containing 12M synthetic multi-image samples, each with 25 interconnected images. Utilizing Stable Diffusion with varied latent noises, our method produces a set of interconnected images from a single caption. Leveraging MIS, we learn M2M, an autoregressive model for many-to-many generation, where each image is modeled within a diffusion framework. Throughout training on the synthetic MIS, the model excels in capturing style and content from preceding images - synthetic or real - and generates novel images following the captured patterns. Furthermore, through task-specific fine-tuning, our model demonstrates its adaptability to various multi-image generation tasks, including Novel View Synthesis and Visual Procedure Generation.

- **Summary**: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a prominent task in computer vision with application in autonomous driving, responsible for the simultaneous tracking of multiple object trajectories. Detection-based multi-object tracking (DBT) algorithms detect objects using an independent object detector and predict the imminent location of each target. Conventional prediction methods in DBT utilize Kalman Filter(KF) to extrapolate the target location in the upcoming frames by supposing a constant velocity motion model. These methods are especially hindered in autonomous driving applications due to dramatic camera motion or unavailable detections. Such limitations lead to tracking failures manifested by numerous identity switches and disrupted trajectories. In this paper, we introduce a novel KF-based prediction module called the Ego-motion Aware Target Prediction (EMAP) module by focusing on the integration of camera motion and depth information with object motion models. Our proposed method decouples the impact of camera rotational and translational velocity from the object trajectories by reformulating the Kalman Filter. This reformulation enables us to reject the disturbances caused by camera motion and maximizes the reliability of the object motion model. We integrate our module with four state-of-the-art base MOT algorithms, namely OC-SORT, Deep OC-SORT, ByteTrack, and BoT-SORT. In particular, our evaluation on the KITTI MOT dataset demonstrates that EMAP remarkably drops the number of identity switches (IDSW) of OC-SORT and Deep OC-SORT by 73% and 21%, respectively. At the same time, it elevates other performance metrics such as HOTA by more than 5%. Our source code is available at https://github.com/noyzzz/EMAP.

- **Summary**: In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, multi-modal large language models are emerging as a significant area of interest. These models, which combine various forms of data input, are becoming increasingly popular. However, understanding their internal mechanisms remains a complex task. Numerous advancements have been made in the field of explainability tools and mechanisms, yet there is still much to explore. In this work, we present a novel interactive application aimed towards understanding the internal mechanisms of large vision-language models. Our interface is designed to enhance the interpretability of the image patches, which are instrumental in generating an answer, and assess the efficacy of the language model in grounding its output in the image. With our application, a user can systematically investigate the model and uncover system limitations, paving the way for enhancements in system capabilities. Finally, we present a case study of how our application can aid in understanding failure mechanisms in a popular large multi-modal model: LLaVA.

- **Summary**: The demand for improved efficiency and accuracy in vaccine safety assessments is increasing. Here, we explore the application of computer vision technologies to automate the monitoring of experimental mice for potential side effects after vaccine administration. Traditional observation methods are labor-intensive and lack the capability for continuous monitoring. By deploying a computer vision system, our research aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of vaccine safety assessments. The methodology involves training machine learning models on annotated video data of mice behaviors pre- and post-vaccination. Preliminary results indicate that computer vision effectively identify subtle changes, signaling possible side effects. Therefore, our approach has the potential to significantly enhance the monitoring process in vaccine trials in animals, providing a practical solution to the limitations of human observation.
