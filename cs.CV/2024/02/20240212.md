- **Summary**: The social media-fuelled explosion of fake news and misinformation supported by tampered images has led to growth in the development of models and datasets for image manipulation detection. However, existing detection methods mostly treat media objects in isolation, without considering the impact of specific manipulations on viewer perception. Forensic datasets are usually analyzed based on the manipulation operations and corresponding pixel-based masks, but not on the semantics of the manipulation, i.e., type of scene, objects, and viewers' attention to scene content. The semantics of the manipulation play an important role in spreading misinformation through manipulated images. In an attempt to encourage further development of semantic-aware forensic approaches to understand visual misinformation, we propose a framework to analyze the trends of visual and semantic saliency in popular image manipulation datasets and their impact on detection.

- **Summary**: Identification of tumor margins is essential for surgical decision-making for glioblastoma patients and provides reliable assistance for neurosurgeons. Despite improvements in deep learning architectures for tumor segmentation over the years, creating a fully autonomous system suitable for clinical floors remains a formidable challenge because the model predictions have not yet reached the desired level of accuracy and generalizability for clinical applications. Generative modeling techniques have seen significant improvements in recent times. Specifically, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Denoising-diffusion-based models (DDPMs) have been used to generate higher-quality images with fewer artifacts and finer attributes. In this work, we introduce a framework called Re-Diffinet for modeling the discrepancy between the outputs of a segmentation model like U-Net and the ground truth, using DDPMs. By explicitly modeling the discrepancy, the results show an average improvement of 0.55\% in the Dice score and 16.28\% in HD95 from cross-validation over 5-folds, compared to the state-of-the-art U-Net segmentation model.

- **Summary**: Face swapping has gained significant attention for its varied applications. The majority of previous face swapping approaches have relied on the seesaw game training scheme, which often leads to the instability of the model training and results in undesired samples with blended identities due to the target identity leakage problem. This paper introduces the Shape Agnostic Masked AutoEncoder (SAMAE) training scheme, a novel self-supervised approach designed to enhance face swapping model training. Our training scheme addresses the limitations of traditional training methods by circumventing the conventional seesaw game and introducing clear ground truth through its self-reconstruction training regime. It effectively mitigates identity leakage by masking facial regions of the input images and utilizing learned disentangled identity and non-identity features. Additionally, we tackle the shape misalignment problem with new techniques including perforation confusion and random mesh scaling, and establishes a new state-of-the-art, surpassing other baseline methods, preserving both identity and non-identity attributes, without sacrificing on either aspect.

- **Summary**: Atmospheric turbulence, a common phenomenon in daily life, is primarily caused by the uneven heating of the Earth's surface. This phenomenon results in distorted and blurred acquired images or videos and can significantly impact downstream vision tasks, particularly those that rely on capturing clear, stable images or videos from outdoor environments, such as accurately detecting or recognizing objects. Therefore, people have proposed ways to simulate atmospheric turbulence and designed effective deep learning-based methods to remove the atmospheric turbulence effect. However, these synthesized turbulent images can not cover all the range of real-world turbulence effects. Though the models have achieved great performance for synthetic scenarios, there always exists a performance drop when applied to real-world cases. Moreover, reducing real-world turbulence is a more challenging task as there are no clean ground truth counterparts provided to the models during training. In this paper, we propose a real-world atmospheric turbulence mitigation model under a domain adaptation framework, which links the supervised simulated atmospheric turbulence correction with the unsupervised real-world atmospheric turbulence correction. We will show our proposed method enhances performance in real-world atmospheric turbulence scenarios, improving both image quality and downstream vision tasks.



### Unsupervised Discovery of Object-Centric Neural Fields

- **Summary**: We study inferring 3D object-centric scene representations from a single image. While recent methods have shown potential in unsupervised 3D object discovery from simple synthetic images, they fail to generalize to real-world scenes with visually rich and diverse objects. This limitation stems from their object representations, which entangle objects' intrinsic attributes like shape and appearance with extrinsic, viewer-centric properties such as their 3D location. To address this bottleneck, we propose Unsupervised discovery of Object-Centric neural Fields (uOCF). uOCF focuses on learning the intrinsics of objects and models the extrinsics separately. Our approach significantly improves systematic generalization, thus enabling unsupervised learning of high-fidelity object-centric scene representations from sparse real-world images. To evaluate our approach, we collect three new datasets, including two real kitchen environments. Extensive experiments show that uOCF enables unsupervised discovery of visually rich objects from a single real image, allowing applications such as 3D object segmentation and scene manipulation. Notably, uOCF demonstrates zero-shot generalization to unseen objects from a single real image. Project page: https://red-fairy.github.io/uOCF/

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently shown remarkable perceptual capability in answering visual questions, however, little is known about the limits of their perception. In particular, while prior works have provided anecdotal evidence of MLLMs' sensitivity to object size, this phenomenon and its underlying causes have not been explored comprehensively. In this work, we quantitatively study the perception of small visual objects in several state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal a pervasive limitation in answering questions about small objects in images. Next, we identify four independent factors that can contribute to this limitation -- object quality, size, distractors, and location -- and conduct controlled intervention studies to measure the effect of each factor on MLLMs' perception. In particular, we find that lower object quality and smaller object size can both independently reduce MLLMs' ability to answer visual questions. More surprisingly, we find that the location of the object in the image and the presence of visual distractors can also significantly reduce MLLMs' question answering accuracy. Our study provides a better understanding of the perceptual limitation of MLLMs and contributes new evaluation protocols for analyzing the perception of future MLLMs. To facilitate further investigations, we release our code and data.

- **Summary**: Each medical segmentation task should be considered with a specific AI algorithm based on its scenario so that the most accurate prediction model can be obtained. The most popular algorithms in medical segmentation, 3D U-Net and its variants, can directly implement the task of lung trachea segmentation, but its failure to consider the special tree-like structure of the trachea suggests that there is much room for improvement in its segmentation accuracy. Therefore, a research gap exists because a great amount of state-of-the-art DL algorithms are vanilla 3D U-Net structures, which do not introduce the various performance-enhancing modules that come with special natural image modality in lung airway segmentation. In this paper, we proposed two different network structures Branch-Level U-Net (B-UNet) and Branch-Level CE-UNet (B-CE-UNet) which are based on U-Net structure and compared the prediction results with the same dataset. Specially, both of the two networks add branch loss and central line loss to learn the feature of fine branch endings of the airways. Uncertainty estimation algorithms are also included to attain confident predictions and thereby, increase the overall trustworthiness of our whole model. In addition, predictions of the lung trachea based on the maximum connectivity rate were calculated and extracted during post-processing for segmentation refinement and pruning.



### A Closer Look at the Robustness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP)

- **Summary**: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across multiple challenging distribution shifts. However, there is still much to be explored in terms of their robustness to the variations of specific visual factors. In real-world applications, reliable and safe systems must consider other safety objectives beyond classification accuracy, such as predictive uncertainty. Yet, the effectiveness of CLIP models on such safety-related features is less-explored. Driven by the above, this work comprehensively investigates the safety objectives of CLIP models, specifically focusing on three key properties: resilience to visual factor variations, calibrated uncertainty estimations, and the ability to detect anomalous inputs. To this end, we study 83 CLIP models and 127 ImageNet classifiers. They are diverse in architecture, (pre)training distribution and training strategies. We consider 10 visual factors (e.g., shape and pattern), 5 types of out-of-distribution data, and 8 natural and challenging test conditions with different shift types, such as texture, style, and perturbation shifts. Our study has unveiled several previously unknown insights into CLIP models. For instance, they are not consistently more calibrated than other ImageNet models, which contradicts existing findings. Additionally, our analysis underscores the significance of training source design by showcasing its profound influence on the three safety-related properties. We believe our comprehensive study can shed light on and help guide the development of more robust and reliable CLIP models.

- **Summary**: In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have gained widespread adoption for continuous mobile object detection (OD) tasks, particularly in autonomous systems. However, a prevalent issue in their deployment is the one-size-fits-all approach, where a single DNN is used, resulting in inefficient utilization of computational resources. This inefficiency is particularly detrimental in energy-constrained systems, as it degrades overall system efficiency. We identify that, the contextual information embedded in the input data stream (e.g. the frames in the camera feed that the OD models are run on) could be exploited to allow a more efficient multi-model-based OD process. In this paper, we propose SHIFT which continuously selects from a variety of DNN-based OD models depending on the dynamically changing contextual information and computational constraints. During this selection, SHIFT uniquely considers multi-accelerator execution to better optimize the energy-efficiency while satisfying the latency constraints. Our proposed methodology results in improvements of up to 7.5x in energy usage and 2.8x in latency compared to state-of-the-art GPU-based single model OD approaches.

- **Summary**: Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as the dominant approach for zero-shot recognition, adept at handling diverse scenarios and significant distribution changes. However, their deployment in risk-sensitive areas requires a deeper understanding of their uncertainty estimation capabilities, a relatively uncharted area. In this study, we explore the calibration properties of VLMs across different architectures, datasets, and training strategies. In particular, we analyze the uncertainty estimation performance of VLMs when calibrated in one domain, label set or hierarchy level, and tested in a different one. Our findings reveal that while VLMs are not inherently calibrated for uncertainty, temperature scaling significantly and consistently improves calibration, even across shifts in distribution and changes in label set. Moreover, VLMs can be calibrated with a very small set of examples. Through detailed experimentation, we highlight the potential applications and importance of our insights, aiming for more reliable and effective use of VLMs in critical, real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: While branching network structures abound in nature, their objective analysis is more difficult than expected because existing quantitative methods often rely on the subjective judgment of branch structures. This problem is particularly pronounced when dealing with images comprising discrete particles. Here we propose an objective framework for quantitative analysis of branching networks by introducing the mathematical definitions for internal and external structures based on topological data analysis, specifically, persistent homology. We compare persistence diagrams constructed from images with and without plots on the convex hull. The unchanged points in the two diagrams are the internal structures and the difference between the two diagrams is the external structures. We construct a mathematical theory for our method and show that the internal structures have a monotonicity relationship with respect to the plots on the convex hull, while the external structures do not. This is the phenomenon related to the resolution of the image. Our method can be applied to a wide range of branch structures in biology, enabling objective analysis of numbers, spatial distributions, sizes, and more. Additionally, our method has the potential to be combined with other tools in topological data analysis, such as the generalized persistence landscape.

- **Summary**: Different diseases, such as histological subtypes of breast lesions, have severely varying incidence rates. Even trained with substantial amount of in-distribution (ID) data, models often encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) samples belonging to unseen classes in clinical reality. To address this, we propose a novel framework built upon a long-tailed OOD detection task for breast ultrasound images. It is equipped with a triplet state augmentation (TriAug) which improves ID classification accuracy while maintaining a promising OOD detection performance. Meanwhile, we designed a balanced sphere loss to handle the class imbalanced problem.

- **Summary**: We present a novel deep-learning-based method to cluster words in documents which we apply to detect and recognize tables given the OCR output. We interpret table structure bottom-up as a graph of relations between pairs of words (belonging to the same row, column, header, as well as to the same table) and use a transformer encoder model to predict its adjacency matrix. We demonstrate the performance of our method on the PubTables-1M dataset as well as PubTabNet and FinTabNet datasets. Compared to the current state-of-the-art detection methods such as DETR and Faster R-CNN, our method achieves similar or better accuracy, while requiring a significantly smaller model.

  Morphology (DGMM), Apr 2024, Florence, Italy
- **Summary**: We introduce the notion of a Morse sequence, which provides a simple and effective approach to discrete Morse theory. A Morse sequence is a sequence composed solely of two elementary operations, that is, expansions (the inverse of a collapse), and fillings (the inverse of a perforation). We show that a Morse sequence may be seen as an alternative way to represent the gradient vector field of an arbitrary discrete Morse function. We also show that it is possible, in a straightforward manner, to make a link between Morse sequences and different kinds of Morse functions. At last, we introduce maximal Morse sequences, which formalize two basic schemes for building a Morse sequence from an arbitrary simplicial complex.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art end-to-end Optical Music Recognition (OMR) has, to date, primarily been carried out using monophonic transcription techniques to handle complex score layouts, such as polyphony, often by resorting to simplifications or specific adaptations. Despite their efficacy, these approaches imply challenges related to scalability and limitations. This paper presents the Sheet Music Transformer, the first end-to-end OMR model designed to transcribe complex musical scores without relying solely on monophonic strategies. Our model employs a Transformer-based image-to-sequence framework that predicts score transcriptions in a standard digital music encoding format from input images. Our model has been tested on two polyphonic music datasets and has proven capable of handling these intricate music structures effectively. The experimental outcomes not only indicate the competence of the model, but also show that it is better than the state-of-the-art methods, thus contributing to advancements in end-to-end OMR transcription.

- **Summary**: Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with a large set of feasible solutions that are consistent with a given low-resolution image. Various deterministic algorithms aim to find a single solution that balances fidelity and perceptual quality; however, this trade-off often causes visual artifacts that bring ambiguity in information-centric applications. On the other hand, diffusion models (DMs) excel in generating a diverse set of feasible SR images that span the solution space. The challenge is then how to determine the most likely solution among this set in a trustworthy manner. We observe that quantitative measures, such as PSNR, LPIPS, DISTS, are not reliable indicators to resolve ambiguous cases. To this effect, we propose employing human feedback, where we ask human subjects to select a small number of likely samples and we ensemble the averages of selected samples. This strategy leverages the high-quality image generation capabilities of DMs, while recognizing the importance of obtaining a single trustworthy solution, especially in use cases, such as identification of specific digits or letters, where generating multiple feasible solutions may not lead to a reliable outcome. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed strategy provides more trustworthy solutions when compared to state-of-the art SR methods.



### Complete Instances Mining for Weakly Supervised Instance Segmentation

  Artificial Intelligence(IJCAI 2023). Main Track. Pages 1142-1150
- **Summary**: Weakly supervised instance segmentation (WSIS) using only image-level labels is a challenging task due to the difficulty of aligning coarse annotations with the finer task. However, with the advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs), WSIS has garnered significant attention. Following a proposal-based paradigm, we encounter a redundant segmentation problem resulting from a single instance being represented by multiple proposals. For example, we feed a picture of a dog and proposals into the network and expect to output only one proposal containing a dog, but the network outputs multiple proposals. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach for WSIS that focuses on the online refinement of complete instances through the use of MaskIoU heads to predict the integrity scores of proposals and a Complete Instances Mining (CIM) strategy to explicitly model the redundant segmentation problem and generate refined pseudo labels. Our approach allows the network to become aware of multiple instances and complete instances, and we further improve its robustness through the incorporation of an Anti-noise strategy. Empirical evaluations on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a notable margin. Our implementation will be made available at https://github.com/ZechengLi19/CIM.

- **Summary**: Collaborative perception in automated vehicles leverages the exchange of information between agents, aiming to elevate perception results. Previous camera-based collaborative 3D perception methods typically employ 3D bounding boxes or bird's eye views as representations of the environment. However, these approaches fall short in offering a comprehensive 3D environmental prediction. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first method for collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction. Particularly, it improves local 3D semantic occupancy predictions by hybrid fusion of (i) semantic and occupancy task features, and (ii) compressed orthogonal attention features shared between vehicles. Additionally, due to the lack of a collaborative perception dataset designed for semantic occupancy prediction, we augment a current collaborative perception dataset to include 3D collaborative semantic occupancy labels for a more robust evaluation. The experimental findings highlight that: (i) our collaborative semantic occupancy predictions excel above the results from single vehicles by over 30%, and (ii) models anchored on semantic occupancy outpace state-of-the-art collaborative 3D detection techniques in subsequent perception applications, showcasing enhanced accuracy and enriched semantic-awareness in road environments.

- **Summary**: Recovery of signals with elements defined on the nodes of a graph, from compressive measurements is an important problem, which can arise in various domains such as sensor networks, image reconstruction and group testing. In some scenarios, the graph may not be accurately known, and there may exist a few edge additions or deletions relative to a ground truth graph. Such perturbations, even if small in number, significantly affect the Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). This impedes recovery of signals which may have sparse representations in the GFT bases of the ground truth graph. We present an algorithm which simultaneously recovers the signal from the compressive measurements and also corrects the graph perturbations. We analyze some important theoretical properties of the algorithm. Our approach to correction for graph perturbations is based on model selection techniques such as cross-validation in compressed sensing. We validate our algorithm on signals which have a sparse representation in the GFT bases of many commonly used graphs in the network science literature. An application to compressive image reconstruction is also presented, where graph perturbations are modeled as undesirable graph edges linking pixels with significant intensity difference. In all experiments, our algorithm clearly outperforms baseline techniques which either ignore the perturbations or use first order approximations to the perturbations in the GFT bases.

- **Summary**: Safety is of utmost importance for perception in automated driving (AD). However, a prime safety concern in state-of-the art object detection is that standard evaluation schemes utilize safety-agnostic metrics to argue sufficient detection performance. Hence, it is imperative to leverage supplementary domain knowledge to accentuate safety-critical misdetections during evaluation tasks. To tackle the underspecification, this paper introduces a novel credibility metric, called c-flow, for pedestrian bounding boxes. To this end, c-flow relies on a complementary optical flow signal from image sequences and enhances the analyses of safety-critical misdetections without requiring additional labels. We implement and evaluate c-flow with a state-of-the-art pedestrian detector on a large AD dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that c-flow allows developers to identify safety-critical misdetections.

- **Summary**: Guidance for assemblable parts is a promising field for augmented reality. Augmented reality assembly guidance requires 6D object poses of target objects in real time. Especially in time-critical medical or industrial settings, continuous and markerless tracking of individual parts is essential to visualize instructions superimposed on or next to the target object parts. In this regard, occlusions by the user's hand or other objects and the complexity of different assembly states complicate robust and real-time markerless multi-object tracking. To address this problem, we present Graph-based Object Tracking (GBOT), a novel graph-based single-view RGB-D tracking approach. The real-time markerless multi-object tracking is initialized via 6D pose estimation and updates the graph-based assembly poses. The tracking through various assembly states is achieved by our novel multi-state assembly graph. We update the multi-state assembly graph by utilizing the relative poses of the individual assembly parts. Linking the individual objects in this graph enables more robust object tracking during the assembly process. For evaluation, we introduce a synthetic dataset of publicly available and 3D printable assembly assets as a benchmark for future work. Quantitative experiments in synthetic data and further qualitative study in real test data show that GBOT can outperform existing work towards enabling context-aware augmented reality assembly guidance. Dataset and code will be made publically available.

- **Summary**: Combining LiDAR and camera data has shown potential in enhancing short-distance object detection in autonomous driving systems. Yet, the fusion encounters difficulties with extended distance detection due to the contrast between LiDAR's sparse data and the dense resolution of cameras. Besides, discrepancies in the two data representations further complicate fusion methods. We introduce AYDIV, a novel framework integrating a tri-phase alignment process specifically designed to enhance long-distance detection even amidst data discrepancies. AYDIV consists of the Global Contextual Fusion Alignment Transformer (GCFAT), which improves the extraction of camera features and provides a deeper understanding of large-scale patterns; the Sparse Fused Feature Attention (SFFA), which fine-tunes the fusion of LiDAR and camera details; and the Volumetric Grid Attention (VGA) for a comprehensive spatial data fusion. AYDIV's performance on the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) with an improvement of 1.24% in mAPH value(L2 difficulty) and the Argoverse2 Dataset with a performance improvement of 7.40% in AP value demonstrates its efficacy in comparison to other existing fusion-based methods.

- **Summary**: The acquisition of large-scale, precisely labeled datasets for person re-identification (ReID) poses a significant challenge. Weakly supervised ReID has begun to address this issue, although its performance lags behind fully supervised methods. In response, we introduce Contrastive Multiple Instance Learning (CMIL), a novel framework tailored for more effective weakly supervised ReID. CMIL distinguishes itself by requiring only a single model and no pseudo labels while leveraging contrastive losses -- a technique that has significantly enhanced traditional ReID performance yet is absent in all prior MIL-based approaches. Through extensive experiments and analysis across three datasets, CMIL not only matches state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale SYSU-30k dataset with fewer assumptions but also consistently outperforms all baselines on the WL-market1501 and Weakly Labeled MUddy racer re-iDentification dataset (WL-MUDD) datasets. We introduce and release the WL-MUDD dataset, an extension of the MUDD dataset featuring naturally occurring weak labels from the real-world application at PerformancePhoto.co.

- **Summary**: Patients with atrial fibrillation have a 5-7 fold increased risk of having an ischemic stroke. In these cases, the most common site of thrombus localization is inside the left atrial appendage (LAA) and studies have shown a correlation between the LAA shape and the risk of ischemic stroke. These studies make use of manual measurement and qualitative assessment of shape and are therefore prone to large inter-observer discrepancies, which may explain the contradictions between the conclusions in different studies. We argue that quantitative shape descriptors are necessary to robustly characterize LAA morphology and relate to other functional parameters and stroke risk.   Deep Learning methods are becoming standardly available for segmenting cardiovascular structures from high resolution images such as computed tomography (CT), but only few have been tested for LAA segmentation. Furthermore, the majority of segmentation algorithms produces non-smooth 3D models that are not ideal for further processing, such as statistical shape analysis or computational fluid modelling. In this paper we present a fully automatic pipeline for image segmentation, mesh model creation and statistical shape modelling of the LAA. The LAA anatomy is implicitly represented as a signed distance field (SDF), which is directly regressed from the CT image using Deep Learning. The SDF is further used for registering the LAA shapes to a common template and build a statistical shape model (SSM). Based on 106 automatically segmented LAAs, the built SSM reveals that the LAA shape can be quantified using approximately 5 PCA modes and allows the identification of two distinct shape clusters corresponding to the so-called chicken-wing and non-chicken-wing morphologies.

- **Summary**: Successfully addressing a wide variety of tasks is a core ability of autonomous agents, which requires flexibly adapting the underlying decision-making strategies and, as we argue in this work, also adapting the underlying perception modules. An analogical argument would be the human visual system, which uses top-down signals to focus attention determined by the current task. Similarly, in this work, we adapt pre-trained large vision models conditioned on specific downstream tasks in the context of multi-task policy learning. We introduce task-conditioned adapters that do not require finetuning any pre-trained weights, combined with a single policy trained with behavior cloning and capable of addressing multiple tasks. We condition the policy and visual adapters on task embeddings, which can be selected at inference if the task is known, or alternatively inferred from a set of example demonstrations. To this end, we propose a new optimization-based estimator. We evaluate the method on a wide variety of tasks of the CortexBench benchmark and show that, compared to existing work, it can be addressed with a single policy. In particular, we demonstrate that adapting visual features is a key design choice and that the method generalizes to unseen tasks given visual demonstrations.

- **Summary**: In mixed-initiative conversational search systems, clarifying questions are used to help users who struggle to express their intentions in a single query. These questions aim to uncover user's information needs and resolve query ambiguities. We hypothesize that in scenarios where multimodal information is pertinent, the clarification process can be improved by using non-textual information. Therefore, we propose to add images to clarifying questions and formulate the novel task of asking multimodal clarifying questions in open-domain, mixed-initiative conversational search systems. To facilitate research into this task, we collect a dataset named Melon that contains over 4k multimodal clarifying questions, enriched with over 14k images. We also propose a multimodal query clarification model named Marto and adopt a prompt-based, generative fine-tuning strategy to perform the training of different stages with different prompts. Several analyses are conducted to understand the importance of multimodal contents during the query clarification phase. Experimental results indicate that the addition of images leads to significant improvements of up to 90% in retrieval performance when selecting the relevant images. Extensive analyses are also performed to show the superiority of Marto compared with discriminative baselines in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Segmentations are crucial in medical imaging to obtain morphological, volumetric, and radiomics biomarkers. Manual segmentation is accurate but not feasible in the radiologist's clinical workflow, while automatic segmentation generally obtains sub-par performance. We therefore developed a minimally interactive deep learning-based segmentation method for soft-tissue tumors (STTs) on CT and MRI. The method requires the user to click six points near the tumor's extreme boundaries. These six points are transformed into a distance map and serve, with the image, as input for a Convolutional Neural Network. For training and validation, a multicenter dataset containing 514 patients and nine STT types in seven anatomical locations was used, resulting in a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.85$\pm$0.11 (mean $\pm$ standard deviation (SD)) for CT and 0.84$\pm$0.12 for T1-weighted MRI, when compared to manual segmentations made by expert radiologists. Next, the method was externally validated on a dataset including five unseen STT phenotypes in extremities, achieving 0.81$\pm$0.08 for CT, 0.84$\pm$0.09 for T1-weighted MRI, and 0.88\pm0.08 for previously unseen T2-weighted fat-saturated (FS) MRI. In conclusion, our minimally interactive segmentation method effectively segments different types of STTs on CT and MRI, with robust generalization to previously unseen phenotypes and imaging modalities.

- **Summary**: The detection of human parts (e.g., hands, face) and their correct association with individuals is an essential task, e.g., for ubiquitous human-machine interfaces and action recognition. Traditional methods often employ multi-stage processes, rely on cumbersome anchor-based systems, or do not scale well to larger part sets. This paper presents PBADet, a novel one-stage, anchor-free approach for part-body association detection. Building upon the anchor-free object representation across multi-scale feature maps, we introduce a singular part-to-body center offset that effectively encapsulates the relationship between parts and their parent bodies. Our design is inherently versatile and capable of managing multiple parts-to-body associations without compromising on detection accuracy or robustness. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets underscore the efficacy of our approach, which not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques but also offers a more streamlined and efficient solution to the part-body association challenge.

- **Summary**: Fine-grained grocery object recognition is an important computer vision problem with broad applications in automatic checkout, in-store robotic navigation, and assistive technologies for the visually impaired. Existing datasets on groceries are mainly 2D images. Models trained on these datasets are limited to learning features from the regular 2D grids. While portable 3D sensors such as Kinect were commonly available for mobile phones, sensors such as LiDAR and TrueDepth, have recently been integrated into mobile phones. Despite the availability of mobile 3D sensors, there are currently no dedicated real-world large-scale benchmark 3D datasets for grocery. In addition, existing 3D datasets lack fine-grained grocery categories and have limited training samples. Furthermore, collecting data by going around the object versus the traditional photo capture makes data collection cumbersome. Thus, we introduce a large-scale grocery dataset called 3DGrocery100. It constitutes 100 classes, with a total of 87,898 3D point clouds created from 10,755 RGB-D single-view images. We benchmark our dataset on six recent state-of-the-art 3D point cloud classification models. Additionally, we also benchmark the dataset on few-shot and continual learning point cloud classification tasks. Project Page: https://bigdatavision.org/3DGrocery100/.

- **Summary**: Structural pruning of neural networks conventionally relies on identifying and discarding less important neurons, a practice often resulting in significant accuracy loss that necessitates subsequent fine-tuning efforts. This paper introduces a novel approach named Intra-Fusion, challenging this prevailing pruning paradigm. Unlike existing methods that focus on designing meaningful neuron importance metrics, Intra-Fusion redefines the overlying pruning procedure. Through utilizing the concepts of model fusion and Optimal Transport, we leverage an agnostically given importance metric to arrive at a more effective sparse model representation. Notably, our approach achieves substantial accuracy recovery without the need for resource-intensive fine-tuning, making it an efficient and promising tool for neural network compression.   Additionally, we explore how fusion can be added to the pruning process to significantly decrease the training time while maintaining competitive performance. We benchmark our results for various networks on commonly used datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. More broadly, we hope that the proposed Intra-Fusion approach invigorates exploration into a fresh alternative to the predominant compression approaches.

- **Summary**: Visually-conditioned language models (VLMs) have seen growing adoption in applications such as visual dialogue, scene understanding, and robotic task planning; adoption that has fueled a wealth of new models such as LLaVa, InstructBLIP, and PaLI-3. Despite the volume of new releases, key design decisions around image preprocessing, architecture, and optimization are under-explored, making it challenging to understand what factors account for model performance $-$ a challenge further complicated by the lack of objective, consistent evaluations. To address these gaps, we first compile a suite of standardized evaluations spanning visual question answering, object localization from language, and targeted challenge sets that probe properties such as hallucination; evaluations that provide calibrated, fine-grained insight into a VLM's capabilities. Second, we rigorously investigate VLMs along key design axes, including pretrained visual representations and quantifying the tradeoffs of using base vs. instruct-tuned language models, amongst others. We couple our analysis with three resource contributions: (1) a unified framework for evaluating VLMs, (2) optimized, flexible code for VLM training, and (3) checkpoints for all models, including a family of VLMs at the 7-13B scale that strictly outperform InstructBLIP and LLaVa v1.5, the state-of-the-art in open-source VLMs.

- **Summary**: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across a variety of tasks, from logical reasoning to visual understanding. This opens the door to richer interaction with the world, for example robotic control. However, VLMs produce only textual outputs, while robotic control and other spatial tasks require outputting continuous coordinates, actions, or trajectories. How can we enable VLMs to handle such settings without fine-tuning on task-specific data?   In this paper, we propose a novel visual prompting approach for VLMs that we call Prompting with Iterative Visual Optimization (PIVOT), which casts tasks as iterative visual question answering. In each iteration, the image is annotated with a visual representation of proposals that the VLM can refer to (e.g., candidate robot actions, localizations, or trajectories). The VLM then selects the best ones for the task. These proposals are iteratively refined, allowing the VLM to eventually zero in on the best available answer. We investigate PIVOT on real-world robotic navigation, real-world manipulation from images, instruction following in simulation, and additional spatial inference tasks such as localization. We find, perhaps surprisingly, that our approach enables zero-shot control of robotic systems without any robot training data, navigation in a variety of environments, and other capabilities. Although current performance is far from perfect, our work highlights potentials and limitations of this new regime and shows a promising approach for Internet-Scale VLMs in robotic and spatial reasoning domains.

- **Summary**: Low-light conditions and occluded scenarios impede object detection in real-world Internet of Things (IoT) applications like autonomous vehicles and security systems. While advanced machine learning models strive for accuracy, their computational demands clash with the limitations of resource-constrained devices, hampering real-time performance. In our current research, we tackle this challenge, by introducing "YOLO Phantom", one of the smallest YOLO models ever conceived. YOLO Phantom utilizes the novel Phantom Convolution block, achieving comparable accuracy to the latest YOLOv8n model while simultaneously reducing both parameters and model size by 43%, resulting in a significant 19% reduction in Giga Floating Point Operations (GFLOPs). YOLO Phantom leverages transfer learning on our multimodal RGB-infrared dataset to address low-light and occlusion issues, equipping it with robust vision under adverse conditions. Its real-world efficacy is demonstrated on an IoT platform with advanced low-light and RGB cameras, seamlessly connecting to an AWS-based notification endpoint for efficient real-time object detection. Benchmarks reveal a substantial boost of 17% and 14% in frames per second (FPS) for thermal and RGB detection, respectively, compared to the baseline YOLOv8n model. For community contribution, both the code and the multimodal dataset are available on GitHub.

- **Summary**: Amidst growing food production demands, early plant disease detection is essential to safeguard crops; this study proposes a visual machine learning approach for plant disease detection, harnessing RGB and NIR data collected in real-world conditions through a JAI FS-1600D-10GE camera to build an RGBN dataset. A two-stage early plant disease detection model with YOLOv8 and a sequential CNN was used to train on a dataset with partial labels, which showed a 3.6% increase in mAP compared to a single-stage end-to-end segmentation model. The sequential CNN model achieved 90.62% validation accuracy utilising RGBN data. An average of 6.25% validation accuracy increase is found using RGBN in classification compared to RGB using ResNet15 and the sequential CNN models. Further research and dataset improvements are needed to meet food production demands.

- **Summary**: The performance of an imaging system is limited by optical aberrations, which cause blurriness in the resulting image. Digital correction techniques, such as deconvolution, have limited ability to correct the blur, since some spatial frequencies in the scene are not measured adequately (i.e., 'zeros' of the system transfer function). We prove that the addition of a random mask to an imaging system removes its dependence on aberrations, reducing the likelihood of zeros in the transfer function and consequently decreasing the sensitivity to noise during deconvolution. In simulation, we show that this strategy improves image quality over a range of aberration types, aberration strengths, and signal-to-noise ratios.
