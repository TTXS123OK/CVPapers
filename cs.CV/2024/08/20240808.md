- **Summary**: Remote sensing image change detection (CD) is essential for analyzing land surface changes over time, with a significant challenge being the differentiation of actual changes from complex scenes while filtering out pseudo-changes. A primary contributor to this challenge is the intra-class dynamic changes due to phenological characteristics in natural areas. To overcome this, we introduce the InPhea model, which integrates phenological features into a remote sensing image CD framework. The model features a detector with a differential attention module for improved feature representation of change information, coupled with high-resolution feature extraction and spatial pyramid blocks to enhance performance. Additionally, a constrainer with four constraint modules and a multi-stage contrastive learning approach is employed to aid in the model's understanding of phenological characteristics. Experiments on the HRSCD, SECD, and PSCD-Wuhan datasets reveal that InPhea outperforms other models, confirming its effectiveness in addressing phenological pseudo-changes and its overall model superiority.

- **Summary**: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in integrating semantic information between images and text through contrastive learning techniques. It has achieved remarkable performance in various multimodal tasks. However, the deployment of large CLIP models is hindered in resource-limited environments, while smaller models frequently fall short of meeting performance benchmarks necessary for practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, coined as ComKD-CLIP: Comprehensive Knowledge Distillation for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-traning Model, which aims to comprehensively distill the knowledge from a large teacher CLIP model into a smaller student model, ensuring comparable performance with significantly reduced parameters. ComKD-CLIP is composed of two key mechanisms: Image Feature Alignment (IFAlign) and Educational Attention (EduAttention). IFAlign makes the image features extracted by the student model closely match those extracted by the teacher model, enabling the student to learn teacher's knowledge of extracting image features. EduAttention explores the cross-relationships between text features extracted by the teacher model and image features extracted by the student model, enabling the student model to learn how the teacher model integrates text-image features. In addition, ComKD-CLIP can refine the knowledge distilled from IFAlign and EduAttention leveraging the results of text-image feature fusion by the teacher model, ensuring student model accurately absorbs the knowledge of teacher model. Extensive experiments conducted on 11 datasets have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: In computer vision, traditional ensemble learning methods exhibit either a low training efficiency or the limited performance to enhance the reliability of deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, loss-function-free, and architecture-agnostic ensemble learning by the Decorrelating Structure via Adapters (DSA) for various visual tasks. Concretely, the proposed DSA leverages the structure-diverse adapters to decorrelate multiple prediction heads without any tailed regularization or loss. This allows DSA to be easily extensible to architecture-agnostic networks for a range of computer vision tasks. Importantly, the theoretically analysis shows that the proposed DSA has a lower bias and variance than that of the single head based method (which is adopted by most of the state of art approaches). Consequently, the DSA makes deep networks reliable and robust for the various real-world challenges, \textit{e.g.}, data corruption, and label noises. Extensive experiments combining the proposed method with FreeMatch achieved the accuracy improvements of 5.35% on CIFAR-10 dataset with 40 labeled data and 0.71% on CIFAR-100 dataset with 400 labeled data. Besides, combining the proposed method with DualPose achieved the improvements in the Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK) by 2.08% on the Sniffing dataset with 100 data (30 labeled data), 5.2% on the FLIC dataset with 100 data (including 50 labeled data), and 2.35% on the LSP dataset with 200 data (100 labeled data).

- **Summary**: Transformer-based deep models for single image super-resolution (SISR) have greatly improved the performance of lightweight SISR tasks in recent years. However, they often suffer from heavy computational burden and slow inference due to the complex calculation of multi-head self-attention (MSA), seriously hindering their practical application and deployment. In this work, we present an efficient SR model to mitigate the dilemma between model efficiency and SR performance, which is dubbed Entropy Attention and Receptive Field Augmentation network (EARFA), and composed of a novel entropy attention (EA) and a shifting large kernel attention (SLKA). From the perspective of information theory, EA increases the entropy of intermediate features conditioned on a Gaussian distribution, providing more informative input for subsequent reasoning. On the other hand, SLKA extends the receptive field of SR models with the assistance of channel shifting, which also favors to boost the diversity of hierarchical features. Since the implementation of EA and SLKA does not involve complex computations (such as extensive matrix multiplications), the proposed method can achieve faster nonlinear inference than Transformer-based SR models while maintaining better SR performance. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model can significantly reduce the delay of model inference while achieving the SR performance comparable with other advanced models.

- **Summary**: Accurate cancer survival prediction is crucial for assisting clinical doctors in formulating treatment plans. Multimodal data, including histopathological images and genomic data, offer complementary and comprehensive information that can greatly enhance the accuracy of this task. However, the current methods, despite yielding promising results, suffer from two notable limitations: they do not effectively utilize global context and disregard modal uncertainty. In this study, we put forward a neural network model called M2EF-NNs, which leverages multimodal and multi-instance evidence fusion techniques for accurate cancer survival prediction. Specifically, to capture global information in the images, we use a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model to obtain patch feature embeddings of histopathological images. Then, we introduce a multimodal attention module that uses genomic embeddings as queries and learns the co-attention mapping between genomic and histopathological images to achieve an early interaction fusion of multimodal information and better capture their correlations. Subsequently, we are the first to apply the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DST) to cancer survival prediction. We parameterize the distribution of class probabilities using the processed multimodal features and introduce subjective logic to estimate the uncertainty associated with different modalities. By combining with the Dempster-Shafer theory, we can dynamically adjust the weights of class probabilities after multimodal fusion to achieve trusted survival prediction. Finally, Experimental validation on the TCGA datasets confirms the significant improvements achieved by our proposed method in cancer survival prediction and enhances the reliability of the model.

- **Summary**: Non-blind rotary motion deblurring (RMD) aims to recover the latent clear image from a rotary motion blurred (RMB) image. The rotation center is a crucial input parameter in non-blind RMD methods. Existing methods directly estimate the rotation center from the RMB image. However they always suffer significant errors, and the performance of RMD is limited. For the assembled imaging systems, the position of the rotation center remains fixed. Leveraging this prior knowledge, we propose a geometric-based method for rotation center identification and analyze its error range. Furthermore, we construct a RMB imaging system. The experiment demonstrates that our method achieves less than 1-pixel error along a single axis (x-axis or y-axis). We utilize the constructed imaging system to capture real RMB images, and experimental results show that our method can help existing RMD approaches yield better RMD images.

- **Summary**: Deep networks have shown impressive performance in the image restoration tasks, such as image colorization. However, we find that previous approaches rely on the digital representation from single color model with a specific mapping function, a.k.a., color space, during the colorization pipeline. In this paper, we first investigate the modeling of different color spaces, and find each of them exhibiting distinctive characteristics with unique distribution of colors. The complementarity among multiple color spaces leads to benefits for the image colorization task.   We present MultiColor, a new learning-based approach to automatically colorize grayscale images that combines clues from multiple color spaces. Specifically, we employ a set of dedicated colorization modules for individual color space. Within each module, a transformer decoder is first employed to refine color query embeddings and then a color mapper produces color channel prediction using the embeddings and semantic features. With these predicted color channels representing various color spaces, a complementary network is designed to exploit the complementarity and generate pleasing and reasonable colorized images. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate superior performance over the state-of-the-arts.

- **Summary**: A Bregman manifold is a synonym for a dually flat space in information geometry which admits as a canonical divergence a Bregman divergence. Bregman manifolds are induced by smooth strictly convex functions like the cumulant or partition functions of regular exponential families, the negative entropy of mixture families, or the characteristic functions of regular cones just to list a few such convex Bregman generators. We describe the design of pyBregMan, a library which implements generic operations on Bregman manifolds and instantiate several common Bregman manifolds used in information sciences. At the core of the library is the notion of Legendre-Fenchel duality inducing a canonical pair of dual potential functions and dual Bregman divergences. The library also implements the Fisher-Rao manifolds of categorical/multinomial distributions and multivariate normal distributions. To demonstrate the use of the pyBregMan kernel manipulating those Bregman and Fisher-Rao manifolds, the library also provides several core algorithms for various applications in statistics, machine learning, information fusion, and so on.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework specifically designed for the medical domain, called \textbf{MedGraphRAG}, aimed at enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities and generating evidence-based results, thereby improving safety and reliability when handling private medical data. Our comprehensive pipeline begins with a hybrid static-semantic approach to document chunking, significantly improving context capture over traditional methods. Extracted entities are used to create a three-tier hierarchical graph structure, linking entities to foundational medical knowledge sourced from medical papers and dictionaries. These entities are then interconnected to form meta-graphs, which are merged based on semantic similarities to develop a comprehensive global graph. This structure supports precise information retrieval and response generation. The retrieval process employs a U-retrieve method to balance global awareness and indexing efficiency of the LLM. Our approach is validated through a comprehensive ablation study comparing various methods for document chunking, graph construction, and information retrieval. The results not only demonstrate that our hierarchical graph construction method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple medical Q\&A benchmarks, but also confirms that the responses generated include source documentation, significantly enhancing the reliability of medical LLMs in practical applications.

- **Summary**: Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrated impressive performance in zero-shot promptable segmentation on natural images. The recently released Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) model claims to have better performance than SAM on images while extending the model's capabilities to video segmentation. It is important to evaluate the recent model's ability in medical image segmentation in a zero-shot promptable manner. In this work, we performed extensive studies with multiple datasets from different imaging modalities to compare the performance between SAM and SAM 2. We used two point prompt strategies: (i) single positive prompt near the centroid of the target structure and (ii) additional positive prompts placed randomly within the target structure. The evaluation included 21 unique organ-modality combinations including abdominal structures, cardiac structures, and fetal head images acquired from publicly available MRI, CT, and Ultrasound datasets. The preliminary results, based on 2D images, indicate that while SAM 2 may perform slightly better in a few cases, but it does not in general surpass SAM for medical image segmentation. Especially when the contrast is lower like in CT, Ultrasound images, SAM 2 performs poorly than SAM. For MRI images, SAM 2 performs at par or better than SAM. Similar to SAM, SAM 2 also suffers from over-segmentation issue especially when the boundaries of the to-be-segmented organ is fuzzy in nature.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models (DM) have become fundamental components of generative models, excelling across various domains such as image creation, audio generation, and complex data interpolation. Signal-to-Noise diffusion models constitute a diverse family covering most state-of-the-art diffusion models. While there have been several attempts to study Signal-to-Noise (S2N) diffusion models from various perspectives, there remains a need for a comprehensive study connecting different viewpoints and exploring new perspectives. In this study, we offer a comprehensive perspective on noise schedulers, examining their role through the lens of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and its connections to information theory. Building upon this framework, we have developed a generalized backward equation to enhance the performance of the inference process.

- **Summary**: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) are flourishing and has advanced many video-language tasks. As a golden testbed, Video Question Answering (VideoQA) plays pivotal role in Video-LLM developing. This work conducts a timely and comprehensive study of Video-LLMs' behavior in VideoQA, aiming to elucidate their success and failure modes, and provide insights towards more human-like video understanding and question answering. Our analyses demonstrate that Video-LLMs excel in VideoQA; they can correlate contextual cues and generate plausible responses to questions about varied video contents. However, models falter in handling video temporality, both in reasoning about temporal content ordering and grounding QA-relevant temporal moments. Moreover, the models behave unintuitively - they are unresponsive to adversarial video perturbations while being sensitive to simple variations of candidate answers and questions. Also, they do not necessarily generalize better. The findings demonstrate Video-LLMs' QA capability in standard condition yet highlight their severe deficiency in robustness and interpretability, suggesting the urgent need on rationales in Video-LLM developing.

- **Summary**: Aerial imagery analysis is critical for many research fields. However, obtaining frequent high-quality aerial images is not always accessible due to its high effort and cost requirements. One solution is to use the Ground-to-Aerial (G2A) technique to synthesize aerial images from easily collectible ground images. However, G2A is rarely studied, because of its challenges, including but not limited to, the drastic view changes, occlusion, and range of visibility. In this paper, we present a novel Geometric Preserving Ground-to-Aerial (G2A) image synthesis (GPG2A) model that can generate realistic aerial images from ground images. GPG2A consists of two stages. The first stage predicts the Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation (referred to as the BEV layout map) from the ground image. The second stage synthesizes the aerial image from the predicted BEV layout map and text descriptions of the ground image. To train our model, we present a new multi-modal cross-view dataset, namely VIGORv2 which is built upon VIGOR with newly collected aerial images, maps, and text descriptions. Our extensive experiments illustrate that GPG2A synthesizes better geometry-preserved aerial images than existing models. We also present two applications, data augmentation for cross-view geo-localization and sketch-based region search, to further verify the effectiveness of our GPG2A. The code and data will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Infrared imaging and turbulence strength measurements are in widespread demand in many fields. This paper introduces a Physical Prior Guided Cooperative Learning (P2GCL) framework to jointly enhance atmospheric turbulence strength estimation and infrared image restoration. P2GCL involves a cyclic collaboration between two models, i.e., a TMNet measures turbulence strength and outputs the refractive index structure constant (Cn2) as a physical prior, a TRNet conducts infrared image sequence restoration based on Cn2 and feeds the restored images back to the TMNet to boost the measurement accuracy. A novel Cn2-guided frequency loss function and a physical constraint loss are introduced to align the training process with physical theories. Experiments demonstrate P2GCL achieves the best performance for both turbulence strength estimation (improving Cn2 MAE by 0.0156, enhancing R2 by 0.1065) and image restoration (enhancing PSNR by 0.2775 dB), validating the significant impact of physical prior guided cooperative learning.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces LLDif, a novel diffusion-based facial expression recognition (FER) framework tailored for extremely low-light (LL) environments. Images captured under such conditions often suffer from low brightness and significantly reduced contrast, presenting challenges to conventional methods. These challenges include poor image quality that can significantly reduce the accuracy of emotion recognition. LLDif addresses these issues with a novel two-stage training process that combines a Label-aware CLIP (LA-CLIP), an embedding prior network (PNET), and a transformer-based network adept at handling the noise of low-light images. The first stage involves LA-CLIP generating a joint embedding prior distribution (EPD) to guide the LLformer in label recovery. In the second stage, the diffusion model (DM) refines the EPD inference, ultilising the compactness of EPD for precise predictions. Experimental evaluations on various LL-FER datasets have shown that LLDif achieves competitive performance, underscoring its potential to enhance FER applications in challenging lighting conditions.

- **Summary**: With the exponential growth of multimedia data, leveraging multimodal sensors presents a promising approach for improving accuracy in human activity recognition. Nevertheless, accurately identifying these activities using both video data and wearable sensor data presents challenges due to the labor-intensive data annotation, and reliance on external pretrained models or additional data. To address these challenges, we introduce Multimodal Masked Autoencoders-Based One-Shot Learning (Mu-MAE). Mu-MAE integrates a multimodal masked autoencoder with a synchronized masking strategy tailored for wearable sensors. This masking strategy compels the networks to capture more meaningful spatiotemporal features, which enables effective self-supervised pretraining without the need for external data. Furthermore, Mu-MAE leverages the representation extracted from multimodal masked autoencoders as prior information input to a cross-attention multimodal fusion layer. This fusion layer emphasizes spatiotemporal features requiring attention across different modalities while highlighting differences from other classes, aiding in the classification of various classes in metric-based one-shot learning. Comprehensive evaluations on MMAct one-shot classification show that Mu-MAE outperforms all the evaluated approaches, achieving up to an 80.17% accuracy for five-way one-shot multimodal classification, without the use of additional data.

- **Summary**: We present InstantStyleGaussian, an innovative 3D style transfer method based on the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene representation. By inputting a target style image, it quickly generates new 3D GS scenes. Our approach operates on pre-reconstructed GS scenes, combining diffusion models with an improved iterative dataset update strategy. It utilizes diffusion models to generate target style images, adds these new images to the training dataset, and uses this dataset to iteratively update and optimize the GS scenes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method ensures high-quality stylized scenes while offering significant advantages in style transfer speed and consistency.

- **Summary**: Edge detection is crucial in medical image processing, enabling precise extraction of structural information to support lesion identification and image analysis. Traditional edge detection models typically rely on complex Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformer architectures. Due to their numerous parameters and high computational demands, these models are limited in their application on resource-constrained devices. This paper presents an ultra-lightweight edge detection model (UHNet), characterized by its minimal parameter count, rapid computation speed, negligible of pre-training costs, and commendable performance. UHNet boasts impressive performance metrics with 42.3k parameters, 166 FPS, and 0.79G FLOPs. By employing an innovative feature extraction module and optimized residual connection method, UHNet significantly reduces model complexity and computational requirements. Additionally, a lightweight feature fusion strategy is explored, enhancing detection accuracy.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates the security vulnerabilities of adversarial-example-based image encryption by executing data reconstruction (DR) attacks on encrypted images. A representative image encryption method is the adversarial visual information hiding (AVIH), which uses type-I adversarial example training to protect gallery datasets used in image recognition tasks. In the AVIH method, the type-I adversarial example approach creates images that appear completely different but are still recognized by machines as the original ones. Additionally, the AVIH method can restore encrypted images to their original forms using a predefined private key generative model. For the best security, assigning a unique key to each image is recommended; however, storage limitations may necessitate some images sharing the same key model. This raises a crucial security question for AVIH: How many images can safely share the same key model without being compromised by a DR attack? To address this question, we introduce a dual-strategy DR attack against the AVIH encryption method by incorporating (1) generative-adversarial loss and (2) augmented identity loss, which prevent DR from overfitting -- an issue akin to that in machine learning. Our numerical results validate this approach through image recognition and re-identification benchmarks, demonstrating that our strategy can significantly enhance the quality of reconstructed images, thereby requiring fewer key-sharing encrypted images. Our source code to reproduce our results will be available soon.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for medical image analysis by harnessing unannotated data. Despite their potential, the existing SSL approaches overlook the high anatomical similarity inherent in medical images. This makes it challenging for SSL methods to capture diverse semantic content in medical images consistently. This work introduces a novel and generalized solution that implicitly exploits anatomical similarities by integrating codebooks in SSL. The codebook serves as a concise and informative dictionary of visual patterns, which not only aids in capturing nuanced anatomical details but also facilitates the creation of robust and generalized feature representations. In this context, we propose CoBooM, a novel framework for self-supervised medical image learning by integrating continuous and discrete representations. The continuous component ensures the preservation of fine-grained details, while the discrete aspect facilitates coarse-grained feature extraction through the structured embedding space. To understand the effectiveness of CoBooM, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various medical datasets encompassing chest X-rays and fundus images. The experimental results reveal a significant performance gain in classification and segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: Exploring the capabilities of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian-based methods in the context of 3D scene reconstruction, this study contrasts these modern approaches with traditional Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. Utilizing datasets such as Replica and ScanNet, we assess performance based on tracking accuracy, mapping fidelity, and view synthesis. Findings reveal that NeRF excels in view synthesis, offering unique capabilities in generating new perspectives from existing data, albeit at slower processing speeds. Conversely, Gaussian-based methods provide rapid processing and significant expressiveness but lack comprehensive scene completion. Enhanced by global optimization and loop closure techniques, newer methods like NICE-SLAM and SplaTAM not only surpass older frameworks such as ORB-SLAM2 in terms of robustness but also demonstrate superior performance in dynamic and complex environments. This comparative analysis bridges theoretical research with practical implications, shedding light on future developments in robust 3D scene reconstruction across various real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Just noticeable distortion (JND), representing the threshold of distortion in an image that is minimally perceptible to the human visual system (HVS), is crucial for image compression algorithms to achieve a trade-off between transmission bit rate and image quality. However, traditional JND prediction methods only rely on pixel-level or sub-band level features, lacking the ability to capture the impact of image content on JND. To bridge this gap, we propose a Semantic-Guided JND (SG-JND) network to leverage semantic information for JND prediction. In particular, SG-JND consists of three essential modules: the image preprocessing module extracts semantic-level patches from images, the feature extraction module extracts multi-layer features by utilizing the cross-scale attention layers, and the JND prediction module regresses the extracted features into the final JND value. Experimental results show that SG-JND achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two publicly available JND datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of SG-JND and highlight the significance of incorporating semantic information in JND assessment.

- **Summary**: Pneumonia, a severe respiratory disease, poses significant diagnostic challenges, especially in underdeveloped regions. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as chest X-rays, suffer from variability in interpretation among radiologists, necessitating reliable automated tools. In this study, we propose a novel approach combining deep learning and transformer-based attention mechanisms to enhance pneumonia detection from chest X-rays. Our method begins with lung segmentation using a TransUNet model that integrates our specialized transformer module, which has fewer parameters compared to common transformers while maintaining performance. This model is trained on the "Chest Xray Masks and Labels" dataset and then applied to the Kermany and Cohen datasets to isolate lung regions, enhancing subsequent classification tasks. For classification, we employ pre-trained ResNet models (ResNet-50 and ResNet-101) to extract multi-scale feature maps, processed through our modified transformer module. By employing our specialized transformer, we attain superior results with significantly fewer parameters compared to common transformer models. Our approach achieves high accuracy rates of 92.79% on the Kermany dataset and 95.11% on the Cohen dataset, ensuring robust and efficient performance suitable for resource-constrained environments.

- **Summary**: The annotation of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Therefore, classifying PolSAR images with limited labels is a challenging task in remote sensing domain. In recent years, self-supervised learning approaches have proven effective in PolSAR image classification with sparse labels. However, we observe a lack of research on generative selfsupervised learning in the studied task. Motivated by this, we propose a dual-branch classification model based on generative self-supervised learning in this paper. The first branch is a superpixel-branch, which learns superpixel-level polarimetric representations using a generative self-supervised graph masked autoencoder. To acquire finer classification results, a convolutional neural networks-based pixel-branch is further incorporated to learn pixel-level features. Classification with fused dual-branch features is finally performed to obtain the predictions. Experimental results on the benchmark Flevoland dataset demonstrate that our approach yields promising classification results.

- **Summary**: Currently, lung cancer is a leading cause of global cancer mortality, often necessitating minimally invasive interventions. Microwave ablation (MWA) is extensively utilized for both primary and secondary lung tumors. Although numerous clinical guidelines and standards for MWA have been established, the clinical evaluation of ablation surgery remains challenging and requires long-term patient follow-up for confirmation. In this paper, we propose a method termed respiratory subtraction to evaluate lung tumor ablation therapy performance based on pre- and post-operative image guidance. Initially, preoperative images undergo coarse rigid registration to their corresponding postoperative positions, followed by further non-rigid registration. Subsequently, subtraction images are generated by subtracting the registered preoperative images from the postoperative ones. Furthermore, to enhance the clinical assessment of MWA treatment performance, we devise a quantitative analysis metric to evaluate ablation efficacy by comparing differences between tumor areas and treatment areas. To the best of our knowledge, this is the pioneering work in the field to facilitate the assessment of MWA surgery performance on pulmonary tumors. Extensive experiments involving 35 clinical cases further validate the efficacy of the respiratory subtraction method. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the respiratory subtraction method and the proposed quantitative evaluation metric in assessing lung tumor treatment.

- **Summary**: The CNN has achieved excellent results in the automatic classification of medical images. In this study, we propose a novel deep residual 3D attention non-local network (NL-RAN) to classify CT images included COVID-19, common pneumonia, and normal to perform rapid and explainable COVID-19 diagnosis. We built a deep residual 3D attention non-local network that could achieve end-to-end training. The network is embedded with a nonlocal module to capture global information, while a 3D attention module is embedded to focus on the details of the lesion so that it can directly analyze the 3D lung CT and output the classification results. The output of the attention module can be used as a heat map to increase the interpretability of the model. 4079 3D CT scans were included in this study. Each scan had a unique label (novel coronavirus pneumonia, common pneumonia, and normal). The CT scans cohort was randomly split into a training set of 3263 scans, a validation set of 408 scans, and a testing set of 408 scans. And compare with existing mainstream classification methods, such as CovNet, CBAM, ResNet, etc. Simultaneously compare the visualization results with visualization methods such as CAM. Model performance was evaluated using the Area Under the ROC Curve(AUC), precision, and F1-score. The NL-RAN achieved the AUC of 0.9903, the precision of 0.9473, and the F1-score of 0.9462, surpass all the classification methods compared. The heat map output by the attention module is also clearer than the heat map output by CAM. Our experimental results indicate that our proposed method performs significantly better than existing methods. In addition, the first attention module outputs a heat map containing detailed outline information to increase the interpretability of the model. Our experiments indicate that the inference of our model is fast. It can provide real-time assistance with diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Many incurable diseases prevalent across global societies stem from various influences, including lifestyle choices, economic conditions, social factors, and genetics. Research predominantly focuses on these diseases due to their widespread nature, aiming to decrease mortality, enhance treatment options, and improve healthcare standards. Among these, kidney disease stands out as a particularly severe condition affecting men and women worldwide. Nonetheless, there is a pressing need for continued research into innovative, early diagnostic methods to develop more effective treatments for such diseases. Recently, automatic diagnosis of Kidney Cancer has become an important challenge especially when using deep learning (DL) due to the importance of training medical datasets, which in most cases are difficult and expensive to obtain. Furthermore, in most cases, algorithms require data from the same domain and a powerful computer with efficient storage capacity. To overcome this issue, a new type of learning known as transfer learning (TL) has been proposed that can produce impressive results based on other different pre-trained data. This paper presents, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first comprehensive survey of DL-based TL frameworks for kidney cancer diagnosis. This is a strong contribution to help researchers understand the current challenges and perspectives of this topic. Hence, the main limitations and advantages of each framework are identified and detailed critical analyses are provided. Looking ahead, the article identifies promising directions for future research. Moving on, the discussion is concluded by reflecting on the pivotal role of TL in the development of precision medicine and its effects on clinical practice and research in oncology.

- **Summary**: Salient Object Detection (SOD) aims to identify and segment the most prominent objects in images. Advanced SOD methods often utilize various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Transformers for deep feature extraction. However, these methods still deliver low performance and poor generalization in complex cases. Recently, Segment Anything Model (SAM) has been proposed as a visual fundamental model, which gives strong segmentation and generalization capabilities. Nonetheless, SAM requires accurate prompts of target objects, which are unavailable in SOD. Additionally, SAM lacks the utilization of multi-scale and multi-level information, as well as the incorporation of fine-grained details. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Multi-scale and Detail-enhanced SAM (MDSAM) for SOD. Specifically, we first introduce a Lightweight Multi-Scale Adapter (LMSA), which allows SAM to learn multi-scale information with very few trainable parameters. Then, we propose a Multi-Level Fusion Module (MLFM) to comprehensively utilize the multi-level information from the SAM's encoder. Finally, we propose a Detail Enhancement Module (DEM) to incorporate SAM with fine-grained details. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our model on multiple SOD datasets and its strong generalization on other segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have significantly impacted the AI community, industry, and various economic sectors. In journalism, integrating AI poses unique challenges and opportunities, particularly in enhancing the quality and efficiency of news reporting. This study explores how LLMs and LMMs can assist journalistic practice by generating contextualised captions for images accompanying news articles. We conducted experiments using the GoodNews dataset to evaluate the ability of LMMs (BLIP-2, GPT-4v, or LLaVA) to incorporate one of two types of context: entire news articles, or extracted named entities. In addition, we compared their performance to a two-stage pipeline composed of a captioning model (BLIP-2, OFA, or ViT-GPT2) with post-hoc contextualisation with LLMs (GPT-4 or LLaMA). We assess a diversity of models, and we find that while the choice of contextualisation model is a significant factor for the two-stage pipelines, this is not the case in the LMMs, where smaller, open-source models perform well compared to proprietary, GPT-powered ones. Additionally, we found that controlling the amount of provided context enhances performance. These results highlight the limitations of a fully automated approach and underscore the necessity for an interactive, human-in-the-loop strategy.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates the impact of self-supervised learning, specifically image rotations, on various class-incremental learning paradigms. Here, each image with a predefined rotation is considered as a new class for training. At inference, all image rotation predictions are aggregated for the final prediction, a strategy we term Aggregated Self-Supervision (AggSS). We observe a shift in the deep neural network's attention towards intrinsic object features as it learns through AggSS strategy. This learning approach significantly enhances class-incremental learning by promoting robust feature learning. AggSS serves as a plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly incorporated into any class-incremental learning framework, leveraging its powerful feature learning capabilities to enhance performance across various class-incremental learning approaches. Extensive experiments conducted on standard incremental learning datasets CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-Subset demonstrate the significant role of AggSS in improving performance within these paradigms.

- **Summary**: Road accidents are quite common in almost every part of the world, and, in majority, fatal accidents are attributed to over speeding of vehicles. The tendency to over speeding is usually tried to be controlled using check points at various parts of the road but not all traffic police have the device to check speed with existing speed estimating devices such as LIDAR based, or Radar based guns. The current project tries to address the issue of vehicle speed estimation with handheld devices such as mobile phones or wearable cameras with network connection to estimate the speed using deep learning frameworks.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing the 3D shape of a deformable environment from the information captured by a moving depth camera is highly relevant to surgery. The underlying challenge is the fact that simultaneously estimating camera motion and tissue deformation in a fully deformable scene is an ill-posed problem, especially from a single arbitrarily moving viewpoint. Current solutions are often organ-specific and lack the robustness required to handle large deformations. Here we propose a multi-viewpoint global optimization framework that can flexibly integrate the output of low-level perception modules (data association, depth, and relative scene flow) with kinematic and scene-modeling priors to jointly estimate multiple camera motions and absolute scene flow. We use simulated noisy data to show three practical examples that successfully constrain the convergence to a unique solution. Overall, our method shows robustness to combined noisy input measures and can process hundreds of points in a few milliseconds. MultiViPerFrOG builds a generalized learning-free scaffolding for spatio-temporal encoding that can unlock advanced surgical scene representations and will facilitate the development of the computer-assisted-surgery technologies of the future.

- **Summary**: Path loss prediction for wireless communications is highly dependent on the local environment. Propagation models including clutter information have been shown to significantly increase model accuracy. This paper explores the application of deep learning to satellite imagery to identify environmental clutter types automatically. Recognizing these clutter types has numerous uses, but our main application is to use clutter information to enhance propagation prediction models. Knowing the type of obstruction (tree, building, and further classifications) can improve the prediction accuracy of key propagation metrics such as path loss.

- **Summary**: As a crucial and intricate task in robotic minimally invasive surgery, reconstructing surgical scenes using stereo or monocular endoscopic video holds immense potential for clinical applications. NeRF-based techniques have recently garnered attention for the ability to reconstruct scenes implicitly. On the other hand, Gaussian splatting-based 3D-GS represents scenes explicitly using 3D Gaussians and projects them onto a 2D plane as a replacement for the complex volume rendering in NeRF. However, these methods face challenges regarding surgical scene reconstruction, such as slow inference, dynamic scenes, and surgical tool occlusion. This work explores and reviews state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, discussing their innovations and implementation principles. Furthermore, we replicate the models and conduct testing and evaluation on two datasets. The test results demonstrate that with advancements in these techniques, achieving real-time, high-quality reconstructions becomes feasible.

- **Summary**: The seismocardiographic signal is a promising alternative to the traditional ECG in the analysis of the cardiac activity. In particular, the systolic complex is known to be the most informative part of the seismocardiogram, thus requiring further analysis. State-of-art solutions to detect the systolic complex are based on Deep Learning models, which have been proven effective in pioneering studies. However, these solutions have only been tested in a controlled scenario considering only clean signals acquired from users maintained still in supine position. On top of that, all these studies consider data coming from a single dataset, ignoring the benefits and challenges related to a cross-dataset scenario. In this work, a cross-dataset experimental analysis was performed considering also data from a real-world scenario. Our findings prove the effectiveness of a deep learning solution, while showing the importance of a personalization step to contrast the domain shift, namely a change in data distribution between training and testing data. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of a multi-channels approach, leveraging the information extracted from both accelerometers and gyroscopes data.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models are effective, yet brittle. Even carefully trained, their behavior tends to be hard to predict when confronted with out-of-distribution samples. In this work, our goal is to propose a simple yet effective solution to predict and describe via natural language potential failure modes of computer vision models. Given a pretrained model and a set of samples, our aim is to find sentences that accurately describe the visual conditions in which the model underperforms. In order to study this important topic and foster future research on it, we formalize the problem of Language-Based Error Explainability (LBEE) and propose a set of metrics to evaluate and compare different methods for this task. We propose solutions that operate in a joint vision-and-language embedding space, and can characterize through language descriptions model failures caused, e.g., by objects unseen during training or adverse visual conditions. We experiment with different tasks, such as classification under the presence of dataset bias and semantic segmentation in unseen environments, and show that the proposed methodology isolates nontrivial sentences associated with specific error causes. We hope our work will help practitioners better understand the behavior of models, increasing their overall safety and interpretability.

- **Summary**: Most of the sophisticated AI models utilize huge amounts of annotated data and heavy training to achieve high-end performance. However, there are certain challenges that hinder the deployment of AI models "in-the-wild" scenarios, i.e., inefficient use of unlabeled data, lack of incorporation of human expertise, and lack of interpretation of the results. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel Explainable Active Learning (XAL) model, XAL-based semantic segmentation model "SegXAL", that can (i) effectively utilize the unlabeled data, (ii) facilitate the "Human-in-the-loop" paradigm, and (iii) augment the model decisions in an interpretable way. In particular, we investigate the application of the SegXAL model for semantic segmentation in driving scene scenarios. The SegXAL model proposes the image regions that require labeling assistance from Oracle by dint of explainable AI (XAI) and uncertainty measures in a weakly-supervised manner. Specifically, we propose a novel Proximity-aware Explainable-AI (PAE) module and Entropy-based Uncertainty (EBU) module to get an Explainable Error Mask, which enables the machine teachers/human experts to provide intuitive reasoning behind the results and to solicit feedback to the AI system via an active learning strategy. Such a mechanism bridges the semantic gap between man and machine through collaborative intelligence, where humans and AI actively enhance each other's complementary strengths. A novel high-confidence sample selection technique based on the DICE similarity coefficient is also presented within the SegXAL framework. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses are carried out in the benchmarking Cityscape dataset. Results show the outperformance of our proposed SegXAL against other state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: Liver cirrhosis, a leading cause of global mortality, requires precise segmentation of ROIs for effective disease monitoring and treatment planning. Existing segmentation models often fail to capture complex feature interactions and generalize across diverse datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel synergistic theory that leverages complementary latent spaces for enhanced feature interaction modeling. Our proposed architecture, nnSynergyNet3D integrates continuous and discrete latent spaces for 3D volumes and features auto-configured training. This approach captures both fine-grained and coarse features, enabling effective modeling of intricate feature interactions. We empirically validated nnSynergyNet3D on a private dataset of 628 high-resolution T1 abdominal MRI scans from 339 patients. Our model outperformed the baseline nnUNet3D by approximately 2%. Additionally, zero-shot testing on healthy liver CT scans from the public LiTS dataset demonstrated superior cross-modal generalization capabilities. These results highlight the potential of synergistic latent space models to improve segmentation accuracy and robustness, thereby enhancing clinical workflows by ensuring consistency across CT and MRI modalities.

- **Summary**: Identifying the regions of a learning resource that a learner pays attention to is crucial for assessing the material's impact and improving its design and related support systems. Saliency detection in videos addresses the automatic recognition of attention-drawing regions in single frames. In educational settings, the recognition of pertinent regions in a video's visual stream can enhance content accessibility and information retrieval tasks such as video segmentation, navigation, and summarization. Such advancements can pave the way for the development of advanced AI-assisted technologies that support learning with greater efficacy. However, this task becomes particularly challenging for educational videos due to the combination of unique characteristics such as text, voice, illustrations, animations, and more. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no study that evaluates saliency detection approaches in educational videos. In this paper, we address this gap by evaluating four state-of-the-art saliency detection approaches for educational videos. We reproduce the original studies and explore the replication capabilities for general-purpose (non-educational) datasets. Then, we investigate the generalization capabilities of the models and evaluate their performance on educational videos. We conduct a comprehensive analysis to identify common failure scenarios and possible areas of improvement. Our experimental results show that educational videos remain a challenging context for generic video saliency detection models.

- **Summary**: Estimating global tree canopy height is crucial for forest conservation and climate change applications. However, capturing high-resolution ground truth canopy height using LiDAR is expensive and not available globally. An efficient alternative is to train a canopy height estimator to operate on single-view remotely sensed imagery. The primary obstacle to this approach is that these methods require significant training data to generalize well globally and across uncommon edge cases. Recent monocular depth estimation foundation models have show strong zero-shot performance even for complex scenes. In this paper we leverage the representations learned by these models to transfer to the remote sensing domain for measuring canopy height. Our findings suggest that our proposed Depth Any Canopy, the result of fine-tuning the Depth Anything v2 model for canopy height estimation, provides a performant and efficient solution, surpassing the current state-of-the-art with superior or comparable performance using only a fraction of the computational resources and parameters. Furthermore, our approach requires less than \$1.30 in compute and results in an estimated carbon footprint of 0.14 kgCO2.

- **Summary**: 3D Content Generation is at the heart of many computer graphics applications, including video gaming, film-making, virtual and augmented reality, etc. This paper proposes a novel deep-learning based approach for automatically generating interactive and playable 3D game scenes, all from the user's casual prompts such as a hand-drawn sketch. Sketch-based input offers a natural, and convenient way to convey the user's design intention in the content creation process. To circumvent the data-deficient challenge in learning (i.e. the lack of large training data of 3D scenes), our method leverages a pre-trained 2D denoising diffusion model to generate a 2D image of the scene as the conceptual guidance. In this process, we adopt the isometric projection mode to factor out unknown camera poses while obtaining the scene layout. From the generated isometric image, we use a pre-trained image understanding method to segment the image into meaningful parts, such as off-ground objects, trees, and buildings, and extract the 2D scene layout. These segments and layouts are subsequently fed into a procedural content generation (PCG) engine, such as a 3D video game engine like Unity or Unreal, to create the 3D scene. The resulting 3D scene can be seamlessly integrated into a game development environment and is readily playable. Extensive tests demonstrate that our method can efficiently generate high-quality and interactive 3D game scenes with layouts that closely follow the user's intention.

- **Summary**: The advent of large models, also known as foundation models, has significantly transformed the AI research landscape, with models like Segment Anything (SAM) achieving notable success in diverse image segmentation scenarios. Despite its advancements, SAM encountered limitations in handling some complex low-level segmentation tasks like camouflaged object and medical imaging. In response, in 2023, we introduced SAM-Adapter, which demonstrated improved performance on these challenging tasks. Now, with the release of Segment Anything 2 (SAM2), a successor with enhanced architecture and a larger training corpus, we reassess these challenges. This paper introduces SAM2-Adapter, the first adapter designed to overcome the persistent limitations observed in SAM2 and achieve new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in specific downstream tasks including medical image segmentation, camouflaged (concealed) object detection, and shadow detection. SAM2-Adapter builds on the SAM-Adapter's strengths, offering enhanced generalizability and composability for diverse applications. We present extensive experimental results demonstrating SAM2-Adapter's effectiveness. We show the potential and encourage the research community to leverage the SAM2 model with our SAM2-Adapter for achieving superior segmentation outcomes.

- **Summary**: Capturing and rendering novel views of complex real-world scenes is a long-standing problem in computer graphics and vision, with applications in augmented and virtual reality, immersive experiences and 3D photography. The advent of deep learning has enabled revolutionary advances in this area, classically known as image-based rendering. However, previous approaches require intractably dense view sampling or provide little or no guidance for how users should sample views of a scene to reliably render high-quality novel views. Local light field fusion proposes an algorithm for practical view synthesis from an irregular grid of sampled views that first expands each sampled view into a local light field via a multiplane image scene representation, then renders novel views by blending adjacent local light fields. Crucially, we extend traditional plenoptic sampling theory to derive a bound that specifies precisely how densely users should sample views of a given scene when using our algorithm. We achieve the perceptual quality of Nyquist rate view sampling while using up to 4000x fewer views. Subsequent developments have led to new scene representations for deep learning with view synthesis, notably neural radiance fields, but the problem of sparse view synthesis from a small number of images has only grown in importance. We reprise some of the recent results on sparse and even single image view synthesis, while posing the question of whether prescriptive sampling guidelines are feasible for the new generation of image-based rendering algorithms.

- **Summary**: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is a challenging task in which, given a partially labelled dataset, models must categorize all unlabelled instances, regardless of whether they come from labelled categories or from new ones. In this paper, we challenge a remaining assumption in this task: that all images share the same domain. Specifically, we introduce a new task and method to handle GCD when the unlabelled data also contains images from different domains to the labelled set. Our proposed `HiLo' networks extract High-level semantic and Low-level domain features, before minimizing the mutual information between the representations. Our intuition is that the clusterings based on domain information and semantic information should be independent. We further extend our method with a specialized domain augmentation tailored for the GCD task, as well as a curriculum learning approach. Finally, we construct a benchmark from corrupted fine-grained datasets as well as a large-scale evaluation on DomainNet with real-world domain shifts, reimplementing a number of GCD baselines in this setting. We demonstrate that HiLo outperforms SoTA category discovery models by a large margin on all evaluations.

- **Summary**: The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) 2 has demonstrated remarkable foundational competence in semantic segmentation, with its memory mechanism and mask decoder further addressing challenges in video tracking and object occlusion, thereby achieving superior results in interactive segmentation for both images and videos. Building upon our previous empirical studies, we further explore the zero-shot segmentation performance of SAM 2 in robot-assisted surgery based on prompts, alongside its robustness against real-world corruption. For static images, we employ two forms of prompts: 1-point and bounding box, while for video sequences, the 1-point prompt is applied to the initial frame. Through extensive experimentation on the MICCAI EndoVis 2017 and EndoVis 2018 benchmarks, SAM 2, when utilizing bounding box prompts, outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in comparative evaluations. The results with point prompts also exhibit a substantial enhancement over SAM's capabilities, nearing or even surpassing existing unprompted SOTA methodologies. Besides, SAM 2 demonstrates improved inference speed and less performance degradation against various image corruption. Although slightly unsatisfactory results remain in specific edges or regions, SAM 2's robust adaptability to 1-point prompts underscores its potential for downstream surgical tasks with limited prompt requirements.

- **Summary**: High-performance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely heavily on data quality. This study introduces a novel dataset named Img-Diff, designed to enhance fine-grained image recognition in MLLMs by leveraging insights from contrastive learning and image difference captioning. By analyzing object differences between similar images, we challenge models to identify both matching and distinct components. We utilize the Stable-Diffusion-XL model and advanced image editing techniques to create pairs of similar images that highlight object replacements. Our methodology includes a Difference Area Generator for object differences identifying, followed by a Difference Captions Generator for detailed difference descriptions. The result is a relatively small but high-quality dataset of "object replacement" samples. We use the the proposed dataset to finetune state-of-the-art (SOTA) MLLMs such as MGM-7B, yielding comprehensive improvements of performance scores over SOTA models that trained with larger-scale datasets, in numerous image difference and Visual Question Answering tasks. For instance, our trained models notably surpass the SOTA models GPT-4V and Gemini on the MMVP benchmark. Besides, we investigate alternative methods for generating image difference data through "object removal" and conduct a thorough evaluation to confirm the dataset's diversity, quality, and robustness, presenting several insights on the synthesis of such a contrastive dataset. To encourage further research and advance the field of multimodal data synthesis and enhancement of MLLMs' fundamental capabilities for image understanding, we release our codes and dataset at https://github.com/modelscope/data-juicer/tree/ImgDiff.

- **Summary**: While deep neural networks have achieved remarkable performance, they tend to lack transparency in prediction. The pursuit of greater interpretability in neural networks often results in a degradation of their original performance. Some works strive to improve both interpretability and performance, but they primarily depend on meticulously imposed conditions. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework that acquires more explainable activation heatmaps and simultaneously increase the model performance, without the need for any extra supervision. Specifically, our concise framework introduces a new metric, i.e., explanation consistency, to reweight the training samples adaptively in model learning. The explanation consistency metric is utilized to measure the similarity between the model's visual explanations of the original samples and those of semantic-preserved adversarial samples, whose background regions are perturbed by using image adversarial attack techniques. Our framework then promotes the model learning by paying closer attention to those training samples with a high difference in explanations (i.e., low explanation consistency), for which the current model cannot provide robust interpretations. Comprehensive experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework in multiple aspects, including higher recognition accuracy, greater data debiasing capability, stronger network robustness, and more precise localization ability on both regular networks and interpretable networks. We also provide extensive ablation studies and qualitative analyses to unveil the detailed contribution of each component.

- **Summary**: High-resolution point clouds~(HRPCD) anomaly detection~(AD) plays a critical role in precision machining and high-end equipment manufacturing. Despite considerable 3D-AD methods that have been proposed recently, they still cannot meet the requirements of the HRPCD-AD task. There are several challenges: i) It is difficult to directly capture HRPCD information due to large amounts of points at the sample level; ii) The advanced transformer-based methods usually obtain anisotropic features, leading to degradation of the representation; iii) The proportion of abnormal areas is very small, which makes it difficult to characterize. To address these challenges, we propose a novel group-level feature-based network, called Group3AD, which has a significantly efficient representation ability. First, we design an Intercluster Uniformity Network~(IUN) to present the mapping of different groups in the feature space as several clusters, and obtain a more uniform distribution between clusters representing different parts of the point clouds in the feature space. Then, an Intracluster Alignment Network~(IAN) is designed to encourage groups within the cluster to be distributed tightly in the feature space. In addition, we propose an Adaptive Group-Center Selection~(AGCS) based on geometric information to improve the pixel density of potential anomalous regions during inference. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed Group3AD, which surpasses Reg3D-AD by the margin of 5\% in terms of object-level AUROC on Real3D-AD. We provide the code and supplementary information on our website: https://github.com/M-3LAB/Group3AD.

- **Summary**: This paper presents the development of an industrial fall detection system utilizing YOLOv8 variants, enhanced by our proposed augmentation pipeline to increase dataset variance and improve detection accuracy. Among the models evaluated, the YOLOv8m model, consisting of 25.9 million parameters and 79.1 GFLOPs, demonstrated a respectable balance between computational efficiency and detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.971 at 50% Intersection over Union (IoU) across both "Fall Detected" and "Human in Motion" categories. Although the YOLOv8l and YOLOv8x models presented higher precision and recall, particularly in fall detection, their higher computational demands and model size make them less suitable for resource-constrained environments.

- **Summary**: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) has the potential to enhance the transparency and trust of AI-based systems. Although accurate predictions can be made using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), the process used to arrive at such predictions is usually hard to explain. In terms of perceptibly human-friendly representations, such as word phrases in text or super-pixels in images, prototype-based explanations can justify a model's decision. In this work, we introduce a DNN architecture for image classification, the Enhanced Prototypical Part Network (EPPNet), which achieves strong performance while discovering relevant prototypes that can be used to explain the classification results. This is achieved by introducing a novel cluster loss that helps to discover more relevant human-understandable prototypes. We also introduce a faithfulness score to evaluate the explainability of the results based on the discovered prototypes. Our score not only accounts for the relevance of the learned prototypes but also the performance of a model. Our evaluations on the CUB-200-2011 dataset show that the EPPNet outperforms state-of-the-art xAI-based methods, in terms of both classification accuracy and explainability

  Fairness of AI in Medical Imaging (FAIMI) Workshop
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Deep learning-based medical image segmentation has seen tremendous progress over the last decade, but there is still relatively little transfer into clinical practice. One of the main barriers is the challenge of domain generalisation, which requires segmentation models to maintain high performance across a wide distribution of image data. This challenge is amplified by the many factors that contribute to the diverse appearance of medical images, such as acquisition conditions and patient characteristics. The impact of shifting patient characteristics such as age and sex on segmentation performance remains relatively under-studied, especially for abdominal organs, despite that this is crucial for ensuring the fairness of the segmentation model. We perform the first study to determine the impact of population shift with respect to age and sex on abdominal CT image segmentation, by leveraging two large public datasets, and introduce a novel metric to quantify the impact. We find that population shift is a challenge similar in magnitude to cross-dataset shift for abdominal organ segmentation, and that the effect is asymmetric and dataset-dependent. We conclude that dataset diversity in terms of known patient characteristics is not necessarily equivalent to dataset diversity in terms of image features. This implies that simple population matching to ensure good generalisation and fairness may be insufficient, and we recommend that fairness research should be directed towards better understanding and quantifying medical image dataset diversity in terms of performance-relevant characteristics such as organ morphology.

However, creating an analogous representation for ancient logographic writing systems is an extremely labor intensive process that requires expert knowledge. At present, a large portion of logographic data persists in a purely visual form due to the absence of transcription -- this issue poses a bottleneck for researchers seeking to apply NLP toolkits to study ancient logographic languages: most of the relevant data are images of writing.   This paper investigates whether direct processing of visual representations of language offers a potential solution. We introduce LogogramNLP, the first benchmark enabling NLP analysis of ancient logographic languages, featuring both transcribed and visual datasets for four writing systems along with annotations for tasks like classification, translation, and parsing. Our experiments compare systems that employ recent visual and text encoding strategies as backbones. The results demonstrate that visual representations outperform textual representations for some investigated tasks, suggesting that visual processing pipelines may unlock a large amount of cultural heritage data of logographic languages for NLP-based analyses.

- **Summary**: We present Puppet-Master, an interactive video generative model that can serve as a motion prior for part-level dynamics. At test time, given a single image and a sparse set of motion trajectories (i.e., drags), Puppet-Master can synthesize a video depicting realistic part-level motion faithful to the given drag interactions. This is achieved by fine-tuning a large-scale pre-trained video diffusion model, for which we propose a new conditioning architecture to inject the dragging control effectively. More importantly, we introduce the all-to-first attention mechanism, a drop-in replacement for the widely adopted spatial attention modules, which significantly improves generation quality by addressing the appearance and background issues in existing models. Unlike other motion-conditioned video generators that are trained on in-the-wild videos and mostly move an entire object, Puppet-Master is learned from Objaverse-Animation-HQ, a new dataset of curated part-level motion clips. We propose a strategy to automatically filter out sub-optimal animations and augment the synthetic renderings with meaningful motion trajectories. Puppet-Master generalizes well to real images across various categories and outperforms existing methods in a zero-shot manner on a real-world benchmark.

- **Summary**: The vast portion of workloads employing LLMs involves answering questions grounded on PDF or scan content. We introduce the Arctic-TILT achieving accuracy on par with models 1000$\times$ its size on these use cases. It can be fine-tuned and deployed on a single 24GB GPU, lowering operational costs while processing Visually Rich Documents with up to 400k tokens. The model establishes state-of-the-art results on seven diverse Document Understanding benchmarks, as well as provides reliable confidence scores and quick inference, which are essential for processing files in large-scale or time-sensitive enterprise environments.

- **Summary**: Event stereo matching is an emerging technique to estimate depth from neuromorphic cameras; however, events are unlikely to trigger in the absence of motion or the presence of large, untextured regions, making the correspondence problem extremely challenging. Purposely, we propose integrating a stereo event camera with a fixed-frequency active sensor -- e.g., a LiDAR -- collecting sparse depth measurements, overcoming the aforementioned limitations. Such depth hints are used by hallucinating -- i.e., inserting fictitious events -- the stacks or raw input streams, compensating for the lack of information in the absence of brightness changes. Our techniques are general, can be adapted to any structured representation to stack events and outperform state-of-the-art fusion methods applied to event-based stereo.
