- **Summary**: We present Text-driven Object-Centric Style Transfer (TEXTOC), a novel method that guides style transfer at an object-centric level using textual inputs. The core of TEXTOC is our Patch-wise Co-Directional (PCD) loss, meticulously designed for precise object-centric transformations that are closely aligned with the input text. This loss combines a patch directional loss for text-guided style direction and a patch distribution consistency loss for even CLIP embedding distribution across object regions. It ensures a seamless and harmonious style transfer across object regions. Key to our method are the Text-Matched Patch Selection (TMPS) and Pre-fixed Region Selection (PRS) modules for identifying object locations via text, eliminating the need for segmentation masks. Lastly, we introduce an Adaptive Background Preservation (ABP) loss to maintain the original style and structural essence of the image's background. This loss is applied to dynamically identified background areas. Extensive experiments underline the effectiveness of our approach in creating visually coherent and textually aligned style transfers.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly in medical imaging, have significantly propelled the progress of healthcare systems. However, examining the robustness of medical images against adversarial attacks is crucial due to their real-world applications and profound impact on individuals' health. These attacks can result in misclassifications in disease diagnosis, potentially leading to severe consequences. Numerous studies have explored both the implementation of adversarial attacks on medical images and the development of defense mechanisms against these threats, highlighting the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks to such adversarial activities. In this study, we investigate adversarial attacks on images associated with Alzheimer's disease and propose a defensive method to counteract these attacks. Specifically, we examine adversarial attacks that employ frequency domain transformations on Alzheimer's disease images, along with other well-known adversarial attacks. Our approach utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based autoencoder architecture in conjunction with the two-dimensional Fourier transform of images for detection purposes. The simulation results demonstrate that our detection and defense mechanism effectively mitigates several adversarial attacks, thereby enhancing the robustness of deep neural networks against such vulnerabilities.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong performance in generative tasks, making them ideal candidates for image editing. Recent studies highlight their ability to apply desired edits effectively by following textual instructions, yet two key challenges persist. First, these models struggle to apply multiple edits simultaneously, resulting in computational inefficiencies due to their reliance on sequential processing. Second, relying on textual prompts to determine the editing region can lead to unintended alterations in other parts of the image. In this work, we introduce FunEditor, an efficient diffusion model designed to learn atomic editing functions and perform complex edits by aggregating simpler functions. This approach enables complex editing tasks, such as object movement, by aggregating multiple functions and applying them simultaneously to specific areas. FunEditor is 5 to 24 times faster inference than existing methods on complex tasks like object movement. Our experiments demonstrate that FunEditor significantly outperforms recent baselines, including both inference-time optimization methods and fine-tuned models, across various metrics, such as image quality assessment (IQA) and object-background consistency.

- **Summary**: Conventional frame camera is the mainstream sensor of the autonomous driving scene perception, while it is limited in adverse conditions, such as low light. Event camera with high dynamic range has been applied in assisting frame camera for the multimodal fusion, which relies heavily on the pixel-level spatial alignment between various modalities. Typically, existing multimodal datasets mainly place event and frame cameras in parallel and directly align them spatially via warping operation. However, this parallel strategy is less effective for multimodal fusion, since the large disparity exacerbates spatial misalignment due to the large event-frame baseline. We argue that baseline minimization can reduce alignment error between event and frame cameras. In this work, we introduce hybrid coaxial event-frame devices to build the multimodal system, and propose a coaxial stereo event camera (CoSEC) dataset for autonomous driving. As for the multimodal system, we first utilize the microcontroller to achieve time synchronization, and then spatially calibrate different sensors, where we perform intra- and inter-calibration of stereo coaxial devices. As for the multimodal dataset, we filter LiDAR point clouds to generate depth and optical flow labels using reference depth, which is further improved by fusing aligned event and frame data in nighttime conditions. With the help of the coaxial device, the proposed dataset can promote the all-day pixel-level multimodal fusion. Moreover, we also conduct experiments to demonstrate that the proposed dataset can improve the performance and generalization of the multimodal fusion.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated great potential in the field of adversarial robustness, where DM-based defense methods can achieve superior defense capability without adversarial training. However, they all require huge computational costs due to the usage of large-scale pre-trained DMs, making it difficult to conduct full evaluation under strong attacks and compare with traditional CNN-based methods. Simply reducing the network size and timesteps in DMs could significantly harm the image generation quality, which invalidates previous frameworks. To alleviate this issue, we redesign the diffusion framework from generating high-quality images to predicting distinguishable image labels. Specifically, we employ an image translation framework to learn many-to-one mapping from input samples to designed orthogonal image labels. Based on this framework, we introduce an efficient Image-to-Image diffusion classifier with a pruned U-Net structure and reduced diffusion timesteps. Besides the framework, we redesign the optimization objective of DMs to fit the target of image classification, where a new classification loss is incorporated in the DM-based image translation framework to distinguish the generated label from those of other classes. We conduct sufficient evaluations of the proposed classifier under various attacks on popular benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves better adversarial robustness with fewer computational costs than DM-based and CNN-based methods.

- **Summary**: Personalized concept generation by tuning diffusion models with a few images raises potential legal and ethical concerns regarding privacy and intellectual property rights. Researchers attempt to prevent malicious personalization using adversarial perturbations. However, previous efforts have mainly focused on the effectiveness of protection while neglecting the visibility of perturbations. They utilize global adversarial perturbations, which introduce noticeable alterations to original images and significantly degrade visual quality. In this work, we propose the Visual-Friendly Concept Protection (VCPro) framework, which prioritizes the protection of key concepts chosen by the image owner through adversarial perturbations with lower perceptibility. To ensure these perturbations are as inconspicuous as possible, we introduce a relaxed optimization objective to identify the least perceptible yet effective adversarial perturbations, solved using the Lagrangian multiplier method. Qualitative and quantitative experiments validate that VCPro achieves a better trade-off between the visibility of perturbations and protection effectiveness, effectively prioritizing the protection of target concepts in images with less perceptible perturbations.

- **Summary**: We present GS-ID, a novel framework for illumination decomposition on Gaussian Splatting, achieving photorealistic novel view synthesis and intuitive light editing. Illumination decomposition is an ill-posed problem facing three main challenges: 1) priors for geometry and material are often lacking; 2) complex illumination conditions involve multiple unknown light sources; and 3) calculating surface shading with numerous light sources is computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we first introduce intrinsic diffusion priors to estimate the attributes for physically based rendering. Then we divide the illumination into environmental and direct components for joint optimization. Last, we employ deferred rendering to reduce the computational load. Our framework uses a learnable environment map and Spherical Gaussians (SGs) to represent light sources parametrically, therefore enabling controllable and photorealistic relighting on Gaussian Splatting. Extensive experiments and applications demonstrate that GS-ID produces state-of-the-art illumination decomposition results while achieving better geometry reconstruction and rendering performance.

- **Summary**: Recently, multimodal deep learning, which integrates histopathology slides and molecular biomarkers, has achieved a promising performance in glioma grading. Despite great progress, due to the intra-modality complexity and inter-modality heterogeneity, existing studies suffer from inadequate histopathology representation learning and inefficient molecular-pathology knowledge alignment. These two issues hinder existing methods to precisely interpret diagnostic molecular-pathology features, thereby limiting their grading performance. Moreover, the real-world applicability of existing multimodal approaches is significantly restricted as molecular biomarkers are not always available during clinical deployment. To address these problems, we introduce a novel Focus on Focus (FoF) framework with paired pathology-genomic training and applicable pathology-only inference, enhancing molecular-pathology representation effectively. Specifically, we propose a Focus-oriented Representation Learning (FRL) module to encourage the model to identify regions positively or negatively related to glioma grading and guide it to focus on the diagnostic areas with a consistency constraint. To effectively link the molecular biomarkers to morphological features, we propose a Multi-view Cross-modal Alignment (MCA) module that projects histopathology representations into molecular subspaces, aligning morphological features with corresponding molecular biomarker status by supervised contrastive learning. Experiments on the TCGA GBM-LGG dataset demonstrate that our FoF framework significantly improves the glioma grading. Remarkably, our FoF achieves superior performance using only histopathology slides compared to existing multimodal methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/peterlipan/FoF.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel method for privacy-preserving fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) with encrypted images. Conventional methods using encrypted images degrade model performance compared with that of using plain images due to the influence of image encryption. In contrast, the proposed encryption method using restricted random permutation matrices can provide a higher performance than the conventional ones.

- **Summary**: Traditional shadow detectors often identify all shadow regions of static images or video sequences. This work presents the Referring Video Shadow Detection (RVSD), which is an innovative task that rejuvenates the classic paradigm by facilitating the segmentation of particular shadows in videos based on descriptive natural language prompts. This novel RVSD not only achieves segmentation of arbitrary shadow areas of interest based on descriptions (flexibility) but also allows users to interact with visual content more directly and naturally by using natural language prompts (interactivity), paving the way for abundant applications ranging from advanced video editing to virtual reality experiences. To pioneer the RVSD research, we curated a well-annotated RVSD dataset, which encompasses 86 videos and a rich set of 15,011 paired textual descriptions with corresponding shadows. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset is the first one for addressing RVSD. Based on this dataset, we propose a Referring Shadow-Track Memory Network (RSM-Net) for addressing the RVSD task. In our RSM-Net, we devise a Twin-Track Synergistic Memory (TSM) to store intra-clip memory features and hierarchical inter-clip memory features, and then pass these memory features into a memory read module to refine features of the current video frame for referring shadow detection. We also develop a Mixed-Prior Shadow Attention (MSA) to utilize physical priors to obtain a coarse shadow map for learning more visual features by weighting it with the input video frame. Experimental results show that our RSM-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance for RVSD with a notable Overall IOU increase of 4.4\%.

- **Summary**: Sign language serves as the primary meaning of communication for the deaf-mute community. Different from spoken language, it commonly conveys information by the collaboration of manual features, i.e., hand gestures and body movements, and non-manual features, i.e., facial expressions and mouth cues. To facilitate communication between the deaf-mute and hearing people, a series of sign language understanding (SLU) tasks have been studied in recent years, including isolated/continuous sign language recognition (ISLR/CSLR), gloss-free sign language translation (GF-SLT) and sign language retrieval (SL-RT). Sign language recognition and translation aims to understand the semantic meaning conveyed by sign languages from gloss-level and sentence-level, respectively. In contrast, SL-RT focuses on retrieving sign videos or corresponding texts from a closed-set under the query-by-example search paradigm. These tasks investigate sign language topics from diverse perspectives and raise challenges in learning effective representation of sign language videos. To advance the development of sign language understanding, exploring a generalized model that is applicable across various SLU tasks is a profound research direction.

- **Summary**: The usage of commercial Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) has increased drastically during the last decade. While the added value of MAVs to society is apparent, their growing use is also coming with increasing risks like violating public airspace at airports or committing privacy violations. To mitigate these issues it is becoming critical to develop solutions that incorporate the detection and tracking of MAVs with autonomous systems. This work presents a method for the detection and tracking of MAVs using a novel, low-cost rosette scanning LiDAR on a pan-tilt turret. Once the static background is captured, a particle filter is utilized to detect a possible target and track its position with a physical, programmable pan-tilt system. The tracking makes it possible to keep the MAV in the center, maximizing the density of 3D points measured on the target by the LiDAR sensor. The developed algorithm was evaluated within the indoor MIcro aerial vehicle and MOtion capture (MIMO) arena and has state-of-the-art tracking accuracy, stability, and fast re-detection time in case of tracking loss. Based on the outdoor tests, it was possible to significantly increase the detection distance and number of returned points compared to other similar methods using LiDAR.

- **Summary**: Full Field Digital Mammograms (FFDMs) and Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) are the two most widely used imaging modalities for breast cancer screening. Although DBT has increased cancer detection compared to FFDM, its widespread adoption in clinical practice has been slowed by increased interpretation times and a perceived decrease in the conspicuity of specific lesion types. Specifically, the non-inferiority of DBT for microcalcifications remains under debate. Due to concerns about the decrease in visual acuity, combined DBT-FFDM acquisitions remain popular, leading to overall increased exam times and radiation dosage. Enabling DBT to provide diagnostic information present in both FFDM and DBT would reduce reliance on FFDM, resulting in a reduction in both quantities. We propose a machine learning methodology that learns high-level representations leveraging the complementary diagnostic signal from both DBT and FFDM. Experiments on a large-scale data set validate our claims and show that our representations enable more accurate breast lesion detection than any DBT- or FFDM-based model.

- **Summary**: This study mainly introduces a method combining the Stable Diffusion Model (SDM) and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning method for generating Chinese Landscape Paintings. This training process is accelerated by combining LoRA with pre-trained SDM and DreamBooth with pre-trained SDM, respectively. On the Chinese Landscape Paintings Internet dataset used in this paper, this study finds that SDM combined with DreamBooth exhibits superior performance, outperforming other models, including the generic pre-trained SDM and LoRA-based fine-tuning SDM. The SDM combined with DreamBooth achieves a FID of 12.75 on the dataset and outperforms all other models in terms of expert evaluation, highlighting the model's versatility in the field of Chinese Landscape Paintings given the unique identifier, high fidelity and high quality. This study illustrates the potential of specialised fine-tuning method to improve the performance of SDM on domain-specific tasks, particularly in the domain of Landscape Paintings.

- **Summary**: Attention based models have achieved many remarkable breakthroughs in numerous applications. However, the quadratic complexity of Attention makes the vanilla Attention based models hard to apply to long sequence tasks. Various improved Attention structures are proposed to reduce the computation cost by inducing low rankness and approximating the whole sequence by sub-sequences. The most challenging part of those approaches is maintaining the proper balance between information preservation and computation reduction: the longer sub-sequences used, the better information is preserved, but at the price of introducing more noise and computational costs. In this paper, we propose a smoothed skeleton sketching based Attention structure, coined S$^3$Attention, which significantly improves upon the previous attempts to negotiate this trade-off. S$^3$Attention has two mechanisms to effectively minimize the impact of noise while keeping the linear complexity to the sequence length: a smoothing block to mix information over long sequences and a matrix sketching method that simultaneously selects columns and rows from the input matrix. We verify the effectiveness of S$^3$Attention both theoretically and empirically. Extensive studies over Long Range Arena (LRA) datasets and six time-series forecasting show that S$^3$Attention significantly outperforms both vanilla Attention and other state-of-the-art variants of Attention structures.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based framework for non-rigid point cloud matching, which can be trained purely on point clouds without any correspondence annotation but also be extended naturally to partial-to-full matching. Our key insight is to incorporate semantic features derived from large vision models (LVMs) to geometry-based shape feature learning. Our framework effectively leverages the structural information contained in the semantic features to address ambiguities arise from self-similarities among local geometries. Furthermore, our framework also enjoys the strong generalizability and robustness regarding partial observations of LVMs, leading to improvements in the regarding point cloud matching tasks. In order to achieve the above, we propose a pixel-to-point feature aggregation module, a local and global attention network as well as a geometrical similarity loss function. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in matching non-rigid point clouds in both near-isometric and heterogeneous shape collection as well as more realistic partial and noisy data.

- **Summary**: Associating driver attention with driving scene across two fields of views (FOVs) is a hard cross-domain perception problem, which requires comprehensive consideration of cross-view mapping, dynamic driving scene analysis, and driver status tracking. Previous methods typically focus on a single view or map attention to the scene via estimated gaze, failing to exploit the implicit connection between them. Moreover, simple fusion modules are insufficient for modeling the complex relationships between the two views, making information integration challenging. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for end-to-end scene-associated driver attention estimation, called EraW-Net. This method enhances the most discriminative dynamic cues, refines feature representations, and facilitates semantically aligned cross-domain integration through a W-shaped architecture, termed W-Net. Specifically, a Dynamic Adaptive Filter Module (DAF-Module) is proposed to address the challenges of frequently changing driving environments by extracting vital regions. It suppresses the indiscriminately recorded dynamics and highlights crucial ones by innovative joint frequency-spatial analysis, enhancing the model's ability to parse complex dynamics. Additionally, to track driver states during non-fixed facial poses, we propose a Global Context Sharing Module (GCS-Module) to construct refined feature representations by capturing hierarchical features that adapt to various scales of head and eye movements. Finally, W-Net achieves systematic cross-view information integration through its "Encoding-Independent Partial Decoding-Fusion Decoding" structure, addressing semantic misalignment in heterogeneous data integration. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method robustly and accurately estimates the mapping of driver attention in scene on large public datasets.

- **Summary**: We present a new image compression paradigm to achieve ``intelligently coding for machine'' by cleverly leveraging the common sense of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We are motivated by the evidence that large language/multimodal models are powerful general-purpose semantics predictors for understanding the real world. Different from traditional image compression typically optimized for human eyes, the image coding for machines (ICM) framework we focus on requires the compressed bitstream to more comply with different downstream intelligent analysis tasks. To this end, we employ LMM to \textcolor{red}{tell codec what to compress}: 1) first utilize the powerful semantic understanding capability of LMMs w.r.t object grounding, identification, and importance ranking via prompts, to disentangle image content before compression, 2) and then based on these semantic priors we accordingly encode and transmit objects of the image in order with a structured bitstream. In this way, diverse vision benchmarks including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, etc., can be well supported with such a semantically structured bitstream. We dub our method ``\textit{SDComp}'' for ``\textit{S}emantically \textit{D}isentangled \textit{Comp}ression'', and compare it with state-of-the-art codecs on a wide variety of different vision tasks. SDComp codec leads to more flexible reconstruction results, promised decoded visual quality, and a more generic/satisfactory intelligent task-supporting ability.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a foundational model designed for promptable segmentation tasks, demonstrates exceptional generalization capabilities, making it highly promising for natural scene image segmentation. However, SAM's lack of pretraining on massive remote sensing images and its interactive structure limit its automatic mask prediction capabilities. In this paper, a Multi-Cognitive SAM-Based Instance Segmentation Model (MC-SAM SEG) is introduced to employ SAM on remote sensing domain. The SAM-Mona encoder utilizing the Multi-cognitive Visual Adapter (Mona) is conducted to facilitate SAM's transfer learning in remote sensing applications. The proposed method named MC-SAM SEG extracts high-quality features by fine-tuning the SAM-Mona encoder along with a feature aggregator. Subsequently, a pixel decoder and transformer decoder are designed for prompt-free mask generation and instance classification. The comprehensive experiments are conducted on the HRSID and WHU datasets for instance segmentation tasks on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and optical remote sensing images respectively. The evaluation results indicate the proposed method surpasses other deep learning algorithms and verify its effectiveness and generalization.

- **Summary**: Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) has extensive applications in automated grading and office automation. However, existing sequence-based decoding methods, which directly predict $\LaTeX$ sequences, struggle to understand and model the inherent tree structure of $\LaTeX$ and often fail to ensure syntactic correctness in the decoded results. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model named TAMER (Tree-Aware Transformer) for handwritten mathematical expression recognition. TAMER introduces an innovative Tree-aware Module while maintaining the flexibility and efficient training of Transformer. TAMER combines the advantages of both sequence decoding and tree decoding models by jointly optimizing sequence prediction and tree structure prediction tasks, which enhances the model's understanding and generalization of complex mathematical expression structures. During inference, TAMER employs a Tree Structure Prediction Scoring Mechanism to improve the structural validity of the generated $\LaTeX$ sequences. Experimental results on CROHME datasets demonstrate that TAMER outperforms traditional sequence decoding and tree decoding models, especially in handling complex mathematical structures, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

- **Summary**: As artificial intelligence (AI) technology advances, ensuring the robustness and safety of AI-driven systems has become paramount. However, varying perceptions of robustness among AI developers create misaligned evaluation metrics, complicating the assessment and certification of safety-critical and complex AI systems such as autonomous driving (AD) agents. To address this challenge, we introduce Simulation-Based Robustness Assessment Framework (S-RAF) for autonomous driving. S-RAF leverages the CARLA Driving simulator to rigorously assess AD agents across diverse conditions, including faulty sensors, environmental changes, and complex traffic situations. By quantifying robustness and its relationship with other safety-critical factors, such as carbon emissions, S-RAF aids developers and stakeholders in building safe and responsible driving agents, and streamlining safety certification processes. Furthermore, S-RAF offers significant advantages, such as reduced testing costs, and the ability to explore edge cases that may be unsafe to test in the real world.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation transcends traditional closed-vocabulary methods by enabling the identification of both previously seen and unseen objects in real-world scenarios. It leverages a dual-modality approach, utilizing both 3D point clouds and 2D multi-view images to generate class-agnostic object mask proposals. Previous efforts predominantly focused on enhancing 3D mask proposal models; consequently, the information that could come from 2D association to 3D was not fully exploited. This bias towards 3D data, while effective for familiar indoor objects, limits the system's adaptability to new and varied object types, where 2D models offer greater utility. Addressing this gap, we introduce Zero-Shot Dual-Path Integration Framework that equally values the contributions of both 3D and 2D modalities. Our framework comprises three components: 3D pathway, 2D pathway, and Dual-Path Integration. 3D pathway generates spatially accurate class-agnostic mask proposals of common indoor objects from 3D point cloud data using a pre-trained 3D model, while 2D pathway utilizes pre-trained open-vocabulary instance segmentation model to identify a diverse array of object proposals from multi-view RGB-D images. In Dual-Path Integration, our Conditional Integration process, which operates in two stages, filters and merges the proposals from both pathways adaptively. This process harmonizes output proposals to enhance segmentation capabilities. Our framework, utilizing pre-trained models in a zero-shot manner, is model-agnostic and demonstrates superior performance on both seen and unseen data, as evidenced by comprehensive evaluations on the ScanNet200 and qualitative results on ARKitScenes datasets.

- **Summary**: Ophthalmic image segmentation serves as a critical foundation for ocular disease diagnosis. Although fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly employed for segmentation, they are constrained by inductive biases and face challenges in establishing long-range dependencies. Transformer-based models address these limitations but introduce substantial computational overhead. Recently, a simple yet efficient Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) architecture was proposed for image classification, achieving competitive performance relative to advanced transformers. However, its effectiveness for ophthalmic image segmentation remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce MM-UNet, an efficient Mixed MLP model tailored for ophthalmic image segmentation. Within MM-UNet, we propose a multi-scale MLP (MMLP) module that facilitates the interaction of features at various depths through a grouping strategy, enabling simultaneous capture of global and local information. We conducted extensive experiments on both a private anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) image dataset and a public fundus image dataset. The results demonstrated the superiority of our MM-UNet model in comparison to state-of-the-art deep segmentation networks.

- **Summary**: Building a unified model for general low-level vision tasks holds significant research and practical value. Current methods encounter several critical issues. Multi-task restoration approaches can address multiple degradation-to-clean restoration tasks, while their applicability to tasks with different target domains (e.g., image stylization) is limited. Methods like PromptGIP can handle multiple input-target domains but rely on the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) paradigm. Consequently, they are tied to the ViT architecture, resulting in suboptimal image reconstruction quality. In addition, these methods are sensitive to prompt image content and often struggle with low-frequency information processing. In this paper, we propose a Visual task Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework to overcome these challenges. VPIP employs visual task prompts to manage tasks with different input-target domains and allows flexible selection of backbone network suitable for general tasks. Besides, a new prompt cross-attention is introduced to facilitate interaction between the input and prompt information. Based on the VPIP framework, we train a low-level vision generalist model, namely GenLV, on 30 diverse tasks. Experimental results show that GenLV can successfully address a variety of low-level tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: Deep video compression has made remarkable process in recent years, with the majority of advancements concentrated on P-frame coding. Although efforts to enhance B-frame coding are ongoing, their compression performance is still far behind that of traditional bi-directional video codecs. In this paper, we introduce a bi-directional deep contextual video compression scheme tailored for B-frames, termed DCVC-B, to improve the compression performance of deep B-frame coding. Our scheme mainly has three key innovations. First, we develop a bi-directional motion difference context propagation method for effective motion difference coding, which significantly reduces the bit cost of bi-directional motions. Second, we propose a bi-directional contextual compression model and a corresponding bi-directional temporal entropy model, to make better use of the multi-scale temporal contexts. Third, we propose a hierarchical quality structure-based training strategy, leading to an effective bit allocation across large groups of pictures (GOP). Experimental results show that our DCVC-B achieves an average reduction of 26.6% in BD-Rate compared to the reference software for H.265/HEVC under random access conditions. Remarkably, it surpasses the performance of the H.266/VVC reference software on certain test datasets under the same configuration.

- **Summary**: This paper presents our method for the generative track of The First Dataset Distillation Challenge at ECCV 2024. Since the diffusion model has become the mainstay of generative models because of its high-quality generative effects, we focus on distillation methods based on the diffusion model. Considering that the track can only generate a fixed number of images in 10 minutes using a generative model for CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets, we need to use a generative model that can generate images at high speed. In this study, we proposed a novel generative dataset distillation method based on Stable Diffusion. Specifically, we use the SDXL-Turbo model which can generate images at high speed and quality. Compared to other diffusion models that can only generate images per class (IPC) = 1, our method can achieve an IPC = 10 for Tiny-ImageNet and an IPC = 20 for CIFAR-100, respectively. Additionally, to generate high-quality distilled datasets for CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, we use the class information as text prompts and post data augmentation for the SDXL-Turbo model. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, and we achieved third place in the generative track of the ECCV 2024 DD Challenge.

- **Summary**: Analysis and visualization of 3D microscopy images pose challenges due to anisotropic axial resolution, demanding volumetric super-resolution along the axial direction. While training a learning-based 3D super-resolution model seems to be a straightforward solution, it requires ground truth isotropic volumes and suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, existing methods utilize 2D neural networks to reconstruct each axial slice, eventually piecing together the entire volume. However, reconstructing each slice in the pixel domain fails to give consistent reconstruction in all directions leading to misalignment artifacts. In this work, we present a reconstruction framework based on implicit neural representation (INR), which allows 3D coherency even when optimized by independent axial slices in a batch-wise manner. Our method optimizes a continuous volumetric representation from low-resolution axial slices, using a 2D diffusion prior trained on high-resolution lateral slices without requiring isotropic volumes. Through experiments on real and synthetic anisotropic microscopy images, we demonstrate that our method surpasses other state-of-the-art reconstruction methods.

- **Summary**: Sketch, a powerful artistic technique to capture essential visual information about real-world objects, is increasingly gaining attention in the image synthesis field. However, evaluating the quality of synthesized sketches presents unique unsolved challenges. Current evaluation methods for sketch synthesis are inadequate due to the lack of a unified benchmark dataset, over-reliance on classification accuracy for recognizability, and unfair evaluation of sketches with different levels of simplification. To address these issues, we introduce SketchRef, a benchmark dataset comprising 4 categories of reference photos--animals, human faces, human bodies, and common objects--alongside novel evaluation metrics. Considering that classification accuracy is insufficient to measure the structural consistency between a sketch and its reference photo, we propose the mean Object Keypoint Similarity (mOKS) metric, utilizing pose estimation to assess structure-level recognizability. To ensure fair evaluation sketches with different simplification levels, we propose a recognizability calculation method constrained by simplicity. We also collect 8K responses from art enthusiasts, validating the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation methods. We hope this work can provide a comprehensive evaluation of sketch synthesis algorithms, thereby aligning their performance more closely with human understanding.

- **Summary**: Building Footprint Extraction (BFE) in off-nadir aerial images often relies on roof segmentation and roof-to-footprint offset prediction, then drugging roof-to-footprint via the offset. However, the results from this multi-stage inference are not applicable in data production, because of the low quality of masks given by prediction. To solve this problem, we proposed OBMv2 in this paper, which supports both end-to-end and promptable polygonal footprint prediction. Different from OBM, OBMv2 using a newly proposed Self Offset Attention (SOFA) to bridge the performance gap on bungalow and skyscraper, which realized a real end-to-end footprint polygon prediction without postprocessing. %, such as Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and Distance NMS (DNMS). % To fully use information contained in roof masks, building masks and offsets, we proposed a Multi-level Information SyStem (MISS) for footprint prediction, with which OBMv2 can predict footprints even with insufficient predictions. Additionally, to squeeze information from the same model, we were inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in Nature Language Processing and proposed "RAG in BFE" problem. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted on open datasets BONAI and OmniCity-view3. A generalization test was also conducted on Huizhou test set.

- **Summary**: The human brain undergoes rapid development during the third trimester of pregnancy. In this work, we model the neonatal development of the infant brain in this age range. As a basis, we use MR images of preterm- and term-birth neonates from the developing human connectome project (dHCP). We propose a neural network, specifically an implicit neural representation (INR), to predict 2D- and 3D images of varying time points. In order to model a subject-specific development process, it is necessary to disentangle the age from the subjects' identity in the latent space of the INR. We propose two methods, Subject Specific Latent Vectors (SSL) and Stochastic Global Latent Augmentation (SGLA), enabling this disentanglement. We perform an analysis of the results and compare our proposed model to an age-conditioned denoising diffusion model as a baseline. We also show that our method can be applied in a memory-efficient way, which is especially important for 3D data.

- **Summary**: Burst super-resolution aims to reconstruct high-resolution images with higher quality and richer details by fusing the sub-pixel information from multiple burst low-resolution frames. In BusrtSR, the key challenge lies in extracting the base frame's content complementary sub-pixel details while simultaneously suppressing high-frequency noise disturbance. Existing methods attempt to extract sub-pixels by modeling inter-frame relationships frame by frame while overlooking the mutual correlations among multi-current frames and neglecting the intra-frame interactions, leading to inaccurate and noisy sub-pixels for base frame super-resolution. Further, existing methods mainly employ static upsampling with fixed parameters to improve spatial resolution for all scenes, failing to perceive the sub-pixel distribution difference across multiple frames and cannot balance the fusion weights of different frames, resulting in over-smoothed details and artifacts. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel Query Mamba Burst Super-Resolution (QMambaBSR) network, which incorporates a Query State Space Model (QSSM) and Adaptive Up-sampling module (AdaUp). Specifically, based on the observation that sub-pixels have consistent spatial distribution while random noise is inconsistently distributed, a novel QSSM is proposed to efficiently extract sub-pixels through inter-frame querying and intra-frame scanning while mitigating noise interference in a single step. Moreover, AdaUp is designed to dynamically adjust the upsampling kernel based on the spatial distribution of multi-frame sub-pixel information in the different burst scenes, thereby facilitating the reconstruction of the spatial arrangement of high-resolution details. Extensive experiments on four popular synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Recently, foundation models based on Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become widely available. However, their fine-tuning process is highly resource-intensive, and it hinders their adoption in several edge or low-energy applications. To this end, in this paper we introduce an efficient fine-tuning method for ViTs called $\textbf{ALaST}$ ($\textit{Adaptive Layer Selection Fine-Tuning for Vision Transformers}$) to speed up the fine-tuning process while reducing computational cost, memory load, and training time. Our approach is based on the observation that not all layers are equally critical during fine-tuning, and their importance varies depending on the current mini-batch. Therefore, at each fine-tuning step, we adaptively estimate the importance of all layers and we assign what we call ``compute budgets'' accordingly. Layers that were allocated lower budgets are either trained with a reduced number of input tokens or kept frozen. Freezing a layer reduces the computational cost and memory usage by preventing updates to its weights, while discarding tokens removes redundant data, speeding up processing and reducing memory requirements. We show that this adaptive compute allocation enables a nearly-optimal schedule for distributing computational resources across layers, resulting in substantial reductions in training time (up to 1.5x), FLOPs (up to 2x), and memory load (up to 2x) compared to traditional full fine-tuning approaches. Additionally, it can be successfully combined with other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as LoRA.

- **Summary**: Skeleton Action Recognition (SAR) has attracted significant interest for its efficient representation of the human skeletal structure. Despite its advancements, recent studies have raised security concerns in SAR models, particularly their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. However, such strategies are limited to digital scenarios and ineffective in physical attacks, limiting their real-world applicability. To investigate the vulnerabilities of SAR in the physical world, we introduce the Physical Skeleton Backdoor Attacks (PSBA), the first exploration of physical backdoor attacks against SAR. Considering the practicalities of physical execution, we introduce a novel trigger implantation method that integrates infrequent and imperceivable actions as triggers into the original skeleton data. By incorporating a minimal amount of this manipulated data into the training set, PSBA enables the system misclassify any skeleton sequences into the target class when the trigger action is present. We examine the resilience of PSBA in both poisoned and clean-label scenarios, demonstrating its efficacy across a range of datasets, poisoning ratios, and model architectures. Additionally, we introduce a trigger-enhancing strategy to strengthen attack performance in the clean label setting. The robustness of PSBA is tested against three distinct backdoor defenses, and the stealthiness of PSBA is evaluated using two quantitative metrics. Furthermore, by employing a Kinect V2 camera, we compile a dataset of human actions from the real world to mimic physical attack situations, with our findings confirming the effectiveness of our proposed attacks.

- **Summary**: The key to effective point cloud compression is to obtain a robust context model consistent with complex 3D data structures. Recently, the advancement of large language models (LLMs) has highlighted their capabilities not only as powerful generators for in-context learning and generation but also as effective compressors. These dual attributes of LLMs make them particularly well-suited to meet the demands of data compression. Therefore, this paper explores the potential of using LLM for compression tasks, focusing on lossless point cloud geometry compression (PCGC) experiments. However, applying LLM directly to PCGC tasks presents some significant challenges, i.e., LLM does not understand the structure of the point cloud well, and it is a difficult task to fill the gap between text and point cloud through text description, especially for large complicated and small shapeless point clouds. To address these problems, we introduce a novel architecture, namely the Large Language Model-based Point Cloud Geometry Compression (LLM-PCGC) method, using LLM to compress point cloud geometry information without any text description or aligning operation. By utilizing different adaptation techniques for cross-modality representation alignment and semantic consistency, including clustering, K-tree, token mapping invariance, and Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the proposed method can translate LLM to a compressor/generator for point cloud. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first structure to employ LLM as a compressor for point cloud data. Experiments demonstrate that the LLM-PCGC outperforms the other existing methods significantly, by achieving -40.213% bit rate reduction compared to the reference software of MPEG Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC) standard, and by achieving -2.267% bit rate reduction compared to the state-of-the-art learning-based method.

- **Summary**: The development of learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression models has recently attracted significant interest. Existing models predominantly utilize convolutional filters, which capture only local dependencies. Furthermore, they often incur high training costs and exhibit substantial computational complexity. To address these limitations, in this paper we propose Hyperspectral Compression Transformer (HyCoT) that is a transformer-based autoencoder for pixelwise HSI compression. Additionally, we introduce an efficient training strategy to accelerate the training process. Experimental results on the HySpecNet-11k dataset demonstrate that HyCoT surpasses the state-of-the-art across various compression ratios by over 1 dB with significantly reduced computational requirements. Our code and pre-trained weights are publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycot .

- **Summary**: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel \textit{state-object} compositions by leveraging the shared knowledge of their primitive components. Despite considerable progress, effectively calibrating the bias between semantically similar multimodal representations, as well as generalizing pre-trained knowledge to novel compositional contexts, remains an enduring challenge. In this paper, our interest is to revisit the conditional transport (CT) theory and its homology to the visual-semantics interaction in CZSL and further, propose a novel Trisets Consistency Alignment framework (dubbed TsCA) that well-addresses these issues. Concretely, we utilize three distinct yet semantically homologous sets, i.e., patches, primitives, and compositions, to construct pairwise CT costs to minimize their semantic discrepancies. To further ensure the consistency transfer within these sets, we implement a cycle-consistency constraint that refines the learning by guaranteeing the feature consistency of the self-mapping during transport flow, regardless of modality. Moreover, we extend the CT plans to an open-world setting, which enables the model to effectively filter out unfeasible pairs, thereby speeding up the inference as well as increasing the accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, garnering significant attention in AI communities. However, their performance and reliability in specialized domains such as medicine remain insufficiently assessed. In particular, most assessments over-concentrate in evaluating VLMs based on simple Visual Question Answering (VQA) on multi-modality data, while ignoring the in-depth characteristic of LVLMs. In this study, we introduce RadVUQA, a novel Radiological Visual Understanding and Question Answering benchmark, to comprehensively evaluate existing LVLMs. RadVUQA mainly validates LVLMs across five dimensions: 1) Anatomical understanding, assessing the models' ability to visually identify biological structures; 2) Multimodal comprehension, which involves the capability of interpreting linguistic and visual instructions to produce desired outcomes; 3) Quantitative and spatial reasoning, evaluating the models' spatial awareness and proficiency in combining quantitative analysis with visual and linguistic information; 4) Physiological knowledge, measuring the models' capability to comprehend functions and mechanisms of organs and systems; and 5) Robustness, which assesses the models' capabilities against unharmonised and synthetic data. The results indicate that both generalized LVLMs and medical-specific LVLMs have critical deficiencies with weak multimodal comprehension and quantitative reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal the large gap between existing LVLMs and clinicians, highlighting the urgent need for more robust and intelligent LVLMs. The code and dataset will be available after the acceptance of this paper.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal brain tumor segmentation typically involves four magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities, while incomplete modalities significantly degrade performance. Existing solutions employ explicit or implicit modality adaptation, aligning features across modalities or learning a fused feature robust to modality incompleteness. They share a common goal of encouraging each modality to express both itself and the others. However, the two expression abilities are entangled as a whole in a seamless feature space, resulting in prohibitive learning burdens. In this paper, we propose DeMoSeg to enhance the modality adaptation by Decoupling the task of representing the ego and other Modalities for robust incomplete multi-modal Segmentation. The decoupling is super lightweight by simply using two convolutions to map each modality onto four feature sub-spaces. The first sub-space expresses itself (Self-feature), while the remaining sub-spaces substitute for other modalities (Mutual-features). The Self- and Mutual-features interactively guide each other through a carefully-designed Channel-wised Sparse Self-Attention (CSSA). After that, a Radiologist-mimic Cross-modality expression Relationships (RCR) is introduced to have available modalities provide Self-feature and also `lend' their Mutual-features to compensate for the absent ones by exploiting the clinical prior knowledge. The benchmark results on BraTS2020, BraTS2018 and BraTS2015 verify the DeMoSeg's superiority thanks to the alleviated modality adaptation difficulty. Concretely, for BraTS2020, DeMoSeg increases Dice by at least 0.92%, 2.95% and 4.95% on whole tumor, tumor core and enhanced tumor regions, respectively, compared to other state-of-the-arts.

- **Summary**: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) without Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pre-processed camera poses--referred to as SfM-free methods--is crucial for promoting rapid response capabilities and enhancing robustness against variable operating conditions. Recent SfM-free methods have integrated pose optimization, designing end-to-end frameworks for joint camera pose estimation and NVS. However, most existing works rely on per-pixel image loss functions, such as L2 loss. In SfM-free methods, inaccurate initial poses lead to misalignment issue, which, under the constraints of per-pixel image loss functions, results in excessive gradients, causing unstable optimization and poor convergence for NVS. In this study, we propose a correspondence-guided SfM-free 3D Gaussian splatting for NVS. We use correspondences between the target and the rendered result to achieve better pixel alignment, facilitating the optimization of relative poses between frames. We then apply the learned poses to optimize the entire scene. Each 2D screen-space pixel is associated with its corresponding 3D Gaussians through approximated surface rendering to facilitate gradient back propagation. Experimental results underline the superior performance and time efficiency of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.

- **Summary**: Arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR) aims to learn a single model for image super-resolution at arbitrary magnifying scales. Existing ASSR networks typically comprise an off-the-shelf scale-agnostic feature extractor and an arbitrary scale upsampler. These feature extractors often use fixed network architectures to address different ASSR inference tasks, each of which is characterized by an input image and an upsampling scale. However, this overlooks the difficulty variance of super-resolution on different inference scenarios, where simple images or small SR scales could be resolved with less computational effort than difficult images or large SR scales. To tackle this difficulty variability, in this paper, we propose a Task-Aware Dynamic Transformer (TADT) as an input-adaptive feature extractor for efficient image ASSR. Our TADT consists of a multi-scale feature extraction backbone built upon groups of Multi-Scale Transformer Blocks (MSTBs) and a Task-Aware Routing Controller (TARC). The TARC predicts the inference paths within feature extraction backbone, specifically selecting MSTBs based on the input images and SR scales. The prediction of inference path is guided by a new loss function to trade-off the SR accuracy and efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that, when working with three popular arbitrary-scale upsamplers, our TADT achieves state-of-the-art ASSR performance when compared with mainstream feature extractors, but with relatively fewer computational costs. The code will be publicly released.

- **Summary**: Unfolded proximal neural networks (PNNs) form a family of methods that combines deep learning and proximal optimization approaches. They consist in designing a neural network for a specific task by unrolling a proximal algorithm for a fixed number of iterations, where linearities can be learned from prior training procedure. PNNs have shown to be more robust than traditional deep learning approaches while reaching at least as good performances, in particular in computational imaging. However, training PNNs still depends on the efficiency of available training algorithms. In this work, we propose a lifted training formulation based on Bregman distances for unfolded PNNs. Leveraging the deterministic mini-batch block-coordinate forward-backward method, we design a bespoke computational strategy beyond traditional back-propagation methods for solving the resulting learning problem efficiently. We assess the behaviour of the proposed training approach for PNNs through numerical simulations on image denoising, considering a denoising PNN whose structure is based on dual proximal-gradient iterations.

- **Summary**: Microscopy is routinely used to image biological structures of interest. Due to imaging constraints, acquired images are typically low-SNR and contain noise. Over the last few years, regression-based tasks like unsupervised denoising and splitting have found utility in working with such noisy micrographs. For evaluation, Structural Similarity (SSIM) is one of the most popular measures used in the field. For such tasks, the best evaluation would be when both low-SNR noisy images and corresponding high-SNR clean images are obtained directly from a microscope. However, due to the following three peculiar properties of the microscopy data, we observe that SSIM is not well suited to this data regime: (a) high-SNR micrographs have higher intensity pixels as compared to low SNR micrographs, (b) high-SNR micrographs have higher intensity pixels than found in natural images, images for which SSIM was developed, and (c) a digitally configurable offset is added by the detector present inside the microscope. We show that SSIM components behave unexpectedly when the prediction generated from low-SNR input is compared with the corresponding high-SNR data. We explain this behavior by introducing the phenomenon of saturation, where the value of SSIM components becomes less sensitive to (dis)similarity between the images. We introduce microSSIM, a variant of SSIM, which overcomes the above-discussed issues. We justify the soundness and utility of microSSIM using theoretical and empirical arguments and show the utility of microSSIM on two tasks: unsupervised denoising and joint image splitting with unsupervised denoising. Since our formulation can be applied to a broad family of SSIM-based measures, we also introduce MicroMS3IM, a microscopy-specific variation of MS-SSIM.

- **Summary**: This paper examines three major generative modelling frameworks: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Stable Diffusion models. VAEs are effective at learning latent representations but frequently yield blurry results. GANs can generate realistic images but face issues such as mode collapse. Stable Diffusion models, while producing high-quality images with strong semantic coherence, are demanding in terms of computational resources. Additionally, the paper explores how incorporating Grounding DINO and Grounded SAM with Stable Diffusion improves image accuracy by utilising sophisticated segmentation and inpainting techniques. The analysis guides on selecting suitable models for various applications and highlights areas for further research.

- **Summary**: Masked autoencoder has been widely explored in point cloud self-supervised learning, whereby the point cloud is generally divided into visible and masked parts. These methods typically include an encoder accepting visible patches (normalized) and corresponding patch centers (position) as input, with the decoder accepting the output of the encoder and the centers (position) of the masked parts to reconstruct each point in the masked patches. Then, the pre-trained encoders are used for downstream tasks. In this paper, we show a motivating empirical result that when directly feeding the centers of masked patches to the decoder without information from the encoder, it still reconstructs well. In other words, the centers of patches are important and the reconstruction objective does not necessarily rely on representations of the encoder, thus preventing the encoder from learning semantic representations. Based on this key observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, i.e., learning to Predict Centers for Point Masked AutoEncoders (PCP-MAE) which guides the model to learn to predict the significant centers and use the predicted centers to replace the directly provided centers. Specifically, we propose a Predicting Center Module (PCM) that shares parameters with the original encoder with extra cross-attention to predict centers. Our method is of high pre-training efficiency compared to other alternatives and achieves great improvement over Point-MAE, particularly outperforming it by 5.50%, 6.03%, and 5.17% on three variants of ScanObjectNN. The code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Implicit surfaces via neural radiance fields (NeRF) have shown surprising accuracy in surface reconstruction. Despite their success in reconstructing richly textured surfaces, existing methods struggle with planar regions with weak textures, which account for the majority of indoor scenes. In this paper, we address indoor dense surface reconstruction by revisiting key aspects of NeRF in order to use the recently proposed Vector Field (VF) as the implicit representation. VF is defined by the unit vector directed to the nearest surface point. It therefore flips direction at the surface and equals to the explicit surface normals. Except for this flip, VF remains constant along planar surfaces and provides a strong inductive bias in representing planar surfaces. Concretely, we develop a novel density-VF relationship and a training scheme that allows us to learn VF via volume rendering By doing this, VF-NeRF can model large planar surfaces and sharp corners accurately. We show that, when depth cues are available, our method further improves and achieves state-of-the-art results in reconstructing indoor scenes and rendering novel views. We extensively evaluate VF-NeRF on indoor datasets and run ablations of its components.

- **Summary**: Prognosis after intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is influenced by a complex interplay between imaging and tabular data. Rapid and reliable prognosis are crucial for effective patient stratification and informed treatment decision-making. In this study, we aim to enhance image-based prognosis by learning a robust feature representation shared between prognosis and the clinical and demographic variables most highly correlated with it. Our approach mimics clinical decision-making by reinforcing the model to learn valuable prognostic data embedded in the image. We propose a 3D multi-task image model to predict prognosis, Glasgow Coma Scale and age, improving accuracy and interpretability. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art baseline image models, and demonstrates superior performance in ICH prognosis compared to four board-certified neuroradiologists using only CT scans as input. We further validate our model with interpretability saliency maps. Code is available at https://github.com/MiriamCobo/MultitaskLearning_ICH_Prognosis.git.

- **Summary**: Artificial intelligence applied to retinal images offers significant potential for recognizing signs and symptoms of retinal conditions and expediting the diagnosis of eye diseases and systemic disorders. However, developing generalized artificial intelligence models for medical data often requires a large number of labeled images representing various disease signs, and most models are typically task-specific, focusing on major retinal diseases. In this study, we developed a Fundus-Specific Pretrained Model (Image+Fundus), a supervised artificial intelligence model trained to detect abnormalities in fundus images. A total of 57,803 images were used to develop this pretrained model, which achieved superior performance across various downstream tasks, indicating that our proposed model outperforms other general methods. Our Image+Fundus model offers a generalized approach to improve model performance while reducing the number of labeled datasets required. Additionally, it provides more disease-specific insights into fundus images, with visualizations generated by our model. These disease-specific foundation models are invaluable in enhancing the performance and efficiency of deep learning models in the field of fundus imaging.

- **Summary**: Malaria remains a significant global health challenge, necessitating rapid and accurate diagnostic methods. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools utilizing deep learning have shown promise, their generalization to diverse clinical settings remains poorly assessed. This study evaluates the generalization capabilities of a CAD model for malaria diagnosis from thin blood smear images across four sites. We explore strategies to enhance generalization, including fine-tuning and incremental learning. Our results demonstrate that incorporating site-specific data significantly improves model performance, paving the way for broader clinical application.

- **Summary**: Visual retrieval systems face significant challenges when updating models with improved representations due to misalignment between the old and new representations. The costly and resource-intensive backfilling process involves recalculating feature vectors for images in the gallery set whenever a new model is introduced. To address this, prior research has explored backward-compatible training methods that enable direct comparisons between new and old representations without backfilling. Despite these advancements, achieving a balance between backward compatibility and the performance of independently trained models remains an open problem. In this paper, we address it by expanding the representation space with additional dimensions and learning an orthogonal transformation to achieve compatibility with old models and, at the same time, integrate new information. This transformation preserves the original feature space's geometry, ensuring that our model aligns with previous versions while also learning new data. Our Orthogonal Compatible Aligned (OCA) approach eliminates the need for re-indexing during model updates and ensures that features can be compared directly across different model updates without additional mapping functions. Experimental results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k demonstrate that our method not only maintains compatibility with previous models but also achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming several existing methods.

- **Summary**: Online vectorized High-Definition (HD) map construction is crucial for subsequent prediction and planning tasks in autonomous driving. Following MapTR paradigm, recent works have made noteworthy achievements. However, reference points are randomly initialized in mainstream methods, leading to unstable matching between predictions and ground truth. To address this issue, we introduce PriorMapNet to enhance online vectorized HD map construction with priors. We propose the PPS-Decoder, which provides reference points with position and structure priors. Fitted from the map elements in the dataset, prior reference points lower the learning difficulty and achieve stable matching. Furthermore, we propose the PF-Encoder to enhance the image-to-BEV transformation with BEV feature priors. Besides, we propose the DMD cross-attention, which decouples cross-attention along multi-scale and multi-sample respectively to achieve efficiency. Our proposed PriorMapNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in the online vectorized HD map construction task on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets. The code will be released publicly soon.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical decision-making, but the scarcity of annotated data presents significant challenges. Few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods show promise but often require retraining on the target domain and struggle to generalize across different modalities. Similarly, adapting foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for medical imaging has limitations, including the need for finetuning and domain-specific adaptation. To address these issues, we propose a novel method that adapts DINOv2 and Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) for retrieval-augmented few-shot medical image segmentation. Our approach uses DINOv2's feature as query to retrieve similar samples from limited annotated data, which are then encoded as memories and stored in memory bank. With the memory attention mechanism of SAM 2, the model leverages these memories as conditions to generate accurate segmentation of the target image. We evaluated our framework on three medical image segmentation tasks, demonstrating superior performance and generalizability across various modalities without the need for any retraining or finetuning. Overall, this method offers a practical and effective solution for few-shot medical image segmentation and holds significant potential as a valuable annotation tool in clinical applications.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have shown remarkable potential in image generation, but their sampling efficiency is hindered by the need for numerous denoising steps. Most existing solutions accelerate the sampling process by proposing fast ODE solvers. However, the inevitable discretization errors of the ODE solvers are significantly magnified when the number of function evaluations (NFE) is fewer. In this work, we propose PFDiff, a novel training-free and orthogonal timestep-skipping strategy, which enables existing fast ODE solvers to operate with fewer NFE. Based on two key observations: a significant similarity in the model's outputs at time step size that is not excessively large during the denoising process of existing ODE solvers, and a high resemblance between the denoising process and SGD. PFDiff, by employing gradient replacement from past time steps and foresight updates inspired by Nesterov momentum, rapidly updates intermediate states, thereby reducing unnecessary NFE while correcting for discretization errors inherent in first-order ODE solvers. Experimental results demonstrate that PFDiff exhibits flexible applicability across various pre-trained DPMs, particularly excelling in conditional DPMs and surpassing previous state-of-the-art training-free methods. For instance, using DDIM as a baseline, we achieved 16.46 FID (4 NFE) compared to 138.81 FID with DDIM on ImageNet 64x64 with classifier guidance, and 13.06 FID (10 NFE) on Stable Diffusion with 7.5 guidance scale.

- **Summary**: Existing RGBT tracking methods often design various interaction models to perform cross-modal fusion of each layer, but can not execute the feature interactions among all layers, which plays a critical role in robust multimodal representation, due to large computational burden. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel All-layer multimodal Interaction Network, named AINet, which performs efficient and effective feature interactions of all modalities and layers in a progressive fusion Mamba, for robust RGBT tracking. Even though modality features in different layers are known to contain different cues, it is always challenging to build multimodal interactions in each layer due to struggling in balancing interaction capabilities and efficiency. Meanwhile, considering that the feature discrepancy between RGB and thermal modalities reflects their complementary information to some extent, we design a Difference-based Fusion Mamba (DFM) to achieve enhanced fusion of different modalities with linear complexity. When interacting with features from all layers, a huge number of token sequences (3840 tokens in this work) are involved and the computational burden is thus large. To handle this problem, we design an Order-dynamic Fusion Mamba (OFM) to execute efficient and effective feature interactions of all layers by dynamically adjusting the scan order of different layers in Mamba. Extensive experiments on four public RGBT tracking datasets show that AINet achieves leading performance against existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In pathological research, education, and clinical practice, the decision-making process based on pathological images is critically important. This significance extends to digital pathology image analysis: its adequacy is demonstrated by the extensive information contained within tissue structures, which is essential for accurate cancer classification and grading. Additionally, its necessity is highlighted by the inherent requirement for interpretability in the conclusions generated by algorithms. For humans, determining tumor type and grade typically involves multi-scale analysis, which presents a significant challenge for AI algorithms. Traditional patch-based methods are inadequate for modeling such complex structures, as they fail to capture the intricate, multi-scale information inherent in whole slide images. Consequently, there is a pressing need for advanced AI techniques capable of efficiently and accurately replicating this complex analytical process. To address this issue, we introduce HistoGym, an open-source reinforcement learning environment for histopathological image analysis. Following OpenAI Gym APIs, HistoGym aims to foster whole slide image diagnosis by mimicking the real-life processes of doctors. Leveraging the pyramid feature of WSIs and the OpenSlide API, HistoGym provides a unified framework for various clinical tasks, including tumor detection and classification. We detail the observation, action, and reward specifications tailored for the histopathological image analysis domain and provide an open-source Python-based interface for both clinicians and researchers. To accommodate different clinical demands, we offer various scenarios for different organs and cancers, including both WSI-based and selected region-based scenarios, showcasing several noteworthy results.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs), e.g., CLIP, have shown remarkable potential in zero-shot image classification. However, adapting these models to new domains remains challenging, especially in unsupervised settings where labelled data is unavailable. Recent research has proposed pseudo-labelling approaches to adapt CLIP in an unsupervised manner using unlabelled target data. Nonetheless, these methods struggle due to noisy pseudo-labels resulting from the misalignment between CLIP's visual and textual representations. This study introduces DPA, an unsupervised domain adaptation method for VLMs. DPA introduces the concept of dual prototypes, acting as distinct classifiers, along with the convex combination of their outputs, thereby leading to accurate pseudo-label construction. Next, it ranks pseudo-labels to facilitate robust self-training, particularly during early training. Finally, it addresses visual-textual misalignment by aligning textual prototypes with image prototypes to further improve the adaptation performance. Experiments on 13 downstream vision tasks demonstrate that DPA significantly outperforms zero-shot CLIP and the state-of-the-art unsupervised adaptation baselines.

- **Summary**: Image segmentation plays an important role in vision understanding. Recently, the emerging vision foundation models continuously achieved superior performance on various tasks. Following such success, in this paper, we prove that the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be a strong encoder for U-shaped segmentation models. We propose a simple but effective framework, termed SAM2-UNet, for versatile image segmentation. Specifically, SAM2-UNet adopts the Hiera backbone of SAM2 as the encoder, while the decoder uses the classic U-shaped design. Additionally, adapters are inserted into the encoder to allow parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Preliminary experiments on various downstream tasks, such as camouflaged object detection, salient object detection, marine animal segmentation, mirror detection, and polyp segmentation, demonstrate that our SAM2-UNet can simply beat existing specialized state-of-the-art methods without bells and whistles.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel application of image translation networks for image classification and demonstrate its potential as a more interpretable alternative to conventional black box classification networks. We train a network to translate images between possible classes, and then quantify translation distance, i.e. the degree of alteration needed to conform an image to one class or another. These translation distances can then be examined for clusters and trends, and can be fed directly to a simple classifier (e.g. a support vector machine, SVM), providing comparable accuracy compared to a conventional end-to-end convolutional neural network classifier. In addition, visual inspection of translated images can reveal class-specific characteristics and biases in the training sets, such as visual artifacts that are more frequently observed in one class or another. We demonstrate the approach on a toy 2-class scenario, apples versus oranges, and then apply it to two medical imaging tasks: detecting melanoma from photographs of pigmented lesions and classifying 6 cell types in a bone marrow biopsy smear. This novel application of image-to-image networks shows the potential of the technology to go beyond imagining different stylistic changes and to provide greater insight into image classification and medical imaging datasets.

- **Summary**: Accurate classification of haematological cells is critical for diagnosing blood disorders, but presents significant challenges for machine automation owing to the complexity of cell morphology, heterogeneities of biological, pathological, and imaging characteristics, and the imbalance of cell type frequencies. We introduce CytoDiffusion, a diffusion-based classifier that effectively models blood cell morphology, combining accurate classification with robust anomaly detection, resistance to distributional shifts, interpretability, data efficiency, and superhuman uncertainty quantification. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative models in anomaly detection (AUC 0.976 vs. 0.919), resistance to domain shifts (85.85% vs. 74.38% balanced accuracy), and performance in low-data regimes (95.88% vs. 94.95% balanced accuracy). Notably, our model generates synthetic blood cell images that are nearly indistinguishable from real images, as demonstrated by a Turing test in which expert haematologists achieved only 52.3% accuracy (95% CI: [50.5%, 54.2%]). Furthermore, we enhance model explainability through the generation of directly interpretable counterfactual heatmaps. Our comprehensive evaluation framework, encompassing these multiple performance dimensions, establishes a new benchmark for medical image analysis in haematology, ultimately enabling improved diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings.

- **Summary**: The increasing frequency and severity of wildfires highlight the need for accurate fire and plume spread models. We introduce an approach that effectively isolates and tracks fire and plume behavior across various spatial and temporal scales and image types, identifying physical phenomena in the system and providing insights useful for developing and validating models. Our method combines image segmentation and graph theory to delineate fire fronts and plume boundaries. We demonstrate that the method effectively distinguishes fires and plumes from visually similar objects. Results demonstrate the successful isolation and tracking of fire and plume dynamics across various image sources, ranging from synoptic-scale ($10^4$-$10^5$ m) satellite images to sub-microscale ($10^0$-$10^1$ m) images captured close to the fire environment. Furthermore, the methodology leverages image inpainting and spatio-temporal dataset generation for use in statistical and machine learning models.

- **Summary**: While image-to-text models have demonstrated significant advancements in various vision-language tasks, they remain susceptible to adversarial attacks. Existing white-box attacks on image-to-text models require access to the architecture, gradients, and parameters of the target model, resulting in low practicality. Although the recently proposed gray-box attacks have improved practicality, they suffer from semantic loss during the training process, which limits their targeted attack performance. To advance adversarial attacks of image-to-text models, this paper focuses on a challenging scenario: decision-based black-box targeted attacks where the attackers only have access to the final output text and aim to perform targeted attacks. Specifically, we formulate the decision-based black-box targeted attack as a large-scale optimization problem. To efficiently solve the optimization problem, a three-stage process \textit{Ask, Attend, Attack}, called \textit{AAA}, is proposed to coordinate with the solver. \textit{Ask} guides attackers to create target texts that satisfy the specific semantics. \textit{Attend} identifies the crucial regions of the image for attacking, thus reducing the search space for the subsequent \textit{Attack}. \textit{Attack} uses an evolutionary algorithm to attack the crucial regions, where the attacks are semantically related to the target texts of \textit{Ask}, thus achieving targeted attacks without semantic loss. Experimental results on transformer-based and CNN+RNN-based image-to-text models confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed \textit{AAA}.

- **Summary**: We investigate the theoretical foundations of classifier-free guidance (CFG). CFG is the dominant method of conditional sampling for text-to-image diffusion models, yet unlike other aspects of diffusion, it remains on shaky theoretical footing. In this paper, we disprove common misconceptions, by showing that CFG interacts differently with DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) and DDIM (Song et al., 2021), and neither sampler with CFG generates the gamma-powered distribution $p(x|c)^\gamma p(x)^{1-\gamma}$. Then, we clarify the behavior of CFG by showing that it is a kind of predictor-corrector method (Song et al., 2020) that alternates between denoising and sharpening, which we call predictor-corrector guidance (PCG). We prove that in the SDE limit, CFG is actually equivalent to combining a DDIM predictor for the conditional distribution together with a Langevin dynamics corrector for a gamma-powered distribution (with a carefully chosen gamma). Our work thus provides a lens to theoretically understand CFG by embedding it in a broader design space of principled sampling methods.

- **Summary**: This study compares eight pre-trained CNNs for diagnosing keratoconus, a degenerative eye disease. A carefully selected dataset of keratoconus, normal, and suspicious cases was used. The models tested include DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0, InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, VGG16, and VGG19. To maximize model training, bad sample removal, resizing, rescaling, and augmentation were used. The models were trained with similar parameters, activation function, classification function, and optimizer to compare performance. To determine class separation effectiveness, each model was evaluated on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. MobileNetV2 was the best accurate model in identifying keratoconus and normal cases with few misclassifications. InceptionV3 and DenseNet121 both performed well in keratoconus detection, but they had trouble with questionable cases. In contrast, EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, and VGG19 had more difficulty distinguishing dubious cases from regular ones, indicating the need for model refining and development. A detailed comparison of state-of-the-art CNN architectures for automated keratoconus identification reveals each model's benefits and weaknesses. This study shows that advanced deep learning models can enhance keratoconus diagnosis and treatment planning. Future research should explore hybrid models and integrate clinical parameters to improve diagnostic accuracy and robustness in real-world clinical applications, paving the way for more effective AI-driven ophthalmology tools.

- **Summary**: Human emotion is a complex phenomenon conveyed and perceived through facial expressions, vocal tones, body language, and physiological signals. Multimodal emotion recognition systems can perform well because they can learn complementary and redundant semantic information from diverse sensors. In real-world scenarios, only a subset of the modalities employed for training may be available at test time. Learning privileged information allows a model to exploit data from additional modalities that are only available during training. SOTA methods for PKD have been proposed to distill information from a teacher model (with privileged modalities) to a student model (without privileged modalities). However, such PKD methods utilize point-to-point matching and do not explicitly capture the relational information. Recently, methods have been proposed to distill the structural information. However, PKD methods based on structural similarity are primarily confined to learning from a single joint teacher representation, which limits their robustness, accuracy, and ability to learn from diverse multimodal sources. In this paper, a multi-teacher PKD (MT-PKDOT) method with self-distillation is introduced to align diverse teacher representations before distilling them to the student. MT-PKDOT employs a structural similarity KD mechanism based on a regularized optimal transport (OT) for distillation. The proposed MT-PKDOT method was validated on the Affwild2 and Biovid datasets. Results indicate that our proposed method can outperform SOTA PKD methods. It improves the visual-only baseline on Biovid data by 5.5%. On the Affwild2 dataset, the proposed method improves 3% and 5% over the visual-only baseline for valence and arousal respectively. Allowing the student to learn from multiple diverse sources is shown to increase the accuracy and implicitly avoids negative transfer to the student model.

- **Summary**: Recovering camera poses from a set of images is a foundational task in 3D computer vision, which powers key applications such as 3D scene/object reconstructions. Classic methods often depend on feature correspondence, such as keypoints, which require the input images to have large overlap and small viewpoint changes. Such requirements present considerable challenges in scenarios with sparse views. Recent data-driven approaches aim to directly output camera poses, either through regressing the 6DoF camera poses or formulating rotation as a probability distribution. However, each approach has its limitations. On one hand, directly regressing the camera poses can be ill-posed, since it assumes a single mode, which is not true under symmetry and leads to sub-optimal solutions. On the other hand, probabilistic approaches are capable of modeling the symmetry ambiguity, yet they sample the entire space of rotation uniformly by brute-force. This leads to an inevitable trade-off between high sample density, which improves model precision, and sample efficiency that determines the runtime. In this paper, we propose ADen to unify the two frameworks by employing a generator and a discriminator: the generator is trained to output multiple hypotheses of 6DoF camera pose to represent a distribution and handle multi-mode ambiguity, and the discriminator is trained to identify the hypothesis that best explains the data. This allows ADen to combine the best of both worlds, achieving substantially higher precision as well as lower runtime than previous methods in empirical evaluations.
