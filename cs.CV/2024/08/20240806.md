- **Summary**: Interactive virtual humanoid agent is a crucial interface with the physical world. A relatively complete humanoid agent first needs to have face and body, then possess both verbal and non-verbal (such as eye contact, facial expression, lip motion, gesture, and manipulation) abilities, and finally, it is capable of real-time duplex communication, e.g., the ability to actively interrupt conversations. Most prior systems typically only consider a subset of these elements, leaving a gap from realistic humanoid agent. In this work, we propose a real-time, duplex, interactive end-to-end network capable of modeling realistic agent behaviors, including speech, full-body movements for talking, responding, idling, and manipulation. This system is a multimodal model integrating audio and visual inputs, extended from a pre-trained large language model (LLM). We collect approximately 200,000 hours of audio, around 130,000 hours of video data, and about 20,000 alignment samples to build the model. The final model demonstrates capabilities that are difficult to achieve in previous systems, such as generalized object manipulation. This work performs a preliminary exploration of the end-to-end approach in this field, aiming to inspire further research towards scaling up.

- **Summary**: An electrocardiogram (ECG) captures the heart's electrical signal to assess various heart conditions. In practice, ECG data is stored as either digitized signals or printed images. Despite the emergence of numerous deep learning models for digitized signals, many hospitals prefer image storage due to cost considerations. Recognizing the unavailability of raw ECG signals in many clinical settings, we propose VizECGNet, which uses only printed ECG graphics to determine the prognosis of multiple cardiovascular diseases. During training, cross-modal attention modules (CMAM) are used to integrate information from two modalities - image and signal, while self-modality attention modules (SMAM) capture inherent long-range dependencies in ECG data of each modality. Additionally, we utilize knowledge distillation to improve the similarity between two distinct predictions from each modality stream. This innovative multi-modal deep learning architecture enables the utilization of only ECG images during inference. VizECGNet with image input achieves higher performance in precision, recall, and F1-Score compared to signal-based ECG classification models, with improvements of 3.50%, 8.21%, and 7.38%, respectively.

- **Summary**: Recent studies emphasize the crucial role of data augmentation in enhancing the performance of object detection models. However,existing methodologies often struggle to effectively harmonize dataset diversity with semantic coordination.To bridge this gap, we introduce an innovative augmentation technique leveraging pre-trained conditional diffusion models to mediate this balance. Our approach encompasses the development of a Category Affinity Matrix, meticulously designed to enhance dataset diversity, and a Surrounding Region Alignment strategy, which ensures the preservation of semantic coordination in the augmented images. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm the efficacy of our method in enriching dataset diversity while seamlessly maintaining semantic coordination. Our method yields substantial average improvements of +1.4AP, +0.9AP, and +3.4AP over existing alternatives on three distinct object detection models, respectively.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: This paper introduces MedTrinity-25M, a comprehensive, large-scale multimodal dataset for medicine, covering over 25 million images across 10 modalities, with multigranular annotations for more than 65 diseases. These enriched annotations encompass both global textual information, such as disease/lesion type, modality, region-specific descriptions, and inter-regional relationships, as well as detailed local annotations for regions of interest (ROIs), including bounding boxes, segmentation masks. Unlike existing approach which is limited by the availability of image-text pairs, we have developed the first automated pipeline that scales up multimodal data by generating multigranular visual and texual annotations (in the form of image-ROI-description triplets) without the need for any paired text descriptions. Specifically, data from over 90 different sources have been collected, preprocessed, and grounded using domain-specific expert models to identify ROIs related to abnormal regions. We then build a comprehensive knowledge base and prompt multimodal large language models to perform retrieval-augmented generation with the identified ROIs as guidance, resulting in multigranular texual descriptions. Compared to existing datasets, MedTrinity-25M provides the most enriched annotations, supporting a comprehensive range of multimodal tasks such as captioning and report generation, as well as vision-centric tasks like classification and segmentation. Pretraining on MedTrinity-25M, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on VQA-RAD and PathVQA, surpassing both multimodal large language models and other representative SoTA approaches. This dataset can also be utilized to support large-scale pre-training of multimodal medical AI models, contributing to the development of future foundation models in the medical domain.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We propose Lighthouse, a user-friendly library for reproducible video moment retrieval and highlight detection (MR-HD). Although researchers proposed various MR-HD approaches, the research community holds two main issues. The first is a lack of comprehensive and reproducible experiments across various methods, datasets, and video-text features. This is because no unified training and evaluation codebase covers multiple settings. The second is user-unfriendly design. Because previous works use different libraries, researchers set up individual environments. In addition, most works release only the training codes, requiring users to implement the whole inference process of MR-HD. Lighthouse addresses these issues by implementing a unified reproducible codebase that includes six models, three features, and five datasets. In addition, it provides an inference API and web demo to make these methods easily accessible for researchers and developers. Our experiments demonstrate that Lighthouse generally reproduces the reported scores in the reference papers. The code is available at https://github.com/line/lighthouse.

- **Summary**: Spatial pooling (SP) and cross-channel pooling (CCP) operators have been applied to aggregate spatial features and pixel-wise features from feature maps in deep neural networks (DNNs), respectively. Their main goal is to reduce computation and memory overhead without visibly weakening the performance of DNNs. However, SP often faces the problem of losing the subtle feature representations, while CCP has a high possibility of ignoring salient feature representations, which may lead to both miscalibration of confidence issues and suboptimal medical classification results. To address these problems, we propose a novel dual-view framework, the first to systematically investigate the relative roles of SP and CCP by analyzing the difference between spatial features and pixel-wise features. Based on this framework, we propose a new pooling method, termed dual-view pyramid pooling (DVPP), to aggregate multi-scale dual-view features. DVPP aims to boost both medical image classification and confidence calibration performance by fully leveraging the merits of SP and CCP operators from a dual-axis perspective. Additionally, we discuss how to fulfill DVPP with five parameter-free implementations. Extensive experiments on six 2D/3D medical image classification tasks show that our DVPP surpasses state-of-the-art pooling methods in terms of medical image classification results and confidence calibration across different DNNs.

- **Summary**: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) are primarily based on Transformers. However, existing Transformer-based 3D HPE backbones often encounter a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. To resolve the above dilemma, in this work, we leverage recent advances in state space models and utilize Mamba for high-quality and efficient long-range modeling. Nonetheless, Mamba still faces challenges in precisely exploiting local dependencies between joints. To address these issues, we propose a new attention-free hybrid spatiotemporal architecture named Hybrid Mamba-GCN (Pose Magic). This architecture introduces local enhancement with GCN by capturing relationships between neighboring joints, thus producing new representations to complement Mamba's outputs. By adaptively fusing representations from Mamba and GCN, Pose Magic demonstrates superior capability in learning the underlying 3D structure. To meet the requirements of real-time inference, we also provide a fully causal version. Extensive experiments show that Pose Magic achieves new SOTA results ($\downarrow 0.9 mm$) while saving $74.1\%$ FLOPs. In addition, Pose Magic exhibits optimal motion consistency and the ability to generalize to unseen sequence lengths.

- **Summary**: With breakthroughs in large-scale modeling, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its extensions have been attempted for applications in various underwater visualization tasks in marine sciences, and have had a significant impact on the academic community. Recently, Meta has further developed the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), which significantly improves running speed and segmentation accuracy compared to its predecessor. This report aims to explore the potential of SAM2 in marine science by evaluating it on the underwater instance segmentation benchmark datasets UIIS and USIS10K. The experiments show that the performance of SAM2 is extremely dependent on the type of user-provided prompts. When using the ground truth bounding box as prompt, SAM2 performed excellently in the underwater instance segmentation domain. However, when running in automatic mode, SAM2's ability with point prompts to sense and segment underwater instances is significantly degraded. It is hoped that this paper will inspire researchers to further explore the SAM model family in the underwater domain. The results and evaluation codes in this paper are available at https://github.com/LiamLian0727/UnderwaterSAM2Eval.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks have demonstrated exceptional efficacy in stroke lesion segmentation. However, the delineation of small lesions, critical for stroke diagnosis, remains a challenge. In this study, we propose two straightforward yet powerful approaches that can be seamlessly integrated into a variety of networks: Multi-Size Labeling (MSL) and Distance-Based Labeling (DBL), with the aim of enhancing the segmentation accuracy of small lesions. MSL divides lesion masks into various categories based on lesion volume while DBL emphasizes the lesion boundaries. Experimental evaluations on the Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS) v2.0 dataset showcase that an ensemble of MSL and DBL achieves consistently better or equal performance on recall (3.6% and 3.7%), F1 (2.4% and 1.5%), and Dice scores (1.3% and 0.0%) compared to the top-1 winner of the 2022 MICCAI ATLAS Challenge on both the subset only containing small lesions and the entire dataset, respectively. Notably, on the mini-lesion subset, a single MSL model surpasses the previous best ensemble strategy, with enhancements of 1.0% and 0.3% on F1 and Dice scores, respectively.

- **Summary**: All current benchmarks for multimodal deepfake detection manipulate entire frames using various generation techniques, resulting in oversaturated detection accuracies exceeding 94% at the video-level classification. However, these benchmarks struggle to detect dynamic deepfake attacks with challenging frame-by-frame alterations presented in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce FakeMix, a novel clip-level evaluation benchmark aimed at identifying manipulated segments within both video and audio, providing insight into the origins of deepfakes. Furthermore, we propose novel evaluation metrics, Temporal Accuracy (TA) and Frame-wise Discrimination Metric (FDM), to assess the robustness of deepfake detection models. Evaluating state-of-the-art models against diverse deepfake benchmarks, particularly FakeMix, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach comprehensively. Specifically, while achieving an Average Precision (AP) of 94.2% at the video-level, the evaluation of the existing models at the clip-level using the proposed metrics, TA and FDM, yielded sharp declines in accuracy to 53.1%, and 52.1%, respectively.

- **Summary**: Online temporal action localization (On-TAL) is the task of identifying multiple action instances given a streaming video. Since existing methods take as input only a video segment of fixed size per iteration, they are limited in considering long-term context and require tuning the segment size carefully. To overcome these limitations, we propose memory-augmented transformer (MATR). MATR utilizes the memory queue that selectively preserves the past segment features, allowing to leverage long-term context for inference. We also propose a novel action localization method that observes the current input segment to predict the end time of the ongoing action and accesses the memory queue to estimate the start time of the action. Our method outperformed existing methods on two datasets, THUMOS14 and MUSES, surpassing not only TAL methods in the online setting but also some offline TAL methods.

- **Summary**: Compressing a set of unordered points is far more challenging than compressing images/videos of regular sample grids, because of the difficulties in characterizing neighboring relations in an irregular layout of points. Many researchers resort to voxelization to introduce regularity, but this approach suffers from quantization loss. In this research, we use the KNN method to determine the neighborhoods of raw surface points. This gives us a means to determine the spatial context in which the latent features of 3D points are compressed by arithmetic coding. As such, the conditional probability model is adaptive to local geometry, leading to significant rate reduction. Additionally, we propose a dual-layer architecture where a non-learning base layer reconstructs the main structures of the point cloud at low complexity, while a learned refinement layer focuses on preserving fine details. This design leads to reductions in model complexity and coding latency by two orders of magnitude compared to SOTA methods. Moreover, we incorporate an implicit neural representation (INR) into the refinement layer, allowing the decoder to sample points on the underlying surface at arbitrary densities. This work is the first to effectively exploit content-aware local contexts for compressing irregular raw point clouds, achieving high rate-distortion performance, low complexity, and the ability to function as an arbitrary-scale upsampling network simultaneously.

- **Summary**: E-commerce is increasingly multimedia-enriched, with products exhibited in a broad-domain manner as images, short videos, or live stream promotions. A unified and vectorized cross-domain production representation is essential. Due to large intra-product variance and high inter-product similarity in the broad-domain scenario, a visual-only representation is inadequate. While Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) text derived from the short or live-stream videos is readily accessible, how to de-noise the excessively noisy text for multimodal representation learning is mostly untouched. We propose ASR-enhanced Multimodal Product Representation Learning (AMPere). In order to extract product-specific information from the raw ASR text, AMPere uses an easy-to-implement LLM-based ASR text summarizer. The LLM-summarized text, together with visual data, is then fed into a multi-branch network to generate compact multimodal embeddings. Extensive experiments on a large-scale tri-domain dataset verify the effectiveness of AMPere in obtaining a unified multimodal product representation that clearly improves cross-domain product retrieval.

- **Summary**: Recent studies on AI security have highlighted the vulnerability of Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models to subtle yet intentionally designed perturbations in images and texts. Investigating multimodal systems' robustness via adversarial attacks is crucial in this field. Most multimodal attacks are sample-specific, generating a unique perturbation for each sample to construct adversarial samples. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work through multimodal decision boundaries to explore the creation of a universal, sample-agnostic perturbation that applies to any image. Initially, we explore strategies to move sample points beyond the decision boundaries of linear classifiers, refining the algorithm to ensure successful attacks under the top $k$ accuracy metric. Based on this foundation, in visual-language tasks, we treat visual and textual modalities as reciprocal sample points and decision hyperplanes, guiding image embeddings to traverse text-constructed decision boundaries, and vice versa. This iterative process consistently refines a universal perturbation, ultimately identifying a singular direction within the input space which is exploitable to impair the retrieval performance of VLP models. The proposed algorithms support the creation of global perturbations or adversarial patches. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, showcasing its data, task, and model transferability across various VLP models and datasets.

- **Summary**: Non-exemplar class-incremental learning (NECIL) is to resist catastrophic forgetting without saving old class samples. Prior methodologies generally employ simple rules to generate features for replaying, suffering from large distribution gap between replayed features and real ones. To address the aforementioned issue, we propose a simple, yet effective \textbf{Diff}usion-based \textbf{F}eature \textbf{R}eplay (\textbf{DiffFR}) method for NECIL. First, to alleviate the limited representational capacity caused by fixing the feature extractor, we employ Siamese-based self-supervised learning for initial generalizable features. Second, we devise diffusion models to generate class-representative features highly similar to real features, which provides an effective way for exemplar-free knowledge memorization. Third, we introduce prototype calibration to direct the diffusion model's focus towards learning the distribution shapes of features, rather than the entire distribution. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate significant performance gains of our DiffFR, outperforming the state-of-the-art NECIL methods by 3.0\% in average. The code will be made publicly available soon.

- **Summary**: Recently, the text-to-3D task has developed rapidly due to the appearance of the SDS method. However, the SDS method always generates 3D objects with poor quality due to the over-smooth issue. This issue is attributed to two factors: 1) the DDPM single-step inference produces poor guidance gradients; 2) the randomness from the input noises and timesteps averages the details of the 3D contents.In this paper, to address the issue, we propose DreamLCM which incorporates the Latent Consistency Model (LCM). DreamLCM leverages the powerful image generation capabilities inherent in LCM, enabling generating consistent and high-quality guidance, i.e., predicted noises or images. Powered by the improved guidance, the proposed method can provide accurate and detailed gradients to optimize the target 3D models.In addition, we propose two strategies to enhance the generation quality further. Firstly, we propose a guidance calibration strategy, utilizing Euler Solver to calibrate the guidance distribution to accelerate 3D models to converge. Secondly, we propose a dual timestep strategy, increasing the consistency of guidance and optimizing 3D models from geometry to appearance in DreamLCM. Experiments show that DreamLCM achieves state-of-the-art results in both generation quality and training efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/1YimingZhong/DreamLCM.

- **Summary**: In recent years, large-scale multimodal models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various domains. However, enabling these models to effectively perform multiple multimodal tasks simultaneously remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce a novel tuning method called neural tuning, designed to handle diverse multimodal tasks concurrently, including reasoning segmentation, referring segmentation, image captioning, and text-to-image generation. Neural tuning emulates sparse distributed representation in human brain, where only specific subsets of neurons are activated for each task. Additionally, we present a new benchmark, MMUD, where each sample is annotated with multiple task labels. By applying neural tuning to pretrained large models on the MMUD benchmark, we achieve simultaneous task handling in a streamlined and efficient manner. All models, code, and datasets will be publicly available after publication, facilitating further research and development in this field.

- **Summary**: Emotional Video Captioning is an emerging task that aims to describe factual content with the intrinsic emotions expressed in videos. The essential of the EVC task is to effectively perceive subtle and ambiguous visual emotional cues during the caption generation, which is neglected by the traditional video captioning. Existing emotional video captioning methods perceive global visual emotional cues at first, and then combine them with the video features to guide the emotional caption generation, which neglects two characteristics of the EVC task. Firstly, their methods neglect the dynamic subtle changes in the intrinsic emotions of the video, which makes it difficult to meet the needs of common scenes with diverse and changeable emotions. Secondly, as their methods incorporate emotional cues into each step, the guidance role of emotion is overemphasized, which makes factual content more or less ignored during generation. To this end, we propose a dual-path collaborative generation network, which dynamically perceives visual emotional cues evolutions while generating emotional captions by collaborative learning. Specifically, in the dynamic emotion perception path, we propose a dynamic emotion evolution module, which first aggregates visual features and historical caption features to summarize the global visual emotional cues, and then dynamically selects emotional cues required to be re-composed at each stage. Besides, in the adaptive caption generation path, to balance the description of factual content and emotional cues, we propose an emotion adaptive decoder. Thus, our methods can generate emotion-related words at the necessary time step, and our caption generation balances the guidance of factual content and emotional cues well. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach and each proposed module.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the problem of unsupervised video anomaly detection (UVAD). The task aims to detect abnormal events in test video using unlabeled videos as training data. The presence of anomalies in the training data poses a significant challenge in this task, particularly because they form clusters in the feature space. We refer to this property as the "Anomaly Cluster" issue. The condensed nature of these anomalies makes it difficult to distinguish between normal and abnormal data in the training set. Consequently, training conventional anomaly detection techniques using an unlabeled dataset often leads to sub-optimal results. To tackle this difficulty, we propose a new method called Cleansed k-Nearest Neighbor (CKNN), which explicitly filters out the Anomaly Clusters by cleansing the training dataset. Following the k-nearest neighbor algorithm in the feature space provides powerful anomaly detection capability. Although the identified Anomaly Cluster issue presents a significant challenge to applying k-nearest neighbor in UVAD, our proposed cleansing scheme effectively addresses this problem. We evaluate the proposed method on various benchmark datasets and demonstrate that CKNN outperforms the previous state-of-the-art UVAD method by up to 8.5% (from 82.0 to 89.0) in terms of AUROC. Moreover, we emphasize that the performance of the proposed method is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art method trained using anomaly-free data.

- **Summary**: The significance of background information is frequently overlooked in contemporary research concerning channel attention mechanisms. This study addresses the issue of suboptimal single-spectral nighttime pedestrian detection performance under low-light conditions by incorporating background information into the channel attention mechanism. Despite numerous studies focusing on the development of efficient channel attention mechanisms, the relevance of background information has been largely disregarded. By adopting a contrast learning approach, we reexamine channel attention with regard to pedestrian objects and background information for nighttime pedestrian detection, resulting in the proposed Fore-Background Contrast Attention (FBCA). FBCA possesses two primary attributes: (1) channel descriptors form remote dependencies with global spatial feature information; (2) the integration of background information enhances the distinction between channels concentrating on low-light pedestrian features and those focusing on background information. Consequently, the acquired channel descriptors exhibit a higher semantic level and spatial accuracy. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that FBCA significantly outperforms existing methods in single-spectral nighttime pedestrian detection, achieving state-of-the-art results on the NightOwls and TJU-DHD-pedestrian datasets. Furthermore, this methodology also yields performance improvements for the multispectral LLVIP dataset. These findings indicate that integrating background information into the channel attention mechanism effectively mitigates detector performance degradation caused by illumination factors in nighttime scenarios.

- **Summary**: Conditional video diffusion models (CDM) have shown promising results for video synthesis, potentially enabling the generation of realistic echocardiograms to address the problem of data scarcity. However, current CDMs require a paired segmentation map and echocardiogram dataset. We present a new method called Free-Echo for generating realistic echocardiograms from a single end-diastolic segmentation map without additional training data. Our method is based on the 3D-Unet with Temporal Attention Layers model and is conditioned on the segmentation map using a training-free conditioning method based on SDEdit. We evaluate our model on two public echocardiogram datasets, CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic. We show that our model can generate plausible echocardiograms that are spatially aligned with the input segmentation map, achieving performance comparable to training-based CDMs. Our work opens up new possibilities for generating echocardiograms from a single segmentation map, which can be used for data augmentation, domain adaptation, and other applications in medical imaging.

- **Summary**: With growing interest in recent years, medical visual question answering (Med-VQA) has rapidly evolved, with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerging as an alternative to classical model architectures. Specifically, their ability to add visual information to the input of pre-trained LLMs brings new capabilities for image interpretation. However, simple visual errors cast doubt on the actual visual understanding abilities of these models. To address this, region-based questions have been proposed as a means to assess and enhance actual visual understanding through compositional evaluation. To combine these two perspectives, this paper introduces targeted visual prompting to equip MLLMs with region-based questioning capabilities. By presenting the model with both the isolated region and the region in its context in a customized visual prompt, we show the effectiveness of our method across multiple datasets while comparing it to several baseline models. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/sergiotasconmorales/locvqallm.

- **Summary**: Lightweight and effective models are essential for devices with limited resources, such as intelligent vehicles. Structured pruning offers a promising approach to model compression and efficiency enhancement. However, existing methods often tie pruning techniques to specific model architectures or vision tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel unified pruning framework Comb, Prune, Distill (CPD), which addresses both model-agnostic and task-agnostic concerns simultaneously. Our framework employs a combing step to resolve hierarchical layer-wise dependency issues, enabling architecture independence. Additionally, the pruning pipeline adaptively remove parameters based on the importance scoring metrics regardless of vision tasks. To support the model in retaining its learned information, we introduce knowledge distillation during the pruning step. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalizability of our framework, encompassing both convolutional neural network (CNN) and transformer models, as well as image classification and segmentation tasks. In image classification we achieve a speedup of up to x4.3 with a accuracy loss of 1.8% and in semantic segmentation up to x1.89 with a 5.1% loss in mIoU.



### FastEdit: Fast Text-Guided Single-Image Editing via Semantic-Aware Diffusion Fine-Tuning

- **Summary**: Conventional Text-guided single-image editing approaches require a two-step process, including fine-tuning the target text embedding for over 1K iterations and the generative model for another 1.5K iterations. Although it ensures that the resulting image closely aligns with both the input image and the target text, this process often requires 7 minutes per image, posing a challenge for practical application due to its time-intensive nature. To address this bottleneck, we introduce FastEdit, a fast text-guided single-image editing method with semantic-aware diffusion fine-tuning, dramatically accelerating the editing process to only 17 seconds. FastEdit streamlines the generative model's fine-tuning phase, reducing it from 1.5K to a mere 50 iterations. For diffusion fine-tuning, we adopt certain time step values based on the semantic discrepancy between the input image and target text. Furthermore, FastEdit circumvents the initial fine-tuning step by utilizing an image-to-image model that conditions on the feature space, rather than the text embedding space. It can effectively align the target text prompt and input image within the same feature space and save substantial processing time. Additionally, we apply the parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique LoRA to U-net. With LoRA, FastEdit minimizes the model's trainable parameters to only 0.37\% of the original size. At the same time, we can achieve comparable editing outcomes with significantly reduced computational overhead. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the editing performance of our approach and show promising editing capabilities, including content addition, style transfer, background replacement, and posture manipulation, etc.

- **Summary**: Over the last few decades, image-based building surface reconstruction has garnered substantial research interest and has been applied across various fields, such as heritage preservation, architectural planning, etc. Compared to the traditional photogrammetric and NeRF-based solutions, recently, Gaussian fields-based methods have exhibited significant potential in generating surface meshes due to their time-efficient training and detailed 3D information preservation. However, most gaussian fields-based methods are trained with all image pixels, encompassing building and nonbuilding areas, which results in a significant noise for building meshes and degeneration in time efficiency. This paper proposes a novel framework, Masked Gaussian Fields (MGFs), designed to generate accurate surface reconstruction for building in a time-efficient way. The framework first applies EfficientSAM and COLMAP to generate multi-level masks of building and the corresponding masked point clouds. Subsequently, the masked gaussian fields are trained by integrating two innovative losses: a multi-level perceptual masked loss focused on constructing building regions and a boundary loss aimed at enhancing the details of the boundaries between different masks. Finally, we improve the tetrahedral surface mesh extraction method based on the masked gaussian spheres. Comprehensive experiments on UAV images demonstrate that, compared to the traditional method and several NeRF-based and Gaussian-based SOTA solutions, our approach significantly improves both the accuracy and efficiency of building surface reconstruction. Notably, as a byproduct, there is an additional gain in the novel view synthesis of building.

- **Summary**: Collective perception has received considerable attention as a promising approach to overcome occlusions and limited sensing ranges of vehicle-local perception in autonomous driving. In order to develop and test novel collective perception technologies, appropriate datasets are required. These datasets must include not only different environmental conditions, as they strongly influence the perception capabilities, but also a wide range of scenarios with different road users as well as realistic sensor models. Therefore, we propose the Synthetic COllective PErception (SCOPE) dataset. SCOPE is the first synthetic multi-modal dataset that incorporates realistic camera and LiDAR models as well as parameterized and physically accurate weather simulations for both sensor types. The dataset contains 17,600 frames from over 40 diverse scenarios with up to 24 collaborative agents, infrastructure sensors, and passive traffic, including cyclists and pedestrians. In addition, recordings from two novel digital-twin maps from Karlsruhe and T\"ubingen are included. The dataset is available at https://ekut-es.github.io/scope

- **Summary**: Endoscopic surgery relies on two-dimensional views, posing challenges for surgeons in depth perception and instrument manipulation. While Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, its implementation in endoscopic procedures presents significant challenges due to hardware limitations, such as the use of a monocular camera and the absence of odometry sensors. This study presents a robust deep learning-based SLAM approach that combines state-of-the-art and newly developed models. It consists of three main parts: the Monocular Pose Estimation Module that introduces a novel unsupervised method based on the CycleGAN architecture, the Monocular Depth Estimation Module that leverages the novel Zoe architecture, and the 3D Reconstruction Module which uses information from the previous models to create a coherent surgical map. The performance of the procedure was rigorously evaluated using three publicly available datasets (Hamlyn, EndoSLAM, and SCARED) and benchmarked against two state-of-the-art methods, EndoSFMLearner and EndoDepth. The integration of Zoe in the MDEM demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art depth estimation algorithms in endoscopy, whereas the novel approach in the MPEM exhibited competitive performance and the lowest inference time. The results showcase the robustness of our approach in laparoscopy, gastroscopy, and colonoscopy, three different scenarios in endoscopic surgery. The proposed SLAM approach has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of endoscopic procedures by providing surgeons with enhanced depth perception and 3D reconstruction capabilities.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we briefly introduce the solution developed by our team, HFUT-VUT, for the track of Micro-gesture Classification in the MiGA challenge at IJCAI 2024. The task of micro-gesture classification task involves recognizing the category of a given video clip, which focuses on more fine-grained and subtle body movements compared to typical action recognition tasks. Given the inherent complexity of micro-gesture recognition, which includes large intra-class variability and minimal inter-class differences, we utilize two innovative modules, i.e., the cross-modal fusion module and prototypical refinement module, to improve the discriminative ability of MG features, thereby improving the classification accuracy. Our solution achieved significant success, ranking 1st in the track of Micro-gesture Classification. We surpassed the performance of last year's leading team by a substantial margin, improving Top-1 accuracy by 6.13%.

- **Summary**: Differentiable volumetric rendering-based methods made significant progress in novel view synthesis. On one hand, innovative methods have replaced the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) network with locally parameterized structures, enabling high-quality renderings in a reasonable time. On the other hand, approaches have used differentiable splatting instead of NeRF's ray casting to optimize radiance fields rapidly using Gaussian kernels, allowing for fine adaptation to the scene. However, differentiable ray casting of irregularly spaced kernels has been scarcely explored, while splatting, despite enabling fast rendering times, is susceptible to clearly visible artifacts.   Our work closes this gap by providing a physically consistent formulation of the emitted radiance c and density {\sigma}, decomposed with Gaussian functions associated with Spherical Gaussians/Harmonics for all-frequency colorimetric representation. We also introduce a method enabling differentiable ray casting of irregularly distributed Gaussians using an algorithm that integrates radiance fields slab by slab and leverages a BVH structure. This allows our approach to finely adapt to the scene while avoiding splatting artifacts. As a result, we achieve superior rendering quality compared to the state-of-the-art while maintaining reasonable training times and achieving inference speeds of 25 FPS on the Blender dataset.

- **Summary**: Existing plant disease classification models have achieved remarkable performance in recognizing in-laboratory diseased images. However, their performance often significantly degrades in classifying in-the-wild images. Furthermore, we observed that in-the-wild plant images may exhibit similar appearances across various diseases (i.e., small inter-class discrepancy) while the same diseases may look quite different (i.e., large intra-class variance). Motivated by this observation, we propose an in-the-wild multimodal plant disease recognition dataset that contains the largest number of disease classes but also text-based descriptions for each disease. Particularly, the newly provided text descriptions are introduced to provide rich information in textual modality and facilitate in-the-wild disease classification with small inter-class discrepancy and large intra-class variance issues. Therefore, our proposed dataset can be regarded as an ideal testbed for evaluating disease recognition methods in the real world. In addition, we further present a strong yet versatile baseline that models text descriptions and visual data through multiple prototypes for a given class. By fusing the contributions of multimodal prototypes in classification, our baseline can effectively address the small inter-class discrepancy and large intra-class variance issues. Remarkably, our baseline model can not only classify diseases but also recognize diseases in few-shot or training-free scenarios. Extensive benchmarking results demonstrate that our proposed in-the-wild multimodal dataset sets many new challenges to the plant disease recognition task and there is a large space to improve for future works.

- **Summary**: The aim of surface defect detection is to identify and localise abnormal regions on the surfaces of captured objects, a task that's increasingly demanded across various industries. Current approaches frequently fail to fulfil the extensive demands of these industries, which encompass high performance, consistency, and fast operation, along with the capacity to leverage the entirety of the available training data. Addressing these gaps, we introduce SuperSimpleNet, an innovative discriminative model that evolved from SimpleNet. This advanced model significantly enhances its predecessor's training consistency, inference time, as well as detection performance. SuperSimpleNet operates in an unsupervised manner using only normal training images but also benefits from labelled abnormal training images when they are available. SuperSimpleNet achieves state-of-the-art results in both the supervised and the unsupervised settings, as demonstrated by experiments across four challenging benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: The rapid increase in multimedia data has spurred advancements in Multimodal Summarization with Multimodal Output (MSMO), which aims to produce a multimodal summary that integrates both text and relevant images. The inherent heterogeneity of content within multimodal inputs and outputs presents a significant challenge to the execution of MSMO. Traditional approaches typically adopt a holistic perspective on coarse image-text data or individual visual objects, overlooking the essential connections between objects and the entities they represent. To integrate the fine-grained entity knowledge, we propose an Entity-Guided Multimodal Summarization model (EGMS). Our model, building on BART, utilizes dual multimodal encoders with shared weights to process text-image and entity-image information concurrently. A gating mechanism then combines visual data for enhanced textual summary generation, while image selection is refined through knowledge distillation from a pre-trained vision-language model. Extensive experiments on public MSMO dataset validate the superiority of the EGMS method, which also prove the necessity to incorporate entity information into MSMO problem.

- **Summary**: Image generative AI has garnered significant attention in recent years. In particular, the diffusion model, a core component of recent generative AI, produces high-quality images with rich diversity. In this study, we propose a novel CT reconstruction method by combining the denoising diffusion probabilistic model with iterative CT reconstruction. In sharp contrast to previous studies, we optimize the fidelity loss of CT reconstruction with respect to the latent variable of the diffusion model, instead of the image and model parameters. To suppress anatomical structure changes produced by the diffusion model, we shallow the diffusion and reverse processes, and fix a set of added noises in the reverse process to make it deterministic during inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through sparse view CT reconstruction of 1/10 view projection data. Despite the simplicity of the implementation, the proposed method shows the capability of reconstructing high-quality images while preserving the patient's anatomical structure, and outperforms existing methods including iterative reconstruction, iterative reconstruction with total variation, and the diffusion model alone in terms of quantitative indices such as SSIM and PSNR. We also explore further sparse view CT using 1/20 view projection data with the same trained diffusion model. As the number of iterations increases, image quality improvement comparable to that of 1/10 sparse view CT reconstruction is achieved. In principle, the proposed method can be widely applied not only to CT but also to other imaging modalities such as MRI, PET, and SPECT.

- **Summary**: Dilated Convolution with Learnable Spacing (DCLS) is a recent advanced convolution method that allows enlarging the receptive fields (RF) without increasing the number of parameters, like the dilated convolution, yet without imposing a regular grid. DCLS has been shown to outperform the standard and dilated convolutions on several computer vision benchmarks. Here, we show that, in addition, DCLS increases the models' interpretability, defined as the alignment with human visual strategies. To quantify it, we use the Spearman correlation between the models' GradCAM heatmaps and the ClickMe dataset heatmaps, which reflect human visual attention. We took eight reference models - ResNet50, ConvNeXt (T, S and B), CAFormer, ConvFormer, and FastViT (sa 24 and 36) - and drop-in replaced the standard convolution layers with DCLS ones. This improved the interpretability score in seven of them. Moreover, we observed that Grad-CAM generated random heatmaps for two models in our study: CAFormer and ConvFormer models, leading to low interpretability scores. We addressed this issue by introducing Threshold-Grad-CAM, a modification built on top of Grad-CAM that enhanced interpretability across nearly all models.

- **Summary**: We introduce a new approach for generating realistic 3D models with UV maps through a representation termed "Object Images." This approach encapsulates surface geometry, appearance, and patch structures within a 64x64 pixel image, effectively converting complex 3D shapes into a more manageable 2D format. By doing so, we address the challenges of both geometric and semantic irregularity inherent in polygonal meshes. This method allows us to use image generation models, such as Diffusion Transformers, directly for 3D shape generation. Evaluated on the ABO dataset, our generated shapes with patch structures achieve point cloud FID comparable to recent 3D generative models, while naturally supporting PBR material generation.

- **Summary**: We propose an application of online hard sample mining for efficient training of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). NeRF models produce state-of-the-art quality for many 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks but require substantial computational resources. The encoding of the scene information within the NeRF network parameters necessitates stochastic sampling. We observe that during the training, a major part of the compute time and memory usage is spent on processing already learnt samples, which no longer affect the model update significantly. We identify the backward pass on the stochastic samples as the computational bottleneck during the optimization. We thus perform the first forward pass in inference mode as a relatively low-cost search for hard samples. This is followed by building the computational graph and updating the NeRF network parameters using only the hard samples. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we apply our method to Instant-NGP, resulting in significant improvements of the view-synthesis quality over the baseline (1 dB improvement on average per training time, or 2x speedup to reach the same PSNR level) along with approx. 40% memory savings coming from using only the hard samples to build the computational graph. As our method only interfaces with the network module, we expect it to be widely applicable.

- **Summary**: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a leading diagnostic modality for a wide range of exams, where multiple contrast images are often acquired for characterizing different tissues. However, acquiring high-resolution MRI typically extends scan time, which can introduce motion artifacts. Super-resolution of MRI therefore emerges as a promising approach to mitigate these challenges. Earlier studies have investigated the use of multiple contrasts for MRI super-resolution (MCSR), whereas majority of them did not fully exploit the rich contrast-invariant structural information. To fully utilize such crucial prior knowledge of multi-contrast MRI, in this work, we propose a novel structure-guided MCSR (SGSR) framework based on a new spatio-frequency co-query attention (CQA) mechanism. Specifically, CQA performs attention on features of multiple contrasts with a shared structural query, which is particularly designed to extract, fuse, and refine the common structures from different contrasts. We further propose a novel frequency-domain CQA module in addition to the spatial domain, to enable more fine-grained structural refinement. Extensive experiments on fastMRI knee data and low-field brain MRI show that SGSR outperforms state-of-the-art MCSR methods with statistical significance.

- **Summary**: Personalized federated learning (PFL) for surgical instrument segmentation (SIS) is a promising approach. It enables multiple clinical sites to collaboratively train a series of models in privacy, with each model tailored to the individual distribution of each site. Existing PFL methods rarely consider the personalization of multi-headed self-attention, and do not account for appearance diversity and instrument shape similarity, both inherent in surgical scenes. We thus propose PFedSIS, a novel PFL method with visual trait priors for SIS, incorporating global-personalized disentanglement (GPD), appearance-regulation personalized enhancement (APE), and shape-similarity global enhancement (SGE), to boost SIS performance in each site. GPD represents the first attempt at head-wise assignment for multi-headed self-attention personalization. To preserve the unique appearance representation of each site and gradually leverage the inter-site difference, APE introduces appearance regulation and provides customized layer-wise aggregation solutions via hypernetworks for each site's personalized parameters. The mutual shape information of instruments is maintained and shared via SGE, which enhances the cross-style shape consistency on the image level and computes the shape-similarity contribution of each site on the prediction level for updating the global parameters. PFedSIS outperforms state-of-the-art methods with +1.51% Dice, +2.11% IoU, -2.79 ASSD, -15.55 HD95 performance gains. The corresponding code and models will be released at https://github.com/wzjialang/PFedSIS.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models continuously push the boundary of state-of-the-art image generation, but the process is hard to control with any nuance: practice proves that textual prompts are inadequate for accurately describing image style or fine structural details (such as faces). ControlNet and IPAdapter address this shortcoming by conditioning the generative process on imagery instead, but each individual instance is limited to modeling a single conditional posterior: for practical use-cases, where multiple different posteriors are desired within the same workflow, training and using multiple adapters is cumbersome. We propose IPAdapter-Instruct, which combines natural-image conditioning with ``Instruct'' prompts to swap between interpretations for the same conditioning image: style transfer, object extraction, both, or something else still? IPAdapterInstruct efficiently learns multiple tasks with minimal loss in quality compared to dedicated per-task models.

- **Summary**: Continual learning (CL) refers to the ability to continually learn over time by accommodating new knowledge while retaining previously learned experience. While this concept is inherent in human learning, current machine learning methods are highly prone to overwrite previously learned patterns and thus forget past experience. Instead, model parameters should be updated selectively and carefully, avoiding unnecessary forgetting while optimally leveraging previously learned patterns to accelerate future learning. Since hand-crafting effective update mechanisms is difficult, we propose meta-learning a transformer-based optimizer to enhance CL. This meta-learned optimizer uses attention to learn the complex relationships between model parameters across a stream of tasks, and is designed to generate effective weight updates for the current task while preventing catastrophic forgetting on previously encountered tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets like SplitMNIST, RotatedMNIST, and SplitCIFAR-100 affirm the efficacy of the proposed approach in terms of both forward and backward transfer, even on small sets of labeled data, highlighting the advantages of integrating a meta-learned optimizer within the continual learning framework.

- **Summary**: Pose estimation and tracking of objects is a fundamental application in 3D vision. Event cameras possess remarkable attributes such as high dynamic range, low latency, and resilience against motion blur, which enables them to address challenging high dynamic range scenes or high-speed motion. These features make event cameras an ideal complement over standard cameras for object pose estimation. In this work, we propose a line-based robust pose estimation and tracking method for planar or non-planar objects using an event camera. Firstly, we extract object lines directly from events, then provide an initial pose using a globally-optimal Branch-and-Bound approach, where 2D-3D line correspondences are not known in advance. Subsequently, we utilize event-line matching to establish correspondences between 2D events and 3D models. Furthermore, object poses are refined and continuously tracked by minimizing event-line distances. Events are assigned different weights based on these distances, employing robust estimation algorithms. To evaluate the precision of the proposed methods in object pose estimation and tracking, we have devised and established an event-based moving object dataset. Compared against state-of-the-art methods, the robustness and accuracy of our methods have been validated both on synthetic experiments and the proposed dataset.

- **Summary**: Quantifying and evaluating image complexity can be instrumental in enhancing the performance of various computer vision tasks. Supervised learning can effectively learn image complexity features from well-annotated datasets. However, creating such datasets requires expensive manual annotation costs. The models may learn human subjective biases from it. In this work, we introduce the MoCo v2 framework. We utilize contrastive learning to represent image complexity, named CLIC (Contrastive Learning for Image Complexity). We find that there are complexity differences between different local regions of an image, and propose Random Crop and Mix (RCM), which can produce positive samples consisting of multi-scale local crops. RCM can also expand the train set and increase data diversity without introducing additional data. We conduct extensive experiments with CLIC, comparing it with both unsupervised and supervised methods. The results demonstrate that the performance of CLIC is comparable to that of state-of-the-art supervised methods. In addition, we establish the pipelines that can apply CLIC to computer vision tasks to effectively improve their performance.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the challenge of perceiving complete object shapes through visual perception. While prior studies have demonstrated encouraging outcomes in segmenting the visible parts of objects within a scene, amodal segmentation, in particular, has the potential to allow robots to infer the occluded parts of objects. To this end, this paper introduces a new framework that explores amodal segmentation for robotic grasping in cluttered scenes, thus greatly enhancing robotic grasping abilities. Initially, we use a conventional segmentation algorithm to detect the visible segments of the target object, which provides shape priors for completing the full object mask. Particularly, to explore how to utilize semantic features from RGB images and geometric information from depth images, we propose a Linear-fusion Attention-guided Convolutional Network (LAC-Net). LAC-Net utilizes the linear-fusion strategy to effectively fuse this cross-modal data, and then uses the prior visible mask as attention map to guide the network to focus on target feature locations for further complete mask recovery. Using the amodal mask of the target object provides advantages in selecting more accurate and robust grasp points compared to relying solely on the visible segments. The results on different datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, the robot experiments validate the feasibility and robustness of this method in the real world. Our code and demonstrations are available on the project page: https://jrryzh.github.io/LAC-Net.

- **Summary**: This work investigates the problem of instance-level image retrieval re-ranking with the constraint of memory efficiency, ultimately aiming to limit memory usage to 1KB per image. Departing from the prevalent focus on performance enhancements, this work prioritizes the crucial trade-off between performance and memory requirements. The proposed model uses a transformer-based architecture designed to estimate image-to-image similarity by capturing interactions within and across images based on their local descriptors. A distinctive property of the model is the capability for asymmetric similarity estimation. Database images are represented with a smaller number of descriptors compared to query images, enabling performance improvements without increasing memory consumption. To ensure adaptability across different applications, a universal model is introduced that adjusts to a varying number of local descriptors during the testing phase. Results on standard benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both hand-crafted and learned models. In particular, compared with current state-of-the-art methods that overlook their memory footprint, our approach not only attains superior performance but does so with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

- **Summary**: Lip-syncing videos with given audio is the foundation for various applications including the creation of virtual presenters or performers. While recent studies explore high-fidelity lip-sync with different techniques, their task-orientated models either require long-term videos for clip-specific training or retain visible artifacts. In this paper, we propose a unified and effective framework ReSyncer, that synchronizes generalized audio-visual facial information. The key design is revisiting and rewiring the Style-based generator to efficiently adopt 3D facial dynamics predicted by a principled style-injected Transformer. By simply re-configuring the information insertion mechanisms within the noise and style space, our framework fuses motion and appearance with unified training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReSyncer not only produces high-fidelity lip-synced videos according to audio, but also supports multiple appealing properties that are suitable for creating virtual presenters and performers, including fast personalized fine-tuning, video-driven lip-syncing, the transfer of speaking styles, and even face swapping.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation and video object segmentation are essential for diagnosing and analyzing diseases by identifying and measuring biological structures. Recent advances in natural domain have been driven by foundation models like the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2). To explore the performance of SAM 2 in biomedical applications, we designed two evaluation pipelines for single-frame image segmentation and multi-frame video segmentation with varied prompt designs, revealing SAM 2's limitations in medical contexts. Consequently, we developed BioSAM 2, an enhanced foundation model optimized for biomedical data based on SAM 2. Our experiments show that BioSAM 2 not only surpasses the performance of existing state-of-the-art foundation models but also matches or even exceeds specialist models, demonstrating its efficacy and potential in the medical domain.

- **Summary**: Vision transformers (ViTs) have garnered significant attention for their performance in vision tasks; however, the high computational cost and significant latency issues have hinder widespread adoption. Post-training quantization (PTQ), a promising method for model compression, still faces accuracy degradation challenges with ViTs. There are two reasons for this: the existing quantization paradigm does not fit the power-law distribution of post-Softmax activations well, and accuracy inevitably decreases after reparameterizing post-LayerNorm activations. We propose a Distribution-Friendly and Outlier-Aware Post-training Quantization method for Vision Transformers, named DopQ-ViT. DopQ-ViT analyzes the inefficiencies of current quantizers and introduces a distribution-friendly Tan Quantizer called TanQ. TanQ focuses more on values near 1, more accurately preserving the power-law distribution of post-Softmax activations, and achieves favorable results. Moreover, when reparameterizing post-LayerNorm activations from channel-wise to layer-wise quantization, the accuracy degradation is mainly due to the significant impact of outliers in the scaling factors. Therefore, DopQ-ViT proposes a method to Search for the Optimal Scaling Factor, denoted as SOSF, which compensates for the influence of outliers and preserves the performance of the quantization model. DopQ-ViT has undergone extensive validation and demonstrates significant performance improvements in quantization models, particularly in low-bit settings.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose TextIM, a novel framework for synthesizing TEXT-driven human Interactive Motions, with a focus on the precise alignment of part-level semantics. Existing methods often overlook the critical roles of interactive body parts and fail to adequately capture and align part-level semantics, resulting in inaccuracies and even erroneous movement outcomes. To address these issues, TextIM utilizes a decoupled conditional diffusion framework to enhance the detailed alignment between interactive movements and corresponding semantic intents from textual descriptions. Our approach leverages large language models, functioning as a human brain, to identify interacting human body parts and to comprehend interaction semantics to generate complicated and subtle interactive motion. Guided by the refined movements of the interacting parts, TextIM further extends these movements into a coherent whole-body motion. We design a spatial coherence module to complement the entire body movements while maintaining consistency and harmony across body parts using a part graph convolutional network. For training and evaluation, we carefully selected and re-labeled interactive motions from HUMANML3D to develop a specialized dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that TextIM produces semantically accurate human interactive motions, significantly enhancing the realism and applicability of synthesized interactive motions in diverse scenarios, even including interactions with deformable and dynamically changing objects.

- **Summary**: Etruscan mirrors constitute a significant category in Etruscan art, characterized by elaborate figurative illustrations featured on their backside. A laborious and costly aspect of their analysis and documentation is the task of manually tracing these illustrations. In previous work, a methodology has been proposed to automate this process, involving photometric-stereo scanning in combination with deep neural networks. While achieving quantitative performance akin to an expert annotator, some results still lack qualitative precision and, thus, require annotators for inspection and potential correction, maintaining resource intensity. In response, we propose a deep neural network trained to interactively refine existing annotations based on human guidance. Our human-in-the-loop approach streamlines annotation, achieving equal quality with up to 75% less manual input required. Moreover, during the refinement process, the relative improvement of our methodology over pure manual labeling reaches peak values of up to 26%, attaining drastically better quality quicker. By being tailored to the complex task of segmenting intricate lines, specifically distinguishing it from previous methods, our approach offers drastic improvements in efficacy, transferable to a broad spectrum of applications beyond Etruscan mirrors.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in the field of Diffusion Transformers have substantially improved the generation of high-quality 2D images, 3D videos, and 3D shapes. However, the effectiveness of the Transformer architecture in the domain of co-speech gesture generation remains relatively unexplored, as prior methodologies have predominantly employed the Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) or simple a few transformer layers. In an attempt to bridge this research gap, we introduce a novel Masked Diffusion Transformer for co-speech gesture generation, referred to as MDT-A2G, which directly implements the denoising process on gesture sequences. To enhance the contextual reasoning capability of temporally aligned speech-driven gestures, we incorporate a novel Masked Diffusion Transformer. This model employs a mask modeling scheme specifically designed to strengthen temporal relation learning among sequence gestures, thereby expediting the learning process and leading to coherent and realistic motions. Apart from audio, Our MDT-A2G model also integrates multi-modal information, encompassing text, emotion, and identity. Furthermore, we propose an efficient inference strategy that diminishes the denoising computation by leveraging previously calculated results, thereby achieving a speedup with negligible performance degradation. Experimental results demonstrate that MDT-A2G excels in gesture generation, boasting a learning speed that is over 6$\times$ faster than traditional diffusion transformers and an inference speed that is 5.7$\times$ than the standard diffusion model.

In this work, we first present a comprehensive benchmarking of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) across 11 medical image modalities and videos and point out its strengths and weaknesses by comparing it to SAM1 and MedSAM. Then, we develop a transfer learning pipeline and demonstrate SAM2 can be quickly adapted to medical domain by fine-tuning.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are capable of handling diverse data types such as imaging, text, and physiological signals, and can be applied in various fields. In the medical field, LVLMs have a high potential to offer substantial assistance for diagnosis and treatment. Before that, it is crucial to develop benchmarks to evaluate LVLMs' effectiveness in various medical applications. Current benchmarks are often built upon specific academic literature, mainly focusing on a single domain, and lacking varying perceptual granularities. Thus, they face specific challenges, including limited clinical relevance, incomplete evaluations, and insufficient guidance for interactive LVLMs. To address these limitations, we developed the GMAI-MMBench, the most comprehensive general medical AI benchmark with well-categorized data structure and multi-perceptual granularity to date. It is constructed from 285 datasets across 39 medical image modalities, 18 clinical-related tasks, 18 departments, and 4 perceptual granularities in a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format. Additionally, we implemented a lexical tree structure that allows users to customize evaluation tasks, accommodating various assessment needs and substantially supporting medical AI research and applications. We evaluated 50 LVLMs, and the results show that even the advanced GPT-4o only achieves an accuracy of 52%, indicating significant room for improvement. Moreover, we identified five key insufficiencies in current cutting-edge LVLMs that need to be addressed to advance the development of better medical applications. We believe that GMAI-MMBench will stimulate the community to build the next generation of LVLMs toward GMAI.   Project Page: https://uni-medical.github.io/GMAI-MMBench.github.io/

- **Summary**: We present LLaVA-OneVision, a family of open large multimodal models (LMMs) developed by consolidating our insights into data, models, and visual representations in the LLaVA-NeXT blog series. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLaVA-OneVision is the first single model that can simultaneously push the performance boundaries of open LMMs in three important computer vision scenarios: single-image, multi-image, and video scenarios. Importantly, the design of LLaVA-OneVision allows strong transfer learning across different modalities/scenarios, yielding new emerging capabilities. In particular, strong video understanding and cross-scenario capabilities are demonstrated through task transfer from images to videos.

- **Summary**: The gamma belief network (GBN), often regarded as a deep topic model, has demonstrated its potential for uncovering multi-layer interpretable latent representations in text data. Its notable capability to acquire interpretable latent factors is partially attributed to sparse and non-negative gamma-distributed latent variables. However, the existing GBN and its variations are constrained by the linear generative model, thereby limiting their expressiveness and applicability. To address this limitation, we introduce the generalized gamma belief network (Generalized GBN) in this paper, which extends the original linear generative model to a more expressive non-linear generative model. Since the parameters of the Generalized GBN no longer possess an analytic conditional posterior, we further propose an upward-downward Weibull inference network to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent variables. The parameters of both the generative model and the inference network are jointly trained within the variational inference framework. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on both expressivity and disentangled representation learning tasks to evaluate the performance of the Generalized GBN against state-of-the-art Gaussian variational autoencoders serving as baselines.

- **Summary**: Biomedical image segmentation plays a vital role in diagnosis of diseases across various organs. Deep learning-based object detection methods are commonly used for such segmentation. There exists an extensive research in this topic. However, there is no standard review on this topic. Existing surveys often lack a standardized approach or focus on broader segmentation techniques. In this paper, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR), collected and analysed 148 articles that explore deep learning object detection methods for biomedical image segmentation. We critically analyzed these methods, identified the key challenges, and discussed the future directions. From the selected articles we extracted the results including the deep learning models, targeted imaging modalities, targeted diseases, and the metrics for the analysis of the methods. The results have been presented in tabular and/or charted forms. The results are presented in three major categories including two stage detection models, one stage detection models and point-based detection models. Each article is individually analyzed along with its pros and cons. Finally, we discuss open challenges, potential benefits, and future research directions. This SLR aims to provide the research community with a quick yet deeper understanding of these segmentation models, ultimately facilitating the development of more powerful solutions for biomedical image analysis.

- **Summary**: We propose Set2Seq Transformer, a novel sequential multiple instance architecture, that learns to rank permutation aware set representations of sequences. First, we illustrate that learning temporal position-aware representations of discrete timesteps can greatly improve static visual multiple instance learning methods that do not regard temporality and concentrate almost exclusively on visual content analysis. We further demonstrate the significant advantages of end-to-end sequential multiple instance learning, integrating visual content and temporal information in a multimodal manner. As application we focus on fine art analysis related tasks. To that end, we show that our Set2Seq Transformer can leverage visual set and temporal position-aware representations for modelling visual artists' oeuvres for predicting artistic success. Finally, through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation using a novel dataset, WikiArt-Seq2Rank, and a visual learning-to-rank downstream task, we show that our Set2Seq Transformer captures essential temporal information improving the performance of strong static and sequential multiple instance learning methods for predicting artistic success.

- **Summary**: We are considering in this paper the task of label-efficient fine-tuning of segmentation models: We assume that a large labeled dataset is available and allows to train an accurate segmentation model in one domain, and that we have to adapt this model on a related domain where only a few samples are available. We observe that this adaptation can be done using two distinct methods: The first method, supervised pretraining, is simply to take the model trained on the first domain using classical supervised learning, and fine-tune it on the second domain with the available labeled samples. The second method is to perform self-supervised pretraining on the first domain using a generic pretext task in order to get high-quality representations which can then be used to train a model on the second domain in a label-efficient way. We propose in this paper to fuse these two approaches by introducing a new pretext task, which is to perform simultaneously image denoising and mask prediction on the first domain. We motivate this choice by showing that in the same way that an image denoiser conditioned on the noise level can be considered as a generative model for the unlabeled image distribution using the theory of diffusion models, a model trained using this new pretext task can be considered as a generative model for the joint distribution of images and segmentation masks under the assumption that the mapping from images to segmentation masks is deterministic. We then empirically show on several datasets that fine-tuning a model pretrained using this approach leads to better results than fine-tuning a similar model trained using either supervised or unsupervised pretraining only.

- **Summary**: Iris recognition is widely used in several fields such as mobile phones, financial transactions, identification cards, airport security, international border control, voter registration for living persons. However, the possibility of identifying deceased individuals based on their iris patterns has emerged recently as a supplementary or alternative method valuable in forensic analysis. Simultaneously, it poses numerous new technological challenges and one of the most challenging among them is the image segmentation stage as conventional iris recognition approaches have struggled to reliably execute it. This paper presents and compares Deep Learning (DL) models designed for segmenting iris images collected from the deceased subjects, by training SegNet and DeepLabV3+ semantic segmentation methods where using VGG19, ResNet18, ResNet50, MobileNetv2, Xception, or InceptionResNetv2 as backbones. In this study, our experiments demonstrate that our proposed method effectively learns and identifies specific deformations inherent in post-mortem samples and providing a significant improvement in accuracy. By employing our novel method MobileNetv2 as the backbone of DeepLabV3+ and replacing the final layer with a hybrid loss function combining Boundary and Dice loss, we achieve Mean Intersection over Union of 95.54% on the Warsaw-BioBase-PostMortem-Iris-v1 dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the most extensive evaluation of DL models for post-mortem iris segmentation.

- **Summary**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have profoundly transformed the field of remote sensing, revolutionizing data collection, processing, and analysis. Traditionally reliant on manual interpretation and task-specific models, remote sensing has been significantly enhanced by the advent of foundation models--large-scale, pre-trained AI models capable of performing a wide array of tasks with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of foundation models in the remote sensing domain, covering models released between June 2021 and June 2024. We categorize these models based on their applications in computer vision and domain-specific tasks, offering insights into their architectures, pre-training datasets, and methodologies. Through detailed performance comparisons, we highlight emerging trends and the significant advancements achieved by these foundation models. Additionally, we discuss the technical challenges, practical implications, and future research directions, addressing the need for high-quality data, computational resources, and improved model generalization. Our research also finds that pre-training methods, particularly self-supervised learning techniques like contrastive learning and masked autoencoders, significantly enhance the performance and robustness of foundation models in remote sensing tasks such as scene classification, object detection, and other applications. This survey aims to serve as a resource for researchers and practitioners by providing a panorama of advances and promising pathways for continued development and application of foundation models in remote sensing.
