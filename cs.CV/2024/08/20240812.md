- **Summary**: In the field of medical images, although various works find Swin Transformer has promising effectiveness on pixelwise dense prediction, whether pre-training these models without using extra dataset can further boost the performance for the downstream semantic segmentation remains unexplored.Applications of previous representation learning methods are hindered by the limited number of 3D volumes and high computational cost. In addition, most of pretext tasks designed specifically for Transformer are not applicable to hierarchical structure of Swin Transformer. Thus, this work proposes a token-level representation learning loss that maximizes agreement between token embeddings from different augmented views individually instead of volume-level global features. Moreover, we identify a potential representation collapse exclusively caused by this new loss. To prevent collapse, we invent a simple "rotate-and-restore" mechanism, which rotates and flips one augmented view of input volume, and later restores the order of tokens in the feature maps. We also modify the contrastive loss to address the discrimination between tokens at the same position but from different volumes. We test our pre-training scheme on two public medical segmentation datasets, and the results on the downstream segmentation task show more improvement of our methods than other state-of-the-art pre-trainig methods.

- **Summary**: Rapidly acquiring three-dimensional (3D) building data, including geometric attributes like rooftop, height, and structure, as well as indicative attributes like function, quality, and age, is essential for accurate urban analysis, simulations, and policy updates. Existing large-scale building datasets lack accuracy, extensibility and indicative attributes. This paper presents a geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) framework for large-scale building modeling, introducing the first Multi-Attribute Building dataset (CMAB) in China at a national scale. The dataset covers 3,667 natural cities with a total rooftop area of 21.3 billion square meters with an F1-Score of 89.93% in rooftop extraction through the OCRNet. We trained bootstrap aggregated XGBoost models with city administrative classifications, incorporating building features such as morphology, location, and function. Using multi-source data, including billions of high-resolution Google Earth imagery and 60 million street view images (SVI), we generated rooftop, height, function, age, and quality attributes for each building. Accuracy was validated through model benchmarks, existing similar products, and manual SVI validation. The results support urban planning and sustainable development.

- **Summary**: Polyp segmentation plays a crucial role in the early detection and diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However, obtaining accurate segmentations often requires labor-intensive annotations and specialized models. Recently, Meta AI Research released a general Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), which has demonstrated promising performance in several segmentation tasks. In this work, we evaluate the performance of SAM 2 in segmenting polyps under various prompted settings. We hope this report will provide insights to advance the field of polyp segmentation and promote more interesting work in the future.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) building upon the foundation of powerful large language models have made rapid progress in reasoning across visual and textual data. While VLMs perform well on vision tasks that they are trained on, our results highlight key challenges in abstract pattern recognition. We present GlyphPattern, a 954 item dataset that pairs 318 human-written descriptions of visual patterns from 40 writing systems with three visual presentation styles.   GlyphPattern evaluates abstract pattern recognition in VLMs, requiring models to understand and judge natural language descriptions of visual patterns. GlyphPattern patterns are drawn from a large-scale cognitive science investigation of human writing systems; as a result, they are rich in spatial reference and compositionality. Our experiments show that GlyphPattern is challenging for state-of-the-art VLMs (GPT-4o achieves only 55% accuracy), with marginal gains from few-shot prompting. Our detailed error analysis reveals challenges at multiple levels, including visual processing, natural language understanding, and pattern generalization.

- **Summary**: Adversarial purification is one of the promising approaches to defend neural networks against adversarial attacks. Recently, methods utilizing diffusion probabilistic models have achieved great success for adversarial purification in image classification tasks. However, such methods fall into the dilemma of balancing the needs for noise removal and information preservation. This paper points out that existing adversarial purification methods based on diffusion models gradually lose sample information during the core denoising process, causing occasional label shift in subsequent classification tasks. As a remedy, we suggest to suppress such information loss by introducing guidance from the classifier confidence. Specifically, we propose Classifier-cOnfidence gUided Purification (COUP) algorithm, which purifies adversarial examples while keeping away from the classifier decision boundary. Experimental results show that COUP can achieve better adversarial robustness under strong attack methods.

- **Summary**: Foundation models, such as CNNs and ViTs, have powered the development of image modeling. However, general guidance to model architecture design is still missing. The design of many modern model architectures, such as residual structures, multiplicative gating signal, and feed-forward networks, can be interpreted in terms of the heat conduction equation. This finding inspired us to model images by the heat conduction equation, where the essential idea is to conceptualize image features as temperatures and model their information interaction as the diffusion of thermal energy. We can take advantage of the rich knowledge in the heat conduction equation to guide us in designing new and more interpretable models. As an example, we propose Heat Conduction Layer and Refine Approximation Layer inspired by solving the heat conduction equation using Finite Difference Method and Fourier series, respectively. This paper does not aim to present a state-of-the-art model; instead, it seeks to integrate the overall architectural design of the model into the heat conduction theory framework. Nevertheless, our Heat Conduction Network (HcNet) still shows competitive performance. Code available at \url{https://github.com/ZheminZhang1/HcNet}.

- **Summary**: Current weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) task aims to achieve frame-level anomalous event detection with only coarse video-level annotations available. Existing works typically involve extracting global features from full-resolution video frames and training frame-level classifiers to detect anomalies in the temporal dimension. However, most anomalous events tend to occur in localized spatial regions rather than the entire video frames, which implies existing frame-level feature based works may be misled by the dominant background information and lack the interpretation of the detected anomalies. To address this dilemma, this paper introduces a novel method called STPrompt that learns spatio-temporal prompt embeddings for weakly supervised video anomaly detection and localization (WSVADL) based on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). Our proposed method employs a two-stream network structure, with one stream focusing on the temporal dimension and the other primarily on the spatial dimension. By leveraging the learned knowledge from pre-trained VLMs and incorporating natural motion priors from raw videos, our model learns prompt embeddings that are aligned with spatio-temporal regions of videos (e.g., patches of individual frames) for identify specific local regions of anomalies, enabling accurate video anomaly detection while mitigating the influence of background information. Without relying on detailed spatio-temporal annotations or auxiliary object detection/tracking, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks for the WSVADL task.

- **Summary**: Colonoscopic Polyp Re-Identification aims to match the same polyp from a large gallery with images from different views taken using different cameras and plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer in computer-aided diagnosis. However, traditional methods for object ReID directly adopting CNN models trained on the ImageNet dataset usually produce unsatisfactory retrieval performance on colonoscopic datasets due to the large domain gap. Worsely, these solutions typically learn unimodal modal representations on the basis of visual samples, which fails to explore complementary information from different modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Deep Multimodal Collaborative Learning framework named DMCL for polyp re-identification, which can effectively encourage modality collaboration and reinforce generalization capability in medical scenarios. On the basis of it, a dynamic multimodal feature fusion strategy is introduced to leverage the optimized multimodal representations for multimodal fusion via end-to-end training. Experiments on the standard benchmarks show the benefits of the multimodal setting over state-of-the-art unimodal ReID models, especially when combined with the specialized multimodal fusion strategy.

- **Summary**: Within the domain of person re-identification (ReID), partial ReID methods are considered mainstream, aiming to measure feature distances through comparisons of body parts between samples. However, in practice, previous methods often lack sufficient awareness of anatomical aspect of body parts, resulting in the failure to capture features of the same body parts across different samples. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{Part Aware Transformer (PAFormer)}, a pose estimation based ReID model which can perform precise part-to-part comparison. In order to inject part awareness to pose tokens, we introduce learnable parameters called `pose token' which estimate the correlation between each body part and partial regions of the image. Notably, at inference phase, PAFormer operates without additional modules related to body part localization, which is commonly used in previous ReID methodologies leveraging pose estimation models. Additionally, leveraging the enhanced awareness of body parts, PAFormer suggests the use of a learning-based visibility predictor to estimate the degree of occlusion for each body part. Also, we introduce a teacher forcing technique using ground truth visibility scores which enables PAFormer to be trained only with visible parts. A set of extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches on well-known ReID benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Image denoising is an appealing and challenging task, in that noise statistics of real-world observations may vary with local image contents and different image channels. Specifically, the green channel usually has twice the sampling rate in raw data. To handle noise variances and leverage such channel-wise prior information, we propose a simple and effective green channel prior-based image denoising (GCP-ID) method, which integrates GCP into the classic patch-based denoising framework. Briefly, we exploit the green channel to guide the search for similar patches, which aims to improve the patch grouping quality and encourage sparsity in the transform domain. The grouped image patches are then reformulated into RGGB arrays to explicitly characterize the density of green samples. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptivity of GCP-ID to various image contents, we cast the noise estimation problem into a classification task and train an effective estimator based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed GCP-ID method for image and video denoising applications in both raw and sRGB spaces.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in generation problems over various domains including images, videos, text, and audio. A practical bottleneck of diffusion models is their sampling speed, due to the repeated evaluation of score estimation networks during the inference. In this work, we propose a novel framework capable of adaptively allocating compute required for the score estimation, thereby reducing the overall sampling time of diffusion models. We observe that the amount of computation required for the score estimation may vary along the time step for which the score is estimated. Based on this observation, we propose an early-exiting scheme, where we skip the subset of parameters in the score estimation network during the inference, based on a time-dependent exit schedule. Using the diffusion models for image synthesis, we show that our method could significantly improve the sampling throughput of the diffusion models without compromising image quality. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that our method seamlessly integrates with various types of solvers for faster sampling, capitalizing on their compatibility to enhance overall efficiency.

- **Summary**: Foundational vision models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have achieved significant breakthroughs through extensive pre-training on large-scale visual datasets. Despite their general success, these models may fall short in specialized tasks with limited data, and fine-tuning such large-scale models is often not feasible. Current strategies involve incorporating adaptors into the pre-trained SAM to facilitate downstream task performance with minimal model adjustment. However, these strategies can be hampered by suboptimal learning approaches for the adaptors. In this paper, we introduce a novel Multi-scale Contrastive Adaptor learning method named MCA-SAM, which enhances adaptor performance through a meticulously designed contrastive learning framework at both token and sample levels. Our Token-level Contrastive adaptor (TC-adaptor) focuses on refining local representations by improving the discriminability of patch tokens, while the Sample-level Contrastive adaptor (SC-adaptor) amplifies global understanding across different samples. Together, these adaptors synergistically enhance feature comparison within and across samples, bolstering the model's representational strength and its ability to adapt to new tasks. Empirical results demonstrate that MCA-SAM sets new benchmarks, outperforming existing methods in three challenging domains: camouflage object detection, shadow segmentation, and polyp segmentation. Specifically, MCA-SAM exhibits substantial relative performance enhancements, achieving a 20.0% improvement in MAE on the COD10K dataset, a 6.0% improvement in MAE on the CAMO dataset, a 15.4% improvement in BER on the ISTD dataset, and a 7.9% improvement in mDice on the Kvasir-SEG dataset.

- **Summary**: To address the data scarcity associated with 3D assets, 2D-lifting techniques such as Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) have become a widely adopted practice in text-to-3D generation pipelines. However, the diffusion models used in these techniques are prone to viewpoint bias and thus lead to geometric inconsistencies such as the Janus problem. To counter this, we introduce MT3D, a text-to-3D generative model that leverages a high-fidelity 3D object to overcome viewpoint bias and explicitly infuse geometric understanding into the generation pipeline. Firstly, we employ depth maps derived from a high-quality 3D model as control signals to guarantee that the generated 2D images preserve the fundamental shape and structure, thereby reducing the inherent viewpoint bias. Next, we utilize deep geometric moments to ensure geometric consistency in the 3D representation explicitly. By incorporating geometric details from a 3D asset, MT3D enables the creation of diverse and geometrically consistent objects, thereby improving the quality and usability of our 3D representations.

- **Summary**: This paper presents UniPortrait, an innovative human image personalization framework that unifies single- and multi-ID customization with high face fidelity, extensive facial editability, free-form input description, and diverse layout generation. UniPortrait consists of only two plug-and-play modules: an ID embedding module and an ID routing module. The ID embedding module extracts versatile editable facial features with a decoupling strategy for each ID and embeds them into the context space of diffusion models. The ID routing module then combines and distributes these embeddings adaptively to their respective regions within the synthesized image, achieving the customization of single and multiple IDs. With a carefully designed two-stage training scheme, UniPortrait achieves superior performance in both single- and multi-ID customization. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the advantages of our method over existing approaches as well as its good scalability, e.g., the universal compatibility with existing generative control tools.

- **Summary**: Person detection and tracking (PDT) has seen significant advancements with 2D camera-based systems in the autonomous vehicle field, leading to widespread adoption of these algorithms. However, growing privacy concerns have recently emerged as a major issue, prompting a shift towards LiDAR-based PDT as a viable alternative. Within this domain, "Tracking-by-Detection" (TBD) has become a prominent methodology. Despite its effectiveness, LiDAR-based PDT has not yet achieved the same level of performance as camera-based PDT. This paper examines key components of the LiDAR-based PDT framework, including detection post-processing, data association, motion modeling, and lifecycle management. Building upon these insights, we introduce SpbTrack, a robust person tracker designed for diverse environments. Our method achieves superior performance on noisy datasets and state-of-the-art results on KITTI Dataset benchmarks and custom office indoor dataset among LiDAR-based trackers.

- **Summary**: The rise of autonomous vehicles has significantly increased the demand for robust 3D object detection systems. While cameras and LiDAR sensors each offer unique advantages--cameras provide rich texture information and LiDAR offers precise 3D spatial data--relying on a single modality often leads to performance limitations. This paper introduces MV2DFusion, a multi-modal detection framework that integrates the strengths of both worlds through an advanced query-based fusion mechanism. By introducing an image query generator to align with image-specific attributes and a point cloud query generator, MV2DFusion effectively combines modality-specific object semantics without biasing toward one single modality. Then the sparse fusion process can be accomplished based on the valuable object semantics, ensuring efficient and accurate object detection across various scenarios. Our framework's flexibility allows it to integrate with any image and point cloud-based detectors, showcasing its adaptability and potential for future advancements. Extensive evaluations on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that MV2DFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in long-range detection scenarios.

- **Summary**: The groundbreaking performance of transformers in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks has led to their replacement of traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), owing to the efficiency and accuracy achieved through the self-attention mechanism. This success has inspired researchers to explore the use of transformers in computer vision tasks to attain enhanced long-term semantic awareness. Vision transformers (ViTs) have excelled in various computer vision tasks due to their superior ability to capture long-distance dependencies using the self-attention mechanism. Contemporary ViTs like Data Efficient Transformers (DeiT) can effectively learn both global semantic information and local texture information from images, achieving performance comparable to traditional CNNs. However, their impressive performance comes with a high computational cost due to very large number of parameters, hindering their deployment on devices with limited resources like smartphones, cameras, drones etc. Additionally, ViTs require a large amount of data for training to achieve performance comparable to benchmark CNN models. Therefore, we identified two key challenges in deploying ViTs on smaller form factor devices: the high computational requirements of large models and the need for extensive training data. As a solution to these challenges, we propose compressing large ViT models using Knowledge Distillation (KD), which is implemented data-free to circumvent limitations related to data availability. Additionally, we conducted experiments on object detection within the same environment in addition to classification tasks. Based on our analysis, we found that datafree knowledge distillation is an effective method to overcome both issues, enabling the deployment of ViTs on less resourceconstrained devices.

- **Summary**: Few-shot image classification aims to classify novel classes with few labeled samples. Recent research indicates that deep local descriptors have better representational capabilities. These studies recognize the impact of background noise on classification performance. They typically filter query descriptors using all local descriptors in the support classes or engage in bidirectional selection between local descriptors in support and query sets. However, they ignore the fact that background features may be useful for the classification performance of specific tasks. This paper proposes a novel task-aware contrastive local descriptor selection network (TCDSNet). First, we calculate the contrastive discriminative score for each local descriptor in the support class, and select discriminative local descriptors to form a support descriptor subset. Finally, we leverage support descriptor subsets to adaptively select discriminative query descriptors for specific tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both general and fine-grained datasets.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised temporal action localization (WTAL) aims to detect action instances in untrimmed videos using only video-level annotations. Since many existing works optimize WTAL models based on action classification labels, they encounter the task discrepancy problem (i.e., localization-by-classification). To tackle this issue, recent studies have attempted to utilize action category names as auxiliary semantic knowledge through vision-language pre-training (VLP). However, there are still areas where existing research falls short. Previous approaches primarily focused on leveraging textual information from language models but overlooked the alignment of dynamic human action and VLP knowledge in a joint space. Furthermore, the deterministic representation employed in previous studies struggles to capture fine-grained human motions. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework that aligns human action knowledge and VLP knowledge in a probabilistic embedding space. Moreover, we propose intra- and inter-distribution contrastive learning to enhance the probabilistic embedding space based on statistical similarities. Extensive experiments and ablation studies reveal that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/sejong-rcv/PVLR.

- **Summary**: Currently, most crowd counting methods have outstanding performance under normal weather conditions. However, they often struggle to maintain their performance in extreme and adverse weather conditions due to significant differences in the domain and a lack of adverse weather images for training. To address this issue and enhance the model's robustness in adverse weather, we propose a two-stage crowd counting method. Specifically, in the first stage, we introduce a multi-queue MoCo contrastive learning strategy to tackle the problem of weather class imbalance. This strategy facilitates the learning of weather-aware representations by the model. In the second stage, we propose to refine the representations under the guidance of contrastive learning, enabling the conversion of the weather-aware representations to the normal weather domain. While significantly improving the robustness, our method only marginally increases the weight of the model. In addition, we also create a new synthetic adverse weather dataset. Extensive experimental results show that our method achieves competitive performance.

- **Summary**: In high-risk railway construction, personal protective equipment monitoring is critical but challenging due to small and frequently obstructed targets. We propose YOLO-EA, an innovative model that enhances safety measure detection by integrating ECA into its backbone's convolutional layers, improving discernment of minuscule objects like hardhats. YOLO-EA further refines target recognition under occlusion by replacing GIoU with EIoU loss. YOLO-EA's effectiveness was empirically substantiated using a dataset derived from real-world railway construction site surveillance footage. It outperforms YOLOv5, achieving 98.9% precision and 94.7% recall, up 2.5% and 0.5% respectively, while maintaining real-time performance at 70.774 fps. This highly efficient and precise YOLO-EA holds great promise for practical application in intricate construction scenarios, enforcing stringent safety compliance during complex railway construction projects.

- **Summary**: Drawing freehand sketches of mechanical components on multimedia devices for AI-based engineering modeling has become a new trend. However, its development is being impeded because existing works cannot produce suitable sketches for data-driven research. These works either generate sketches lacking a freehand style or utilize generative models not originally designed for this task resulting in poor effectiveness. To address this issue, we design a two-stage generative framework mimicking the human sketching behavior pattern, called MSFormer, which is the first time to produce humanoid freehand sketches tailored for mechanical components. The first stage employs Open CASCADE technology to obtain multi-view contour sketches from mechanical components, filtering perturbing signals for the ensuing generation process. Meanwhile, we design a view selector to simulate viewpoint selection tasks during human sketching for picking out information-rich sketches. The second stage translates contour sketches into freehand sketches by a transformer-based generator. To retain essential modeling features as much as possible and rationalize stroke distribution, we introduce a novel edge-constraint stroke initialization. Furthermore, we utilize a CLIP vision encoder and a new loss function incorporating the Hausdorff distance to enhance the generalizability and robustness of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for generating freehand sketches in the mechanical domain. Project page: https://mcfreeskegen.github.io .

- **Summary**: Zero-shot human-object interaction (HOI) detector is capable of generalizing to HOI categories even not encountered during training. Inspired by the impressive zero-shot capabilities offered by CLIP, latest methods strive to leverage CLIP embeddings for improving zero-shot HOI detection. However, these embedding-based methods train the classifier on seen classes only, inevitably resulting in seen-unseen confusion for the model during inference. Besides, we find that using prompt-tuning and adapters further increases the gap between seen and unseen accuracy. To tackle this challenge, we present the first generation-based model using CLIP for zero-shot HOI detection, coined HOIGen. It allows to unlock the potential of CLIP for feature generation instead of feature extraction only. To achieve it, we develop a CLIP-injected feature generator in accordance with the generation of human, object and union features. Then, we extract realistic features of seen samples and mix them with synthetic features together, allowing the model to train seen and unseen classes jointly. To enrich the HOI scores, we construct a generative prototype bank in a pairwise HOI recognition branch, and a multi-knowledge prototype bank in an image-wise HOI recognition branch, respectively. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate our HOIGen achieves superior performance for both seen and unseen classes under various zero-shot settings, compared with other top-performing methods.

- **Summary**: The scarcity and complexity of voxel-level annotations in 3D medical imaging present significant challenges, particularly due to the domain gap between labeled datasets from well-resourced centers and unlabeled datasets from less-resourced centers. This disparity affects the fairness of artificial intelligence algorithms in healthcare. We introduce Diffuse-UDA, a novel method leveraging diffusion models to tackle Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) in medical image segmentation. Diffuse-UDA generates high-quality image-mask pairs with target domain characteristics and various structures, thereby enhancing UDA tasks. Initially, pseudo labels for target domain samples are generated. Subsequently, a specially tailored diffusion model, incorporating deformable augmentations, is trained on image-label or image-pseudo-label pairs from both domains. Finally, source domain labels guide the diffusion model to generate image-label pairs for the target domain. Comprehensive evaluations on several benchmarks demonstrate that Diffuse-UDA outperforms leading UDA and semi-supervised strategies, achieving performance close to or even surpassing the theoretical upper bound of models trained directly on target domain data. Diffuse-UDA offers a pathway to advance the development and deployment of AI systems in medical imaging, addressing disparities between healthcare environments. This approach enables the exploration of innovative AI-driven diagnostic tools, improves outcomes, saves time, and reduces human error.

- **Summary**: With the development of generative technologies in deep learning, a large number of image-to-image translation and style transfer models have emerged at an explosive rate in recent years. These two technologies have made significant progress and can generate realistic images. However, many communities tend to confuse the two, because both generate the desired image based on the input image and both cover the two definitions of content and style. In fact, there are indeed significant differences between the two, and there is currently a lack of clear explanations to distinguish the two technologies, which is not conducive to the advancement of technology. We hope to serve the entire community by introducing the differences and connections between image-to-image translation and style transfer. The entire discussion process involves the concepts, forms, training modes, evaluation processes, and visualization results of the two technologies. Finally, we conclude that image-to-image translation divides images by domain, and the types of images in the domain are limited, and the scope involved is small, but the conversion ability is strong and can achieve strong semantic changes. Style transfer divides image types by single image, and the scope involved is large, but the transfer ability is limited, and it transfers more texture and color of the image.

- **Summary**: Speech-driven 3D facial animation has garnered lots of attention thanks to its broad range of applications. Despite recent advancements in achieving realistic lip motion, current methods fail to capture the nuanced emotional undertones conveyed through speech and produce monotonous facial motion. These limitations result in blunt and repetitive facial animations, reducing user engagement and hindering their applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce DEEPTalk, a novel approach that generates diverse and emotionally rich 3D facial expressions directly from speech inputs. To achieve this, we first train DEE (Dynamic Emotion Embedding), which employs probabilistic contrastive learning to forge a joint emotion embedding space for both speech and facial motion. This probabilistic framework captures the uncertainty in interpreting emotions from speech and facial motion, enabling the derivation of emotion vectors from its multifaceted space. Moreover, to generate dynamic facial motion, we design TH-VQVAE (Temporally Hierarchical VQ-VAE) as an expressive and robust motion prior overcoming limitations of VAEs and VQ-VAEs. Utilizing these strong priors, we develop DEEPTalk, A talking head generator that non-autoregressively predicts codebook indices to create dynamic facial motion, incorporating a novel emotion consistency loss. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in creating diverse, emotionally expressive talking faces that maintain accurate lip-sync. Source code will be made publicly available soon.

- **Summary**: The success of modern Deep Neural Network (DNN) approaches can be attributed to the use of complex optimization criteria beyond standard losses such as mean absolute error (MAE) or mean squared error (MSE). In this work, we propose a novel method of utilising a no-reference sharpness metric Q introduced by Zhu and Milanfar for removing out-of-focus blur from images. We also introduce a novel dataset of real-world out-of-focus images for assessing restoration models. Our fine-tuned method produces images with a 7.5 % increase in perceptual quality (LPIPS) as compared to a standard model trained only on MAE. Furthermore, we observe a 6.7 % increase in Q (reflecting sharper restorations) and 7.25 % increase in PSNR over most state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

- **Summary**: The increasing adoption of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to their application in many challenging scientific visualization tasks. While advanced DNNs offer impressive generalization capabilities, understanding factors such as model prediction quality, robustness, and uncertainty is crucial. These insights can enable domain scientists to make informed decisions about their data. However, DNNs inherently lack ability to estimate prediction uncertainty, necessitating new research to construct robust uncertainty-aware visualization techniques tailored for various visualization tasks. In this work, we propose uncertainty-aware implicit neural representations to model scalar field data sets effectively and comprehensively study the efficacy and benefits of estimated uncertainty information for volume visualization tasks. We evaluate the effectiveness of two principled deep uncertainty estimation techniques: (1) Deep Ensemble and (2) Monte Carlo Dropout (MCDropout). These techniques enable uncertainty-informed volume visualization in scalar field data sets. Our extensive exploration across multiple data sets demonstrates that uncertainty-aware models produce informative volume visualization results. Moreover, integrating prediction uncertainty enhances the trustworthiness of our DNN model, making it suitable for robustly analyzing and visualizing real-world scientific volumetric data sets.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a novel 3D head avatar creation approach capable of generalizing from few-shot in-the-wild data with high-fidelity and animatable robustness. Given the underconstrained nature of this problem, incorporating prior knowledge is essential. Therefore, we propose a framework comprising prior learning and avatar creation phases. The prior learning phase leverages 3D head priors derived from a large-scale multi-view dynamic dataset, and the avatar creation phase applies these priors for few-shot personalization. Our approach effectively captures these priors by utilizing a Gaussian Splatting-based auto-decoder network with part-based dynamic modeling. Our method employs identity-shared encoding with personalized latent codes for individual identities to learn the attributes of Gaussian primitives. During the avatar creation phase, we achieve fast head avatar personalization by leveraging inversion and fine-tuning strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model effectively exploits head priors and successfully generalizes them to few-shot personalization, achieving photo-realistic rendering quality, multi-view consistency, and stable animation.

- **Summary**: Interactive segmentation algorithms based on click points have garnered significant attention from researchers in recent years. However, existing studies typically use sparse click maps as model inputs to segment specific target objects, which primarily affect local regions and have limited abilities to focus on the whole target object, leading to increased times of clicks. In addition, most existing algorithms can not balance well between high performance and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a click attention algorithm that expands the influence range of positive clicks based on the similarity between positively-clicked regions and the whole input. We also propose a discriminative affinity loss to reduce the attention coupling between positive and negative click regions to avoid an accuracy decrease caused by mutual interference between positive and negative clicks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is superior to existing methods and achieves cutting-edge performance in fewer parameters. An interactive demo and all reproducible codes will be released at https://github.com/hahamyt/ClickAttention.

- **Summary**: Deep neural network models have a complex architecture and are overparameterized. The number of parameters is more than the whole dataset, which is highly resource-consuming. This complicates their application and limits its usage on different devices. Reduction in the number of network parameters helps to reduce the size of the model, but at the same time, thoughtlessly applied, can lead to a deterioration in the quality of the network. One way to reduce the number of model parameters is matrix decomposition, where a matrix is represented as a product of smaller matrices. In this paper, we propose a new way of applying the matrix decomposition with respect to the weights of convolutional layers. The essence of the method is to train not all convolutions, but only the subset of convolutions (basis convolutions), and represent the rest as linear combinations of the basis ones. Experiments on models from the ResNet family and the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that basis convolutions can not only reduce the size of the model but also accelerate the forward and backward passes of the network. Another contribution of this work is that we propose a fast method for selecting a subset of network layers in which the use of matrix decomposition does not degrade the quality of the final model.

- **Summary**: In the rapidly evolving fields of natural language processing and computer vision, Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) stands as a critical, yet challenging task. The quest for models that can seamlessly integrate and interpret multimodal data is more pressing than ever. Imagine a system that can understand language with the depth and nuance of human cognition, while simultaneously interpreting the rich visual context of the world around it.   We present ARPA, an architecture that fuses the unparalleled contextual understanding of large language models with the advanced feature extraction capabilities of transformers, which then pass through a custom Graph Neural Network (GNN) layer to learn intricate relationships and subtle nuances within the data. This innovative architecture not only sets a new benchmark in visual word disambiguation but also introduces a versatile framework poised to transform how linguistic and visual data interact by harnessing the synergistic strengths of its components, ensuring robust performance even in the most complex disambiguation scenarios. Through a series of experiments and comparative analysis, we reveal the substantial advantages of our model, underscoring its potential to redefine standards in the field. Beyond its architectural prowess, our architecture excels through experimental enrichments, including sophisticated data augmentation and multi-modal training techniques.   ARPA's introduction marks a significant milestone in visual word disambiguation, offering a compelling solution that bridges the gap between linguistic and visual modalities. We invite researchers and practitioners to explore the capabilities of our model, envisioning a future where such hybrid models drive unprecedented advancements in artificial intelligence.

- **Summary**: Image-based virtual try-on is an increasingly popular and important task to generate realistic try-on images of specific person. Existing methods always employ an accurate mask to remove the original garment in the source image, thus achieving realistic synthesized images in simple and conventional try-on scenarios based on powerful diffusion model. Therefore, acquiring suitable mask is vital to the try-on performance of these methods. However, obtaining precise inpainting masks, especially for complex wild try-on data containing diverse foreground occlusions and person poses, is not easy as Figure 1-Top shows. This difficulty often results in poor performance in more practical and challenging real-life scenarios, such as the selfie scene shown in Figure 1-Bottom. To this end, we propose a novel training paradigm combined with an efficient data augmentation method to acquire large-scale unpaired training data from wild scenarios, thereby significantly facilitating the try-on performance of our model without the need for additional inpainting masks. Besides, a try-on localization loss is designed to localize a more accurate try-on area to obtain more reasonable try-on results. It is noted that our method only needs the reference cloth image, source pose image and source person image as input, which is more cost-effective and user-friendly compared to existing methods. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments have demonstrated superior performance in wild scenarios with such a low-demand input.

- **Summary**: We express parallel transport for several common matrix Lie groups with a family of pseudo-Riemannian metrics in terms of matrix exponential and exponential actions. The expression for parallel transport is preserved by taking the quotient under certain scenarios. In particular, for a Stiefel manifold of orthogonal matrices of size $n\times d$, we give an expression for parallel transport along a geodesic from time zero to $t$, that could be computed with time complexity of $O(nd^2)$ for small $t$, and of $O(td^3)$ for large t, contributing a step in a long-standing open problem in matrix manifolds. A similar result holds for flag manifolds with the canonical metric. We also show the parallel transport formulas for the generalized linear group, and the special orthogonal group under these metrics.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable and robust abilities in both image and video generation. To achieve greater control over generated results, researchers introduce additional architectures, such as ControlNet, Adapters and ReferenceNet, to integrate conditioning controls. However, current controllable generation methods often require substantial additional computational resources, especially for video generation, and face challenges in training or exhibit weak control. In this paper, we propose ControlNeXt: a powerful and efficient method for controllable image and video generation. We first design a more straightforward and efficient architecture, replacing heavy additional branches with minimal additional cost compared to the base model. Such a concise structure also allows our method to seamlessly integrate with other LoRA weights, enabling style alteration without the need for additional training. As for training, we reduce up to 90% of learnable parameters compared to the alternatives. Furthermore, we propose another method called Cross Normalization (CN) as a replacement for Zero-Convolution' to achieve fast and stable training convergence. We have conducted various experiments with different base models across images and videos, demonstrating the robustness of our method.

To overcome these difficulties, ML engineers mainly rely on comprehensive real-world datasets. However, the difficulties in real-world data collection for critical areas of the operational design domain (ODD) often means synthetic data is required for perception training and safety validation. Thus, we present A-BDD, a large set of over 60,000 synthetically augmented images based on BDD100K that are equipped with semantic segmentation and bounding box annotations (inherited from the BDD100K dataset). The dataset contains augmented data for rain, fog, overcast and sunglare/shadow with varying intensity levels. We further introduce novel strategies utilizing feature-based image quality metrics like FID and CMMD, which help identify useful augmented and real-world data for ML training and testing. By conducting experiments on A-BDD, we provide evidence that data augmentations can play a pivotal role in closing performance gaps in adverse weather and lighting conditions.

- **Summary**: We introduce CogVideoX, a large-scale diffusion transformer model designed for generating videos based on text prompts. To efficently model video data, we propose to levearge a 3D Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress videos along both spatial and temporal dimensions. To improve the text-video alignment, we propose an expert transformer with the expert adaptive LayerNorm to facilitate the deep fusion between the two modalities. By employing a progressive training technique, CogVideoX is adept at producing coherent, long-duration videos characterized by significant motions. In addition, we develop an effective text-video data processing pipeline that includes various data preprocessing strategies and a video captioning method. It significantly helps enhance the performance of CogVideoX, improving both generation quality and semantic alignment. Results show that CogVideoX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both multiple machine metrics and human evaluations. The model weights of both the 3D Causal VAE and CogVideoX are publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/CogVideo.

- **Summary**: Reference metrics have been developed to objectively and quantitatively compare two images. Especially for evaluating the quality of reconstructed or compressed images, these metrics have shown very useful. Extensive tests of such metrics on benchmarks of artificially distorted natural images have revealed which metric best correlate with human perception of quality. Direct transfer of these metrics to the evaluation of generative models in medical imaging, however, can easily lead to pitfalls, because assumptions about image content, image data format and image interpretation are often very different. Also, the correlation of reference metrics and human perception of quality can vary strongly for different kinds of distortions and commonly used metrics, such as SSIM, PSNR and MAE are not the best choice for all situations. We selected five pitfalls that showcase unexpected and probably undesired reference metric scores and discuss strategies to avoid them.

- **Summary**: Despite the significant advances that deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved in various visual tasks, they still exhibit vulnerability to adversarial examples, leading to serious security concerns. Recent adversarial training techniques have utilized inverse adversarial attacks to generate high-confidence examples, aiming to align the distributions of adversarial examples with the high-confidence regions of their corresponding classes. However, in this paper, our investigation reveals that high-confidence outputs under inverse adversarial attacks are correlated with biased feature activation. Specifically, training with inverse adversarial examples causes the model's attention to shift towards background features, introducing a spurious correlation bias. To address this bias, we propose Debiased High-Confidence Adversarial Training (DHAT), a novel approach that not only aligns the logits of adversarial examples with debiased high-confidence logits obtained from inverse adversarial examples, but also restores the model's attention to its normal state by enhancing foreground logit orthogonality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DHAT achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits robust generalization capabilities across various vision datasets. Additionally, DHAT can seamlessly integrate with existing advanced adversarial training techniques for improving the performance.

- **Summary**: In the field of monocular depth estimation (MDE), many models with excellent zero-shot performance in general scenes emerge recently. However, these methods often fail in predicting non-Lambertian surfaces, such as transparent or mirror (ToM) surfaces, due to the unique reflective properties of these regions. Previous methods utilize externally provided ToM masks and aim to obtain correct depth maps through direct in-painting of RGB images. These methods highly depend on the accuracy of additional input masks, and the use of random colors during in-painting makes them insufficiently robust. We are committed to incrementally enabling the baseline model to directly learn the uniqueness of non-Lambertian surface regions for depth estimation through a well-designed training framework. Therefore, we propose non-Lambertian surface regional guidance, which constrains the predictions of MDE model from the gradient domain to enhance its robustness. Noting the significant impact of lighting on this task, we employ the random tone-mapping augmentation during training to ensure the network can predict correct results for varying lighting inputs. Additionally, we propose an optional novel lighting fusion module, which uses Variational Autoencoders to fuse multiple images and obtain the most advantageous input RGB image for depth estimation when multi-exposure images are available. Our method achieves accuracy improvements of 33.39% and 5.21% in zero-shot testing on the Booster and Mirror3D dataset for non-Lambertian surfaces, respectively, compared to the Depth Anything V2. The state-of-the-art performance of 90.75 in delta1.05 within the ToM regions on the TRICKY2024 competition test set demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: Despite the progress on 3D point cloud deep learning, most prior works focus on learning features that are invariant to translation and point permutation, and very limited efforts have been devoted for rotation invariant property. Several recent studies achieve rotation invariance at the cost of lower accuracies. In this work, we close this gap by proposing a novel yet effective rotation invariant architecture for 3D point cloud classification and segmentation. Instead of traditional pointwise operations, we construct local triangle surfaces to capture more detailed surface structure, based on which we can extract highly expressive rotation invariant surface properties which are then integrated into an attention-augmented convolution operator named RISurConv to generate refined attention features via self-attention layers. Based on RISurConv we build an effective neural network for 3D point cloud analysis that is invariant to arbitrary rotations while maintaining high accuracy. We verify the performance on various benchmarks with supreme results obtained surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin. We achieve an overall accuracy of 96.0% (+4.7%) on ModelNet40, 93.1% (+12.8%) on ScanObjectNN, and class accuracies of 91.5% (+3.6%), 82.7% (+5.1%), and 78.5% (+9.2%) on the three categories of the FG3D dataset for the fine-grained classification task. Additionally, we achieve 81.5% (+1.0%) mIoU on ShapeNet for the segmentation task. Code is available here: https://github.com/cszyzhang/RISurConv

- **Summary**: Infrared-visible object detection aims to achieve robust object detection by leveraging the complementary information of infrared and visible image pairs. However, the commonly existing modality misalignment problem presents two challenges: fusing misalignment complementary features is difficult, and current methods cannot accurately locate objects in both modalities under misalignment conditions. In this paper, we propose a Decoupled Position Detection Transformer (DPDETR) to address these problems. Specifically, we explicitly formulate the object category, visible modality position, and infrared modality position to enable the network to learn the intrinsic relationships and output accurate positions of objects in both modalities. To fuse misaligned object features accurately, we propose a Decoupled Position Multispectral Cross-attention module that adaptively samples and aggregates multispectral complementary features with the constraint of infrared and visible reference positions. Additionally, we design a query-decoupled Multispectral Decoder structure to address the optimization gap among the three kinds of object information in our task and propose a Decoupled Position Contrastive DeNosing Training strategy to enhance the DPDETR's ability to learn decoupled positions. Experiments on DroneVehicle and KAIST datasets demonstrate significant improvements compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gjj45/DPDETR.

- **Summary**: The safe operation of automated vehicles depends on their ability to perceive the environment comprehensively. However, occlusion, sensor range, and environmental factors limit their perception capabilities. To overcome these limitations, collective perception enables vehicles to exchange information. However, fusing this exchanged information is a challenging task. Early fusion approaches require large amounts of bandwidth, while intermediate fusion approaches face interchangeability issues. Late fusion of shared detections is currently the only feasible approach. However, it often results in inferior performance due to information loss. To address this issue, we propose MR3D-Net, a dynamic multi-resolution 3D sparse voxel grid fusion backbone architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception. We show that sparse voxel grids at varying resolutions provide a meaningful and compact environment representation that can adapt to the communication bandwidth. MR3D-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OPV2V 3D object detection benchmark while reducing the required bandwidth by up to 94% compared to early fusion.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel point cloud U-Net diffusion architecture for 3D generative modeling capable of generating high-quality and diverse 3D shapes while maintaining fast generation times. Our network employs a dual-branch architecture, combining the high-resolution representations of points with the computational efficiency of sparse voxels. Our fastest variant outperforms all non-diffusion generative approaches on unconditional shape generation, the most popular benchmark for evaluating point cloud generative models, while our largest model achieves state-of-the-art results among diffusion methods, with a runtime approximately 70% of the previously state-of-the-art PVD. Beyond unconditional generation, we perform extensive evaluations, including conditional generation on all categories of ShapeNet, demonstrating the scalability of our model to larger datasets, and implicit generation which allows our network to produce high quality point clouds on fewer timesteps, further decreasing the generation time. Finally, we evaluate the architecture's performance in point cloud completion and super-resolution. Our model excels in all tasks, establishing it as a state-of-the-art diffusion U-Net for point cloud generative modeling.

- **Summary**: Neural enhancement through super-resolution deep neural networks opens up new possibilities for ultra-high-definition live streaming over existing encoding and networking infrastructure. Yet, the heavy SR DNN inference overhead leads to severe deployment challenges. To reduce the overhead, existing systems propose to apply DNN-based SR only on selected anchor frames while upscaling non-anchor frames via the lightweight reusing-based SR approach. However, frame-level scheduling is coarse-grained and fails to deliver optimal efficiency. In this work, we propose Palantir, the first neural-enhanced UHD live streaming system with fine-grained patch-level scheduling. In the presented solutions, two novel techniques are incorporated to make good scheduling decisions for inference overhead optimization and reduce the scheduling latency. Firstly, under the guidance of our pioneering and theoretical analysis, Palantir constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for lightweight yet accurate quality estimation under any possible anchor patch set. Secondly, to further optimize the scheduling latency, Palantir improves parallelizability by refactoring the computation subprocedure of the estimation process into a sparse matrix-matrix multiplication operation. The evaluation results suggest that Palantir incurs a negligible scheduling latency accounting for less than 5.7% of the end-to-end latency requirement. When compared to the state-of-the-art real-time frame-level scheduling strategy, Palantir reduces the energy overhead of SR-integrated mobile clients by 38.1% at most (and 22.4% on average) and the monetary costs of cloud-based SR by 80.1% at most (and 38.4% on average).

- **Summary**: Recent 3D novel view synthesis (NVS) methods are limited to single-object-centric scenes generated from new viewpoints and struggle with complex environments. They often require extensive 3D data for training, lacking generalization beyond training distribution. Conversely, 3D-free methods can generate text-controlled views of complex, in-the-wild scenes using a pretrained stable diffusion model without tedious fine-tuning, but lack camera control. In this paper, we introduce HawkI++, a method capable of generating camera-controlled viewpoints from a single input image. HawkI++ excels in handling complex and diverse scenes without additional 3D data or extensive training. It leverages widely available pretrained NVS models for weak guidance, integrating this knowledge into a 3D-free view synthesis approach to achieve the desired results efficiently. Our experimental results demonstrate that HawkI++ outperforms existing models in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, providing high-fidelity and consistent novel view synthesis at desired camera angles across a wide variety of scenes.

- **Summary**: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) \textit{e.g.} CLIP have made great progress in video recognition. Despite the improvement brought by the strong visual backbone in extracting spatial features, CLIP still falls short in capturing and integrating spatial-temporal features which is essential for video recognition. In this paper, we propose OmniCLIP, a framework that adapts CLIP for video recognition by focusing on learning comprehensive features encompassing spatial, temporal, and dynamic spatial-temporal scales, which we refer to as omni-scale features. This is achieved through the design of spatial-temporal blocks that include parallel temporal adapters (PTA), enabling efficient temporal modeling. Additionally, we introduce a self-prompt generator (SPG) module to capture dynamic object spatial features. The synergy between PTA and SPG allows OmniCLIP to discern varying spatial information across frames and assess object scales over time. We have conducted extensive experiments in supervised video recognition, few-shot video recognition, and zero-shot recognition tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially with OmniCLIP achieving a top-1 accuracy of 74.30\% on HMDB51 in a 16-shot setting, surpassing the recent MotionPrompt approach even with full training data.

- **Summary**: Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has been widely used to obtain quantitative elemental composition of imaged subjects for personalized and precise medical diagnosis. Compared with existing high-end DECT leveraging advanced X-ray source and/or detector technologies, the use of the sequentially-scanning data acquisition scheme to implement DECT may make broader impact on clinical practice because this scheme requires no specialized hardware designs. However, since the concentration of iodinated contrast agent in the imaged subject varies over time, sequentially-scanned data sets acquired at two tube potentials are temporally inconsistent. As existing material decomposition approaches for DECT assume that the data sets acquired at two tube potentials are temporally consistent, the violation of this assumption results in inaccurate quantification accuracy of iodine concentration. In this work, we developed a technique to achieve sequentially-scanning DECT imaging using high temporal resolution image reconstruction and temporal extrapolation, ACCELERATION in short, to address the technical challenge induced by temporal inconsistency of sequentially-scanned data sets and improve iodine quantification accuracy in sequentially-scanning DECT. ACCELERATION has been validated and evaluated using numerical simulation data sets generated from clinical human subject exams. Results demonstrated the improvement of iodine quantification accuracy using ACCELERATION.

- **Summary**: We present Blind-Match, a novel biometric identification system that leverages homomorphic encryption (HE) for efficient and privacy-preserving 1:N matching. Blind-Match introduces a HE-optimized cosine similarity computation method, where the key idea is to divide the feature vector into smaller parts for processing rather than computing the entire vector at once. By optimizing the number of these parts, Blind-Match minimizes execution time while ensuring data privacy through HE. Blind-Match achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across various biometric datasets. On the LFW face dataset, Blind-Match attains a 99.63% Rank-1 accuracy with a 128-dimensional feature vector, demonstrating its robustness in face recognition tasks. For fingerprint identification, Blind-Match achieves a remarkable 99.55% Rank-1 accuracy on the PolyU dataset, even with a compact 16-dimensional feature vector, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art method, Blind-Touch, which achieves only 59.17%. Furthermore, Blind-Match showcases practical efficiency in large-scale biometric identification scenarios, such as Naver Cloud's FaceSign, by processing 6,144 biometric samples in 0.74 seconds using a 128-dimensional feature vector.

- **Summary**: Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the zero-shot performance of Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) in 3D segmentation of abdominal organs in CT scans, leveraging its video tracking capabilities for volumetric medical imaging. Materials and Methods: Using a subset of the TotalSegmentator CT dataset (n=123) from 8 different institutions, we assessed SAM 2's ability to segment 8 abdominal organs. Segmentation was initiated from three different Z-coordinate levels (caudal, mid, and cranial levels) of each organ. Performance was measured using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). We also analyzed organ volumes to contextualize the results. Results: As a zero-shot approach, larger organs with clear boundaries demonstrated high segmentation performance, with mean(median) DSCs as follows: liver 0.821(0.898), left kidney 0.870(0.921), right kidney 0.862(0.935), and spleen 0.891(0.932). Smaller or less defined structures showed lower performance: gallbladder 0.531(0.590), pancreas 0.361(0.359), and adrenal glands 0.203-0.308(0.109-0.231). Significant differences in DSC were observed depending on the starting initial slice of segmentation for different organs. A moderate positive correlation was observed between volume size and DSCs (Spearman's rs = 0.731, P <.001 at caudal-level). DSCs exhibited high variability within organs, ranging from near 0 to almost 1.0, indicating substantial inconsistency in segmentation performance between scans. Conclusion: SAM 2 demonstrated promising zero-shot performance in segmenting certain abdominal organs in CT scans, particularly larger organs with clear boundaries. The model's ability to segment previously unseen targets without additional training highlights its potential for cross-domain generalization in medical imaging. However, improvements are needed for smaller and less defined structures.

- **Summary**: We introduce FruitNeRF, a unified novel fruit counting framework that leverages state-of-the-art view synthesis methods to count any fruit type directly in 3D. Our framework takes an unordered set of posed images captured by a monocular camera and segments fruit in each image. To make our system independent of the fruit type, we employ a foundation model that generates binary segmentation masks for any fruit. Utilizing both modalities, RGB and semantic, we train a semantic neural radiance field. Through uniform volume sampling of the implicit Fruit Field, we obtain fruit-only point clouds. By applying cascaded clustering on the extracted point cloud, our approach achieves precise fruit count.The use of neural radiance fields provides significant advantages over conventional methods such as object tracking or optical flow, as the counting itself is lifted into 3D. Our method prevents double counting fruit and avoids counting irrelevant fruit.We evaluate our methodology using both real-world and synthetic datasets. The real-world dataset consists of three apple trees with manually counted ground truths, a benchmark apple dataset with one row and ground truth fruit location, while the synthetic dataset comprises various fruit types including apple, plum, lemon, pear, peach, and mango.Additionally, we assess the performance of fruit counting using the foundation model compared to a U-Net.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation is one of the domains where sufficient annotated data is not available. This necessitates the application of low-data frameworks like few-shot learning. Contemporary prototype-based frameworks often do not account for the variation in features within the support and query images, giving rise to a large variance in prototype alignment. In this work, we adopt a prototype-based self-supervised one-way one-shot learning framework using pseudo-labels generated from superpixels to learn the semantic segmentation task itself. We use a correlation-based probability score to generate a dynamic prototype for each query pixel from the bag of prototypes obtained from the support feature map. This weighting scheme helps to give a higher weightage to contextually related prototypes. We also propose a quadrant masking strategy in the downstream segmentation task by utilizing prior domain information to discard unwanted false positives. We present extensive experimentations and evaluations on abdominal CT and MR datasets to show that the proposed simple but potent framework performs at par with the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in deep learning for predicting 3D protein structures have shown promise, particularly when leveraging inputs like protein sequences and Cryo-Electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) images. However, these techniques often fall short when predicting the structures of protein complexes (PCs), which involve multiple proteins. In our study, we investigate using atomic force microscopy (AFM) combined with deep learning to predict the 3D structures of PCs. AFM generates height maps that depict the PCs in various random orientations, providing a rich information for training a neural network to predict the 3D structures. We then employ the pre-trained UpFusion model (which utilizes a conditional diffusion model for synthesizing novel views) to train an instance-specific NeRF model for 3D reconstruction. The performance of UpFusion is evaluated through zero-shot predictions of 3D protein structures using AFM images. The challenge, however, lies in the time-intensive and impractical nature of collecting actual AFM images. To address this, we use a virtual AFM imaging process that transforms a `PDB' protein file into multi-view 2D virtual AFM images via volume rendering techniques. We extensively validate the UpFusion architecture using both virtual and actual multi-view AFM images. Our results include a comparison of structures predicted with varying numbers of views and different sets of views. This novel approach holds significant potential for enhancing the accuracy of protein complex structure predictions with further fine-tuning of the UpFusion network.

- **Summary**: Many learning-based low-light image enhancement (LLIE) algorithms are based on the Retinex theory. However, the Retinex-based decomposition techniques in such models introduce corruptions which limit their enhancement performance. In this paper, we propose a Latent Disentangle-based Enhancement Network (LDE-Net) for low light vision tasks. The latent disentanglement module disentangles the input image in latent space such that no corruption remains in the disentangled Content and Illumination components. For LLIE task, we design a Content-Aware Embedding (CAE) module that utilizes Content features to direct the enhancement of the Illumination component. For downstream tasks (e.g. nighttime UAV tracking and low-light object detection), we develop an effective light-weight enhancer based on the latent disentanglement framework. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our LDE-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various LLIE benchmarks. In addition, the great results obtained by applying our framework on the downstream tasks also demonstrate the usefulness of our latent disentanglement design.

- **Summary**: Traditionally, video is structured as a sequence of discrete image frames. Recently, however, a novel video sensing paradigm has emerged which eschews video frames entirely. These "event" sensors aim to mimic the human vision system with asynchronous sensing, where each pixel has an independent, sparse data stream. While these cameras enable high-speed and high-dynamic-range sensing, researchers often revert to a framed representation of the event data for existing applications, or build bespoke applications for a particular camera's event data type. At the same time, classical video systems have significant computational redundancy at the application layer, since pixel samples are repeated across frames in the uncompressed domain.   To address the shortcomings of existing systems, I introduce Address, Decimation, {\Delta}t Event Representation (AD{\Delta}ER, pronounced "adder"), a novel intermediate video representation and system framework. The framework transcodes a variety of framed and event camera sources into a single event-based representation, which supports source-modeled lossy compression and backward compatibility with traditional frame-based applications. I demonstrate that AD{\Delta}ER achieves state-of-the-art application speed and compression performance for scenes with high temporal redundancy. Crucially, I describe how AD{\Delta}ER unlocks an entirely new control mechanism for computer vision: application speed can correlate with both the scene content and the level of lossy compression. Finally, I discuss the implications for event-based video on large-scale video surveillance and resource-constrained sensing.

- **Summary**: Visual storytelling systems generate multi-sentence stories from image sequences. In this task, capturing contextual information and bridging visual variation bring additional challenges. We propose a simple yet effective framework that leverages the generalization capabilities of pretrained foundation models, only training a lightweight vision-language mapping network to connect modalities, while incorporating context to enhance coherence. We introduce a multimodal contrastive objective that also improves visual relevance and story informativeness. Extensive experimental results, across both automatic metrics and human evaluations, demonstrate that the stories generated by our framework are diverse, coherent, informative, and interesting.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted great attention in novel view synthesis because of its superior rendering efficiency and high fidelity. However, the trained Gaussians suffer from severe zooming degradation due to non-adjustable representation derived from single-scale training. Though some methods attempt to tackle this problem via post-processing techniques such as selective rendering or filtering techniques towards primitives, the scale-specific information is not involved in Gaussians. In this paper, we propose a unified optimization method to make Gaussians adaptive for arbitrary scales by self-adjusting the primitive properties (e.g., color, shape and size) and distribution (e.g., position). Inspired by the mipmap technique, we design pseudo ground-truth for the target scale and propose a scale-consistency guidance loss to inject scale information into 3D Gaussians. Our method is a plug-in module, applicable for any 3DGS models to solve the zoom-in and zoom-out aliasing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, our method outperforms 3DGS in PSNR by an average of 9.25 dB for zoom-in and 10.40 dB for zoom-out on the NeRF Synthetic dataset.

- **Summary**: The increasing use of deep learning across various domains highlights the importance of understanding the decision-making processes of these black-box models. Recent research focusing on the decision boundaries of deep classifiers, relies on generated synthetic instances in areas of low confidence, uncovering samples that challenge both models and humans. We propose a novel approach to enhance the interpretability of deep binary classifiers by selecting representative samples from the decision boundary - prototypes - and applying post-model explanation algorithms. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach through 2D visualizations and GradientSHAP analysis. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of the proposed method, revealing distinct and compact clusters and diverse prototypes that capture essential features that lead to low-confidence decisions. By offering a more aggregated view of deep classifiers' decision boundaries, our work contributes to the responsible development and deployment of reliable machine learning systems.

- **Summary**: Vision language models can now generate long-form answers to questions about images - long-form visual question answers (LFVQA). We contribute VizWiz-LF, a dataset of long-form answers to visual questions posed by blind and low vision (BLV) users. VizWiz-LF contains 4.2k long-form answers to 600 visual questions, collected from human expert describers and six VQA models. We develop and annotate functional roles of sentences of LFVQA and demonstrate that long-form answers contain information beyond the question answer such as explanations and suggestions. We further conduct automatic and human evaluations with BLV and sighted people to evaluate long-form answers. BLV people perceive both human-written and generated long-form answers to be plausible, but generated answers often hallucinate incorrect visual details, especially for unanswerable visual questions (e.g., blurry or irrelevant images). To reduce hallucinations, we evaluate the ability of VQA models to abstain from answering unanswerable questions across multiple prompting strategies.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), introduced to the computer vision community by Meta in April 2023, is a groundbreaking tool that allows automated segmentation of objects in images based on prompts such as text, clicks, or bounding boxes. SAM excels in zero-shot performance, segmenting unseen objects without additional training, stimulated by a large dataset of over one billion image masks. SAM 2 expands this functionality to video, leveraging memory from preceding and subsequent frames to generate accurate segmentation across entire videos, enabling near real-time performance. This comparison shows how SAM has evolved to meet the growing need for precise and efficient segmentation in various applications. The study suggests that future advancements in models like SAM will be crucial for improving computer vision technology.

- **Summary**: Presently, neural networks are widely employed to accurately estimate 2D displacements and associated uncertainties from Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data that can be integrated into stochastic filter networks like the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) as measurements and uncertainties for the update step in the filter. However, such neural approaches overlook symmetry which is a crucial inductive bias for model generalization. This oversight is notable because (i) physical laws adhere to symmetry principles when considering the gravity axis, meaning there exists the same transformation for both the physical entity and the resulting trajectory, and (ii) displacements should remain equivariant to frame transformations when the inertial frame changes. To address this, we propose a subequivariant framework by: (i) deriving fundamental layers such as linear and nonlinear layers for a subequivariant network, designed to handle sequences of vectors and scalars, (ii) employing the subequivariant network to predict an equivariant frame for the sequence of inertial measurements. This predicted frame can then be utilized for extracting invariant features through projection, which are integrated with arbitrary network architectures, (iii) transforming the invariant output by frame transformation to obtain equivariant displacements and covariances. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our Equivariant Framework on a filter-based approach with TLIO architecture for TLIO and Aria datasets, and an end-to-end deep learning approach with RONIN architecture for RONIN, RIDI and OxIOD datasets.

- **Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have ushered in a new era in artificial intelligence, merging capabilities in both language and vision to form highly capable Visual Foundation Agents. These agents are postulated to excel across a myriad of tasks, potentially approaching general artificial intelligence. However, existing benchmarks fail to sufficiently challenge or showcase the full potential of LMMs in complex, real-world environments. To address this gap, we introduce VisualAgentBench (VAB), a comprehensive and pioneering benchmark specifically designed to train and evaluate LMMs as visual foundation agents across diverse scenarios, including Embodied, Graphical User Interface, and Visual Design, with tasks formulated to probe the depth of LMMs' understanding and interaction capabilities. Through rigorous testing across nine proprietary LMM APIs and eight open models, we demonstrate the considerable yet still developing agent capabilities of these models. Additionally, VAB constructs a trajectory training set constructed through hybrid methods including Program-based Solvers, LMM Agent Bootstrapping, and Human Demonstrations, promoting substantial performance improvements in LMMs through behavior cloning. Our work not only aims to benchmark existing models but also provides a solid foundation for future development into visual foundation agents. Code, train \& test data, and part of fine-tuned open LMMs are available at \url{https://github.com/THUDM/VisualAgentBench}.

- **Summary**: Moving object segmentation (MOS) using a 3D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor is crucial for scene understanding and identification of moving objects. Despite the availability of various types of 3D LiDAR sensors in the market, MOS research still predominantly focuses on 3D point clouds from mechanically spinning omnidirectional LiDAR sensors. Thus, we are, for example, lacking a dataset with MOS labels for point clouds from solid-state LiDAR sensors which have irregular scanning patterns. In this paper, we present a labeled dataset, called \textit{HeLiMOS}, that enables to test MOS approaches on four heterogeneous LiDAR sensors, including two solid-state LiDAR sensors. Furthermore, we introduce a novel automatic labeling method to substantially reduce the labeling effort required from human annotators. To this end, our framework exploits an instance-aware static map building approach and tracking-based false label filtering. Finally, we provide experimental results regarding the performance of commonly used state-of-the-art MOS approaches on HeLiMOS that suggest a new direction for a sensor-agnostic MOS, which generally works regardless of the type of LiDAR sensors used to capture 3D point clouds.

- **Summary**: The cattle industry has been a major contributor to the economy of many countries, including the US and Canada. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized this sector, mirroring its transformative impact across all industries by enabling scalable and automated monitoring and intervention practices. AI has also introduced tools and methods that automate many tasks previously performed by human labor with the help of computer vision, including health inspections. Among these methods, pose estimation has a special place; pose estimation is the process of finding the position of joints in an image of animals. Analyzing the pose of animal subjects enables precise identification and tracking of the animal's movement and the movements of its body parts. By summarizing the video and imagery data into movement and joint location using pose estimation and then analyzing this information, we can address the scalability challenge in cattle management, focusing on health monitoring, behavioural phenotyping and welfare concerns. Our study reviews recent advancements in pose estimation methodologies, their applicability in improving the cattle industry, existing challenges, and gaps in this field. Furthermore, we propose an initiative to enhance open science frameworks within this field of study by launching a platform designed to connect industry and academia.
