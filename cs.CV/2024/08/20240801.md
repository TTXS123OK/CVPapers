- **Summary**: The recent success of large vision language models shows great potential in driving the agent system operating on user interfaces. However, we argue that the power multimodal models like GPT-4V as a general agent on multiple operating systems across different applications is largely underestimated due to the lack of a robust screen parsing technique capable of: 1) reliably identifying interactable icons within the user interface, and 2) understanding the semantics of various elements in a screenshot and accurately associate the intended action with the corresponding region on the screen. To fill these gaps, we introduce \textsc{OmniParser}, a comprehensive method for parsing user interface screenshots into structured elements, which significantly enhances the ability of GPT-4V to generate actions that can be accurately grounded in the corresponding regions of the interface. We first curated an interactable icon detection dataset using popular webpages and an icon description dataset. These datasets were utilized to fine-tune specialized models: a detection model to parse interactable regions on the screen and a caption model to extract the functional semantics of the detected elements. \textsc{OmniParser} significantly improves GPT-4V's performance on ScreenSpot benchmark. And on Mind2Web and AITW benchmark, \textsc{OmniParser} with screenshot only input outperforms the GPT-4V baselines requiring additional information outside of screenshot.

- **Summary**: Blind iris images, which result from unknown degradation during the process of iris recognition at long distances, often lead to decreased iris recognition rates. Currently, little existing literature offers a solution to this problem. In response, we propose a prior embedding-driven architecture for long distance blind iris recognition. We first proposed a blind iris image restoration network called Iris-PPRGAN. To effectively restore the texture of the blind iris, Iris-PPRGAN includes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) used as a Prior Decoder, and a DNN used as the encoder. To extract iris features more efficiently, we then proposed a robust iris classifier by modifying the bottleneck module of InsightFace, which called Insight-Iris. A low-quality blind iris image is first restored by Iris-PPRGAN, then the restored iris image undergoes recognition via Insight-Iris. Experimental results on the public CASIA-Iris-distance dataset demonstrate that our proposed method significantly superior results to state-of-the-art blind iris restoration methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, Specifically, the recognition rate for long-distance blind iris images reaches 90% after processing with our methods, representing an improvement of approximately ten percentage points compared to images without restoration.

- **Summary**: Modern medical image registration approaches predict deformations using deep networks. These approaches achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration accuracy and are generally fast. However, deep learning (DL) approaches are, in contrast to conventional non-deep-learning-based approaches, anatomy-specific. Recently, a universal deep registration approach, uniGradICON, has been proposed. However, uniGradICON focuses on monomodal image registration. In this work, we therefore develop multiGradICON as a first step towards universal *multimodal* medical image registration. Specifically, we show that 1) we can train a DL registration model that is suitable for monomodal *and* multimodal registration; 2) loss function randomization can increase multimodal registration accuracy; and 3) training a model with multimodal data helps multimodal generalization. Our code and the multiGradICON model are available at https://github.com/uncbiag/uniGradICON.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Existing works in few-shot action recognition mostly fine-tune a pre-trained image model and design sophisticated temporal alignment modules at feature level. However, simply fully fine-tuning the pre-trained model could cause overfitting due to the scarcity of video samples. Additionally, we argue that the exploration of task-specific information is insufficient when relying solely on well extracted abstract features. In this work, we propose a simple but effective task-specific adaptation method (Task-Adapter) for few-shot action recognition. By introducing the proposed Task-Adapter into the last several layers of the backbone and keeping the parameters of the original pre-trained model frozen, we mitigate the overfitting problem caused by full fine-tuning and advance the task-specific mechanism into the process of feature extraction. In each Task-Adapter, we reuse the frozen self-attention layer to perform task-specific self-attention across different videos within the given task to capture both distinctive information among classes and shared information within classes, which facilitates task-specific adaptation and enhances subsequent metric measurement between the query feature and support prototypes. Experimental results consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Task-Adapter on four standard few-shot action recognition datasets. Especially on temporal challenging SSv2 dataset, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Despite the photorealistic novel view synthesis (NVS) performance achieved by the original 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), its rendering quality significantly degrades with sparse input views. This performance drop is mainly caused by the limited number of initial points generated from the sparse input, insufficient supervision during the training process, and inadequate regularization of the oversized Gaussian ellipsoids. To handle these issues, we propose the LoopSparseGS, a loop-based 3DGS framework for the sparse novel view synthesis task. In specific, we propose a loop-based Progressive Gaussian Initialization (PGI) strategy that could iteratively densify the initialized point cloud using the rendered pseudo images during the training process. Then, the sparse and reliable depth from the Structure from Motion, and the window-based dense monocular depth are leveraged to provide precise geometric supervision via the proposed Depth-alignment Regularization (DAR). Additionally, we introduce a novel Sparse-friendly Sampling (SFS) strategy to handle oversized Gaussian ellipsoids leading to large pixel errors. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that LoopSparseGS outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for sparse-input novel view synthesis, across indoor, outdoor, and object-level scenes with various image resolutions.

- **Summary**: Deep models are being applied in numerous fields and have become a new important digital product. Meanwhile, previous studies have shown that deep models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, in which compromised models return attacker-desired results when a trigger appears. Backdoor attacks severely break the trust-worthiness of deep models. In this paper, we turn this weakness of deep models into a strength, and propose a novel revocable backdoor and deep model trading scenario. Specifically, we aim to compromise deep models without degrading their performance, meanwhile, we can easily detoxify poisoned models without re-training the models. We design specific mask matrices to manage the internal feature maps of the models. These mask matrices can be used to deactivate the backdoors. The revocable backdoor can be adopted in the deep model trading scenario. Sellers train models with revocable backdoors as a trial version. Buyers pay a deposit to sellers and obtain a trial version of the deep model. If buyers are satisfied with the trial version, they pay a final payment to sellers and sellers send mask matrices to buyers to withdraw revocable backdoors. We demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of our revocable backdoor by various datasets and network architectures.

- **Summary**: Image de-raining is a critical task in computer vision to improve visibility and enhance the robustness of outdoor vision systems. While recent advances in de-raining methods have achieved remarkable performance, the challenge remains to produce high-quality and visually pleasing de-rained results. In this paper, we present a reference-guided de-raining filter, a transformer network that enhances de-raining results using a reference clean image as guidance. We leverage the capabilities of the proposed module to further refine the images de-rained by existing methods. We validate our method on three datasets and show that our module can improve the performance of existing prior-based, CNN-based, and transformer-based approaches.

- **Summary**: We explore the application of U-KAN, a U-Net based network enhanced with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers, for 3D brain tumor segmentation using multi-modal MRI data. We adapt the original 2D U-KAN model to the 3D task, and introduce a variant called UKAN-SE, which incorporates Squeeze-and-Excitation modules for global attention. We compare the performance of U-KAN and UKAN-SE against existing methods such as U-Net, Attention U-Net, and Swin UNETR, using the BraTS 2024 dataset. Our results show that U-KAN and UKAN-SE, with approximately 10.6 million parameters, achieve exceptional efficiency, requiring only about 1/4 of the training time of U-Net and Attention U-Net, and 1/6 that of Swin UNETR, while surpassing these models across most evaluation metrics. Notably, UKAN-SE slightly outperforms U-KAN.

- **Summary**: We propose MESA and DMESA as novel feature matching methods, which utilize Segment Anything Model (SAM) to effectively mitigate matching redundancy. The key insight of our methods is to establish implicit-semantic area matching prior to point matching, based on advanced image understanding of SAM. Then, informative area matches with consistent internal semantic are able to undergo dense feature comparison, facilitating precise inside-area point matching. Specifically, MESA adopts a sparse matching framework and first obtains candidate areas from SAM results through a novel Area Graph (AG). Then, area matching among the candidates is formulated as graph energy minimization and solved by graphical models derived from AG. To address the efficiency issue of MESA, we further propose DMESA as its dense counterpart, applying a dense matching framework. After candidate areas are identified by AG, DMESA establishes area matches through generating dense matching distributions. The distributions are produced from off-the-shelf patch matching utilizing the Gaussian Mixture Model and refined via the Expectation Maximization. With less repetitive computation, DMESA showcases a speed improvement of nearly five times compared to MESA, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our methods are extensively evaluated on five datasets encompassing indoor and outdoor scenes. The results illustrate consistent performance improvements from our methods for five distinct point matching baselines across all datasets. Furthermore, our methods exhibit promise generalization and improved robustness against image resolution variations. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Easonyesheng/A2PM-MESA.

- **Summary**: This research investigates biases in text-to-image (TTI) models for the Indic languages widely spoken across India. It evaluates and compares the generative performance and cultural relevance of leading TTI models in these languages against their performance in English. Using the proposed IndicTTI benchmark, we comprehensively assess the performance of 30 Indic languages with two open-source diffusion models and two commercial generation APIs. The primary objective of this benchmark is to evaluate the support for Indic languages in these models and identify areas needing improvement. Given the linguistic diversity of 30 languages spoken by over 1.4 billion people, this benchmark aims to provide a detailed and insightful analysis of TTI models' effectiveness within the Indic linguistic landscape.

- **Summary**: 3D object detection is essential for understanding 3D scenes. Contemporary techniques often require extensive annotated training data, yet obtaining point-wise annotations for point clouds is time-consuming and laborious. Recent developments in semi-supervised methods seek to mitigate this problem by employing a teacher-student framework to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled point clouds. However, these pseudo-labels frequently suffer from insufficient diversity and inferior quality. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce an Agent-based Diffusion Model for Semi-supervised 3D Object Detection (Diff3DETR). Specifically, an agent-based object query generator is designed to produce object queries that effectively adapt to dynamic scenes while striking a balance between sampling locations and content embedding. Additionally, a box-aware denoising module utilizes the DDIM denoising process and the long-range attention in the transformer decoder to refine bounding boxes incrementally. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and SUN RGB-D datasets demonstrate that Diff3DETR outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised 3D object detection methods.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) intends to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Many current methods focus on learning feature representations that are both discriminative for classification and invariant across domains by simultaneously optimizing domain alignment and classification tasks. However, these methods often overlook a crucial challenge: the inherent conflict between these two tasks during gradient-based optimization. In this paper, we delve into this issue and introduce two effective solutions known as Gradient Harmonization, including GH and GH++, to mitigate the conflict between domain alignment and classification tasks. GH operates by altering the gradient angle between different tasks from an obtuse angle to an acute angle, thus resolving the conflict and trade-offing the two tasks in a coordinated manner. Yet, this would cause both tasks to deviate from their original optimization directions. We thus further propose an improved version, GH++, which adjusts the gradient angle between tasks from an obtuse angle to a vertical angle. This not only eliminates the conflict but also minimizes deviation from the original gradient directions. Finally, for optimization convenience and efficiency, we evolve the gradient harmonization strategies into a dynamically weighted loss function using an integral operator on the harmonized gradient. Notably, GH/GH++ are orthogonal to UDA and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing UDA models. Theoretical insights and experimental analyses demonstrate that the proposed approaches not only enhance popular UDA baselines but also improve recent state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: With the advent of the era of foundation models, pre-training and fine-tuning have become common paradigms. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning has garnered widespread attention due to its better balance between the number of learnable parameters and performance. However, some current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods only model a single modality and lack the utilization of structural knowledge in downstream tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-modal parameter-efficient fine-tuning method based on graph networks. Each image is fed into a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to generate a text description. The image and its corresponding text description are then processed by a frozen image encoder and text encoder to generate image features and text features, respectively. A graph is constructed based on the similarity of the multi-modal feature nodes, and knowledge and relationships relevant to these features are extracted from each node. Additionally, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) regularization is incorporated into the loss function to mitigate the problem of forgetting during task learning. The proposed model achieves test accuracies on the OxfordPets, Flowers102, and Food101 datasets that improve by 4.45%, 2.92%, and 0.23%, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/yunche0/GA-Net/tree/master.

- **Summary**: With the widespread sharing of personal face images in applications' public databases, face recognition systems faces real threat of being breached by potential adversaries who are able to access users' face images and use them to intrude the face recognition systems. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy protection method in the multiscale sparsified feature subspaces to protect sensitive facial features, by taking care of the influence or weight ranked feature coefficients on the privacy budget, named "Ranked Differential Privacy (RDP)". After the multiscale feature decomposition, the lightweight Laplacian noise is added to the dimension-reduced sparsified feature coefficients according to the geometric superposition method. Then, we rigorously prove that the RDP satisfies Differential Privacy. After that, the nonlinear Lagrange Multiplier (LM) method is formulated for the constraint optimization problem of maximizing the utility of the visualization quality protected face images with sanitizing noise, under a given facial features privacy budget. Then, two methods are proposed to solve the nonlinear LM problem and obtain the optimal noise scale parameters: 1) the analytical Normalization Approximation (NA) method with identical average noise scale parameter for real-time online applications; and 2) the LM optimization Gradient Descent (LMGD) numerical method to obtain the nonlinear solution through iterative updating for more accurate offline applications. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that our proposed RDP outperforms other state-of-the-art methods: at a privacy budget of 0.2, the PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) of the RDP is about ~10 dB higher than (10 times as high as) the highest PSNR of all compared methods.

- **Summary**: Creating a 360{\deg} parametric model of a human head is a very challenging task. While recent advancements have demonstrated the efficacy of leveraging synthetic data for building such parametric head models, their performance remains inadequate in crucial areas such as expression-driven animation, hairstyle editing, and text-based modifications. In this paper, we build a dataset of artist-designed high-fidelity human heads and propose to create a novel parametric 360{\deg} renderable parametric head model from it. Our scheme decouples the facial motion/shape and facial appearance, which are represented by a classic parametric 3D mesh model and an attached neural texture, respectively. We further propose a training method for decompositing hairstyle and facial appearance, allowing free-swapping of the hairstyle. A novel inversion fitting method is presented based on single image input with high generalization and fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first parametric 3D full-head that achieves 360{\deg} free-view synthesis, image-based fitting, appearance editing, and animation within a single model. Experiments show that facial motions and appearances are well disentangled in the parametric space, leading to SOTA performance in rendering and animating quality.

- **Summary**: We present a novel approach for synthesizing 3D talking heads with controllable emotion, featuring enhanced lip synchronization and rendering quality. Despite significant progress in the field, prior methods still suffer from multi-view consistency and a lack of emotional expressiveness. To address these issues, we collect EmoTalk3D dataset with calibrated multi-view videos, emotional annotations, and per-frame 3D geometry. By training on the EmoTalk3D dataset, we propose a \textit{`Speech-to-Geometry-to-Appearance'} mapping framework that first predicts faithful 3D geometry sequence from the audio features, then the appearance of a 3D talking head represented by 4D Gaussians is synthesized from the predicted geometry. The appearance is further disentangled into canonical and dynamic Gaussians, learned from multi-view videos, and fused to render free-view talking head animation. Moreover, our model enables controllable emotion in the generated talking heads and can be rendered in wide-range views. Our method exhibits improved rendering quality and stability in lip motion generation while capturing dynamic facial details such as wrinkles and subtle expressions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating high-fidelity and emotion-controllable 3D talking heads. The code and EmoTalk3D dataset are released at https://nju-3dv.github.io/projects/EmoTalk3D.

- **Summary**: Enabling engagement of manga by visually impaired individuals presents a significant challenge due to its inherently visual nature. With the goal of fostering accessibility, this paper aims to generate a dialogue transcript of a complete manga chapter, entirely automatically, with a particular emphasis on ensuring narrative consistency. This entails identifying (i) what is being said, i.e., detecting the texts on each page and classifying them into essential vs non-essential, and (ii) who is saying it, i.e., attributing each dialogue to its speaker, while ensuring the same characters are named consistently throughout the chapter.   To this end, we introduce: (i) Magiv2, a model that is capable of generating high-quality chapter-wide manga transcripts with named characters and significantly higher precision in speaker diarisation over prior works; (ii) an extension of the PopManga evaluation dataset, which now includes annotations for speech-bubble tail boxes, associations of text to corresponding tails, classifications of text as essential or non-essential, and the identity for each character box; and (iii) a new character bank dataset, which comprises over 11K characters from 76 manga series, featuring 11.5K exemplar character images in total, as well as a list of chapters in which they appear. The code, trained model, and both datasets can be found at: https://github.com/ragavsachdeva/magi

- **Summary**: Throughout rapid development of multimodal large language models, a crucial ingredient is a fair and accurate evaluation of their multimodal comprehension abilities. Although Visual Question Answering (VQA) could serve as a developed test field, limitations of VQA evaluation, like the inflexible pattern of Exact Match, have hindered MLLMs from demonstrating their real capability and discourage rich responses. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of semantics-based evaluators for assessing unconstrained open-ended responses on VQA datasets. As characteristics of VQA have made such evaluation significantly different than the traditional Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task, to systematically analyze the behaviour and compare the performance of various evaluators including LLM-based ones, we proposes three key properties, i.e., Alignment, Consistency and Generalization, and a corresponding dataset Assessing VQA Evaluators (AVE) to facilitate analysis. In addition, this paper proposes a Semantically Flexible VQA Evaluator (SFVE) with meticulous design based on the unique features of VQA evaluation. Experimental results verify the feasibility of model-based VQA evaluation and effectiveness of the proposed evaluator that surpasses existing semantic evaluators by a large margin. The proposed training scheme generalizes to both the BERT-like encoders and decoder-only LLM.

- **Summary**: Neural implicit representation, the parameterization of distance function as a coordinate neural field, has emerged as a promising lead in tackling surface reconstruction from unoriented point clouds. To enforce consistent orientation, existing methods focus on regularizing the gradient of the distance function, such as constraining it to be of the unit norm, minimizing its divergence, or aligning it with the eigenvector of Hessian that corresponds to zero eigenvalue. However, under the presence of large scanning noise, they tend to either overfit the noise input or produce an excessively smooth reconstruction. In this work, we propose to guide the surface reconstruction under a new variant of neural field, the octahedral field, leveraging the spherical harmonics representation of octahedral frames originated in the hexahedral meshing. Such field automatically snaps to geometry features when constrained to be smooth, and naturally preserves sharp angles when interpolated over creases. By simultaneously fitting and smoothing the octahedral field alongside the implicit geometry, it behaves analogously to bilateral filtering, resulting in smooth reconstruction while preserving sharp edges. Despite being operated purely pointwise, our method outperforms various traditional and neural approaches across extensive experiments, and is very competitive with methods that require normal and data priors. Our full implementation is available at: https://github.com/Ankbzpx/frame-field.

- **Summary**: In this study, we present a novel approach for predicting genomic information from medical imaging modalities using a transformer-based model. We aim to bridge the gap between imaging and genomics data by leveraging transformer networks, allowing for accurate genomic profile predictions from CT/MRI images. Presently most studies rely on the use of whole slide images (WSI) for the association, which are obtained via invasive methodologies. We propose using only available CT/MRI images to predict genomic sequences. Our transformer based approach is able to efficiently generate associations between multiple sequences based on CT/MRI images alone. This work paves the way for the use of non-invasive imaging modalities for precise and personalized healthcare, allowing for a better understanding of diseases and treatment.

- **Summary**: Recently Diffusion-based Purification (DiffPure) has been recognized as an effective defense method against adversarial examples. However, we find DiffPure which directly employs the original pre-trained diffusion models for adversarial purification, to be suboptimal. This is due to an inherent trade-off between noise purification performance and data recovery quality. Additionally, the reliability of existing evaluations for DiffPure is questionable, as they rely on weak adaptive attacks. In this work, we propose a novel Adversarial Diffusion Bridge Model, termed ADBM. ADBM directly constructs a reverse bridge from the diffused adversarial data back to its original clean examples, enhancing the purification capabilities of the original diffusion models. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation across various scenarios, ADBM has proven to be a superior and robust defense mechanism, offering significant promise for practical applications.

- **Summary**: Reliably detecting when a deployed machine learning model is likely to fail on a given input is crucial for ensuring safe operation. In this work, we propose DECIDER (Debiasing Classifiers to Identify Errors Reliably), a novel approach that leverages priors from large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to detect failures in image classification models. DECIDER utilizes LLMs to specify task-relevant core attributes and constructs a ``debiased'' version of the classifier by aligning its visual features to these core attributes using a VLM, and detects potential failure by measuring disagreement between the original and debiased models. In addition to proactively identifying samples on which the model would fail, DECIDER also provides human-interpretable explanations for failure through a novel attribute-ablation strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks spanning subpopulation shifts (spurious correlations, class imbalance) and covariate shifts (synthetic corruptions, domain shifts), DECIDER consistently achieves state-of-the-art failure detection performance, significantly outperforming baselines in terms of the overall Matthews correlation coefficient as well as failure and success recall.

- **Summary**: Outdoor sports pose a challenge for people with impaired vision. The demand for higher-speed mobility inspired us to develop a vision-based wearable steering assistance. To ensure broad applicability, we focused on a representative sports environment, the athletics track. Our efforts centered on improving the speed and accuracy of perception, enhancing planning adaptability for the real world, and providing swift and safe assistance for people with impaired vision. In perception, we engineered a lightweight multitask network capable of simultaneously detecting track lines and obstacles. Additionally, due to the limitations of existing datasets for supporting multi-task detection in athletics tracks, we diligently collected and annotated a new dataset (MAT) containing 1000 images. In planning, we integrated the methods of sampling and spline curves, addressing the planning challenges of curves. Meanwhile, we utilized the positions of the track lines and obstacles as constraints to guide people with impaired vision safely along the current track. Our system is deployed on an embedded device, Jetson Orin NX. Through outdoor experiments, it demonstrated adaptability in different sports scenarios, assisting users in achieving free movement of 400-meter at an average speed of 1.34 m/s, meeting the level of normal people in jogging.

- **Summary**: Due to the visual properties of reflection and refraction, RGB-D cameras cannot accurately capture the depth of transparent objects, leading to incomplete depth maps. To fill in the missing points, recent studies tend to explore new visual features and design complex networks to reconstruct the depth, however, these approaches tremendously increase computation, and the correlation of different visual features remains a problem. To this end, we propose an efficient depth completion network named DistillGrasp which distillates knowledge from the teacher branch to the student branch. Specifically, in the teacher branch, we design a position correlation block (PCB) that leverages RGB images as the query and key to search for the corresponding values, guiding the model to establish correct correspondence between two features and transfer it to the transparent areas. For the student branch, we propose a consistent feature correlation module (CFCM) that retains the reliable regions of RGB images and depth maps respectively according to the consistency and adopts a CNN to capture the pairwise relationship for depth completion. To avoid the student branch only learning regional features from the teacher branch, we devise a distillation loss that not only considers the distance loss but also the object structure and edge information. Extensive experiments conducted on the ClearGrasp dataset manifest that our teacher network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and generalization, and the student network achieves competitive results with a higher speed of 48 FPS. In addition, the significant improvement in a real-world robotic grasping system illustrates the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed system.

- **Summary**: Current visual navigation systems often treat the environment as static, lacking the ability to adaptively interact with obstacles. This limitation leads to navigation failure when encountering unavoidable obstructions. In response, we introduce IN-Sight, a novel approach to self-supervised path planning, enabling more effective navigation strategies through interaction with obstacles. Utilizing RGB-D observations, IN-Sight calculates traversability scores and incorporates them into a semantic map, facilitating long-range path planning in complex, maze-like environments. To precisely navigate around obstacles, IN-Sight employs a local planner, trained imperatively on a differentiable costmap using representation learning techniques. The entire framework undergoes end-to-end training within the state-of-the-art photorealistic Intel SPEAR Simulator. We validate the effectiveness of IN-Sight through extensive benchmarking in a variety of simulated scenarios and ablation studies. Moreover, we demonstrate the system's real-world applicability with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, deploying our planner on the legged robot platform ANYmal, showcasing its practical potential for interactive navigation in real environments.

- **Summary**: Understanding the morphological structure of medical images and precisely segmenting the region of interest or abnormality is an important task that can assist in diagnosis. However, the unique properties of medical imaging make clear segmentation difficult, and the high cost and time-consuming task of labeling leads to a coarse-grained representation of ground truth. Facing with these problems, we propose a novel Diffusion Transformer Segmentation (DTS) model for robust segmentation in the presence of noise. We propose an alternative to the dominant Denoising U-Net encoder through experiments applying a transformer architecture, which captures global dependency through self-attention. Additionally, we propose k-neighbor label smoothing, reverse boundary attention, and self-supervised learning with morphology-driven learning to improve the ability to identify complex structures. Our model, which analyzes the morphological representation of images, shows better results than the previous models in various medical imaging modalities, including CT, MRI, and lesion images.

- **Summary**: In computer vision, it is well-known that a lack of data diversity will impair model performance. In this study, we address the challenges of enhancing the dataset diversity problem in order to benefit various downstream tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation. We propose a simple yet effective data augmentation approach by leveraging advancements in generative models, specifically text-to-image synthesis technologies like Stable Diffusion. Our method focuses on generating variations of labeled real images, utilizing generative object and background augmentation via inpainting to augment existing training data without the need for additional annotations. We find that background augmentation, in particular, significantly improves the models' robustness and generalization capabilities. We also investigate how to adjust the prompt and mask to ensure the generated content comply with the existing annotations. The efficacy of our augmentation techniques is validated through comprehensive evaluations of the COCO dataset and several other key object detection benchmarks, demonstrating notable enhancements in model performance across diverse scenarios. This approach offers a promising solution to the challenges of dataset enhancement, contributing to the development of more accurate and robust computer vision models.

- **Summary**: We propose a new framework for creating and easily manipulating 3D models of arbitrary objects using casually captured videos. Our core ingredient is a novel hierarchy deformation model, which captures motions of objects with a tree-structured bones. Our hierarchy system decomposes motions based on the granularity and reveals the correlations between parts without exploiting any prior structural knowledge. We further propose to regularize the bones to be positioned at the basis of motions, centers of parts, sufficiently covering related surfaces of the part. This is achieved by our bone occupancy function, which identifies whether a given 3D point is placed within the bone. Coupling the proposed components, our framework offers several clear advantages: (1) users can obtain animatable 3D models of the arbitrary objects in improved quality from their casual videos, (2) users can manipulate 3D models in an intuitive manner with minimal costs, and (3) users can interactively add or delete control points as necessary. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on diverse instances, in reconstruction quality, interpretability and easier manipulation.

- **Summary**: Human motion generation driven by deep generative models has enabled compelling applications, but the ability of text-to-motion (T2M) models to produce realistic motions from text prompts raises security concerns if exploited maliciously. Despite growing interest in T2M, few methods focus on safeguarding these models against adversarial attacks, with existing work on text-to-image models proving insufficient for the unique motion domain. In the paper, we propose ALERT-Motion, an autonomous framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to craft targeted adversarial attacks against black-box T2M models. Unlike prior methods modifying prompts through predefined rules, ALERT-Motion uses LLMs' knowledge of human motion to autonomously generate subtle yet powerful adversarial text descriptions. It comprises two key modules: an adaptive dispatching module that constructs an LLM-based agent to iteratively refine and search for adversarial prompts; and a multimodal information contrastive module that extracts semantically relevant motion information to guide the agent's search. Through this LLM-driven approach, ALERT-Motion crafts adversarial prompts querying victim models to produce outputs closely matching targeted motions, while avoiding obvious perturbations. Evaluations across popular T2M models demonstrate ALERT-Motion's superiority over previous methods, achieving higher attack success rates with stealthier adversarial prompts. This pioneering work on T2M adversarial attacks highlights the urgency of developing defensive measures as motion generation technology advances, urging further research into safe and responsible deployment.

- **Summary**: More and more end-to-end text spotting methods based on Transformer architecture have demonstrated superior performance. These methods utilize a bipartite graph matching algorithm to perform one-to-one optimal matching between predicted objects and actual objects. However, the instability of bipartite graph matching can lead to inconsistent optimization targets, thereby affecting the training performance of the model. Existing literature applies denoising training to solve the problem of bipartite graph matching instability in object detection tasks. Unfortunately, this denoising training method cannot be directly applied to text spotting tasks, as these tasks need to perform irregular shape detection tasks and more complex text recognition tasks than classification. To address this issue, we propose a novel denoising training method (DNTextSpotter) for arbitrary-shaped text spotting. Specifically, we decompose the queries of the denoising part into noised positional queries and noised content queries. We use the four Bezier control points of the Bezier center curve to generate the noised positional queries. For the noised content queries, considering that the output of the text in a fixed positional order is not conducive to aligning position with content, we employ a masked character sliding method to initialize noised content queries, thereby assisting in the alignment of text content and position. To improve the model's perception of the background, we further utilize an additional loss function for background characters classification in the denoising training part.Although DNTextSpotter is conceptually simple, it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks (Total-Text, SCUT-CTW1500, ICDAR15, and Inverse-Text), especially yielding an improvement of 11.3% against the best approach in Inverse-Text dataset.

- **Summary**: In the area of self-supervised monocular depth estimation, models that utilize rich-resource inputs, such as high-resolution and multi-frame inputs, typically achieve better performance than models that use ordinary single image input. However, these rich-resource inputs may not always be available, limiting the applicability of these methods in general scenarios. In this paper, we propose Rich-resource Prior Depth estimator (RPrDepth), which only requires single input image during the inference phase but can still produce highly accurate depth estimations comparable to rich resource based methods. Specifically, we treat rich-resource data as prior information and extract features from it as reference features in an offline manner. When estimating the depth for a single-image image, we search for similar pixels from the rich-resource features and use them as prior information to estimate the depth. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperform other single-image model and can achieve comparable or even better performance than models with rich-resource inputs, only using low-resolution single-image input.

- **Summary**: The video topic segmentation (VTS) task segments videos into intelligible, non-overlapping topics, facilitating efficient comprehension of video content and quick access to specific content. VTS is also critical to various downstream video understanding tasks. Traditional VTS methods using shallow features or unsupervised approaches struggle to accurately discern the nuances of topical transitions. Recently, supervised approaches have achieved superior performance on video action or scene segmentation over unsupervised approaches. In this work, we improve supervised VTS by thoroughly exploring multimodal fusion and multimodal coherence modeling. Specifically, (1) we enhance multimodal fusion by exploring different architectures using cross-attention and mixture of experts. (2) To generally strengthen multimodality alignment and fusion, we pre-train and fine-tune the model with multimodal contrastive learning. (3) We propose a new pre-training task tailored for the VTS task, and a novel fine-tuning task for enhancing multimodal coherence modeling for VTS. We evaluate the proposed approaches on educational videos, in the form of lectures, due to the vital role of topic segmentation of educational videos in boosting learning experiences. Additionally, we introduce a large-scale Chinese lecture video dataset to augment the existing English corpus, promoting further research in VTS. Experiments on both English and Chinese lecture datasets demonstrate that our model achieves superior VTS performance compared to competitive unsupervised and supervised baselines.

- **Summary**: Image generation can solve insufficient labeled data issues in defect detection. Most defect generation methods are only trained on a single product without considering the consistencies among multiple products, leading to poor quality and diversity of generated results. To address these issues, we propose DefectDiffu, a novel text-guided diffusion method to model both intra-product background consistency and inter-product defect consistency across multiple products and modulate the consistency perturbation directions to control product type and defect strength, achieving diversified defect image generation. Firstly, we leverage a text encoder to separately provide consistency prompts for background, defect, and fusion parts of the disentangled integrated architecture, thereby disentangling defects and normal backgrounds. Secondly, we propose the double-free strategy to generate defect images through two-stage perturbation of consistency direction, thereby controlling product type and defect strength by adjusting the perturbation scale. Besides, DefectDiffu can generate defect mask annotations utilizing cross-attention maps from the defect part. Finally, to improve the generation quality of small defects and masks, we propose the adaptive attention-enhance loss to increase the attention to defects. Experimental results demonstrate that DefectDiffu surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of generation quality and diversity, thus effectively improving downstream defection performance. Moreover, defect perturbation directions can be transferred among various products to achieve zero-shot defect generation, which is highly beneficial for addressing insufficient data issues.

- **Summary**: Current research on trajectory prediction primarily relies on data collected by onboard sensors of an ego vehicle. With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq. Our results demonstrate superior performance in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Miss Rate (MR) using a single GPU.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in digital pathology have led to the development of numerous foundational models that utilize self-supervised learning on patches extracted from gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs). While this approach leverages vast amounts of unlabeled data, we have discovered a significant issue: features extracted from these self-supervised models tend to cluster by individual WSIs, a phenomenon we term WSI-specific feature collapse. This problem can potentially limit the model's generalization ability and performance on various downstream tasks. To address this issue, we introduce Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model, a novel foundational model trained on patches that have undergone stain normalization. Stain normalization helps reduce color variability arising from different laboratories and scanners, enabling the model to learn more consistent features. Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model is trained using 285,153,903 patches extracted from a total of 34,795 WSIs, combining data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Our experiments demonstrate that Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model significantly mitigates the feature collapse problem, indicating that the model has learned more generalized features rather than overfitting to individual WSI characteristics. We compared Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model with state-of-the-art models across six downstream task datasets, and our results show that Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model achieves excellent performance relative to the number of WSIs used and the model's parameter count. This suggests that the application of stain normalization has substantially improved the model's efficiency and generalization capabilities.

- **Summary**: AI-generated synthetic media, also called Deepfakes, have significantly influenced so many domains, from entertainment to cybersecurity. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) are the main frameworks used to create Deepfakes, producing highly realistic yet fabricated content. While these technologies open up new creative possibilities, they also bring substantial ethical and security risks due to their potential misuse. The rise of such advanced media has led to the development of a cognitive bias known as Impostor Bias, where individuals doubt the authenticity of multimedia due to the awareness of AI's capabilities. As a result, Deepfake detection has become a vital area of research, focusing on identifying subtle inconsistencies and artifacts with machine learning techniques, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Research in forensic Deepfake technology encompasses five main areas: detection, attribution and recognition, passive authentication, detection in realistic scenarios, and active authentication. Each area tackles specific challenges, from tracing the origins of synthetic media and examining its inherent characteristics for authenticity. This paper reviews the primary algorithms that address these challenges, examining their advantages, limitations, and future prospects.

- **Summary**: In the e-commerce realm, compelling advertising images are pivotal for attracting customer attention. While generative models automate image generation, they often produce substandard images that may mislead customers and require significant labor costs to inspect. This paper delves into increasing the rate of available generated images. We first introduce a multi-modal Reliable Feedback Network (RFNet) to automatically inspect the generated images. Combining the RFNet into a recurrent process, Recurrent Generation, results in a higher number of available advertising images. To further enhance production efficiency, we fine-tune diffusion models with an innovative Consistent Condition regularization utilizing the feedback from RFNet (RFFT). This results in a remarkable increase in the available rate of generated images, reducing the number of attempts in Recurrent Generation, and providing a highly efficient production process without sacrificing visual appeal. We also construct a Reliable Feedback 1 Million (RF1M) dataset which comprises over one million generated advertising images annotated by human, which helps to train RFNet to accurately assess the availability of generated images and faithfully reflect the human feedback. Generally speaking, our approach offers a reliable solution for advertising image generation.

- **Summary**: The objective of the panoramic activity recognition task is to identify behaviors at various granularities within crowded and complex environments, encompassing individual actions, social group activities, and global activities. Existing methods generally use either parameter-independent modules to capture task-specific features or parameter-sharing modules to obtain common features across all tasks. However, there is often a strong interrelatedness and complementary effect between tasks of different granularities that previous methods have yet to notice. In this paper, we propose a model called MPT-PAR that considers both the unique characteristics of each task and the synergies between different tasks simultaneously, thereby maximizing the utilization of features across multi-granularity activity recognition. Furthermore, we emphasize the significance of temporal and spatial information by introducing a spatio-temporal relation-enhanced module and a scene representation learning module, which integrate the the spatio-temporal context of action and global scene into the feature map of each granularity. Our method achieved an overall F1 score of 47.5\% on the JRDB-PAR dataset, significantly outperforming all the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models have proven effective for cancer prognosis from Whole Slide Images. However, the original MIL formulation incorrectly assumes the patches of the same image to be independent, leading to a loss of spatial context as information flows through the network. Incorporating contextual knowledge into predictions is particularly important given the inclination for cancerous cells to form clusters and the presence of spatial indicators for tumors. State-of-the-art methods often use attention mechanisms eventually combined with graphs to capture spatial knowledge. In this paper, we take a novel and transversal approach, addressing this issue through the lens of regularization. We propose Context-Aware Regularization for Multiple Instance Learning (CARMIL), a versatile regularization scheme designed to seamlessly integrate spatial knowledge into any MIL model. Additionally, we present a new and generic metric to quantify the Context-Awareness of any MIL model when applied to Whole Slide Images, resolving a previously unexplored gap in the field. The efficacy of our framework is evaluated for two survival analysis tasks on glioblastoma (TCGA GBM) and colon cancer data (TCGA COAD).

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in transformer-based monocular 3D object detection techniques have exhibited exceptional performance in inferring 3D attributes from single 2D images. However, most existing methods rely on resource-intensive transformer architectures, which often lead to significant drops in computational efficiency and performance when handling long sequence data. To address these challenges and advance monocular 3D object detection technology, we propose an innovative network architecture, MonoMM, a Multi-scale \textbf{M}amba-Enhanced network for real-time Monocular 3D object detection. This well-designed architecture primarily includes the following two core modules: Focused Multi-Scale Fusion (FMF) Module, which focuses on effectively preserving and fusing image information from different scales with lower computational resource consumption. By precisely regulating the information flow, the FMF module enhances the model adaptability and robustness to scale variations while maintaining image details. Depth-Aware Feature Enhancement Mamba (DMB) Module: It utilizes the fused features from image characteristics as input and employs a novel adaptive strategy to globally integrate depth information and visual information. This depth fusion strategy not only improves the accuracy of depth estimation but also enhances the model performance under different viewing angles and environmental conditions. Moreover, the modular design of MonoMM provides high flexibility and scalability, facilitating adjustments and optimizations according to specific application needs. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset show that our method outperforms previous monocular methods and achieves real-time detection.



### Focus, Distinguish, and Prompt: Unleashing CLIP for Efficient and Flexible Scene Text Retrieval

- **Summary**: Scene text retrieval aims to find all images containing the query text from an image gallery. Current efforts tend to adopt an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipeline, which requires complicated text detection and/or recognition processes, resulting in inefficient and inflexible retrieval. Different from them, in this work we propose to explore the intrinsic potential of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) for OCR-free scene text retrieval. Through empirical analysis, we observe that the main challenges of CLIP as a text retriever are: 1) limited text perceptual scale, and 2) entangled visual-semantic concepts. To this end, a novel model termed FDP (Focus, Distinguish, and Prompt) is developed. FDP first focuses on scene text via shifting the attention to the text area and probing the hidden text knowledge, and then divides the query text into content word and function word for processing, in which a semantic-aware prompting scheme and a distracted queries assistance module are utilized. Extensive experiments show that FDP significantly enhances the inference speed while achieving better or competitive retrieval accuracy compared to existing methods. Notably, on the IIIT-STR benchmark, FDP surpasses the state-of-the-art model by 4.37% with a 4 times faster speed. Furthermore, additional experiments under phrase-level and attribute-aware scene text retrieval settings validate FDP's particular advantages in handling diverse forms of query text.

- **Summary**: Recent years have seen a tremendous improvement in the quality of video generation and editing approaches. While several techniques focus on editing appearance, few address motion. Current approaches using text, trajectories, or bounding boxes are limited to simple motions, so we specify motions with a single motion reference video instead. We further propose to use a pre-trained image-to-video model rather than a text-to-video model. This approach allows us to preserve the exact appearance and position of a target object or scene and helps disentangle appearance from motion. Our method, called motion-textual inversion, leverages our observation that image-to-video models extract appearance mainly from the (latent) image input, while the text/image embedding injected via cross-attention predominantly controls motion. We thus represent motion using text/image embedding tokens. By operating on an inflated motion-text embedding containing multiple text/image embedding tokens per frame, we achieve a high temporal motion granularity. Once optimized on the motion reference video, this embedding can be applied to various target images to generate videos with semantically similar motions. Our approach does not require spatial alignment between the motion reference video and target image, generalizes across various domains, and can be applied to various tasks such as full-body and face reenactment, as well as controlling the motion of inanimate objects and the camera. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the semantic video motion transfer task, significantly outperforming existing methods in this context.

- **Summary**: Self-similarity techniques are booming in blind super-resolution (SR) due to accurate estimation of the degradation types involved in low-resolution images. However, high-dimensional matrix multiplication within self-similarity computation prohibitively consumes massive computational costs. We find that the high-dimensional attention map is derived from the matrix multiplication between Query and Key, followed by a softmax function. This softmax makes the matrix multiplication between Query and Key inseparable, posing a great challenge in simplifying computational complexity. To address this issue, we first propose a second-order Taylor expansion approximation (STEA) to separate the matrix multiplication of Query and Key, resulting in the complexity reduction from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N)$. Then, we design a multi-scale large field reception (MLFR) to compensate for the performance degradation caused by STEA. Finally, we apply these two core designs to laboratory and real-world scenarios by constructing LabNet and RealNet, respectively. Extensive experimental results tested on five synthetic datasets demonstrate that our LabNet sets a new benchmark in qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Tested on the RealWorld38 dataset, our RealNet achieves superior visual quality over existing methods. Ablation studies further verify the contributions of STEA and MLFR towards both LabNet and RealNet frameworks.

- **Summary**: Long-tailed data is a special type of multi-class imbalanced data with a very large amount of minority/tail classes that have a very significant combined influence. Long-tailed learning aims to build high-performance models on datasets with long-tailed distributions, which can identify all the classes with high accuracy, in particular the minority/tail classes. It is a cutting-edge research direction that has attracted a remarkable amount of research effort in the past few years. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of latest advances in long-tailed visual learning. We first propose a new taxonomy for long-tailed learning, which consists of eight different dimensions, including data balancing, neural architecture, feature enrichment, logits adjustment, loss function, bells and whistles, network optimization, and post hoc processing techniques. Based on our proposed taxonomy, we present a systematic review of long-tailed learning methods, discussing their commonalities and alignable differences. We also analyze the differences between imbalance learning and long-tailed learning approaches. Finally, we discuss prospects and future directions in this field.

- **Summary**: The coexistence of multiple defect categories as well as the substantial class imbalance problem significantly impair the detection of sewer pipeline defects. To solve this problem, a multi-label pipe defect recognition method is proposed based on mask attention guided feature enhancement and label correlation learning. The proposed method can achieve current approximate state-of-the-art classification performance using just 1/16 of the Sewer-ML training dataset and exceeds the current best method by 11.87\% in terms of F2 metric on the full dataset, while also proving the superiority of the model. The major contribution of this study is the development of a more efficient model for identifying and locating multiple defects in sewer pipe images for a more accurate sewer pipeline condition assessment. Moreover, by employing class activation maps, our method can accurately pinpoint multiple defect categories in the image which demonstrates a strong model interpretability.

- **Summary**: Artwork analysis is important and fundamental skill for art appreciation, which could enrich personal aesthetic sensibility and facilitate the critical thinking ability. Understanding artworks is challenging due to its subjective nature, diverse interpretations, and complex visual elements, requiring expertise in art history, cultural background, and aesthetic theory. However, limited by the data collection and model ability, previous works for automatically analyzing artworks mainly focus on classification, retrieval, and other simple tasks, which is far from the goal of AI. To facilitate the research progress, in this paper, we step further to compose comprehensive analysis inspired by the remarkable perception and generation ability of large multimodal models. Specifically, we first propose a task of composing paragraph analysis for artworks, i.e., painting in this paper, only focusing on visual characteristics to formulate more comprehensive understanding of artworks. To support the research on formal analysis, we collect a large dataset PaintingForm, with about 19k painting images and 50k analysis paragraphs. We further introduce a superior large multimodal model for painting analysis composing, dubbed GalleryGPT, which is slightly modified and fine-tuned based on LLaVA architecture leveraging our collected data. We conduct formal analysis generation and zero-shot experiments across several datasets to assess the capacity of our model. The results show remarkable performance improvements comparing with powerful baseline LMMs, demonstrating its superb ability of art analysis and generalization. \textcolor{blue}{The codes and model are available at: https://github.com/steven640pixel/GalleryGPT.

- **Summary**: Modern Machine Learning (ML) has significantly advanced various research fields, but the opaque nature of ML models hinders their adoption in several domains. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this challenge by providing additional information to help users understand the internal decision-making process of ML models. In the field of neuroscience, enriching a ML model for brain decoding with attribution-based XAI techniques means being able to highlight which brain areas correlate with the task at hand, thus offering valuable insights to domain experts. In this paper, we analyze human and Computer Vision (CV) systems in parallel, training and explaining two ML models based respectively on functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and movie frames. We do so by leveraging the "StudyForrest" dataset, which includes functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans of subjects watching the "Forrest Gump" movie, emotion annotations, and eye-tracking data. For human vision the ML task is to link fMRI data with emotional annotations, and the explanations highlight the brain regions strongly correlated with the label. On the other hand, for computer vision, the input data is movie frames, and the explanations are pixel-level heatmaps. We cross-analyzed our results, linking human attention (obtained through eye-tracking) with XAI saliency on CV models and brain region activations. We show how a parallel analysis of human and computer vision can provide useful information for both the neuroscience community (allocation theory) and the ML community (biological plausibility of convolutional models).

- **Summary**: Medical imaging segmentation plays a significant role in the automatic recognition and analysis of lesions. State-of-the-art methods, particularly those utilizing transformers, have been prominently adopted in 3D semantic segmentation due to their superior performance in scalability and generalizability. However, plain vision transformers encounter challenges due to their neglect of local features and their high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we introduce three key contributions: Firstly, we proposed SegStitch, an innovative architecture that integrates transformers with denoising ODE blocks. Instead of taking whole 3D volumes as inputs, we adapt axial patches and customize patch-wise queries to ensure semantic consistency. Additionally, we conducted extensive experiments on the BTCV and ACDC datasets, achieving improvements up to 11.48% and 6.71% respectively in mDSC, compared to state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, our proposed method demonstrates outstanding efficiency, reducing the number of parameters by 36.7% and the number of FLOPS by 10.7% compared to UNETR. This advancement holds promising potential for adapting our method to real-world clinical practice. The code will be available at https://github.com/goblin327/SegStitch

- **Summary**: The exploration of video content via Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models has unveiled a dynamic field of study, emphasizing both the complex challenges and unique opportunities inherent in this area. Despite the growing body of research, the ability of SSL models to detect physical contacts in videos remains largely unexplored, particularly the effectiveness of methods such as downstream supervision with linear probing or full fine-tuning. This work aims to bridge this gap by employing eight different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based video SSL models to identify instances of physical contact within video sequences specifically. The Something-Something v2 (SSv2) and Epic-Kitchen (EK-100) datasets were chosen for evaluating these approaches due to the promising results on UCF101 and HMDB51, coupled with their limited prior assessment on SSv2 and EK-100. Additionally, these datasets feature diverse environments and scenarios, essential for testing the robustness and accuracy of video-based models. This approach not only examines the effectiveness of each model in recognizing physical contacts but also explores the performance in the action recognition downstream task. By doing so, valuable insights into the adaptability of SSL models in interpreting complex, dynamic visual information are contributed.

- **Summary**: Robotic datasets are important for scientific benchmarking and developing algorithms, for example for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Modern robotic datasets feature video data of high resolution and high framerates. Storing and sharing those datasets becomes thus very costly, especially if more than one camera is used for the datasets. It is thus essential to store this video data in a compressed format. This paper investigates the use of modern video encoders for robotic datasets. We provide a software that can replay mp4 videos within ROS 1 and ROS 2 frameworks, supporting the synchronized playback in simulated time. Furthermore, the paper evaluates different encoders and their settings to find optimal configurations in terms of resulting size, quality and encoding time. Through this work we show that it is possible to store and share even highest quality video datasets within reasonable storage constraints.

- **Summary**: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, they suffer from hallucination problems, where models generate plausible yet incorrect answers given the input image-query pair. This hallucination phenomenon is even more severe when querying the image in non-English languages, while existing methods for mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs only consider the English scenarios. In this paper, we make the first attempt to mitigate this important multilingual hallucination in LVLMs. With thorough experiment analysis, we found that multilingual hallucination in LVLMs is a systemic problem that could arise from deficiencies in multilingual capabilities or inadequate multimodal abilities. To this end, we propose a two-stage Multilingual Hallucination Removal (MHR) framework for LVLMs, aiming to improve resistance to hallucination for both high-resource and low-resource languages. Instead of relying on the intricate manual annotations of multilingual resources, we fully leverage the inherent capabilities of the LVLM and propose a novel cross-lingual alignment method, which generates multiple responses for each image-query input and then identifies the hallucination-aware pairs for each language. These data pairs are finally used for direct preference optimization to prompt the LVLMs to favor non-hallucinating responses. Experimental results show that our MHR achieves a substantial reduction in hallucination generation for LVLMs. Notably, on our extended multilingual POPE benchmark, our framework delivers an average increase of 19.0% in accuracy across 13 different languages.

- **Summary**: Despite the remarkable ability of large vision-language models (LVLMs) in image comprehension, these models frequently generate plausible yet factually incorrect responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination.Recently, in large language models (LLMs), augmenting LLMs by retrieving information from external knowledge resources has been proven as a promising solution to mitigate hallucinations.However, the retrieval augmentation in LVLM significantly lags behind the widespread applications of LVLM. Moreover, when transferred to augmenting LVLMs, sometimes the hallucination degree of the model is even exacerbated.Motivated by the research gap and counter-intuitive phenomenon, we introduce a novel framework, the Active Retrieval-Augmented large vision-language model (ARA), specifically designed to address hallucinations by incorporating three critical dimensions: (i) dissecting the retrieval targets based on the inherent hierarchical structures of images. (ii) pinpointing the most effective retrieval methods and filtering out the reliable retrieval results. (iii) timing the retrieval process to coincide with episodes of low certainty, while circumventing unnecessary retrieval during periods of high certainty. To assess the capability of our proposed ARA model in reducing hallucination, we employ three widely used LVLM models (LLaVA-1.5, Qwen-VL, and mPLUG-Owl2) across four benchmarks. Our empirical observations suggest that by utilizing fitting retrieval mechanisms and timing the retrieval judiciously, we can effectively mitigate the hallucination problem. We hope that this study can provide deeper insights into how to adapt the retrieval augmentation to LVLMs for reducing hallucinations with more effective retrieval and minimal retrieval occurrences.

- **Summary**: In recent years, approaches based on radar object detection have made significant progress in autonomous driving systems due to their robustness under adverse weather compared to LiDAR. However, the sparsity of radar point clouds poses challenges in achieving precise object detection, highlighting the importance of effective and comprehensive feature extraction technologies. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a comprehensive feature extraction method for radar point clouds. This study first enhances the capability of detection networks by using a plug-and-play module, GeoSPA. It leverages the Lalonde features to explore local geometric patterns. Additionally, a distributed multi-view attention mechanism, DEMVA, is designed to integrate the shared information across the entire dataset with the global information of each individual frame. By employing the two modules, we present our method, MUFASA, which enhances object detection performance through improved feature extraction. The approach is evaluated on the VoD and TJ4DRaDSet datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness. In particular, we achieve state-of-the-art results among radar-based methods on the VoD dataset with the mAP of 50.24%.

- **Summary**: Automatic estimation of cardiac ultrasound image quality can be beneficial for guiding operators and ensuring the accuracy of clinical measurements. Previous work often fails to distinguish the view correctness of the echocardiogram from the image quality. Additionally, previous studies only provide a global image quality value, which limits their practical utility. In this work, we developed and compared three methods to estimate image quality: 1) classic pixel-based metrics like the generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) on myocardial segments as region of interest and left ventricle lumen as background, obtained using a U-Net segmentation 2) local image coherence derived from a U-Net model that predicts coherence from B-Mode images 3) a deep convolutional network that predicts the quality of each region directly in an end-to-end fashion. We evaluate each method against manual regional image quality annotations by three experienced cardiologists. The results indicate poor performance of the gCNR metric, with Spearman correlation to the annotations of \r{ho} = 0.24. The end-to-end learning model obtains the best result, \r{ho} = 0.69, comparable to the inter-observer correlation, \r{ho} = 0.63. Finally, the coherence-based method, with \r{ho} = 0.58, outperformed the classical metrics and is more generic than the end-to-end approach.

- **Summary**: Point cloud compression is essential to experience volumetric multimedia as it drastically reduces the required streaming data rates. Point attributes, specifically colors, extend the challenge of lossy compression beyond geometric representation to achieving joint reconstruction of texture and geometry. State-of-the-art methods separate geometry and attributes to compress them individually. This comes at a computational cost, requiring an encoder and a decoder for each modality. Additionally, as attribute compression methods require the same geometry for encoding and decoding, the encoder emulates the decoder-side geometry reconstruction as an input step to project and compress the attributes. In this work, we propose to learn joint compression of geometry and attributes using a single, adaptive autoencoder model, embedding both modalities into a unified latent space which is then entropy encoded. Key to the technique is to replace the search for trade-offs between rate, attribute quality and geometry quality, through conditioning the model on the desired qualities of both modalities, bypassing the need for training model ensembles. To differentiate important point cloud regions during encoding or to allow view-dependent compression for user-centered streaming, conditioning is pointwise, which allows for local quality and rate variation. Our evaluation shows comparable performance to state-of-the-art compression methods for geometry and attributes, while reducing complexity compared to related compression methods.



### Harnessing Uncertainty-aware Bounding Boxes for Unsupervised 3D Object Detection

- **Summary**: Unsupervised 3D object detection aims to identify objects of interest from unlabeled raw data, such as LiDAR points. Recent approaches usually adopt pseudo 3D bounding boxes (3D bboxes) from clustering algorithm to initialize the model training, and then iteratively updating both pseudo labels and the trained model. However, pseudo bboxes inevitably contain noises, and such inaccurate annotation accumulates to the final model, compromising the performance. Therefore, in an attempt to mitigate the negative impact of pseudo bboxes, we introduce a new uncertainty-aware framework. In particular, Our method consists of two primary components: uncertainty estimation and uncertainty regularization. (1) In the uncertainty estimation phase, we incorporate an extra auxiliary detection branch alongside the primary detector. The prediction disparity between the primary and auxiliary detectors is leveraged to estimate uncertainty at the box coordinate level, including position, shape, orientation. (2) Based on the assessed uncertainty, we regularize the model training via adaptively adjusting every 3D bboxes coordinates. For pseudo bbox coordinates with high uncertainty, we assign a relatively low loss weight. Experiment verifies that the proposed method is robust against the noisy pseudo bboxes, yielding substantial improvements on nuScenes and Lyft compared to existing techniques, with increases of 6.9% in AP$_{BEV}$ and 2.5% in AP$_{3D}$ on nuScenes, and 2.2% in AP$_{BEV}$ and 1.0% in AP$_{3D}$ on Lyft.

- **Summary**: In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential in real-world applications. They are developing rapidly due to their remarkable ability to comprehend multimodal information and their inherent powerful cognitive and reasoning capabilities. Among MLLMs, vision language models (VLM) stand out for their ability to understand vision information. However, the scaling trend of VLMs under the current mainstream paradigm has not been extensively studied. Whether we can achieve better performance by training even larger models is still unclear. To address this issue, we conducted experiments on the pretraining stage of MLLMs. We conduct our experiment using different encoder sizes and large language model (LLM) sizes. Our findings indicate that merely increasing the size of encoders does not necessarily enhance the performance of VLMs. Moreover, we analyzed the effects of LLM backbone parameter size and data quality on the pretraining outcomes. Additionally, we explored the differences in scaling laws between LLMs and VLMs.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present SynesLM, an unified model which can perform three multimodal language understanding tasks: audio-visual automatic speech recognition(AV-ASR) and visual-aided speech/machine translation(VST/VMT). Unlike previous research that focused on lip motion as visual cues for speech signals, our work explores more general visual information within entire frames, such as objects and actions. Additionally, we use synthetic image data to enhance the correlation between image and speech data. We benchmark SynesLM against the How2 dataset, demonstrating performance on par with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models dedicated to AV-ASR while maintaining our multitasking framework. Remarkably, for zero-shot AV-ASR, SynesLM achieved SOTA performance by lowering the Word Error Rate (WER) from 43.4% to 39.4% on the VisSpeech Dataset. Furthermore, our results in VST and VMT outperform the previous results, improving the BLEU score to 43.5 from 37.2 for VST, and to 54.8 from 54.4 for VMT.

- **Summary**: Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) relies on decoding algorithms such as CNN or Transformer to reconstruct the hyperspectral image (HSI) from its compressed measurement. Although existing CNN and Transformer-based methods have proven effective, CNNs are limited by their inadequate modeling of long-range dependencies, while Transformer ones face high computational costs due to quadratic complexity. Recent Mamba models have demonstrated superior performance over CNN and Transformer-based architectures in some visual tasks, but these models have not fully utilized the local similarities in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Moreover, the long-sequence modeling capability of SSM may offer an advantage in processing the numerous spectral bands for HSI reconstruction, which has not yet been explored. In this paper, we introduce a State Space Model with Across-Scanning and Local Enhancement, named ASLE-SSM, that employs a Spatial-Spectral SSM for global-local balanced context encoding and cross-channel interaction promoting. Specifically, we introduce local scanning in the spatial dimension to balance the global and local receptive fields, and then propose our across-scanning method based on spatial-spectral local cubes to leverage local similarities between adjacent spectral bands and pixels to guide the reconstruction process. These two scanning mechanisms extract the HSI's local features while balancing the global perspective without any additional costs. Experimental results illustrate ASLE-SSM's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods, with an inference speed 2.4 times faster than Transformer-based MST and saving 0.12 (M) of parameters, achieving the lowest computational cost and parameter count.

- **Summary**: Brain tumors are among the deadliest diseases in the world. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is one of the most effective ways to detect brain tumors. Accurate detection of brain tumors based on MRI scans is critical, as it can potentially save many lives and facilitate better decision-making at the early stages of the disease. Within our paper, four different types of MRI-based images have been collected from the database: glioma tumor, no tumor, pituitary tumor, and meningioma tumor. Our study focuses on making predictions for brain tumor classification. Five models, including four pre-trained models (MobileNet, EfficientNet-B0, ResNet-18, and VGG16) and one new model, MobileNet-BT, have been proposed for this study.

- **Summary**: Large and well-annotated datasets are essential for advancing deep learning applications, however often costly or impossible to obtain by a single entity. In many areas, including the medical domain, approaches relying on data sharing have become critical to address those challenges. While effective in increasing dataset size and diversity, data sharing raises significant privacy concerns. Commonly employed anonymization methods based on the k-anonymity paradigm often fail to preserve data diversity, affecting model robustness. This work introduces a novel approach using Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) trained on feature vectors extracted from large pre-trained vision foundation models. Foundation models effectively detect and represent complex patterns across diverse domains, allowing the CVAE to faithfully capture the embedding space of a given data distribution to generate (sample) a diverse, privacy-respecting, and potentially unbounded set of synthetic feature vectors. Our method notably outperforms traditional approaches in both medical and natural image domains, exhibiting greater dataset diversity and higher robustness against perturbations while preserving sample privacy. These results underscore the potential of generative models to significantly impact deep learning applications in data-scarce and privacy-sensitive environments.

- **Summary**: This study investigates the impact of self-supervised pretraining of 3D semantic segmentation models on a large-scale, domain-specific dataset. We introduce BRAINS-45K, a dataset of 44,756 brain MRI volumes from public sources, the largest public dataset available, and revisit a number of design choices for pretraining modern segmentation architectures by simplifying and optimizing state-of-the-art methods, and combining them with a novel augmentation strategy. The resulting AMAES framework is based on masked-image-modeling and intensity-based augmentation reversal and balances memory usage, runtime, and finetuning performance. Using the popular U-Net and the recent MedNeXt architecture as backbones, we evaluate the effect of pretraining on three challenging downstream tasks, covering single-sequence, low-resource settings, and out-of-domain generalization. The results highlight that pretraining on the proposed dataset with AMAES significantly improves segmentation performance in the majority of evaluated cases, and that it is beneficial to pretrain the model with augmentations, despite pretraing on a large-scale dataset. Code and model checkpoints for reproducing results, as well as the BRAINS-45K dataset are available at \url{https://github.com/asbjrnmunk/amaes}.

- **Summary**: Facial action units (AUs), as defined in the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), have received significant research interest owing to their diverse range of applications in facial state analysis. Current mainstream FAU recognition models have a notable limitation, i.e., focusing only on the accuracy of AU recognition and overlooking explanations of corresponding AU states. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Vision-Language joint learning network for explainable FAU recognition (termed VL-FAU), which aims to reinforce AU representation capability and language interpretability through the integration of joint multimodal tasks. Specifically, VL-FAU brings together language models to generate fine-grained local muscle descriptions and distinguishable global face description when optimising FAU recognition. Through this, the global facial representation and its local AU representations will achieve higher distinguishability among different AUs and different subjects. In addition, multi-level AU representation learning is utilised to improve AU individual attention-aware representation capabilities based on multi-scale combined facial stem feature. Extensive experiments on DISFA and BP4D AU datasets show that the proposed approach achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods on most of the metrics. In addition, compared with mainstream FAU recognition methods, VL-FAU can provide local- and global-level interpretability language descriptions with the AUs' predictions.

- **Summary**: We present SF3D, a novel method for rapid and high-quality textured object mesh reconstruction from a single image in just 0.5 seconds. Unlike most existing approaches, SF3D is explicitly trained for mesh generation, incorporating a fast UV unwrapping technique that enables swift texture generation rather than relying on vertex colors. The method also learns to predict material parameters and normal maps to enhance the visual quality of the reconstructed 3D meshes. Furthermore, SF3D integrates a delighting step to effectively remove low-frequency illumination effects, ensuring that the reconstructed meshes can be easily used in novel illumination conditions. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SF3D over the existing techniques. Project page: https://stable-fast-3d.github.io

- **Summary**: Feedback is essential for learning a new skill or improving one's current skill-level. However, current methods for skill-assessment from video only provide scores or compare demonstrations, leaving the burden of knowing what to do differently on the user. We introduce a novel method to generate actionable feedback from video of a person doing a physical activity, such as basketball or soccer. Our method takes a video demonstration and its accompanying 3D body pose and generates (1) free-form expert commentary describing what the person is doing well and what they could improve, and (2) a visual expert demonstration that incorporates the required corrections. We show how to leverage Ego-Exo4D's videos of skilled activity and expert commentary together with a strong language model to create a weakly-supervised training dataset for this task, and we devise a multimodal video-language model to infer coaching feedback. Our method is able to reason across multi-modal input combinations to output full-spectrum, actionable coaching -- expert commentary, expert video retrieval, and the first-of-its-kind expert pose generation -- outperforming strong vision-language models on both established metrics and human preference studies.

- **Summary**: Pre-training and transfer learning are an important building block of current computer vision systems. While pre-training is usually performed on large real-world image datasets, in this paper we ask whether this is truly necessary. To this end, we search for a minimal, purely synthetic pre-training dataset that allows us to achieve performance similar to the 1 million images of ImageNet-1k. We construct such a dataset from a single fractal with perturbations. With this, we contribute three main findings. (i) We show that pre-training is effective even with minimal synthetic images, with performance on par with large-scale pre-training datasets like ImageNet-1k for full fine-tuning. (ii) We investigate the single parameter with which we construct artificial categories for our dataset. We find that while the shape differences can be indistinguishable to humans, they are crucial for obtaining strong performances. (iii) Finally, we investigate the minimal requirements for successful pre-training. Surprisingly, we find that a substantial reduction of synthetic images from 1k to 1 can even lead to an increase in pre-training performance, a motivation to further investigate ''scaling backwards''. Finally, we extend our method from synthetic images to real images to see if a single real image can show similar pre-training effect through shape augmentation. We find that the use of grayscale images and affine transformations allows even real images to ''scale backwards''.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel joint neural networks approach to address the challenging one-shot object recognition and detection tasks. Inspired by Siamese neural networks and state-of-art multi-box detection approaches, the joint neural networks are able to perform object recognition and detection for categories that remain unseen during the training process. Following the one-shot object recognition/detection constraints, the training and testing datasets do not contain overlapped classes, in other words, all the test classes remain unseen during training. The joint networks architecture is able to effectively compare pairs of images via stacked convolutional layers of the query and target inputs, recognising patterns of the same input query category without relying on previous training around this category. The proposed approach achieves 61.41% accuracy for one-shot object recognition on the MiniImageNet dataset and 47.1% mAP for one-shot object detection when trained on the COCO dataset and tested using the Pascal VOC dataset.

- **Summary**: Delineating lesions and anatomical structure is important for image-guided interventions. Point-supervised medical image segmentation (PSS) has great potential to alleviate costly expert delineation labeling. However, due to the lack of precise size and boundary guidance, the effectiveness of PSS often falls short of expectations. Although recent vision foundational models, such as the medical segment anything model (MedSAM), have made significant advancements in bounding-box-prompted segmentation, it is not straightforward to utilize point annotation, and is prone to semantic ambiguity. In this preliminary study, we introduce an iterative framework to facilitate semantic-aware point-supervised MedSAM. Specifically, the semantic box-prompt generator (SBPG) module has the capacity to convert the point input into potential pseudo bounding box suggestions, which are explicitly refined by the prototype-based semantic similarity. This is then succeeded by a prompt-guided spatial refinement (PGSR) module that harnesses the exceptional generalizability of MedSAM to infer the segmentation mask, which also updates the box proposal seed in SBPG. Performance can be progressively improved with adequate iterations. We conducted an evaluation on BraTS2018 for the segmentation of whole brain tumors and demonstrated its superior performance compared to traditional PSS methods and on par with box-supervised methods.

- **Summary**: Training of semantic segmentation models for material analysis requires micrographs and their corresponding masks. It is quite unlikely that perfect masks will be drawn, especially at the edges of objects, and sometimes the amount of data that can be obtained is small, since only a few samples are available. These aspects make it very problematic to train a robust model. We demonstrate a workflow for the improvement of semantic segmentation models of micrographs through the generation of synthetic microstructural images in conjunction with masks. The workflow only requires joining a few micrographs with their respective masks to create the input for a Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder model that includes an embedding space, which is trained such that a generative model (PixelCNN) learns the distribution of each input, transformed into discrete codes, and can be used to sample new codes. The latter will eventually be decoded by VQ-VAE to generate images alongside corresponding masks for semantic segmentation. To evaluate the synthetic data, we have trained U-Net models with different amounts of these synthetic data in conjunction with real data. These models were then evaluated using non-synthetic images only. Additionally, we introduce a customized metric derived from the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). The proposed metric prevents a few falsely predicted pixels from greatly reducing the value of the mIoU. We have achieved a reduction in sample preparation and acquisition times, as well as the efforts, needed for image processing and labeling tasks, are less when it comes to training semantic segmentation model. The approach could be generalized to various types of image data such that it serves as a user-friendly solution for training models with a small number of real images.

- **Summary**: The focus of this paper is 3D motion editing. Given a 3D human motion and a textual description of the desired modification, our goal is to generate an edited motion as described by the text. The challenges include the lack of training data and the design of a model that faithfully edits the source motion. In this paper, we address both these challenges. We build a methodology to semi-automatically collect a dataset of triplets in the form of (i) a source motion, (ii) a target motion, and (iii) an edit text, and create the new MotionFix dataset. Having access to such data allows us to train a conditional diffusion model, TMED, that takes both the source motion and the edit text as input. We further build various baselines trained only on text-motion pairs datasets, and show superior performance of our model trained on triplets. We introduce new retrieval-based metrics for motion editing and establish a new benchmark on the evaluation set of MotionFix. Our results are encouraging, paving the way for further research on finegrained motion generation. Code and models will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: We present Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), a foundation model towards solving promptable visual segmentation in images and videos. We build a data engine, which improves model and data via user interaction, to collect the largest video segmentation dataset to date. Our model is a simple transformer architecture with streaming memory for real-time video processing. SAM 2 trained on our data provides strong performance across a wide range of tasks. In video segmentation, we observe better accuracy, using 3x fewer interactions than prior approaches. In image segmentation, our model is more accurate and 6x faster than the Segment Anything Model (SAM). We believe that our data, model, and insights will serve as a significant milestone for video segmentation and related perception tasks. We are releasing a version of our model, the dataset and an interactive demo.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have opened the path to a wide range of text-based image editing frameworks. However, these typically build on the multi-step nature of the diffusion backwards process, and adapting them to distilled, fast-sampling methods has proven surprisingly challenging. Here, we focus on a popular line of text-based editing frameworks - the ``edit-friendly'' DDPM-noise inversion approach. We analyze its application to fast sampling methods and categorize its failures into two classes: the appearance of visual artifacts, and insufficient editing strength. We trace the artifacts to mismatched noise statistics between inverted noises and the expected noise schedule, and suggest a shifted noise schedule which corrects for this offset. To increase editing strength, we propose a pseudo-guidance approach that efficiently increases the magnitude of edits without introducing new artifacts. All in all, our method enables text-based image editing with as few as three diffusion steps, while providing novel insights into the mechanisms behind popular text-based editing approaches.

- **Summary**: Foundation models are rapidly being developed for computational pathology applications. However, it remains an open question which factors are most important for downstream performance with data scale and diversity, model size, and training algorithm all playing a role. In this work, we present the result of scaling both data and model size, surpassing previous studies in both dimensions, and introduce two new models: Virchow 2, a 632M parameter vision transformer, and Virchow 2G, a 1.85B parameter vision transformer, each trained with 3.1M histopathology whole slide images. To support this scale, we propose domain-inspired adaptations to the DINOv2 training algorithm, which is quickly becoming the default method in self-supervised learning for computational pathology. We achieve state of the art performance on twelve tile-level tasks, as compared to the top performing competing models. Our results suggest that data diversity and domain-specific training can outperform models that only scale in the number of parameters, but, on average, performance benefits from domain-tailoring, data scale, and model scale.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained vision-language models, e.g. CLIP, have been increasingly used to address the challenging Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) task, benefiting from their well-aligned vision-text embedding space. Typical solutions involve either freezing CLIP during training to unilaterally maintain its zero-shot capability, or fine-tuning CLIP vision encoder to achieve perceptual sensitivity to local regions. However, few of them incorporate vision-text collaborative optimization. Based on this, we propose the Content-Dependent Transfer to adaptively enhance each text embedding by interacting with the input image, which presents a parameter-efficient way to optimize the text representation. Besides, we additionally introduce a Representation Compensation strategy, reviewing the original CLIP-V representation as compensation to maintain the zero-shot capability of CLIP. In this way, the vision and text representation of CLIP are optimized collaboratively, enhancing the alignment of the vision-text feature space. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to establish the collaborative vision-text optimizing mechanism within the OVS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves superior performance on popular OVS benchmarks. In open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches by +0.5, +2.3, +3.4, +0.4 and +1.1 mIoU, respectively on A-847, A-150, PC-459, PC-59 and PAS-20. Furthermore, in a panoptic setting on ADE20K, we achieve the performance of 27.1 PQ, 73.5 SQ, and 32.9 RQ. Code will be available at https://github.com/jiaosiyu1999/MAFT-Plus.git .

- **Summary**: Modern day studies show a high degree of correlation between high yielding crop varieties and plants with upright leaf angles. It is observed that plants with upright leaf angles intercept more light than those without upright leaf angles, leading to a higher rate of photosynthesis. Plant scientists and breeders benefit from tools that can directly measure plant parameters in the field i.e. on-site phenotyping. The estimation of leaf angles by manual means in a field setting is tedious and cumbersome. We mitigate the tedium using a combination of the Mask R-CNN instance segmentation neural network, and Line Segment Transformer (LETR), a vision transformer. The proposed Computer Vision (CV) pipeline is applied on two image datasets, Summer 2015-Ames ULA and Summer 2015- Ames MLA, with a combined total of 1,827 plant images collected in the field using FieldBook, an Android application aimed at on-site phenotyping. The leaf angles estimated by the proposed pipeline on the image datasets are compared to two independent manual measurements using ImageJ, a Java-based image processing program developed at the National Institutes of Health and the Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation. The results, when compared for similarity using the Cosine Similarity measure, exhibit 0.98 similarity scores on both independent measurements of Summer 2015-Ames ULA and Summer 2015-Ames MLA image datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed pipeline for on-site measurement of leaf angles.

- **Summary**: Multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly being implemented in real-world environments, necessitating their ability to interpret 3D spaces and comprehend temporal dynamics. Despite their potential, current top models within our community still fall short in adequately understanding spatial and temporal dimensions. We introduce Coarse Correspondence, a simple, training-free, effective, and general-purpose visual prompting method to elicit 3D and temporal understanding in multimodal LLMs. Our method uses a lightweight tracking model to find object correspondences between frames in a video or between sets of image viewpoints. It selects the most frequent object instances and visualizes them with markers with unique IDs in the image. With this simple approach, we achieve state-of-the-art results on 3D understanding benchmarks including ScanQA (+20.5\%) and a subset of OpenEQA (+9.7\%), and on long-form video benchmarks such as EgoSchema (+6.0\%). We also curate a small diagnostic dataset to evaluate whether MLLMs can reason about space from a described viewpoint other than the camera viewpoint. Again, Coarse Correspondence improves spatial perspective-taking abilities but we highlight that MLLMs struggle with this task. Together, we demonstrate that our simple prompting method can significantly aid downstream tasks that require 3D or temporal reasoning.

- **Summary**: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has gained significant attention because of its ability to segment a variety of objects in images given a prompt. The recently developed SAM 2 has extended this ability to video inputs. This opens an opportunity to apply SAM to 3D images, one of the fundamental tasks in the medical imaging field. In this paper, we provide an extensive evaluation of SAM 2's ability to segment both 2D and 3D medical images. We collect 18 medical imaging datasets, including common 3D modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) as well as 2D modalities such as X-ray and ultrasound. We consider two evaluation pipelines of SAM 2: (1) multi-frame 3D segmentation, where prompts are provided to one or multiple slice(s) selected from the volume, and (2) single-frame 2D segmentation, where prompts are provided to each slice. The former is only applicable to 3D modalities, while the latter applies to both 2D and 3D modalities. We learn that SAM 2 exhibits similar performance as SAM under single-frame 2D segmentation, and has variable performance under multi-frame 3D segmentation depending on the choices of slices to annotate, the direction of the propagation, the predictions utilized during the propagation, etc.

- **Summary**: Recent video masked autoencoder (MAE) works have designed improved masking algorithms focused on saliency. These works leverage visual cues such as motion to mask the most salient regions. However, the robustness of such visual cues depends on how often input videos match underlying assumptions. On the other hand, natural language description is an information dense representation of video that implicitly captures saliency without requiring modality-specific assumptions, and has not been explored yet for video MAE. To this end, we introduce a novel text-guided masking algorithm (TGM) that masks the video regions with highest correspondence to paired captions. Without leveraging any explicit visual cues for saliency, our TGM is competitive with state-of-the-art masking algorithms such as motion-guided masking. To further benefit from the semantics of natural language for masked reconstruction, we next introduce a unified framework for joint MAE and masked video-text contrastive learning. We show that across existing masking algorithms, unifying MAE and masked video-text contrastive learning improves downstream performance compared to pure MAE on a variety of video recognition tasks, especially for linear probe. Within this unified framework, our TGM achieves the best relative performance on five action recognition and one egocentric datasets, highlighting the complementary nature of natural language for masked video modeling.

- **Summary**: Conditional diffusion models have shown remarkable success in visual content generation, producing high-quality samples across various domains, largely due to classifier-free guidance (CFG). Recent attempts to extend guidance to unconditional models have relied on heuristic techniques, resulting in suboptimal generation quality and unintended effects. In this work, we propose Smoothed Energy Guidance (SEG), a novel training- and condition-free approach that leverages the energy-based perspective of the self-attention mechanism to enhance image generation. By defining the energy of self-attention, we introduce a method to reduce the curvature of the energy landscape of attention and use the output as the unconditional prediction. Practically, we control the curvature of the energy landscape by adjusting the Gaussian kernel parameter while keeping the guidance scale parameter fixed. Additionally, we present a query blurring method that is equivalent to blurring the entire attention weights without incurring quadratic complexity in the number of tokens. In our experiments, SEG achieves a Pareto improvement in both quality and the reduction of side effects. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/SusungHong/SEG-SDXL}.

- **Summary**: Audio-driven 3D facial animation aims to map input audio to realistic facial motion. Despite significant progress, limitations arise from inconsistent 3D annotations, restricting previous models to training on specific annotations and thereby constraining the training scale. In this work, we present UniTalker, a unified model featuring a multi-head architecture designed to effectively leverage datasets with varied annotations. To enhance training stability and ensure consistency among multi-head outputs, we employ three training strategies, namely, PCA, model warm-up, and pivot identity embedding. To expand the training scale and diversity, we assemble A2F-Bench, comprising five publicly available datasets and three newly curated datasets. These datasets contain a wide range of audio domains, covering multilingual speech voices and songs, thereby scaling the training data from commonly employed datasets, typically less than 1 hour, to 18.5 hours. With a single trained UniTalker model, we achieve substantial lip vertex error reductions of 9.2% for BIWI dataset and 13.7% for Vocaset. Additionally, the pre-trained UniTalker exhibits promise as the foundation model for audio-driven facial animation tasks. Fine-tuning the pre-trained UniTalker on seen datasets further enhances performance on each dataset, with an average error reduction of 6.3% on A2F-Bench. Moreover, fine-tuning UniTalker on an unseen dataset with only half the data surpasses prior state-of-the-art models trained on the full dataset.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: MM-Vet, with open-ended vision-language questions targeting at evaluating integrated capabilities, has become one of the most popular benchmarks for large multimodal model evaluation. MM-Vet assesses six core vision-language (VL) capabilities: recognition, knowledge, spatial awareness, language generation, OCR, and math. However, its question format is restricted to single image-text pairs, lacking the interleaved image and text sequences prevalent in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce MM-Vet v2, which includes a new VL capability called "image-text sequence understanding", evaluating models' ability to process VL sequences. Furthermore, we maintain the high quality of evaluation samples while further expanding the evaluation set size. Using MM-Vet v2 to benchmark large multimodal models, we found that Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the best model with a score of 71.8, slightly outperforming GPT-4o which scored 71.0. Among open-weight models, InternVL2-Llama3-76B leads with a score of 68.4.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models are promising for joint trajectory prediction and controllable generation in autonomous driving, but they face challenges of inefficient inference steps and high computational demands. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Optimal Gaussian Diffusion (OGD) and Estimated Clean Manifold (ECM) Guidance. OGD optimizes the prior distribution for a small diffusion time $T$ and starts the reverse diffusion process from it. ECM directly injects guidance gradients to the estimated clean manifold, eliminating extensive gradient backpropagation throughout the network. Our methodology streamlines the generative process, enabling practical applications with reduced computational overhead. Experimental validation on the large-scale Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates our approach's superior performance, offering a viable solution for computationally efficient, high-quality joint trajectory prediction and controllable generation for autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce Medical SAM 2 (MedSAM-2), an advanced segmentation model that utilizes the SAM 2 framework to address both 2D and 3D medical image segmentation tasks. By adopting the philosophy of taking medical images as videos, MedSAM-2 not only applies to 3D medical images but also unlocks new One-prompt Segmentation capability. That allows users to provide a prompt for just one or a specific image targeting an object, after which the model can autonomously segment the same type of object in all subsequent images, regardless of temporal relationships between the images. We evaluated MedSAM-2 across a variety of medical imaging modalities, including abdominal organs, optic discs, brain tumors, thyroid nodules, and skin lesions, comparing it against state-of-the-art models in both traditional and interactive segmentation settings. Our findings show that MedSAM-2 not only surpasses existing models in performance but also exhibits superior generalization across a range of medical image segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common musculoskeletal disorder that significantly affects the mobility of older adults. In the medical domain, images containing temporal data are frequently utilized to study temporal dynamics and statistically monitor disease progression. While deep learning-based generative models for natural images have been widely researched, there are comparatively few methods available for synthesizing temporal knee X-rays. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-learning model designed to synthesize intermediate X-ray images between a specific patient's healthy knee and severe KOA stages. During the testing phase, based on a healthy knee X-ray, the proposed model can produce a continuous and effective sequence of KOA X-ray images with varying degrees of severity. Specifically, we introduce a Diffusion-based Morphing Model by modifying the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. Our approach integrates diffusion and morphing modules, enabling the model to capture spatial morphing details between source and target knee X-ray images and synthesize intermediate frames along a geodesic path. A hybrid loss consisting of diffusion loss, morphing loss, and supervision loss was employed. We demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves the highest temporal frame synthesis performance, effectively augmenting data for classification models and simulating the progression of KOA.

- **Summary**: This paper explores a novel paradigm in low-bit (i.e. 4-bits or lower) quantization, differing from existing state-of-the-art methods, by framing optimal quantization as an architecture search problem within convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). Our framework, dubbed \textbf{CoRa} (Optimal Quantization Residual \textbf{Co}nvolutional Operator Low-\textbf{Ra}nk Adaptation), is motivated by two key aspects. Firstly, quantization residual knowledge, i.e. the lost information between floating-point weights and quantized weights, has long been neglected by the research community. Reclaiming the critical residual knowledge, with an infinitesimal extra parameter cost, can reverse performance degradation without training. Secondly, state-of-the-art quantization frameworks search for optimal quantized weights to address the performance degradation. Yet, the vast search spaces in weight optimization pose a challenge for the efficient optimization in large models. For example, state-of-the-art BRECQ necessitates $2 \times 10^4$ iterations to quantize models. Fundamentally differing from existing methods, \textbf{CoRa} searches for the optimal architectures of low-rank adapters, reclaiming critical quantization residual knowledge, within the search spaces smaller compared to the weight spaces, by many orders of magnitude. The low-rank adapters approximate the quantization residual weights, discarded in previous methods. We evaluate our approach over multiple pre-trained ConvNets on ImageNet. \textbf{CoRa} achieves comparable performance against both state-of-the-art quantization-aware training and post-training quantization baselines, in $4$-bit and $3$-bit quantization, by using less than $250$ iterations on a small calibration set with $1600$ images. Thus, \textbf{CoRa} establishes a new state-of-the-art in terms of the optimization efficiency in low-bit quantization.

- **Summary**: Equitable urban transportation applications require high-fidelity digital representations of the built environment: not just streets and sidewalks, but bike lanes, marked and unmarked crossings, curb ramps and cuts, obstructions, traffic signals, signage, street markings, potholes, and more. Direct inspections and manual annotations are prohibitively expensive at scale. Conventional machine learning methods require substantial annotated training data for adequate performance. In this paper, we consider vision language models as a mechanism for annotating diverse urban features from satellite images, reducing the dependence on human annotation to produce large training sets. While these models have achieved impressive results in describing common objects in images captured from a human perspective, their training sets are less likely to include strong signals for esoteric features in the built environment, and their performance in these settings is therefore unclear. We demonstrate proof-of-concept combining a state-of-the-art vision language model and variants of a prompting strategy that asks the model to consider segmented elements independently of the original image. Experiments on two urban features -- stop lines and raised tables -- show that while direct zero-shot prompting correctly annotates nearly zero images, the pre-segmentation strategies can annotate images with near 40% intersection-over-union accuracy. We describe how these results inform a new research agenda in automatic annotation of the built environment to improve equity, accessibility, and safety at broad scale and in diverse environments.

- **Summary**: The progression of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) significantly correlates with higher patient mortality rates. Early detection of IPF progression is critical for initiating timely treatment, which can effectively slow down the advancement of the disease. However, the current clinical criteria define disease progression requiring two CT scans with a one-year interval, presenting a dilemma: a disease progression is identified only after the disease has already progressed. To this end, in this paper, we develop a novel diffusion model to accurately predict the progression of IPF by generating patient's follow-up CT scan from the initial CT scan. Specifically, from the clinical prior knowledge, we tailor improvements to the traditional diffusion model and propose a Clinically-Informed Residual Diffusion model, called CIResDiff. The key innovations of CIResDiff include 1) performing the target region pre-registration to align the lung regions of two CT scans at different time points for reducing the generation difficulty, 2) adopting the residual diffusion instead of traditional diffusion to enable the model focus more on differences (i.e., lesions) between the two CT scans rather than the largely identical anatomical content, and 3) designing the clinically-informed process based on CLIP technology to integrate lung function information which is highly relevant to diagnosis into the reverse process for assisting generation. Extensive experiments on clinical data demonstrate that our approach can outperform state-of-the-art methods and effectively predict the progression of IPF.

- **Summary**: Ischemic stroke is a severe condition caused by the blockage of brain blood vessels, and can lead to the death of brain tissue due to oxygen deprivation. Thrombectomy has become a common treatment choice for ischemic stroke due to its immediate effectiveness. But, it carries the risk of postoperative cerebral hemorrhage. Clinically, multiple CT scans within 0-72 hours post-surgery are used to monitor for hemorrhage. However, this approach exposes radiation dose to patients, and may delay the detection of cerebral hemorrhage. To address this dilemma, we propose a novel prediction framework for measuring postoperative cerebral hemorrhage using only the patient's initial CT scan. Specifically, we introduce a dual-task mutual learning framework to takes the initial CT scan as input and simultaneously estimates both the follow-up CT scan and prognostic label to predict the occurrence of postoperative cerebral hemorrhage. Our proposed framework incorporates two attention mechanisms, i.e., self-attention and interactive attention. Specifically, the self-attention mechanism allows the model to focus more on high-density areas in the image, which are critical for diagnosis (i.e., potential hemorrhage areas). The interactive attention mechanism further models the dependencies between the interrelated generation and classification tasks, enabling both tasks to perform better than the case when conducted individually. Validated on clinical data, our method can generate follow-up CT scans better than state-of-the-art methods, and achieves an accuracy of 86.37% in predicting follow-up prognostic labels. Thus, our work thus contributes to the timely screening of post-thrombectomy cerebral hemorrhage, and could significantly reform the clinical process of thrombectomy and other similar operations related to stroke.

- **Summary**: We present a novel data-driven simulation environment for modeling traffic in metropolitan street intersections. Using real-world tracking data collected over an extended period of time, we train trajectory forecasting models to learn agent interactions and environmental constraints that are difficult to capture conventionally. Trajectories of new agents are first coarsely generated by sampling from the spatial and temporal generative distributions, then refined using state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting models. The simulation can run either autonomously, or under explicit human control conditioned on the generative distributions. We present the experiments for a variety of model configurations. Under an iterative prediction scheme, the way-point-supervised TrajNet++ model obtained 0.36 Final Displacement Error (FDE) in 20 FPS on an NVIDIA A100 GPU.

- **Summary**: Eye gaze contains rich information about human attention and cognitive processes. This capability makes the underlying technology, known as gaze tracking, a critical enabler for many ubiquitous applications and has triggered the development of easy-to-use gaze estimation services. Indeed, by utilizing the ubiquitous cameras on tablets and smartphones, users can readily access many gaze estimation services. In using these services, users must provide their full-face images to the gaze estimator, which is often a black box. This poses significant privacy threats to the users, especially when a malicious service provider gathers a large collection of face images to classify sensitive user attributes. In this work, we present PrivateGaze, the first approach that can effectively preserve users' privacy in black-box gaze tracking services without compromising gaze estimation performance. Specifically, we proposed a novel framework to train a privacy preserver that converts full-face images into obfuscated counterparts, which are effective for gaze estimation while containing no privacy information. Evaluation on four datasets shows that the obfuscated image can protect users' private information, such as identity and gender, against unauthorized attribute classification. Meanwhile, when used directly by the black-box gaze estimator as inputs, the obfuscated images lead to comparable tracking performance to the conventional, unprotected full-face images.
