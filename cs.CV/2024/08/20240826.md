- **Summary**: Dynamic scene reconstruction has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its capabilities in high-quality and real-time rendering. Among various methodologies, constructing a 4D spatial-temporal representation, such as 4D-GS, has gained popularity for its high-quality rendered images. However, these methods often produce suboptimal surfaces, as the discrete 3D Gaussian point clouds fail to align with the object's surface precisely. To address this problem, we propose DynaSurfGS to achieve both photorealistic rendering and high-fidelity surface reconstruction of dynamic scenarios. Specifically, the DynaSurfGS framework first incorporates Gaussian features from 4D neural voxels with the planar-based Gaussian Splatting to facilitate precise surface reconstruction. It leverages normal regularization to enforce the smoothness of the surface of dynamic objects. It also incorporates the as-rigid-as-possible (ARAP) constraint to maintain the approximate rigidity of local neighborhoods of 3D Gaussians between timesteps and ensure that adjacent 3D Gaussians remain closely aligned throughout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaSurfGS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both high-fidelity surface reconstruction and photorealistic rendering.

- **Summary**: Histological Tertiary Lymphoid Structures (TLSs) are increasingly recognized for their correlation with the efficacy of immunotherapy in various solid tumors. Traditionally, the identification and characterization of TLSs rely on immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining techniques, utilizing markers such as CD20 for B cells. Despite the specificity of IHC, Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) staining offers a more accessible and cost-effective choice. Capitalizing on the prevalence of H&E staining slides, we introduce a novel Mask-Guided Adversarial Transfer Learning method designed for virtual pathological staining. This method adeptly captures the nuanced color variations across diverse tissue types under various staining conditions, such as nucleus, red blood cells, positive reaction regions, without explicit label information, and adeptly synthesizes realistic IHC-like virtual staining patches, even replicating the positive reaction. Further, we propose the Virtual IHC Pathology Analysis Network (VIPA-Net), an integrated framework encompassing a Mask-Guided Transfer Module and an H&E-Based Virtual Staining TLS Detection Module. VIPA-Net synergistically harnesses both H\&E staining slides and the synthesized virtual IHC patches to enhance the detection of TLSs within H&E Whole Slide Images (WSIs). We evaluate the network with a comprehensive dataset comprising 1019 annotated slides from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Experimental results compellingly illustrate that the VIPA-Net substantially elevates TLS detection accuracy, effectively circumventing the need for actual CD20 staining across the public dataset.

- **Summary**: With the prevalence of large-scale pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, soft-prompt tuning has become a popular method for adapting these models to various downstream tasks. However, few works delve into the inherent properties of learnable soft-prompt vectors, specifically the impact of their norms to the performance of VLMs. This motivates us to pose an unexplored research question: ``Do we need to normalize the soft prompts in VLMs?'' To fill this research gap, we first uncover a phenomenon, called the \textbf{Low-Norm Effect} by performing extensive corruption experiments, suggesting that reducing the norms of certain learned prompts occasionally enhances the performance of VLMs, while increasing them often degrades it. To harness this effect, we propose a novel method named \textbf{N}ormalizing th\textbf{e} soft-pro\textbf{m}pt v\textbf{e}ctors of vi\textbf{si}on-language model\textbf{s} (\textbf{Nemesis}) to normalize soft-prompt vectors in VLMs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to systematically investigate the role of norms of soft-prompt vector in VLMs, offering valuable insights for future research in soft-prompt tuning.

- **Summary**: Multimodal image fusion and segmentation enhance scene understanding in autonomous driving by integrating data from various sensors. However, current models struggle to efficiently segment densely packed elements in such scenes, due to the absence of comprehensive fusion features that can guide mid-process fine-tuning and focus attention on relevant areas. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has emerged as a transformative segmentation method. It provides more effective prompts through its flexible prompt encoder, compared to transformers lacking fine-tuned control. Nevertheless, SAM has not been extensively studied in the domain of multimodal fusion for natural images. In this paper, we introduce SAM into multimodal image segmentation for the first time, proposing a novel framework that combines Latent Space Token Generation (LSTG) and Fusion Mask Prompting (FMP) modules to enhance SAM's multimodal fusion and segmentation capabilities. Specifically, we first obtain latent space features of the two modalities through vector quantization and embed them into a cross-attention-based inter-domain fusion module to establish long-range dependencies between modalities. Then, we use these comprehensive fusion features as prompts to guide precise pixel-level segmentation. Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms SAM and SAM2 in multimodal autonomous driving scenarios, achieving at least 3.9$\%$ higher segmentation mIoU than the state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Radiation therapy is the mainstay treatment for cervical cancer, and its ultimate goal is to ensure the planning target volume (PTV) reaches the prescribed dose while reducing dose deposition of organs-at-risk (OARs) as much as possible. To achieve these clinical requirements, the medical physicist needs to manually tweak the radiotherapy plan repeatedly in a trial-anderror manner until finding the optimal one in the clinic. However, such trial-and-error processes are quite time-consuming, and the quality of plans highly depends on the experience of the medical physicist. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Attentionbased Residual Adversarial Network with deep supervision, namely ARANet, to automatically predict the 3D dose distribution of cervical cancer. Specifically, given the computer tomography (CT) images and their corresponding segmentation masks of PTV and OARs, ARANet employs a prediction network to generate the dose maps. We also utilize a multi-scale residual attention module and deep supervision mechanism to enforce the prediction network to extract more valuable dose features while suppressing irrelevant information. Our proposed method is validated on an in-house dataset including 54 cervical cancer patients, and experimental results have demonstrated its obvious superiority compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable success in various machine learning tasks. How to design efficient test-time adaptation methods for transformer models becomes an important research task. In this work, motivated by the dual-subband wavelet lifting scheme developed in multi-scale signal processing which is able to efficiently separate the input signals into principal components and noise components, we introduce a dual-path token lifting for domain shift correction in test time adaptation. Specifically, we introduce an extra token, referred to as \textit{domain shift token}, at each layer of the transformer network. We then perform dual-path lifting with interleaved token prediction and update between the path of domain shift tokens and the path of class tokens at all network layers. The prediction and update networks are learned in an adversarial manner. Specifically, the task of the prediction network is to learn the residual noise of domain shift which should be largely invariant across all classes and all samples in the target domain. In other words, the predicted domain shift noise should be indistinguishable between all sample classes. On the other hand, the task of the update network is to update the class tokens by removing the domain shift from the input image samples so that input samples become more discriminative between different classes in the feature space. To effectively learn the prediction and update networks with two adversarial tasks, both theoretically and practically, we demonstrate that it is necessary to use smooth optimization for the update network but non-smooth optimization for the prediction network. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the online fully test-time domain adaptation performance.

- **Summary**: Language based editing of 3D human avatars to precisely match user requirements is challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and limited expressiveness of natural language. To overcome this, we propose the Avatar Concept Slider (ACS), a 3D avatar editing method that allows precise manipulation of semantic concepts in human avatars towards a specified intermediate point between two extremes of concepts, akin to moving a knob along a slider track. To achieve this, our ACS has three designs. 1) A Concept Sliding Loss based on Linear Discriminant Analysis to pinpoint the concept-specific axis for precise editing. 2) An Attribute Preserving Loss based on Principal Component Analysis for improved preservation of avatar identity during editing. 3) A 3D Gaussian Splatting primitive selection mechanism based on concept-sensitivity, which updates only the primitives that are the most sensitive to our target concept, to improve efficiency. Results demonstrate that our ACS enables fine-grained 3D avatar editing with efficient feedback, without harming the avatar quality or compromising the avatar's identifying attributes.

- **Summary**: The explosive growth of videos on streaming media platforms has underscored the urgent need for effective video quality assessment (VQA) algorithms to monitor and perceptually optimize the quality of streaming videos. However, VQA remains an extremely challenging task due to the diverse video content and the complex spatial and temporal distortions, thus necessitating more advanced methods to address these issues. Nowadays, large multimodal models (LMMs), such as GPT-4V, have exhibited strong capabilities for various visual understanding tasks, motivating us to leverage the powerful multimodal representation ability of LMMs to solve the VQA task. Therefore, we propose the first Large Multi-Modal Video Quality Assessment (LMM-VQA) model, which introduces a novel spatiotemporal visual modeling strategy for quality-aware feature extraction. Specifically, we first reformulate the quality regression problem into a question and answering (Q&A) task and construct Q&A prompts for VQA instruction tuning. Then, we design a spatiotemporal vision encoder to extract spatial and temporal features to represent the quality characteristics of videos, which are subsequently mapped into the language space by the spatiotemporal projector for modality alignment. Finally, the aligned visual tokens and the quality-inquired text tokens are aggregated as inputs for the large language model (LLM) to generate the quality score and level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LMM-VQA achieves state-of-the-art performance across five VQA benchmarks, exhibiting an average improvement of $5\%$ in generalization ability over existing methods. Furthermore, due to the advanced design of the spatiotemporal encoder and projector, LMM-VQA also performs exceptionally well on general video understanding tasks, further validating its effectiveness. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Sueqk/LMM-VQA.

- **Summary**: In this paper, a color edge detection strategy based on collaborative filtering combined with multiscale gradient fusion is proposed. The block-matching and 3D (BM3D) filter are used to enhance the sparse representation in the transform domain and achieve the effect of denoising, whereas the multiscale gradient fusion makes up for the defect of loss of details in single-scale edge detection and improves the edge detection resolution and quality. First, the RGB images in the dataset are converted to XYZ color space images through mathematical operations. Second, the colored block-matching and 3D (CBM3D) filter are used on the sparse images and to remove noise interference. Then, the vector gradients of the color image and the anisotropic Gaussian directional derivative of the two scale parameters are calculated and averaged pixel-by-pixel to obtain a new edge strength map. Finally, the edge features are enhanced by image normalization and non-maximum suppression technology, and on that basis, the edge contour is obtained by double threshold selection and a new morphological refinement method. Through an experimental analysis of the edge detection dataset, the method proposed has good noise robustness and high edge quality, which is better than the Color Sobel, Color Canny, SE and Color AGDD as shown by the PR curve, AUC, PSNR, MSE, and FOM indicators.

- **Summary**: The task of image-to-multi-view generation refers to generating novel views of an instance from a single image. Recent methods achieve this by extending text-to-image latent diffusion models to multi-view version, which contains an VAE image encoder and a U-Net diffusion model. Specifically, these generation methods usually fix VAE and finetune the U-Net only. However, the significant downscaling of the latent vectors computed from the input images and independent decoding leads to notable pixel-level misalignment across multiple views. To address this, we propose a novel method for pixel-level image-to-multi-view generation. Unlike prior work, we incorporate attention layers across multi-view images in the VAE decoder of a latent video diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce a depth-truncated epipolar attention, enabling the model to focus on spatially adjacent regions while remaining memory efficient. Applying depth-truncated attn is challenging during inference as the ground-truth depth is usually difficult to obtain and pre-trained depth estimation models is hard to provide accurate depth. Thus, to enhance the generalization to inaccurate depth when ground truth depth is missing, we perturb depth inputs during training. During inference, we employ a rapid multi-view to 3D reconstruction approach, NeuS, to obtain coarse depth for the depth-truncated epipolar attention. Our model enables better pixel alignment across multi-view images. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in improving downstream multi-view to 3D reconstruction tasks.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated considerable potential across various downstream tasks that require cross-domain knowledge. MLLMs capable of processing videos, known as Video-MLLMs, have attracted broad interest in video-language understanding. However, videos, especially long videos, contain more visual tokens than images, making them difficult for LLMs to process. Existing works either downsample visual features or extend the LLM context size, risking the loss of high-resolution information or slowing down inference speed. To address these limitations, we apply cross-attention layers in the intermediate projector between the visual encoder and the large language model (LLM). As the naive cross-attention mechanism is insensitive to temporal order, we further introduce causal cross-attention masks (CCAMs) within the cross-attention layers. This Video-MLLM, named Video-CCAM, is trained in a straightforward two-stage fashion: feature alignment and visual instruction tuning. We develop several Video-CCAM models based on LLMs of different sizes (4B, 9B, and 14B). Video-CCAM proves to be a robust Video-MLLM and shows outstanding performance from short videos to long ones. Among standard video benchmarks like MVBench and VideoChatGPT-QA, Video-CCAM shows outstanding performances (1st/2nd/3rd in MVBench and TGIF-QA, 2nd/3rd/4th in MSVD-QA, MSRVTT-QA, and ActivityNet-QA). In benchmarks encompassing long videos, Video-CCAM models can be directly adapted to long video understanding and still achieve exceptional scores despite being trained solely with images and 16-frame videos. Using 96 frames (6$\times$ the training number of frames), Video-CCAM models rank 1st/2nd/3rd in VideoVista and 1st/2nd/4th in MLVU among all open-source Video-MLLMs, respectively. The code is publicly available in \url{https://github.com/QQ-MM/Video-CCAM}.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based video generation models have made significant strides, producing outputs with improved visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and user control. These advancements hold great promise for improving surgical education by enabling more realistic, diverse, and interactive simulation environments. In this study, we introduce SurGen, a text-guided diffusion model tailored for surgical video synthesis, producing the highest resolution and longest duration videos among existing surgical video generation models. We validate the visual and temporal quality of the outputs using standard image and video generation metrics. Additionally, we assess their alignment to the corresponding text prompts through a deep learning classifier trained on surgical data. Our results demonstrate the potential of diffusion models to serve as valuable educational tools for surgical trainees.

- **Summary**: Open Set Object Detection has seen rapid development recently, but it continues to pose significant challenges. Language-based methods, grappling with the substantial modal disparity between textual and visual modalities, require extensive computational resources to bridge this gap. Although integrating visual prompts into these frameworks shows promise for enhancing performance, it always comes with constraints related to textual semantics. In contrast, viusal-only methods suffer from the low-quality fusion of multiple visual prompts. In response, we introduce a strong DETR-based model, Visual Intersection Network for Open Set Object Detection (VINO), which constructs a multi-image visual bank to preserve the semantic intersections of each category across all time steps. Our innovative multi-image visual updating mechanism learns to identify the semantic intersections from various visual prompts, enabling the flexible incorporation of new information and continuous optimization of feature representations. Our approach guarantees a more precise alignment between target category semantics and region semantics, while significantly reducing pre-training time and resource demands compared to language-based methods. Furthermore, the integration of a segmentation head illustrates the broad applicability of visual intersection in various visual tasks. VINO, which requires only 7 RTX4090 GPU days to complete one epoch on the Objects365v1 dataset, achieves competitive performance on par with vision-language models on benchmarks such as LVIS and ODinW35.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes FAST-LIVO2: a fast, direct LiDAR-inertial-visual odometry framework to achieve accurate and robust state estimation in SLAM tasks and provide great potential in real-time, onboard robotic applications. FAST-LIVO2 fuses the IMU, LiDAR and image measurements efficiently through an ESIKF. To address the dimension mismatch between the heterogeneous LiDAR and image measurements, we use a sequential update strategy in the Kalman filter. To enhance the efficiency, we use direct methods for both the visual and LiDAR fusion, where the LiDAR module registers raw points without extracting edge or plane features and the visual module minimizes direct photometric errors without extracting ORB or FAST corner features. The fusion of both visual and LiDAR measurements is based on a single unified voxel map where the LiDAR module constructs the geometric structure for registering new LiDAR scans and the visual module attaches image patches to the LiDAR points. To enhance the accuracy of image alignment, we use plane priors from the LiDAR points in the voxel map (and even refine the plane prior) and update the reference patch dynamically after new images are aligned. Furthermore, to enhance the robustness of image alignment, FAST-LIVO2 employs an on-demanding raycast operation and estimates the image exposure time in real time. Lastly, we detail three applications of FAST-LIVO2: UAV onboard navigation demonstrating the system's computation efficiency for real-time onboard navigation, airborne mapping showcasing the system's mapping accuracy, and 3D model rendering (mesh-based and NeRF-based) underscoring the suitability of our reconstructed dense map for subsequent rendering tasks. We open source our code, dataset and application on GitHub to benefit the robotics community.

- **Summary**: This paper explores the paradigm of Collaborative Perception (CP), where multiple robots and sensors in the environment share and integrate sensor data to construct a comprehensive representation of the surroundings. By aggregating data from various sensors and utilizing advanced algorithms, the collaborative perception framework improves task efficiency, coverage, and safety. Two case studies are presented to showcase the benefits of collaborative perception in multi-robot systems. The first case study illustrates the benefits and advantages of using CP for the task of household cleaning with a team of cleaning robots. The second case study performs a comparative analysis of the performance of CP versus Standalone Perception (SP) for Autonomous Mobile Robots operating in a warehouse environment. The case studies validate the effectiveness of CP in enhancing multi-robot coordination, task completion, and overall system performance and its potential to impact operations in other applications as well.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has shown notable potential in relieving the heavy demand of dense prediction tasks on large-scale well-annotated datasets, especially for the challenging multi-organ segmentation (MoS). However, the prevailing class-imbalance problem in MoS, caused by the substantial variations in organ size, exacerbates the learning difficulty of the SSL network. To alleviate this issue, we present a two-phase semi-supervised network (BSR-Net) with balanced subclass regularization for MoS. Concretely, in Phase I, we introduce a class-balanced subclass generation strategy based on balanced clustering to effectively generate multiple balanced subclasses from original biased ones according to their pixel proportions. Then, in Phase II, we design an auxiliary subclass segmentation (SCS) task within the multi-task framework of the main MoS task. The SCS task contributes a balanced subclass regularization to the main MoS task and transfers unbiased knowledge to the MoS network, thus alleviating the influence of the class-imbalance problem. Extensive experiments conducted on two publicly available datasets, i.e., the MICCAI FLARE 2022 dataset and the WORD dataset, verify the superior performance of our method compared with other methods.

- **Summary**: AI-assisted lesion detection models play a crucial role in the early screening of cancer. However, previous image-based models ignore the inter-frame contextual information present in videos. On the other hand, video-based models capture the inter-frame context but are computationally expensive. To mitigate this contradiction, we delve into Video-to-Image knowledge distillation leveraging DEtection TRansformer (V2I-DETR) for the task of medical video lesion detection. V2I-DETR adopts a teacher-student network paradigm. The teacher network aims at extracting temporal contexts from multiple frames and transferring them to the student network, and the student network is an image-based model dedicated to fast prediction in inference. By distilling multi-frame contexts into a single frame, the proposed V2I-DETR combines the advantages of utilizing temporal contexts from video-based models and the inference speed of image-based models. Through extensive experiments, V2I-DETR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin while achieving the real-time inference speed (30 FPS) as the image-based model.

- **Summary**: The recent surge in AI-generated songs presents exciting possibilities and challenges. While these tools democratize music creation, they also necessitate the ability to distinguish between human-composed and AI-generated songs for safeguarding artistic integrity and content curation. Existing research and datasets in fake song detection only focus on singing voice deepfake detection (SVDD), where the vocals are AI-generated but the instrumental music is sourced from real songs. However, this approach is inadequate for contemporary end-to-end AI-generated songs where all components (vocals, lyrics, music, and style) could be AI-generated. Additionally, existing datasets lack lyrics-music diversity, long-duration songs, and open fake songs. To address these gaps, we introduce SONICS, a novel dataset for end-to-end Synthetic Song Detection (SSD), comprising over 97k songs with over 49k synthetic songs from popular platforms like Suno and Udio. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of modeling long-range temporal dependencies in songs for effective authenticity detection, an aspect overlooked in existing methods. To capture these patterns, we propose a novel model, SpecTTTra, that is up to 3 times faster and 6 times more memory efficient compared to popular CNN and Transformer-based models while maintaining competitive performance. Finally, we offer both AI-based and Human evaluation benchmarks, addressing another deficiency in current research.

- **Summary**: The Houma Alliance Book, one of history's earliest calligraphic examples, was unearthed in the 1970s. These artifacts were meticulously organized, reproduced, and copied by the Shanxi Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics. However, because of their ancient origins and severe ink erosion, identifying characters in the Houma Alliance Book is challenging, necessitating the use of digital technology. In this paper, we propose a new ancient handwritten character recognition database for the Houma alliance book, along with a novel benchmark based on deep learning architectures. More specifically, a collection of 26,732 characters samples from the Houma Alliance Book were gathered, encompassing 327 different types of ancient characters through iterative annotation. Furthermore, benchmark algorithms were proposed by combining four deep neural network classifiers with two data augmentation methods. This research provides valuable resources and technical support for further studies on the Houma Alliance Book and other ancient characters. This contributes to our understanding of ancient culture and history, as well as the preservation and inheritance of humanity's cultural heritage.

- **Summary**: In existing medical Region of Interest (ROI) detection, there lacks an algorithm that can simultaneously satisfy both real-time performance and accuracy, not meeting the growing demand for automatic detection in medicine. Although the basic YOLO framework ensures real-time detection due to its fast speed, it still faces challenges in maintaining precision concurrently. To alleviate the above problems, we propose a novel model named Lightweight Shunt Matching-YOLO (LSM-YOLO), with Lightweight Adaptive Extraction (LAE) and Multipath Shunt Feature Matching (MSFM). Firstly, by using LAE to refine feature extraction, the model can obtain more contextual information and high-resolution details from multiscale feature maps, thereby extracting detailed features of ROI in medical images while reducing the influence of noise. Secondly, MSFM is utilized to further refine the fusion of high-level semantic features and low-level visual features, enabling better fusion between ROI features and neighboring features, thereby improving the detection rate for better diagnostic assistance. Experimental results demonstrate that LSM-YOLO achieves 48.6% AP on a private dataset of pancreatic tumors, 65.1% AP on the BCCD blood cell detection public dataset, and 73.0% AP on the Br35h brain tumor detection public dataset. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter cost on the above three datasets. The source codes are at: https://github.com/VincentYuuuuuu/LSM-YOLO.

- **Summary**: Hand gesture-based sign language recognition (SLR) is one of the most advanced applications of machine learning, and computer vision uses hand gestures. Although, in the past few years, many researchers have widely explored and studied how to address BSL problems, specific unaddressed issues remain, such as skeleton and transformer-based BSL recognition. In addition, the lack of evaluation of the BSL model in various concealed environmental conditions can prove the generalized property of the existing model by facing daily life signs. As a consequence, existing BSL recognition systems provide a limited perspective of their generalisation ability as they are tested on datasets containing few BSL alphabets that have a wide disparity in gestures and are easy to differentiate. To overcome these limitations, we propose a spatial-temporal attention-based BSL recognition model considering hand joint skeletons extracted from the sequence of images. The main aim of utilising hand skeleton-based BSL data is to ensure the privacy and low-resolution sequence of images, which need minimum computational cost and low hardware configurations. Our model captures discriminative structural displacements and short-range dependency based on unified joint features projected onto high-dimensional feature space. Specifically, the use of Separable TCN combined with a powerful multi-head spatial-temporal attention architecture generated high-performance accuracy. The extensive experiments with a proposed dataset and two benchmark BSL datasets with a wide range of evaluations, such as intra- and inter-dataset evaluation settings, demonstrated that our proposed models achieve competitive performance with extremely low computational complexity and run faster than existing models.

- **Summary**: Electron microscopy (EM) imaging offers unparalleled resolution for analyzing neural tissues, crucial for uncovering the intricacies of synaptic connections and neural processes fundamental to understanding behavioral mechanisms. Recently, the foundation models have demonstrated impressive performance across numerous natural and medical image segmentation tasks. However, applying these foundation models to EM segmentation faces significant challenges due to domain disparities. This paper presents ShapeMamba-EM, a specialized fine-tuning method for 3D EM segmentation, which employs adapters for long-range dependency modeling and an encoder for local shape description within the original foundation model. This approach effectively addresses the unique volumetric and morphological complexities of EM data. Tested over a wide range of EM images, covering five segmentation tasks and 10 datasets, ShapeMamba-EM outperforms existing methods, establishing a new standard in EM image segmentation and enhancing the understanding of neural tissue architecture.

- **Summary**: Recent studies showcase the competitive accuracy of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in relation to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), along with their remarkable robustness. However, ViTs demand a large amount of data to achieve adequate performance, which makes their application to small datasets challenging, falling behind CNNs. To overcome this, we propose GenFormer, a data augmentation strategy utilizing generated images, thereby improving transformer accuracy and robustness on small-scale image classification tasks. In our comprehensive evaluation we propose Tiny ImageNetV2, -R, and -A as new test set variants of Tiny ImageNet by transferring established ImageNet generalization and robustness benchmarks to the small-scale data domain. Similarly, we introduce MedMNIST-C and EuroSAT-C as corrupted test set variants of established fine-grained datasets in the medical and aerial domain. Through a series of experiments conducted on small datasets of various domains, including Tiny ImageNet, CIFAR, EuroSAT and MedMNIST datasets, we demonstrate the synergistic power of our method, in particular when combined with common train and test time augmentations, knowledge distillation, and architectural design choices. Additionally, we prove the effectiveness of our approach under challenging conditions with limited training data, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and robustness, bridging the gap between CNNs and ViTs in the small-scale dataset domain.

- **Summary**: Food image composition requires the use of existing dish images and background images to synthesize a natural new image, while diffusion models have made significant advancements in image generation, enabling the construction of end-to-end architectures that yield promising results. However, existing diffusion models face challenges in processing and fusing information from multiple images and lack access to high-quality publicly available datasets, which prevents the application of diffusion models in food image composition. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality food image composite dataset, FC22k, which comprises 22,000 foreground, background, and ground truth ternary image pairs. Additionally, we propose a novel food image composition method, Foodfusion, which leverages the capabilities of the pre-trained diffusion models and incorporates a Fusion Module for processing and integrating foreground and background information. This fused information aligns the foreground features with the background structure by merging the global structural information at the cross-attention layer of the denoising UNet. To further enhance the content and structure of the background, we also integrate a Content-Structure Control Module. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: We introduce 2D-Malafide, a novel and lightweight adversarial attack designed to deceive face deepfake detection systems. Building upon the concept of 1D convolutional perturbations explored in the speech domain, our method leverages 2D convolutional filters to craft perturbations which significantly degrade the performance of state-of-the-art face deepfake detectors. Unlike traditional additive noise approaches, 2D-Malafide optimises a small number of filter coefficients to generate robust adversarial perturbations which are transferable across different face images. Experiments, conducted using the FaceForensics++ dataset, demonstrate that 2D-Malafide substantially degrades detection performance in both white-box and black-box settings, with larger filter sizes having the greatest impact. Additionally, we report an explainability analysis using GradCAM which illustrates how 2D-Malafide misleads detection systems by altering the image areas used most for classification. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of current deepfake detection systems to convolutional adversarial attacks as well as the need for future work to enhance detection robustness through improved image fidelity constraints.

- **Summary**: Geospatial data come from various sources, such as satellites, aircraft, and LiDAR. The variability of the source is not limited to the types of data acquisition techniques, as we have maps from different time periods. To incorporate these data for a coherent analysis, it is essential to first align different "styles" of geospatial data to its matching images that point to the same location on the surface of the Earth. In this paper, we approach the image registration as a two-step process of (1) extracting geospatial contents invariant to visual (and any other non-content-related) information, and (2) matching the data based on such (purely) geospatial contents. We hypothesize that a combination of $\beta$-VAE-like architecture [2] and adversarial training will achieve both the disentanglement of the geographic information and artistic styles and generation of new map tiles by composing the encoded geographic information with any artistic style.

- **Summary**: Dual encoder architectures like CLIP models map two types of inputs into a shared embedding space and learn similarities between them. However, it is not understood how such models compare two inputs. Here, we address this research gap with two contributions. First, we derive a method to attribute predictions of any differentiable dual encoder onto feature-pair interactions between its inputs. Second, we apply our method to CLIP-type models and show that they learn fine-grained correspondences between parts of captions and regions in images. They match objects across input modes and also account for mismatches. However, this visual-linguistic grounding ability heavily varies between object classes, depends on the training data distribution, and largely improves after in-domain training. Using our method we can identify knowledge gaps about specific object classes in individual models and can monitor their improvement upon fine-tuning.

- **Summary**: Assessing the aesthetic quality of artistic images presents unique challenges due to the subjective nature of aesthetics and the complex visual characteristics inherent to artworks. Basic data augmentation techniques commonly applied to natural images in computer vision may not be suitable for art images in aesthetic evaluation tasks, as they can change the composition of the art images. In this paper, we explore the impact of local and global data augmentation techniques on artistic image aesthetic assessment (IAA). We introduce BackFlip, a local data augmentation technique designed specifically for artistic IAA. We evaluate the performance of BackFlip across three artistic image datasets and four neural network architectures, comparing it with the commonly used data augmentation techniques. Then, we analyze the effects of components within the BackFlip pipeline through an ablation study. Our findings demonstrate that local augmentations, such as BackFlip, tend to outperform global augmentations on artistic IAA in most cases, probably because they do not perturb the composition of the art images. These results emphasize the importance of considering both local and global augmentations in future computational aesthetics research.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we aim to enhance the performance of SwiftBrush, a prominent one-step text-to-image diffusion model, to be competitive with its multi-step Stable Diffusion counterpart. Initially, we explore the quality-diversity trade-off between SwiftBrush and SD Turbo: the former excels in image diversity, while the latter excels in image quality. This observation motivates our proposed modifications in the training methodology, including better weight initialization and efficient LoRA training. Moreover, our introduction of a novel clamped CLIP loss enhances image-text alignment and results in improved image quality. Remarkably, by combining the weights of models trained with efficient LoRA and full training, we achieve a new state-of-the-art one-step diffusion model, achieving an FID of 8.14 and surpassing all GAN-based and multi-step Stable Diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Significant progress has been made in the field of Instruction-based Image Editing (IIE). However, evaluating these models poses a significant challenge. A crucial requirement in this field is the establishment of a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for accurately assessing editing results and providing valuable insights for its further development. In response to this need, we propose I2EBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to automatically evaluate the quality of edited images produced by IIE models from multiple dimensions. I2EBench consists of 2,000+ images for editing, along with 4,000+ corresponding original and diverse instructions. It offers three distinctive characteristics: 1) Comprehensive Evaluation Dimensions: I2EBench comprises 16 evaluation dimensions that cover both high-level and low-level aspects, providing a comprehensive assessment of each IIE model. 2) Human Perception Alignment: To ensure the alignment of our benchmark with human perception, we conducted an extensive user study for each evaluation dimension. 3) Valuable Research Insights: By analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of existing IIE models across the 16 dimensions, we offer valuable research insights to guide future development in the field. We will open-source I2EBench, including all instructions, input images, human annotations, edited images from all evaluated methods, and a simple script for evaluating the results from new IIE models. The code, dataset and generated images from all IIE models are provided in github: https://github.com/cocoshe/I2EBench.

- **Summary**: We propose a way to train deep learning based keypoint descriptors that makes them approximately equivariant for locally affine transformations of the image plane. The main idea is to use the representation theory of GL(2) to generalize the recently introduced concept of steerers from rotations to affine transformations. Affine steerers give high control over how keypoint descriptions transform under image transformations. We demonstrate the potential of using this control for image matching. Finally, we propose a way to finetune keypoint descriptors with a set of steerers on upright images and obtain state-of-the-art results on several standard benchmarks. Code will be published at github.com/georg-bn/affine-steerers.

- **Summary**: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) aims to generate a comprehensive graphical representation that accurately captures the semantic information of a given scenario. However, the SGG model's performance in predicting more fine-grained predicates is hindered by a significant predicate bias. According to existing works, the long-tail distribution of predicates in training data results in the biased scene graph. However, the semantic overlap between predicate categories makes predicate prediction difficult, and there is a significant difference in the sample size of semantically similar predicates, making the predicate prediction more difficult. Therefore, higher requirements are placed on the discriminative ability of the model. In order to address this problem, this paper proposes Ensemble Predicate Decoding (EPD), which employs multiple decoders to attain unbiased scene graph generation. Two auxiliary decoders trained on lower-frequency predicates are used to improve the discriminative ability of the model. Extensive experiments are conducted on the VG, and the experiment results show that EPD enhances the model's representation capability for predicates. In addition, we find that our approach ensures a relatively superior predictive capability for more frequent predicates compared to previous unbiased SGG methods.

- **Summary**: The detection of small objects, particularly traffic signs, is a critical subtask within object detection and autonomous driving. Despite the notable achievements in previous research, two primary challenges persist. Firstly, the main issue is the singleness of feature extraction. Secondly, the detection process fails to effectively integrate with objects of varying sizes or scales. These issues are also prevalent in generic object detection. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel object detection network named Efficient Multi-scale and Diverse Feature Network (EMDFNet) for traffic sign detection that integrates an Augmented Shortcut Module and an Efficient Hybrid Encoder to address the aforementioned issues simultaneously. Specifically, the Augmented Shortcut Module utilizes multiple branches to integrate various spatial semantic information and channel semantic information, thereby enhancing feature diversity. The Efficient Hybrid Encoder utilizes global feature fusion and local feature interaction based on various features to generate distinctive classification features by integrating feature information in an adaptable manner. Extensive experiments on the Tsinghua-Tencent 100K (TT100K) benchmark and the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB) demonstrate that our EMDFNet outperforms other state-of-the-art detectors in performance while retaining the real-time processing capabilities of single-stage models. This substantiates the effectiveness of EMDFNet in detecting small traffic signs.

- **Summary**: Few-shot classification involves identifying new categories using a limited number of labeled samples. Current few-shot classification methods based on local descriptors primarily leverage underlying consistent features across visible and invisible classes, facing challenges including redundant neighboring information, noisy representations, and limited interpretability. This paper proposes a Feature Aligning Few-shot Learning Method Using Local Descriptors Weighted Rules (FAFD-LDWR). It innovatively introduces a cross-normalization method into few-shot image classification to preserve the discriminative information of local descriptors as much as possible; and enhances classification performance by aligning key local descriptors of support and query sets to remove background noise. FAFD-LDWR performs excellently on three benchmark datasets , outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings. The designed visualization experiments also demonstrate FAFD-LDWR's improvement in prediction interpretability.

- **Summary**: World models envision potential future states based on various ego actions. They embed extensive knowledge about the driving environment, facilitating safe and scalable autonomous driving. Most existing methods primarily focus on either data generation or the pretraining paradigms of world models. Unlike the aforementioned prior works, we propose Drive-OccWorld, which adapts a vision-centric 4D forecasting world model to end-to-end planning for autonomous driving. Specifically, we first introduce a semantic and motion-conditional normalization in the memory module, which accumulates semantic and dynamic information from historical BEV embeddings. These BEV features are then conveyed to the world decoder for future occupancy and flow forecasting, considering both geometry and spatiotemporal modeling. Additionally, we propose injecting flexible action conditions, such as velocity, steering angle, trajectory, and commands, into the world model to enable controllable generation and facilitate a broader range of downstream applications. Furthermore, we explore integrating the generative capabilities of the 4D world model with end-to-end planning, enabling continuous forecasting of future states and the selection of optimal trajectories using an occupancy-based cost function. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our method can generate plausible and controllable 4D occupancy, opening new avenues for driving world generation and end-to-end planning.

- **Summary**: Existing works in single-image human reconstruction suffer from weak generalizability due to insufficient training data or 3D inconsistencies for a lack of comprehensive multi-view knowledge. In this paper, we introduce MagicMan, a human-specific multi-view diffusion model designed to generate high-quality novel view images from a single reference image. As its core, we leverage a pre-trained 2D diffusion model as the generative prior for generalizability, with the parametric SMPL-X model as the 3D body prior to promote 3D awareness. To tackle the critical challenge of maintaining consistency while achieving dense multi-view generation for improved 3D human reconstruction, we first introduce hybrid multi-view attention to facilitate both efficient and thorough information interchange across different views. Additionally, we present a geometry-aware dual branch to perform concurrent generation in both RGB and normal domains, further enhancing consistency via geometry cues. Last but not least, to address ill-shaped issues arising from inaccurate SMPL-X estimation that conflicts with the reference image, we propose a novel iterative refinement strategy, which progressively optimizes SMPL-X accuracy while enhancing the quality and consistency of the generated multi-views. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both novel view synthesis and subsequent 3D human reconstruction tasks.

- **Summary**: Infrared imaging offers resilience against changing lighting conditions by capturing object temperatures. Yet, in few scenarios, its lack of visual details compared to daytime visible images, poses a significant challenge for human and machine interpretation. This paper proposes a novel diffusion method, dubbed Temporally Consistent Patch Diffusion Models (TC-DPM), for infrared-to-visible video translation. Our method, extending the Patch Diffusion Model, consists of two key components. Firstly, we propose a semantic-guided denoising, leveraging the strong representations of foundational models. As such, our method faithfully preserves the semantic structure of generated visible images. Secondly, we propose a novel temporal blending module to guide the denoising trajectory, ensuring the temporal consistency between consecutive frames. Experiment shows that TC-PDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 35.3% in FVD for infrared-to-visible video translation and by 6.1% in AP50 for day-to-night object detection.

- **Summary**: Accurately estimating image quality and model robustness improvement are critical challenges in unconstrained face recognition, which can be addressed through uncertainty estimation via probabilistic face embeddings. Previous research mainly focused on uncertainty estimation in face verification, leaving the open-set face recognition task underexplored. In open-set face recognition, one seeks to classify an image, which could also be unknown. Here, the low variance of probabilistic embedding does not imply a low error probability: an image embedding could be close to several classes in a gallery, thus yielding high uncertainty. We propose a method aware of two sources of ambiguity in the open-set recognition system: (1) the gallery uncertainty caused by overlapping classes and (2) the uncertainty of the face embeddings. To detect both types, we use a Bayesian probabilistic model of embedding distribution, which provides a principled uncertainty estimate. Challenging open-set face recognition datasets, such as IJB-C, serve as a testbed for our method. We also propose a new open-set recognition protocol for whale and dolphin identification. The proposed approach better identifies recognition errors than uncertainty estimation methods based solely on image quality.

- **Summary**: Existing video super-resolution (VSR) methods generally adopt a recurrent propagation network to extract spatio-temporal information from the entire video sequences, exhibiting impressive performance. However, the key components in recurrent-based VSR networks significantly impact model efficiency, e.g., the alignment module occupies a substantial portion of model parameters, while the bidirectional propagation mechanism significantly amplifies the inference time. Consequently, developing a compact and efficient VSR method that can be deployed on resource-constrained devices, e.g., smartphones, remains challenging. To this end, we propose a cascaded temporal updating network (CTUN) for efficient VSR. We first develop an implicit cascaded alignment module to explore spatio-temporal correspondences from adjacent frames. Moreover, we propose a unidirectional propagation updating network to efficiently explore long-range temporal information, which is crucial for high-quality video reconstruction. Specifically, we develop a simple yet effective hidden updater that can leverage future information to update hidden features during forward propagation, significantly reducing inference time while maintaining performance. Finally, we formulate all of these components into an end-to-end trainable VSR network. Extensive experimental results show that our CTUN achieves a favorable trade-off between efficiency and performance compared to existing methods. Notably, compared with BasicVSR, our method obtains better results while employing only about 30% of the parameters and running time. The source code and pre-trained models will be available at https://github.com/House-Leo/CTUN.

- **Summary**: Object detection is a critical field in computer vision focusing on accurately identifying and locating specific objects in images or videos. Traditional methods for object detection rely on large labeled training datasets for each object category, which can be time-consuming and expensive to collect and annotate. To address this issue, researchers have introduced few-shot object detection (FSOD) approaches that merge few-shot learning and object detection principles. These approaches allow models to quickly adapt to new object categories with only a few annotated samples. While traditional FSOD methods have been studied before, this survey paper comprehensively reviews FSOD research with a specific focus on covering different FSOD settings such as standard FSOD, generalized FSOD, incremental FSOD, open-set FSOD, and domain adaptive FSOD. These approaches play a vital role in reducing the reliance on extensive labeled datasets, particularly as the need for efficient machine learning models continues to rise. This survey paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the above-mentioned few-shot settings and explore the methodologies for each FSOD task. It thoroughly compares state-of-the-art methods across different FSOD settings, analyzing them in detail based on their evaluation protocols. Additionally, it offers insights into their applications, challenges, and potential future directions in the evolving field of object detection with limited data.

- **Summary**: LiDAR data of urban scenarios poses unique challenges, such as heterogeneous characteristics and inherent class imbalance. Therefore, large-scale datasets are necessary to apply deep learning methods. Instance augmentation has emerged as an efficient method to increase dataset diversity. However, current methods require the time-consuming curation of 3D models or costly manual data annotation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Text3DAug, a novel approach leveraging generative models for instance augmentation. Text3DAug does not depend on labeled data and is the first of its kind to generate instances and annotations from text. This allows for a fully automated pipeline, eliminating the need for manual effort in practical applications. Additionally, Text3DAug is sensor agnostic and can be applied regardless of the LiDAR sensor used. Comprehensive experimental analysis on LiDAR segmentation, detection and novel class discovery demonstrates that Text3DAug is effective in supplementing existing methods or as a standalone method, performing on par or better than established methods, however while overcoming their specific drawbacks. The code is publicly available.

- **Summary**: Fully quantized training (FQT) accelerates the training of deep neural networks by quantizing the activations, weights, and gradients into lower precision. To explore the ultimate limit of FQT (the lowest achievable precision), we make a first attempt to 1-bit FQT. We provide a theoretical analysis of FQT based on Adam and SGD, revealing that the gradient variance influences the convergence of FQT. Building on these theoretical results, we introduce an Activation Gradient Pruning (AGP) strategy. The strategy leverages the heterogeneity of gradients by pruning less informative gradients and enhancing the numerical precision of remaining gradients to mitigate gradient variance. Additionally, we propose Sample Channel joint Quantization (SCQ), which utilizes different quantization strategies in the computation of weight gradients and activation gradients to ensure that the method is friendly to low-bitwidth hardware. Finally, we present a framework to deploy our algorithm. For fine-tuning VGGNet-16 and ResNet-18 on multiple datasets, our algorithm achieves an average accuracy improvement of approximately 6%, compared to per-sample quantization. Moreover, our training speedup can reach a maximum of 5.13x compared to full precision training.

- **Summary**: The current mainstream multi-modal medical image-to-image translation methods face a contradiction. Supervised methods with outstanding performance rely on pixel-wise aligned training data to constrain the model optimization. However, obtaining pixel-wise aligned multi-modal medical image datasets is challenging. Unsupervised methods can be trained without paired data, but their reliability cannot be guaranteed. At present, there is no ideal multi-modal medical image-to-image translation method that can generate reliable translation results without the need for pixel-wise aligned data. This work aims to develop a novel medical image-to-image translation model that is independent of pixel-wise aligned data (MITIA), enabling reliable multi-modal medical image-to-image translation under the condition of misaligned training data. The proposed MITIA model utilizes a prior extraction network composed of a multi-modal medical image registration module and a multi-modal misalignment error detection module to extract pixel-level prior information from training data with misalignment errors to the largest extent. The extracted prior information is then used to construct a regularization term to constrain the optimization of the unsupervised cycle-consistent GAN model, restricting its solution space and thereby improving the performance and reliability of the generator. We trained the MITIA model using six datasets containing different misalignment errors and two well-aligned datasets. Subsequently, we compared the proposed method with six other state-of-the-art image-to-image translation methods. The results of both quantitative analysis and qualitative visual inspection indicate that MITIA achieves superior performance compared to the competing state-of-the-art methods, both on misaligned data and aligned data.

- **Summary**: It is challenging to reconstruct 3D point clouds in unseen classes from single 2D images. Instead of object-centered coordinate system, current methods generalized global priors learned in seen classes to reconstruct 3D shapes from unseen classes in viewer-centered coordinate system. However, the reconstruction accuracy and interpretability are still eager to get improved. To resolve this issue, we introduce to learn local pattern modularization for reconstructing 3D shapes in unseen classes, which achieves both good generalization ability and high reconstruction accuracy. Our insight is to learn a local prior which is class-agnostic and easy to generalize in object-centered coordinate system. Specifically, the local prior is learned via a process of learning and customizing local pattern modularization in seen classes. During this process, we first learn a set of patterns in local regions, which is the basis in the object-centered coordinate system to represent an arbitrary region on shapes across different classes. Then, we modularize each region on an initially reconstructed shape using the learned local patterns. Based on that, we customize the local pattern modularization using the input image by refining the reconstruction with more details. Our method enables to reconstruct high fidelity point clouds from unseen classes in object-centered coordinate system without requiring a large number of patterns or any additional information, such as segmentation supervision or camera poses. Our experimental results under widely used benchmarks show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy for shapes from unseen classes.

- **Summary**: Uncertainty quantification is a key pillar of trustworthy machine learning. It enables safe reactions under unsafe inputs, like predicting only when the machine learning model detects sufficient evidence, discarding anomalous data, or emitting warnings when an error is likely to be inbound. This is particularly crucial in safety-critical areas like medical image classification or self-driving cars. Despite the plethora of proposed uncertainty quantification methods achieving increasingly higher scores on performance benchmarks, uncertainty estimates are often shied away from in practice. Many machine learning projects start from pretrained latent representations that come without uncertainty estimates. Uncertainties would need to be trained by practitioners on their own, which is notoriously difficult and resource-intense.   This thesis makes uncertainty estimates easily accessible by adding them to the latent representation vectors of pretrained computer vision models. Besides proposing approaches rooted in probability and decision theory, such as Monte-Carlo InfoNCE (MCInfoNCE) and loss prediction, we delve into both theoretical and empirical questions. We show that these unobservable uncertainties about unobservable latent representations are indeed provably correct. We also provide an uncertainty-aware representation learning (URL) benchmark to compare these unobservables against observable ground-truths. Finally, we compile our findings to pretrain lightweight representation uncertainties on large-scale computer vision models that transfer to unseen datasets in a zero-shot manner.   Our findings do not only advance the current theoretical understanding of uncertainties over latent variables, but also facilitate the access to uncertainty quantification for future researchers inside and outside the field, enabling straightforward but trustworthy machine learning.

- **Summary**: Forgetting presents a significant challenge during incremental training, making it particularly demanding for contemporary AI systems to assimilate new knowledge in streaming data environments. To address this issue, most approaches in Continual Learning (CL) rely on the replay of a restricted buffer of past data. However, the presence of noise in real-world scenarios, where human annotation is constrained by time limitations or where data is automatically gathered from the web, frequently renders these strategies vulnerable. In this study, we address the problem of CL under Noisy Labels (CLN) by introducing Alternate Experience Replay (AER), which takes advantage of forgetting to maintain a clear distinction between clean, complex, and noisy samples in the memory buffer. The idea is that complex or mislabeled examples, which hardly fit the previously learned data distribution, are most likely to be forgotten. To grasp the benefits of such a separation, we equip AER with Asymmetric Balanced Sampling (ABS): a new sample selection strategy that prioritizes purity on the current task while retaining relevant samples from the past. Through extensive computational comparisons, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both accuracy and purity of the obtained buffer, resulting in a remarkable average gain of 4.71% points in accuracy with respect to existing loss-based purification strategies.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is the only non-invasive tool for studying white matter tracts and structural connectivity of the brain. These assessments rely heavily on tractography techniques, which reconstruct virtual streamlines representing white matter fibers. Much effort has been devoted to improving tractography methodology for adult brains, while tractography of the fetal brain has been largely neglected. Fetal tractography faces unique difficulties due to low dMRI signal quality, immature and rapidly developing brain structures, and paucity of reference data. This work presents the first machine learning model for fetal tractography. The model input consists of five sources of information: (1) Fiber orientation, inferred from a diffusion tensor fit to the dMRI signal; (2) Directions of recent propagation steps; (3) Global spatial information, encoded as distances to keypoints in the brain cortex; (4) Tissue segmentation information; and (5) Prior information about the expected local fiber orientations supplied with an atlas. In order to mitigate the local tensor estimation error, a large spatial context around the current point in the diffusion tensor image is encoded using convolutional and attention neural network modules. Moreover, the diffusion tensor information at a hypothetical next point is included in the model input. Filtering rules based on anatomically constrained tractography are applied to prune implausible streamlines. We trained the model on manually-refined whole-brain fetal tractograms and validated the trained model on an independent set of 11 test scans with gestational ages between 23 and 36 weeks. Results show that our proposed method achieves superior performance across all evaluated tracts. The new method can significantly advance the capabilities of dMRI for studying normal and abnormal brain development in utero.

- **Summary**: Incorporating inductive biases is a promising approach for tackling challenging robot learning domains with sample-efficient solutions. This paper identifies partially observable domains where symmetries can be a useful inductive bias for efficient learning. Specifically, by encoding the equivariance regarding specific group symmetries into the neural networks, our actor-critic reinforcement learning agents can reuse solutions in the past for related scenarios. Consequently, our equivariant agents outperform non-equivariant approaches significantly in terms of sample efficiency and final performance, demonstrated through experiments on a range of robotic tasks in simulation and real hardware.

- **Summary**: Compositionality is a critical capability in Text-to-Image (T2I) models, as it reflects their ability to understand and combine multiple concepts from text descriptions. Existing evaluations of compositional capability rely heavily on human-designed text prompts or fixed templates, limiting their diversity and complexity, and yielding low discriminative power. We propose ConceptMix, a scalable, controllable, and customizable benchmark which automatically evaluates compositional generation ability of T2I models. This is done in two stages. First, ConceptMix generates the text prompts: concretely, using categories of visual concepts (e.g., objects, colors, shapes, spatial relationships), it randomly samples an object and k-tuples of visual concepts, then uses GPT4-o to generate text prompts for image generation based on these sampled concepts. Second, ConceptMix evaluates the images generated in response to these prompts: concretely, it checks how many of the k concepts actually appeared in the image by generating one question per visual concept and using a strong VLM to answer them. Through administering ConceptMix to a diverse set of T2I models (proprietary as well as open ones) using increasing values of k, we show that our ConceptMix has higher discrimination power than earlier benchmarks. Specifically, ConceptMix reveals that the performance of several models, especially open models, drops dramatically with increased k. Importantly, it also provides insight into the lack of prompt diversity in widely-used training datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive human studies to validate the design of ConceptMix and compare our automatic grading with human judgement. We hope it will guide future T2I model development.

- **Summary**: This work presents the INBD network proposed by Gillert et al. in CVPR-2023 and studies its application for delineating tree rings in RGB images of Pinus taeda cross sections captured by a smartphone (UruDendro dataset), which are images with different characteristics from the ones used to train the method. The INBD network operates in two stages: first, it segments the background, pith, and ring boundaries. In the second stage, the image is transformed into polar coordinates, and ring boundaries are iteratively segmented from the pith to the bark. Both stages are based on the U-Net architecture. The method achieves an F-Score of 77.5, a mAR of 0.540, and an ARAND of 0.205 on the evaluation set. The code for the experiments is available at https://github.com/hmarichal93/mlbrief_inbd.

- **Summary**: Large wildlife image collections from camera traps are crucial for biodiversity monitoring, offering insights into species richness, occupancy, and activity patterns. However, manual processing of these data is time-consuming, hindering analytical processes. To address this, deep neural networks have been widely adopted to automate image analysis. Despite their growing use, the impact of model training decisions on downstream ecological metrics remains unclear. Here, we analyse camera trap data from an African savannah and an Asian sub-tropical dry forest to compare key ecological metrics derived from expert-generated species identifications with those generated from deep neural networks. We assess the impact of model architecture, training data noise, and dataset size on ecological metrics, including species richness, occupancy, and activity patterns. Our results show that while model architecture has minimal impact, large amounts of noise and reduced dataset size significantly affect these metrics. Nonetheless, estimated ecological metrics are resilient to considerable noise, tolerating up to 10% error in species labels and a 50% reduction in training set size without changing significantly. We also highlight that conventional metrics like classification error may not always be representative of a model's ability to accurately measure ecological metrics. We conclude that ecological metrics derived from deep neural network predictions closely match those calculated from expert labels and remain robust to variations in the factors explored. However, training decisions for deep neural networks can impact downstream ecological analysis. Therefore, practitioners should prioritize creating large, clean training sets and evaluate deep neural network solutions based on their ability to measure the ecological metrics of interest.

- **Summary**: The performance of deep neural networks scales with dataset size and label quality, rendering the efficient mitigation of low-quality data annotations crucial for building robust and cost-effective systems. Existing strategies to address label noise exhibit severe limitations due to computational complexity and application dependency. In this work, we propose WANN, a Weighted Adaptive Nearest Neighbor approach that builds on self-supervised feature representations obtained from foundation models. To guide the weighted voting scheme, we introduce a reliability score, which measures the likelihood of a data label being correct. WANN outperforms reference methods, including a linear layer trained with robust loss functions, on diverse datasets of varying size and under various noise types and severities. WANN also exhibits superior generalization on imbalanced data compared to both Adaptive-NNs (ANN) and fixed k-NNs. Furthermore, the proposed weighting scheme enhances supervised dimensionality reduction under noisy labels. This yields a significant boost in classification performance with 10x and 100x smaller image embeddings, minimizing latency and storage requirements. Our approach, emphasizing efficiency and explainability, emerges as a simple, robust solution to overcome the inherent limitations of deep neural network training.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address Generalized Category Discovery, aiming to simultaneously uncover novel categories and accurately classify known ones. Traditional methods, which lean heavily on self-supervision and contrastive learning, often fall short when distinguishing between fine-grained categories. To address this, we introduce a novel concept called `self-expertise', which enhances the model's ability to recognize subtle differences and uncover unknown categories. Our approach combines unsupervised and supervised self-expertise strategies to refine the model's discernment and generalization. Initially, hierarchical pseudo-labeling is used to provide `soft supervision', improving the effectiveness of self-expertise. Our supervised technique differs from traditional methods by utilizing more abstract positive and negative samples, aiding in the formation of clusters that can generalize to novel categories. Meanwhile, our unsupervised strategy encourages the model to sharpen its category distinctions by considering within-category examples as `hard' negatives. Supported by theoretical insights, our empirical results showcase that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques in Generalized Category Discovery across several fine-grained datasets.

- **Summary**: Data augmentation is widely used for training a neural network given little labeled data. A common practice of augmentation training is applying a composition of multiple transformations sequentially to the data. Existing augmentation methods such as RandAugment randomly sample from a list of pre-selected transformations, while methods such as AutoAugment apply advanced search to optimize over an augmentation set of size $k^d$, which is the number of transformation sequences of length $d$, given a list of $k$ transformations.   In this paper, we design efficient algorithms whose running time complexity is much faster than the worst-case complexity of $O(k^d)$, provably. We propose a new algorithm to search for a binary tree-structured composition of $k$ transformations, where each tree node corresponds to one transformation. The binary tree generalizes sequential augmentations, such as the SimCLR augmentation scheme for contrastive learning. Using a top-down, recursive search procedure, our algorithm achieves a runtime complexity of $O(2^d k)$, which is much faster than $O(k^d)$ as $k$ increases above $2$. We apply our algorithm to tackle data distributions with heterogeneous subpopulations by searching for one tree in each subpopulation and then learning a weighted combination, resulting in a forest of trees.   We validate our proposed algorithms on numerous graph and image datasets, including a multi-label graph classification dataset we collected. The dataset exhibits significant variations in the sizes of graphs and their average degrees, making it ideal for studying data augmentation. We show that our approach can reduce the computation cost by 43% over existing search methods while improving performance by 4.3%. The tree structures can be used to interpret the relative importance of each transformation, such as identifying the important transformations on small vs. large graphs.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have significantly improved the automatic generation of radiology reports. However, existing evaluation methods fail to reveal the models' understanding of radiological images and their capacity to achieve human-level granularity in descriptions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a system, named ReXKG, which extracts structured information from processed reports to construct a comprehensive radiology knowledge graph. We then propose three metrics to evaluate the similarity of nodes (ReXKG-NSC), distribution of edges (ReXKG-AMS), and coverage of subgraphs (ReXKG-SCS) across various knowledge graphs. We conduct an in-depth comparative analysis of AI-generated and human-written radiology reports, assessing the performance of both specialist and generalist models. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of current AI models in radiology report generation, offering valuable insights for improving model performance and clinical applicability.

- **Summary**: The transition to renewable energy, particularly solar, is key to mitigating climate change. Google's Solar API aids this transition by estimating solar potential from aerial imagery, but its impact is constrained by geographical coverage. This paper proposes expanding the API's reach using satellite imagery, enabling global solar potential assessment. We tackle challenges involved in building a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and roof instance segmentation from lower resolution and single oblique views using deep learning models. Our models, trained on aligned satellite and aerial datasets, produce 25cm DSMs and roof segments. With ~1m DSM MAE on buildings, ~5deg roof pitch error and ~56% IOU on roof segmentation, they significantly enhance the Solar API's potential to promote solar adoption.

- **Summary**: Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM), has recently shown competitive performance to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers in Natural Language Processing and general sequence modeling. Various attempts have been made to adapt Mamba to Computer Vision tasks, including medical image segmentation (MIS). Vision Mamba (VM)-based networks are particularly attractive due to their ability to achieve global receptive fields, similar to Vision Transformers, while also maintaining linear complexity in the number of tokens. However, the existing VM models still struggle to maintain both spatially local and global dependencies of tokens in high dimensional arrays due to their sequential nature. Employing multiple and/or complicated scanning strategies is computationally costly, which hinders applications of SSMs to high-dimensional 2D and 3D images that are common in MIS problems. In this work, we propose Local-Global Vision Mamba, LoG-VMamba, that explicitly enforces spatially adjacent tokens to remain nearby on the channel axis, and retains the global context in a compressed form. Our method allows the SSMs to access the local and global contexts even before reaching the last token while requiring only a simple scanning strategy. Our segmentation models are computationally efficient and substantially outperform both CNN and Transformers-based baselines on a diverse set of 2D and 3D MIS tasks. The implementation of LoG-VMamba is available at \url{https://github.com/Oulu-IMEDS/LoG-VMamba}.

- **Summary**: We introduce CHARTOM, a visual theory-of-mind benchmark for multimodal large language models. CHARTOM consists of specially designed data visualizing charts. Given a chart, a language model needs to not only correctly comprehend the chart (the FACT question) but also judge if the chart will be misleading to a human reader (the MIND question). Both questions have significant societal benefits. We detail the construction of the CHARTOM benchmark including its calibration on human performance.

- **Summary**: In recent years, three-dimensional point clouds are used increasingly to document natural environments. Each dataset contains a diverse set of objects, at varying shapes and sizes, distributed throughout the data and intricately intertwined with the topography. Therefore, regions of interest are difficult to find and consequent analyses become a challenge. Inspired from visual perception principles, we propose to differentiate objects of interest from the cluttered environment by evaluating how much they stand out from their surroundings, i.e., their geometric salience. Previous saliency detection approaches suggested mostly handcrafted attributes for the task. However, such methods fail when the data are too noisy or have high levels of texture. Here we propose a learning-based mechanism that accommodates noise and textured surfaces. We assume that within the natural environment any change from the prevalent surface would suggest a salient object. Thus, we first learn the underlying surface and then search for anomalies within it. Initially, a deep neural network is trained to reconstruct the surface. Regions where the reconstructed part deviates significantly from the original point cloud yield a substantial reconstruction error, signifying an anomaly, i.e., saliency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by searching for salient features in various natural scenarios, which were acquired by different acquisition platforms. We show the strong correlation between the reconstruction error and salient objects.

- **Summary**: Conventional 3D medical image segmentation methods typically require learning heavy 3D networks (e.g., 3D-UNet), as well as large amounts of in-domain data with accurate pixel/voxel-level labels to avoid overfitting. These solutions are thus extremely time- and labor-expensive, but also may easily fail to generalize to unseen objects during training. To alleviate this issue, we present MSFSeg, a novel few-shot 3D segmentation framework with a lightweight multi-surrogate fusion (MSF). MSFSeg is able to automatically segment unseen 3D objects/organs (during training) provided with one or a few annotated 2D slices or 3D sequence segments, via learning dense query-support organ/lesion anatomy correlations across patient populations. Our proposed MSF module mines comprehensive and diversified morphology correlations between unlabeled and the few labeled slices/sequences through multiple designated surrogates, making it able to generate accurate cross-domain 3D segmentation masks given annotated slices or sequences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework by showing superior performance on conventional few-shot segmentation benchmarks compared to prior art, and remarkable cross-domain cross-volume segmentation performance on proprietary 3D segmentation datasets for challenging entities, i.e., tubular structures, with only limited 2D or 3D labels.

- **Summary**: We explore social perception of human faces in CLIP, a widely used open-source vision-language model. To this end, we compare the similarity in CLIP embeddings between different textual prompts and a set of face images. Our textual prompts are constructed from well-validated social psychology terms denoting social perception. The face images are synthetic and are systematically and independently varied along six dimensions: the legally protected attributes of age, gender, and race, as well as facial expression, lighting, and pose. Independently and systematically manipulating face attributes allows us to study the effect of each on social perception and avoids confounds that can occur in wild-collected data due to uncontrolled systematic correlations between attributes. Thus, our findings are experimental rather than observational. Our main findings are three. First, while CLIP is trained on the widest variety of images and texts, it is able to make fine-grained human-like social judgments on face images. Second, age, gender, and race do systematically impact CLIP's social perception of faces, suggesting an undesirable bias in CLIP vis-a-vis legally protected attributes. Most strikingly, we find a strong pattern of bias concerning the faces of Black women, where CLIP produces extreme values of social perception across different ages and facial expressions. Third, facial expression impacts social perception more than age and lighting as much as age. The last finding predicts that studies that do not control for unprotected visual attributes may reach the wrong conclusions on bias. Our novel method of investigation, which is founded on the social psychology literature and on the experiments involving the manipulation of individual attributes, yields sharper and more reliable observations than previous observational methods and may be applied to study biases in any vision-language model.

- **Summary**: Exploiting both audio and visual modalities for video classification is a challenging task, as the existing methods require large model architectures, leading to high computational complexity and resource requirements. Smaller architectures, on the other hand, struggle to achieve optimal performance. In this paper, we propose Attend-Fusion, an audio-visual (AV) fusion approach that introduces a compact model architecture specifically designed to capture intricate audio-visual relationships in video data. Through extensive experiments on the challenging YouTube-8M dataset, we demonstrate that Attend-Fusion achieves an F1 score of 75.64\% with only 72M parameters, which is comparable to the performance of larger baseline models such as Fully-Connected Late Fusion (75.96\% F1 score, 341M parameters). Attend-Fusion achieves similar performance to the larger baseline model while reducing the model size by nearly 80\%, highlighting its efficiency in terms of model complexity. Our work demonstrates that the Attend-Fusion model effectively combines audio and visual information for video classification, achieving competitive performance with significantly reduced model size. This approach opens new possibilities for deploying high-performance video understanding systems in resource-constrained environments across various applications.

- **Summary**: Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be very successful in a wide range of image processing applications. However, due to their increasing number of model parameters and an increasing availability of large amounts of training data, parallelization strategies to efficiently train complex CNNs are necessary. In previous work by the authors, a novel model parallel CNN architecture was proposed which is loosely inspired by domain decomposition. In particular, the novel network architecture is based on a decomposition of the input data into smaller subimages. For each of these subimages, local CNNs with a proportionally smaller number of parameters are trained in parallel and the resulting local classifications are then aggregated in a second step by a dense feedforward neural network (DNN). In the present work, we compare the resulting CNN-DNN architecture to less costly alternatives to combine the local classifications into a final, global decision. Additionally, we investigate the performance of the CNN-DNN trained as one coherent model as well as using a transfer learning strategy, where the parameters of the pre-trained local CNNs are used as initial values for a subsequently trained global coherent CNN-DNN model.

- **Summary**: Object grasping is a fundamental challenge in robotics and computer vision, critical for advancing robotic manipulation capabilities. Deformable objects, like fabrics and cloths, pose additional challenges due to their non-rigid nature. In this work, we introduce CeDiRNet-3DoF, a deep-learning model for grasp point detection, with a particular focus on cloth objects. CeDiRNet-3DoF employs center direction regression alongside a localization network, attaining first place in the perception task of ICRA 2023's Cloth Manipulation Challenge. Recognizing the lack of standardized benchmarks in the literature that hinder effective method comparison, we present the ViCoS Towel Dataset. This extensive benchmark dataset comprises 8,000 real and 12,000 synthetic images, serving as a robust resource for training and evaluating contemporary data-driven deep-learning approaches.

- **Summary**: Object counting and localization problems are commonly addressed with point supervised learning, which allows the use of less labor-intensive point annotations. However, learning based on point annotations poses challenges due to the high imbalance between the sets of annotated and unannotated pixels, which is often treated with Gaussian smoothing of point annotations and focal loss. However, these approaches still focus on the pixels in the immediate vicinity of the point annotations and exploit the rest of the data only indirectly. In this work, we propose a novel approach termed CeDiRNet for point-supervised learning that uses a dense regression of directions pointing towards the nearest object centers, i.e. center-directions. This provides greater support for each center point arising from many surrounding pixels pointing towards the object center. We propose a formulation of center-directions that allows the problem to be split into the domain-specific dense regression of center-directions and the final localization task based on a small, lightweight, and domain-agnostic localization network that can be trained with synthetic data completely independent of the target domain. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on six different datasets for object counting and localization, and show that it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: This paper considers the problem of Multi-Hop Video Question Answering (MH-VidQA) in long-form egocentric videos. This task not only requires to answer visual questions, but also to localize multiple relevant time intervals within the video as visual evidences. We develop an automated pipeline to create multi-hop question-answering pairs with associated temporal evidence, enabling to construct a large-scale dataset for instruction-tuning. To monitor the progress of this new task, we further curate a high-quality benchmark, MultiHop-EgoQA, with careful manual verification and refinement. Experimental results reveal that existing multi-modal systems exhibit inadequate multi-hop grounding and reasoning abilities, resulting in unsatisfactory performance. We then propose a novel architecture, termed as Grounding Scattered Evidence with Large Language Model (GeLM), that enhances multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) by incorporating a grounding module to retrieve temporal evidence from videos using flexible grounding tokens. Trained on our visual instruction data, GeLM demonstrates improved multi-hop grounding and reasoning capabilities, setting a new baseline for this challenging task. Furthermore, when trained on third-person view videos, the same architecture also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the single-hop VidQA benchmark, ActivityNet-RTL, demonstrating its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Multimodal foundation models serve numerous applications at the intersection of vision and language. Still, despite being pretrained on extensive data, they become outdated over time. To keep models updated, research into continual pretraining mainly explores scenarios with either (1) infrequent, indiscriminate updates on large-scale new data, or (2) frequent, sample-level updates. However, practical model deployment often operates in the gap between these two limit cases, as real-world applications often demand adaptation to specific subdomains, tasks or concepts -- spread over the entire, varying life cycle of a model. In this work, we complement current perspectives on continual pretraining through a research test bed as well as provide comprehensive guidance for effective continual model updates in such scenarios. We first introduce FoMo-in-Flux, a continual multimodal pretraining benchmark with realistic compute constraints and practical deployment requirements, constructed over 63 datasets with diverse visual and semantic coverage. Using FoMo-in-Flux, we explore the complex landscape of practical continual pretraining through multiple perspectives: (1) A data-centric investigation of data mixtures and stream orderings that emulate real-world deployment situations, (2) a method-centric investigation ranging from simple fine-tuning and traditional continual learning strategies to parameter-efficient updates and model merging, (3) meta learning rate schedules and mechanistic design choices, and (4) the influence of model and compute scaling. Together, our insights provide a practitioner's guide to continual multimodal pretraining for real-world deployment. Our benchmark and code is here: https://github.com/ExplainableML/fomo_in_flux.
