- **Summary**: This work focuses on AIGC detection to develop universal detectors capable of identifying various types of forgery images. Recent studies have found large pre-trained models, such as CLIP, are effective for generalizable deepfake detection along with linear classifiers. However, two critical issues remain unresolved: 1) understanding why CLIP features are effective on deepfake detection through a linear classifier; and 2) exploring the detection potential of CLIP. In this study, we delve into the underlying mechanisms of CLIP's detection capabilities by decoding its detection features into text and performing word frequency analysis. Our finding indicates that CLIP detects deepfakes by recognizing similar concepts (Fig. \ref{fig:fig1} a). Building on this insight, we introduce Category Common Prompt CLIP, called C2P-CLIP, which integrates the category common prompt into the text encoder to inject category-related concepts into the image encoder, thereby enhancing detection performance (Fig. \ref{fig:fig1} b). Our method achieves a 12.41\% improvement in detection accuracy compared to the original CLIP, without introducing additional parameters during testing. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two widely-used datasets, encompassing 20 generation models, validate the efficacy of the proposed method, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task in computer vision, with existing state-of-the-art models often limited by hardware constraints and computational inefficiencies, particularly in handling high-resolution images. Recent foundation models, such as transformers and diffusion models, despite their efficacy in various domains, are limited in use on edge devices due to their computational complexity and slow inference times. We introduce ExpoMamba, a novel architecture that integrates components of the frequency state space within a modified U-Net, offering a blend of efficiency and effectiveness. This model is specifically optimized to address mixed exposure challenges, a common issue in low-light image enhancement, while ensuring computational efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that ExpoMamba enhances low-light images up to 2-3x faster than traditional models with an inference time of 36.6 ms and achieves a PSNR improvement of approximately 15-20% over competing models, making it highly suitable for real-time image processing applications.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in human avatar synthesis have utilized radiance fields to reconstruct photo-realistic animatable human avatars. However, both NeRFs-based and 3DGS-based methods struggle with maintaining 3D consistency and exhibit suboptimal detail reconstruction, especially with sparse inputs. To address this challenge, we propose CHASE, which introduces supervision from intrinsic 3D consistency across poses and 3D geometry contrastive learning, achieving performance comparable with sparse inputs to that with full inputs. Following previous work, we first integrate a skeleton-driven rigid deformation and a non-rigid cloth dynamics deformation to coordinate the movements of individual Gaussians during animation, reconstructing basic avatar with coarse 3D consistency. To improve 3D consistency under sparse inputs, we design Dynamic Avatar Adjustment(DAA) to adjust deformed Gaussians based on a selected similar pose/image from the dataset. Minimizing the difference between the image rendered by adjusted Gaussians and the image with the similar pose serves as an additional form of supervision for avatar. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geometry contrastive learning strategy to maintain the 3D global consistency of generated avatars. Though CHASE is designed for sparse inputs, it surprisingly outperforms current SOTA methods \textbf{in both full and sparse settings} on the ZJU-MoCap and H36M datasets, demonstrating that our CHASE successfully maintains avatar's 3D consistency, hence improving rendering quality.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing photo-realistic animatable human avatars from monocular videos remains challenging in computer vision and graphics. Recently, methods using 3D Gaussians to represent the human body have emerged, offering faster optimization and real-time rendering. However, due to ignoring the crucial role of human body semantic information which represents the intrinsic structure and connections within the human body, they fail to achieve fine-detail reconstruction of dynamic human avatars. To address this issue, we propose SG-GS, which uses semantics-embedded 3D Gaussians, skeleton-driven rigid deformation, and non-rigid cloth dynamics deformation to create photo-realistic animatable human avatars from monocular videos. We then design a Semantic Human-Body Annotator (SHA) which utilizes SMPL's semantic prior for efficient body part semantic labeling. The generated labels are used to guide the optimization of Gaussian semantic attributes. To address the limited receptive field of point-level MLPs for local features, we also propose a 3D network that integrates geometric and semantic associations for human avatar deformation. We further implement three key strategies to enhance the semantic accuracy of 3D Gaussians and rendering quality: semantic projection with 2D regularization, semantic-guided density regularization and semantic-aware regularization with neighborhood consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SG-GS achieves state-of-the-art geometry and appearance reconstruction performance.

- **Summary**: Recently, Super-Resolution (SR) achieved significant performance improvement by employing neural networks. Most SR methods conventionally train a single model for each targeted scale, which increases redundancy in training and deployment in proportion to the number of scales targeted. This paper challenges this conventional fixed-scale approach. Our preliminary analysis reveals that, surprisingly, encoders trained at different scales extract similar features from images. Furthermore, the commonly used scale-specific upsampler, Sub-Pixel Convolution (SPConv), exhibits significant inter-scale correlations. Based on these observations, we propose a framework for training multiple integer scales simultaneously with a single model. We use a single encoder to extract features and introduce a novel upsampler, Implicit Grid Convolution~(IGConv), which integrates SPConv at all scales within a single module to predict multiple scales. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that training multiple scales with a single model reduces the training budget and stored parameters by one-third while achieving equivalent inference latency and comparable performance. Furthermore, we propose IGConv$^{+}$, which addresses spectral bias and input-independent upsampling and uses ensemble prediction to improve performance. As a result, SRFormer-IGConv$^{+}$ achieves a remarkable 0.25dB improvement in PSNR at Urban100$\times$4 while reducing the training budget, stored parameters, and inference cost compared to the existing SRFormer.

- **Summary**: Freeform handwriting authentication verifies a person's identity from their writing style and habits in messy handwriting data. This technique has gained widespread attention in recent years as a valuable tool for various fields, e.g., fraud prevention and cultural heritage protection. However, it still remains a challenging task in reality due to three reasons: (i) severe damage, (ii) complex high-dimensional features, and (iii) lack of supervision. To address these issues, we propose SherlockNet, an energy-oriented two-branch contrastive self-supervised learning framework for robust and fast freeform handwriting authentication. It consists of four stages: (i) pre-processing: converting manuscripts into energy distributions using a novel plug-and-play energy-oriented operator to eliminate the influence of noise; (ii) generalized pre-training: learning general representation through two-branch momentum-based adaptive contrastive learning with the energy distributions, which handles the high-dimensional features and spatial dependencies of handwriting; (iii) personalized fine-tuning: calibrating the learned knowledge using a small amount of labeled data from downstream tasks; and (iv) practical application: identifying individual handwriting from scrambled, missing, or forged data efficiently and conveniently. Considering the practicality, we construct EN-HA, a novel dataset that simulates data forgery and severe damage in real applications. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets including our EN-HA, and the results prove the robustness and efficiency of SherlockNet.

- **Summary**: Location information is pivotal for the automation and intelligence of terminal devices and edge-cloud IoT systems, such as autonomous vehicles and augmented reality. However, achieving reliable positioning across diverse IoT applications remains challenging due to significant training costs and the necessity of densely collected data. To tackle these issues, we have innovatively applied the selective state space (SSM) model to visual localization, introducing a new model named MambaLoc. The proposed model demonstrates exceptional training efficiency by capitalizing on the SSM model's strengths in efficient feature extraction, rapid computation, and memory optimization, and it further ensures robustness in sparse data environments due to its parameter sparsity. Additionally, we propose the Global Information Selector (GIS), which leverages selective SSM to implicitly achieve the efficient global feature extraction capabilities of Non-local Neural Networks. This design leverages the computational efficiency of the SSM model alongside the Non-local Neural Networks' capacity to capture long-range dependencies with minimal layers. Consequently, the GIS enables effective global information capture while significantly accelerating convergence. Our extensive experimental validation using public indoor and outdoor datasets first demonstrates our model's effectiveness, followed by evidence of its versatility with various existing localization models. Our code and models are publicly available to support further research and development in this area.

- **Summary**: Early detection of skin cancer relies on precise segmentation of dermoscopic images of skin lesions. However, this task is challenging due to the irregular shape of the lesion, the lack of sharp borders, and the presence of artefacts such as marker colours and hair follicles. Recent methods for melanoma segmentation are U-Nets and fully connected networks (FCNs). As the depth of these neural network models increases, they can face issues like the vanishing gradient problem and parameter redundancy, potentially leading to a decrease in the Jaccard index of the segmentation model. In this study, we introduced a novel network named TESL-Net for the segmentation of skin lesions. The proposed TESL-Net involves a hybrid network that combines the local features of a CNN encoder-decoder architecture with long-range and temporal dependencies using bi-convolutional long-short-term memory (Bi-ConvLSTM) networks and a Swin transformer. This enables the model to account for the uncertainty of segmentation over time and capture contextual channel relationships in the data. We evaluated the efficacy of TESL-Net in three commonly used datasets (ISIC 2016, ISIC 2017, and ISIC 2018) for the segmentation of skin lesions. The proposed TESL-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, as evidenced by a significantly elevated Jaccard index demonstrated by empirical results.

- **Summary**: The correct insertion of virtual objects in images of real-world scenes requires a deep understanding of the scene's lighting, geometry and materials, as well as the image formation process. While recent large-scale diffusion models have shown strong generative and inpainting capabilities, we find that current models do not sufficiently "understand" the scene shown in a single picture to generate consistent lighting effects (shadows, bright reflections, etc.) while preserving the identity and details of the composited object. We propose using a personalized large diffusion model as guidance to a physically based inverse rendering process. Our method recovers scene lighting and tone-mapping parameters, allowing the photorealistic composition of arbitrary virtual objects in single frames or videos of indoor or outdoor scenes. Our physically based pipeline further enables automatic materials and tone-mapping refinement.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have highlighted the significant potential of prompt tuning for adapting these models to a wide range of downstream tasks. However, existing prompt tuning methods typically map an image to a single representation, limiting the model's ability to capture the diverse ways an image can be described. To address this limitation, we investigate the impact of visual prompts on the model's generalization capability and introduce a novel method termed Multi-Representation Guided Prompt Tuning (MePT). Specifically, MePT employs a three-branch framework that focuses on diverse salient regions, uncovering the inherent knowledge within images which is crucial for robust generalization. Further, we employ efficient self-ensemble techniques to integrate these versatile image representations, allowing MePT to learn all conditional, marginal, and fine-grained distributions effectively. We validate the effectiveness of MePT through extensive experiments, demonstrating significant improvements on both base-to-novel class prediction and domain generalization tasks.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have exhibited remarkable success in the field of histopathology image analysis. On the other hand, the contemporary trend of employing large models and extensive datasets has underscored the significance of dataset distillation, which involves compressing large-scale datasets into a condensed set of synthetic samples, offering distinct advantages in improving training efficiency and streamlining downstream applications. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset distillation algorithm tailored for histopathology image datasets (Histo-DD), which integrates stain normalisation and model augmentation into the distillation progress. Such integration can substantially enhance the compatibility with histopathology images that are often characterised by high colour heterogeneity. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the generated histopathology samples in both patch-level and slide-level classification tasks. The experimental results, carried out on three publicly available WSI datasets, including Camelyon16, TCGA-IDH, and UniToPath, demonstrate that the proposed Histo-DD can generate more informative synthetic patches than previous coreset selection and patch sampling methods. Moreover, the synthetic samples can preserve discriminative information, substantially reduce training efforts, and exhibit architecture-agnostic properties. These advantages indicate that synthetic samples can serve as an alternative to large-scale datasets.

- **Summary**: In light of the inherent entailment relations between images and text, hyperbolic point vector embeddings, leveraging the hierarchical modeling advantages of hyperbolic space, have been utilized for visual semantic representation learning. However, point vector embedding approaches fail to address the issue of semantic uncertainty, where an image may have multiple interpretations, and text may refer to different images, a phenomenon particularly prevalent in the medical domain. Therefor, we propose \textbf{HYDEN}, a novel hyperbolic density embedding based image-text representation learning approach tailored for specific medical domain data. This method integrates text-aware local features alongside global features from images, mapping image-text features to density features in hyperbolic space via using hyperbolic pseudo-Gaussian distributions. An encapsulation loss function is employed to model the partial order relations between image-text density distributions. Experimental results demonstrate the interpretability of our approach and its superior performance compared to the baseline methods across various zero-shot tasks and different datasets.

- **Comment**: MSP60K PAR Benchmark Dataset, LLM based PAR model, In Peer Review
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is one of the indispensable tasks in human-centered research. However, existing datasets neglect different domains (e.g., environments, times, populations, and data sources), only conducting simple random splits, and the performance of these datasets has already approached saturation. In the past five years, no large-scale dataset has been opened to the public. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new large-scale, cross-domain pedestrian attribute recognition dataset to fill the data gap, termed MSP60K. It consists of 60,122 images and 57 attribute annotations across eight scenarios. Synthetic degradation is also conducted to further narrow the gap between the dataset and real-world challenging scenarios. To establish a more rigorous benchmark, we evaluate 17 representative PAR models under both random and cross-domain split protocols on our dataset. Additionally, we propose an innovative Large Language Model (LLM) augmented PAR framework, named LLM-PAR. This framework processes pedestrian images through a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone to extract features and introduces a multi-embedding query Transformer to learn partial-aware features for attribute classification. Significantly, we enhance this framework with LLM for ensemble learning and visual feature augmentation. Comprehensive experiments across multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly validated the efficacy of our proposed framework. The dataset and source code accompanying this paper will be made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenPAR}.

- **Summary**: Intraoperative CT imaging serves as a crucial resource for surgical guidance; however, it may not always be readily accessible or practical to implement. In scenarios where CT imaging is not an option, reconstructing CT scans from X-rays can offer a viable alternative. In this paper, we introduce an innovative method for 3D CT reconstruction utilizing biplanar X-rays. Distinct from previous research that relies on conventional image generation techniques, our approach leverages a conditional diffusion process to tackle the task of reconstruction. More precisely, we employ a diffusion-based probabilistic model trained to produce 3D CT images based on orthogonal biplanar X-rays. To improve the structural integrity of the reconstructed images, we incorporate a novel projection loss function. Experimental results validate that our proposed method surpasses existing state-of-the-art benchmarks in both visual image quality and multiple evaluative metrics. Specifically, our technique achieves a higher Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.83, a relative increase of 10\%, and a lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) of 83.43, which represents a relative decrease of 25\%.



### Mutually-Aware Feature Learning for Few-Shot Object Counting

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Few-shot object counting has garnered significant attention for its practicality as it aims to count target objects in a query image based on given exemplars without the need for additional training. However, there is a shortcoming in the prevailing extract-and-match approach: query and exemplar features lack interaction during feature extraction since they are extracted unaware of each other and later correlated based on similarity. This can lead to insufficient target awareness of the extracted features, resulting in target confusion in precisely identifying the actual target when multiple class objects coexist. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, Mutually-Aware FEAture learning(MAFEA), which encodes query and exemplar features mutually aware of each other from the outset. By encouraging interaction between query and exemplar features throughout the entire pipeline, we can obtain target-aware features that are robust to a multi-category scenario. Furthermore, we introduce a background token to effectively associate the target region of query with exemplars and decouple its background region from them. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our model reaches a new state-of-the-art performance on the two challenging benchmarks, FSCD-LVIS and FSC-147, with a remarkably reduced degree of the target confusion problem.

- **Summary**: For surgical planning and intra-operation imaging, CT reconstruction using X-ray images can potentially be an important alternative when CT imaging is not available or not feasible. In this paper, we aim to use biplanar X-rays to reconstruct a 3D CT image, because biplanar X-rays convey richer information than single-view X-rays and are more commonly used by surgeons. Different from previous studies in which the two X-ray views were treated indifferently when fusing the cross-view data, we propose a novel attention-informed coarse-to-fine cross-view fusion method to combine the features extracted from the orthogonal biplanar views. This method consists of a view attention alignment sub-module and a fine-distillation sub-module that are designed to work together to highlight the unique or complementary information from each of the views. Experiments have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed method over the SOTA methods.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In this work, we propose a training-free, trajectory-based controllable T2I approach, termed TraDiffusion. This novel method allows users to effortlessly guide image generation via mouse trajectories. To achieve precise control, we design a distance awareness energy function to effectively guide latent variables, ensuring that the focus of generation is within the areas defined by the trajectory. The energy function encompasses a control function to draw the generation closer to the specified trajectory and a movement function to diminish activity in areas distant from the trajectory. Through extensive experiments and qualitative assessments on the COCO dataset, the results reveal that TraDiffusion facilitates simpler, more natural image control. Moreover, it showcases the ability to manipulate salient regions, attributes, and relationships within the generated images, alongside visual input based on arbitrary or enhanced trajectories.

- **Summary**: Inspired by the tremendous success of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing X-ray medical report generation methods attempt to leverage large models to achieve better performance. They usually adopt a Transformer to extract the visual features of a given X-ray image, and then, feed them into the LLM for text generation. How to extract more effective information for the LLMs to help them improve final results is an urgent problem that needs to be solved. Additionally, the use of visual Transformer models also brings high computational complexity. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel context-guided efficient X-ray medical report generation framework. Specifically, we introduce the Mamba as the vision backbone with linear complexity, and the performance obtained is comparable to that of the strong Transformer model. More importantly, we perform context retrieval from the training set for samples within each mini-batch during the training phase, utilizing both positively and negatively related samples to enhance feature representation and discriminative learning. Subsequently, we feed the vision tokens, context information, and prompt statements to invoke the LLM for generating high-quality medical reports. Extensive experiments on three X-ray report generation datasets (i.e., IU-Xray, MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert Plus) fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed model.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image customization, which takes given texts and images depicting given subjects as inputs, aims to synthesize new images that align with both text semantics and subject appearance. This task provides precise control over details that text alone cannot capture and is fundamental for various real-world applications, garnering significant interest from academia and industry. Existing works follow the pseudo-word paradigm, which involves representing given subjects as pseudo-words and combining them with given texts to collectively guide the generation. However, the inherent conflict and entanglement between the pseudo-words and texts result in a dual-optimum paradox, where subject similarity and text controllability cannot be optimal simultaneously. We propose a novel real-words paradigm termed RealCustom++ that instead represents subjects as non-conflict real words, thereby disentangling subject similarity from text controllability and allowing both to be optimized simultaneously. Specifically, RealCustom++ introduces a novel "train-inference" decoupled framework: (1) During training, RealCustom++ learns the alignment between vision conditions and all real words in the text, ensuring high subject-similarity generation in open domains. This is achieved by the cross-layer cross-scale projector to robustly and finely extract subject features, and a curriculum training recipe that adapts the generated subject to diverse poses and sizes. (2) During inference, leveraging the learned general alignment, an adaptive mask guidance is proposed to only customize the generation of the specific target real word, keeping other subject-irrelevant regions uncontaminated to ensure high text-controllability in real-time.

- **Summary**: Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in males worldwide, and mpMRI is commonly used for diagnosis. However, interpreting mpMRI is challenging and requires expertise from radiologists. This highlights the urgent need for automated grading in mpMRI. Existing studies lack integration of clinical prior information and suffer from uneven training sample distribution due to prevalence. Therefore, we propose a solution that incorporates prior knowledge, addresses the issue of uneven medical sample distribution, and maintains high interpretability in mpMRI. Firstly, we introduce Prior Knowledge-Based Feature Extraction, which mathematically models the PI-RADS criteria for prostate cancer as diagnostic information into model training. Secondly, we propose Adaptive Recall Feedback Loss to address the extremely imbalanced data problem. This method adjusts the training dynamically based on accuracy and recall in the validation set, resulting in high accuracy and recall simultaneously in the testing set.Thirdly, we design an Enhanced Cascade Prostate Cancer Classifier that classifies prostate cancer into different levels in an interpretable way, which refines the classification results and helps with clinical intervention. Our method is validated through experiments on the PI-CAI dataset and outperforms other methods with a more balanced result in both accuracy and recall rate.

- **Summary**: Iris recognition is widely used in high-security scenarios due to its stability and distinctiveness. However, the acquisition of iris images typically requires near-infrared illumination and near-infrared band filters, leading to significant and consistent differences in imaging across devices. This underscores the importance of developing cross-domain capabilities in iris anti-spoofing methods. Despite this need, there is no dataset available that comprehensively evaluates the generalization ability of the iris anti-spoofing task. To address this gap, we propose the IrisGeneral dataset, which includes 10 subsets, belonging to 7 databases, published by 4 institutions, collected with 6 types of devices. IrisGeneral is designed with three protocols, aimed at evaluating average performance, cross-racial generalization, and cross-device generalization of iris anti-spoofing models. To tackle the challenge of integrating multiple sub-datasets in IrisGeneral, we employ multiple parameter sets to learn from the various subsets. Specifically, we utilize the Mixture of Experts (MoE) to fit complex data distributions using multiple sub-neural networks. To further enhance the generalization capabilities, we introduce a novel method Masked-MoE (MMoE). It randomly masks a portion of tokens for some experts and requires their outputs to be similar to the unmasked experts, which improves the generalization ability and effectively mitigates the overfitting issue produced by MoE. We selected ResNet50, VIT-B/16, CLIP, and FLIP as representative models and benchmarked them on the IrisGeneral dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MMoE with CLIP achieves the best performance on IrisGeneral.

- **Summary**: Human Action Recognition (HAR) stands as a pivotal research domain in both computer vision and artificial intelligence, with RGB cameras dominating as the preferred tool for investigation and innovation in this field. However, in real-world applications, RGB cameras encounter numerous challenges, including light conditions, fast motion, and privacy concerns. Consequently, bio-inspired event cameras have garnered increasing attention due to their advantages of low energy consumption, high dynamic range, etc. Nevertheless, most existing event-based HAR datasets are low resolution ($346 \times 260$). In this paper, we propose a large-scale, high-definition ($1280 \times 800$) human action recognition dataset based on the CeleX-V event camera, termed CeleX-HAR. It encompasses 150 commonly occurring action categories, comprising a total of 124,625 video sequences. Various factors such as multi-view, illumination, action speed, and occlusion are considered when recording these data. To build a more comprehensive benchmark dataset, we report over 20 mainstream HAR models for future works to compare. In addition, we also propose a novel Mamba vision backbone network for event stream based HAR, termed EVMamba, which equips the spatial plane multi-directional scanning and novel voxel temporal scanning mechanism. By encoding and mining the spatio-temporal information of event streams, our EVMamba has achieved favorable results across multiple datasets. Both the dataset and source code will be released on \url{https://github.com/Event-AHU/CeleX-HAR}

- **Summary**: Disentanglement of visual features of primitives (i.e., attributes and objects) has shown exceptional results in Compositional Zero-shot Learning (CZSL). However, due to the feature divergence of an attribute (resp. object) when combined with different objects (resp. attributes), it is challenging to learn disentangled primitive features that are general across different compositions. To this end, we propose the solution of cross-composition feature disentanglement, which takes multiple primitive-sharing compositions as inputs and constrains the disentangled primitive features to be general across these compositions. More specifically, we leverage a compositional graph to define the overall primitive-sharing relationships between compositions, and build a task-specific architecture upon the recently successful large pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) CLIP, with dual cross-composition disentangling adapters (called L-Adapter and V-Adapter) inserted into CLIP's frozen text and image encoders, respectively. Evaluation on three popular CZSL benchmarks shows that our proposed solution significantly improves the performance of CZSL, and its components have been verified by solid ablation studies.

- **Summary**: Traditional animation generation methods depend on training generative models with human-labelled data, entailing a sophisticated multi-stage pipeline that demands substantial human effort and incurs high training costs. Due to limited prompting plans, these methods typically produce brief, information-poor, and context-incoherent animations. To overcome these limitations and automate the animation process, we pioneer the introduction of large multimodal models (LMMs) as the core processor to build an autonomous animation-making agent, named Anim-Director. This agent mainly harnesses the advanced understanding and reasoning capabilities of LMMs and generative AI tools to create animated videos from concise narratives or simple instructions. Specifically, it operates in three main stages: Firstly, the Anim-Director generates a coherent storyline from user inputs, followed by a detailed director's script that encompasses settings of character profiles and interior/exterior descriptions, and context-coherent scene descriptions that include appearing characters, interiors or exteriors, and scene events. Secondly, we employ LMMs with the image generation tool to produce visual images of settings and scenes. These images are designed to maintain visual consistency across different scenes using a visual-language prompting method that combines scene descriptions and images of the appearing character and setting. Thirdly, scene images serve as the foundation for producing animated videos, with LMMs generating prompts to guide this process. The whole process is notably autonomous without manual intervention, as the LMMs interact seamlessly with generative tools to generate prompts, evaluate visual quality, and select the best one to optimize the final output.

- **Summary**: Obtaining annotated table structure data for complex tables is a challenging task due to the inherent diversity and complexity of real-world document layouts. The scarcity of publicly available datasets with comprehensive annotations for intricate table structures hinders the development and evaluation of models designed for such scenarios. This research paper introduces a novel approach for generating annotated images for table structure by leveraging conditioned mask images of rows and columns through the application of latent diffusion models. The proposed method aims to enhance the quality of synthetic data used for training object detection models. Specifically, the study employs a conditioning mechanism to guide the generation of complex document table images, ensuring a realistic representation of table layouts. To evaluate the effectiveness of the generated data, we employ the popular YOLOv5 object detection model for training. The generated table images serve as valuable training samples, enriching the dataset with diverse table structures. The model is subsequently tested on the challenging pubtables-1m testset, a benchmark for table structure recognition in complex document layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that the introduced approach significantly improves the quality of synthetic data for training, leading to YOLOv5 models with enhanced performance. The mean Average Precision (mAP) values obtained on the pubtables-1m testset showcase results closely aligned with state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, low FID results obtained on the synthetic data further validate the efficacy of the proposed methodology in generating annotated images for table structure.

- **Summary**: Computer-assisted surgery (CAS) systems are designed to assist surgeons during procedures, thereby reducing complications and enhancing patient care. Training machine learning models for these systems requires a large corpus of annotated datasets, which is challenging to obtain in the surgical domain due to patient privacy concerns and the significant labeling effort required from doctors. Previous methods have explored unpaired image translation using generative models to create realistic surgical images from simulations. However, these approaches have struggled to produce high-quality, diverse surgical images. In this work, we introduce \emph{SurgicaL-CD}, a consistency-distilled diffusion method to generate realistic surgical images with only a few sampling steps without paired data. We evaluate our approach on three datasets, assessing the generated images in terms of quality and utility as downstream training datasets. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms GANs and diffusion-based approaches. Our code is available at \url{https://gitlab.com/nct_tso_public/gan2diffusion}.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is a significant perception task in autonomous driving. It suffers from the risks of adversarial examples. In the past few years, deep learning has gradually transitioned from convolutional neural network (CNN) models with a relatively small number of parameters to foundation models with a huge number of parameters. The segment-anything model (SAM) is a generalized image segmentation framework that is capable of handling various types of images and is able to recognize and segment arbitrary objects in an image without the need to train on a specific object. It is a unified model that can handle diverse downstream tasks, including semantic segmentation, object detection, and tracking. In the task of semantic segmentation for autonomous driving, it is significant to study the zero-shot adversarial robustness of SAM. Therefore, we deliver a systematic empirical study on the robustness of SAM without additional training. Based on the experimental results, the zero-shot adversarial robustness of the SAM under the black-box corruptions and white-box adversarial attacks is acceptable, even without the need for additional training. The finding of this study is insightful in that the gigantic model parameters and huge amounts of training data lead to the phenomenon of emergence, which builds a guarantee of adversarial robustness. SAM is a vision foundation model that can be regarded as an early prototype of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) pipeline. In such a pipeline, a unified model can handle diverse tasks. Therefore, this research not only inspects the impact of vision foundation models on safe autonomous driving but also provides a perspective on developing trustworthy AGI.

- **Summary**: Training deep learning models for semantic occupancy prediction is challenging due to factors such as a large number of occupancy cells, severe occlusion, limited visual cues, complicated driving scenarios, etc. Recent methods often adopt transformer-based architectures given their strong capability in learning input-conditioned weights and long-range relationships. However, transformer-based networks are notorious for their quadratic computation complexity, seriously undermining their efficacy and deployment in semantic occupancy prediction. Inspired by the global modeling and linear computation complexity of the Mamba architecture, we present the first Mamba-based network for semantic occupancy prediction, termed OccMamba. However, directly applying the Mamba architecture to the occupancy prediction task yields unsatisfactory performance due to the inherent domain gap between the linguistic and 3D domains. To relieve this problem, we present a simple yet effective 3D-to-1D reordering operation, i.e., height-prioritized 2D Hilbert expansion. It can maximally retain the spatial structure of point clouds as well as facilitate the processing of Mamba blocks. Our OccMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on three prevalent occupancy prediction benchmarks, including OpenOccupancy, SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS. Notably, on OpenOccupancy, our OccMamba outperforms the previous state-of-the-art Co-Occ by 3.1% IoU and 3.2% mIoU, respectively. Codes will be released upon publication.

- **Summary**: Egocentric videos present unique challenges for 3D scene understanding due to rapid camera motion, frequent object occlusions, and limited object visibility. This paper introduces a novel approach to instance segmentation and tracking in first-person video that leverages 3D awareness to overcome these obstacles. Our method integrates scene geometry, 3D object centroid tracking, and instance segmentation to create a robust framework for analyzing dynamic egocentric scenes. By incorporating spatial and temporal cues, we achieve superior performance compared to state-of-the-art 2D approaches. Extensive evaluations on the challenging EPIC Fields dataset demonstrate significant improvements across a range of tracking and segmentation consistency metrics. Specifically, our method outperforms the next best performing approach by $7$ points in Association Accuracy (AssA) and $4.5$ points in IDF1 score, while reducing the number of ID switches by $73\%$ to $80\%$ across various object categories. Leveraging our tracked instance segmentations, we showcase downstream applications in 3D object reconstruction and amodal video object segmentation in these egocentric settings.

- **Summary**: With sepsis remaining a leading cause of mortality, early identification of septic patients and those at high risk of death is a challenge of high socioeconomic importance. The driving hypothesis of this study was that hyperspectral imaging (HSI) could provide novel biomarkers for sepsis diagnosis and treatment management due to its potential to monitor microcirculatory alterations. We conducted a comprehensive study involving HSI data of the palm and fingers from more than 480 patients on the day of their intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The findings demonstrate that HSI measurements can predict sepsis with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.80 (95 % confidence interval (CI) [0.76; 0.84]) and mortality with an AUROC of 0.72 (95 % CI [0.65; 0.79]). The predictive performance improves substantially when additional clinical data is incorporated, leading to an AUROC of up to 0.94 (95 % CI [0.92; 0.96]) for sepsis and 0.84 (95 % CI [0.78; 0.89]) for mortality. We conclude that HSI presents novel imaging biomarkers for the rapid, non-invasive prediction of sepsis and mortality, suggesting its potential as an important modality for guiding diagnosis and treatment.

- **Summary**: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive performance on a wide range of natural image segmentation tasks. However, its performance significantly deteriorates when directly applied to medical domain, due to the remarkable differences between natural images and medical images. Some researchers have attempted to train SAM on large scale medical datasets. However, poor zero-shot performance is observed from the experimental results. In this context, inspired by the superior performance of U-Net-like models in medical image segmentation, we propose SAMUNet, a new foundation model which incorporates U-Net to the original SAM, to fully leverage the powerful contextual modeling ability of convolutions. To be specific, we parallel a convolutional branch in the image encoder, which is trained independently with the vision Transformer branch frozen. Additionally, we employ multi-scale fusion in the mask decoder, to facilitate accurate segmentation of objects with different scales. We train SAM-UNet on SA-Med2D-16M, the largest 2-dimensional medical image segmentation dataset to date, yielding a universal pretrained model for medical images. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the model, and state-of-the-art result is achieved, with a dice similarity coefficient score of 0.883 on SA-Med2D-16M dataset. Specifically, in zero-shot segmentation experiments, our model not only significantly outperforms previous large medical SAM models across all modalities, but also substantially mitigates the performance degradation seen on unseen modalities. It should be highlighted that SAM-UNet is an efficient and extensible foundation model, which can be further fine-tuned for other downstream tasks in medical community.

Meaning: This study validates the efficacy of our deep learning model to accurately detect rotation cuff tears from radiographs, offering a viable pre-assessment or alternative to more expensive imaging techniques such as MRI.

- **Summary**: Explaining the decisions of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for medical images has become increasingly important. Existing attribution methods have difficulty explaining the meaning of pixels while existing concept-based methods are limited by additional annotations or specific model structures that are difficult to apply to ultrasound images. In this paper, we propose the Lesion Concept Explainer (LCE) framework, which combines attribution methods with concept-based methods. We introduce the Segment Anything Model (SAM), fine-tuned on a large number of medical images, for concept discovery to enable a meaningful explanation of ultrasound image DNNs. The proposed framework is evaluated in terms of both faithfulness and understandability. We point out deficiencies in the popular faithfulness evaluation metrics and propose a new evaluation metric. Our evaluation of public and private breast ultrasound datasets (BUSI and FG-US-B) shows that LCE performs well compared to commonly-used explainability methods. Finally, we also validate that LCE can consistently provide reliable explanations for more meaningful fine-grained diagnostic tasks in breast ultrasound.

- **Summary**: Underwater imagery is often compromised by factors such as color distortion and low contrast, posing challenges for high-level vision tasks. Recent underwater image restoration (UIR) methods either analyze the input image at full resolution, resulting in spatial richness but contextual weakness, or progressively from high to low resolution, yielding reliable semantic information but reduced spatial accuracy. Here, we propose a lightweight multi-stage network called Lit-Net that focuses on multi-resolution and multi-scale image analysis for restoring underwater images while retaining original resolution during the first stage, refining features in the second, and focusing on reconstruction in the final stage. Our novel encoder block utilizes parallel $1\times1$ convolution layers to capture local information and speed up operations. Further, we incorporate a modified weighted color channel-specific $l_1$ loss ($cl_1$) function to recover color and detail information. Extensive experimentations on publicly available datasets suggest our model's superiority over recent state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvement in qualitative and quantitative measures, such as $29.477$ dB PSNR ($1.92\%$ improvement) and $0.851$ SSIM ($2.87\%$ improvement) on the EUVP dataset. The contributions of Lit-Net offer a more robust approach to underwater image enhancement and super-resolution, which is of considerable importance for underwater autonomous vehicles and surveillance.

- **Summary**: Model editing aims to correct outdated or erroneous knowledge in large models without costly retraining. Recent research discovered that the mid-layer representation of the subject's final token in a prompt has a strong influence on factual predictions, and developed Large Language Model (LLM) editing techniques based on this observation. However, for Vision-LLMs (VLLMs), how visual representations impact the predictions from a decoder-only language model remains largely unexplored. To the best of our knowledge, model editing for VLLMs has not been extensively studied in the literature. In this work, we employ the contribution allocation and noise perturbation methods to measure the contributions of visual representations for token predictions. Our attribution analysis shows that visual representations in mid-to-later layers that are highly relevant to the prompt contribute significantly to predictions. Based on these insights, we propose VisEdit, a novel model editor for VLLMs that effectively corrects knowledge by editing intermediate visual representations in regions important to the edit prompt. We evaluated VisEdit using multiple VLLM backbones and public VLLM editing benchmark datasets. The results show the superiority of VisEdit over the strong baselines adapted from existing state-of-the-art editors for LLMs.

- **Summary**: Procedural activity videos often exhibit a long-tailed action distribution due to varying action frequencies and durations. However, state-of-the-art temporal action segmentation methods overlook the long tail and fail to recognize tail actions. Existing long-tail methods make class-independent assumptions and struggle to identify tail classes when applied to temporal segmentation frameworks. This work proposes a novel group-wise temporal logit adjustment~(G-TLA) framework that combines a group-wise softmax formulation while leveraging activity information and action ordering for logit adjustment. The proposed framework significantly improves in segmenting tail actions without any performance loss on head actions.

- **Summary**: Full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) models generally operate by measuring the visual differences between a degraded image and its reference. However, existing FR-IQA models including both the classical ones (eg, PSNR and SSIM) and deep-learning based measures (eg, LPIPS and DISTS) still exhibit limitations in capturing the full perception characteristics of the human visual system (HVS). In this paper, instead of designing a new FR-IQA measure, we aim to explore a generalized human visual attention estimation strategy to mimic the process of human quality rating and enhance existing IQA models. In particular, we model human attention generation by measuring the statistical dependency between the degraded image and the reference image. The dependency is captured in a training-free manner by our proposed sliced maximal information coefficient and exhibits surprising generalization in different IQA measures. Experimental results verify the performance of existing IQA models can be consistently improved when our attention module is incorporated.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have become a powerful tool for modeling 3D scenes from multiple images. However, NeRFs remain difficult to segment into semantically meaningful regions. Previous approaches to 3D segmentation of NeRFs either require user interaction to isolate a single object, or they rely on 2D semantic masks with a limited number of classes for supervision. As a consequence, they generalize poorly to class-agnostic masks automatically generated in real scenes. This is attributable to the ambiguity arising from zero-shot segmentation, yielding inconsistent masks across views. In contrast, we propose a method that is robust to inconsistent segmentations and successfully decomposes the scene into a set of objects of any class. By introducing a limited number of competing object slots against which masks are matched, a meaningful object representation emerges that best explains the 2D supervision and minimizes an additional regularization term. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of our method to generate 3D panoptic segmentations on complex scenes, and extract high-quality 3D assets from NeRFs that can then be used in virtual 3D environments.

- **Summary**: Inspired by the idea of Positive-incentive Noise (Pi-Noise or $\pi$-Noise) that aims at learning the reliable noise beneficial to tasks, we scientifically investigate the connection between contrastive learning and $\pi$-noise in this paper. By converting the contrastive loss to an auxiliary Gaussian distribution to quantitatively measure the difficulty of the specific contrastive model under the information theory framework, we properly define the task entropy, the core concept of $\pi$-noise, of contrastive learning. It is further proved that the predefined data augmentation in the standard contrastive learning paradigm can be regarded as a kind of point estimation of $\pi$-noise. Inspired by the theoretical study, a framework that develops a $\pi$-noise generator to learn the beneficial noise (instead of estimation) as data augmentations for contrast is proposed. The designed framework can be applied to diverse types of data and is also completely compatible with the existing contrastive models. From the visualization, we surprisingly find that the proposed method successfully learns effective augmentations.

- **Summary**: 3D pose estimation from a 2D cross-sectional view enables healthcare professionals to navigate through the 3D space, and such techniques initiate automatic guidance in many image-guided radiology applications. In this work, we investigate how estimating 3D fetal pose from freehand 2D ultrasound scanning can guide a sonographer to locate a head standard plane. Fetal head pose is estimated by the proposed Pose-GuideNet, a novel 2D/3D registration approach to align freehand 2D ultrasound to a 3D anatomical atlas without the acquisition of 3D ultrasound. To facilitate the 2D to 3D cross-dimensional projection, we exploit the prior knowledge in the atlas to align the standard plane frame in a freehand scan. A semantic-aware contrastive-based approach is further proposed to align the frames that are off standard planes based on their anatomical similarity. In the experiment, we enhance the existing assessment of freehand image localization by comparing the transformation of its estimated pose towards standard plane with the corresponding probe motion, which reflects the actual view change in 3D anatomy. Extensive results on two clinical head biometry tasks show that Pose-GuideNet not only accurately predicts pose but also successfully predicts the direction of the fetal head. Evaluations with probe motions further demonstrate the feasibility of adopting Pose-GuideNet for freehand ultrasound-assisted navigation in a sensor-free environment.

- **Summary**: Recently, transformers have captured significant interest in the area of single-image super-resolution tasks, demonstrating substantial gains in performance. Current models heavily depend on the network's extensive ability to extract high-level semantic details from images while overlooking the effective utilization of multi-scale image details and intermediate information within the network. Furthermore, it has been observed that high-frequency areas in images present significant complexity for super-resolution compared to low-frequency areas. This work proposes a transformer-based super-resolution architecture called ML-CrAIST that addresses this gap by utilizing low-high frequency information in multiple scales. Unlike most of the previous work (either spatial or channel), we operate spatial and channel self-attention, which concurrently model pixel interaction from both spatial and channel dimensions, exploiting the inherent correlations across spatial and channel axis. Further, we devise a cross-attention block for super-resolution, which explores the correlations between low and high-frequency information. Quantitative and qualitative assessments indicate that our proposed ML-CrAIST surpasses state-of-the-art super-resolution methods (e.g., 0.15 dB gain @Manga109 $\times$4).

- **Summary**: Understanding human attention is crucial for vision science and AI. While many models exist for free-viewing, less is known about task-driven image exploration. To address this, we introduce CapMIT1003, a dataset with captions and click-contingent image explorations, to study human attention during the captioning task. We also present NevaClip, a zero-shot method for predicting visual scanpaths by combining CLIP models with NeVA algorithms. NevaClip generates fixations to align the representations of foveated visual stimuli and captions. The simulated scanpaths outperform existing human attention models in plausibility for captioning and free-viewing tasks. This research enhances the understanding of human attention and advances scanpath prediction models.

- **Summary**: Sign Language Representation Learning (SLRL) is crucial for a range of sign language-related downstream tasks such as Sign Language Translation (SLT) and Sign Language Retrieval (SLRet). Recently, many gloss-based and gloss-free SLRL methods have been proposed, showing promising performance. Among them, the gloss-free approach shows promise for strong scalability without relying on gloss annotations. However, it currently faces suboptimal solutions due to challenges in encoding the intricate, context-sensitive characteristics of sign language videos, mainly struggling to discern essential sign features using a non-monotonic video-text alignment strategy. Therefore, we introduce an innovative pretraining paradigm for gloss-free SLRL, called C${^2}$RL, in this paper. Specifically, rather than merely incorporating a non-monotonic semantic alignment of video and text to learn language-oriented sign features, we emphasize two pivotal aspects of SLRL: Implicit Content Learning (ICL) and Explicit Context Learning (ECL). ICL delves into the content of communication, capturing the nuances, emphasis, timing, and rhythm of the signs. In contrast, ECL focuses on understanding the contextual meaning of signs and converting them into equivalent sentences. Despite its simplicity, extensive experiments confirm that the joint optimization of ICL and ECL results in robust sign language representation and significant performance gains in gloss-free SLT and SLRet tasks. Notably, C${^2}$RL improves the BLEU-4 score by +5.3 on P14T, +10.6 on CSL-daily, +6.2 on OpenASL, and +1.3 on How2Sign. It also boosts the R@1 score by +8.3 on P14T, +14.4 on CSL-daily, and +5.9 on How2Sign. Additionally, we set a new baseline for the OpenASL dataset in the SLRet task.

- **Summary**: Despite recent progress in enhancing the efficacy of Open-Domain Continual Learning (ODCL) in Vision-Language Models (VLM), failing to (1) correctly identify the Task-ID of a test image and (2) use only the category set corresponding to the Task-ID, while preserving the knowledge related to each domain, cannot address the two primary challenges of ODCL: forgetting old knowledge and maintaining zero-shot capabilities, as well as the confusions caused by category-relatedness between domains. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective solution: leveraging intra-domain category-aware prototypes for ODCL in CLIP (DPeCLIP), where the prototype is the key to bridging the above two processes. Concretely, we propose a training-free Task-ID discriminator method, by utilizing prototypes as classifiers for identifying Task-IDs. Furthermore, to maintain the knowledge corresponding to each domain, we incorporate intra-domain category-aware prototypes as domain prior prompts into the training process. Extensive experiments conducted on 11 different datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving 2.37% and 1.14% average improvement in class-incremental and task-incremental settings, respectively.

- **Summary**: 3D pre-training is crucial to 3D perception tasks. However, limited by the difficulties in collecting clean 3D data, 3D pre-training consistently faced data scaling challenges. Inspired by semi-supervised learning leveraging limited labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data, in this work, we propose a novel self-supervised pre-training framework utilizing the real 3D data and the pseudo-3D data lifted from images by a large depth estimation model. Another challenge lies in the efficiency. Previous methods such as Point-BERT and Point-MAE, employ k nearest neighbors to embed 3D tokens, requiring quadratic time complexity. To efficiently pre-train on such a large amount of data, we propose a linear-time-complexity token embedding strategy and a training-efficient 2D reconstruction target. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D classification and few-shot learning while maintaining high pre-training and downstream fine-tuning efficiency.

- **Summary**: Learning with Noisy labels (LNL) poses a significant challenge for the Machine Learning community. Some of the most widely used approaches that select as clean samples for which the model itself (the in-training model) has high confidence, e.g., `small loss', can suffer from the so called `self-confirmation' bias. This bias arises because the in-training model, is at least partially trained on the noisy labels. Furthermore, in the classification case, an additional challenge arises because some of the label noise is between classes that are visually very similar (`hard noise'). This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a method (\textit{CLIPCleaner}) that leverages CLIP, a powerful Vision-Language (VL) model for constructing a zero-shot classifier for efficient, offline, clean sample selection. This has the advantage that the sample selection is decoupled from the in-training model and that the sample selection is aware of the semantic and visual similarities between the classes due to the way that CLIP is trained. We provide theoretical justifications and empirical evidence to demonstrate the advantages of CLIP for LNL compared to conventional pre-trained models. Compared to current methods that combine iterative sample selection with various techniques, \textit{CLIPCleaner} offers a simple, single-step approach that achieves competitive or superior performance on benchmark datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a VL model has been used for sample selection to address the problem of Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL), highlighting their potential in the domain.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across a wide range of tasks such as semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, these networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that add imperceptible perturbations to the input image, leading to false predictions. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous in safety-critical applications like automated driving. While adversarial examples and defense strategies are well-researched in the context of image classification, there is comparatively less research focused on semantic segmentation. Recently, we have proposed an uncertainty-based method for detecting adversarial attacks on neural networks for semantic segmentation. We observed that uncertainty, as measured by the entropy of the output distribution, behaves differently on clean versus adversely perturbed images, and we utilize this property to differentiate between the two. In this extended version of our work, we conduct a detailed analysis of uncertainty-based detection of adversarial attacks including a diverse set of adversarial attacks and various state-of-the-art neural networks. Our numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty-based detection method, which is lightweight and operates as a post-processing step, i.e., no model modifications or knowledge of the adversarial example generation process are required.

- **Summary**: In the realm of Federated Learning (FL), particularly within the manufacturing sector, the strategy for selecting client weights for server aggregation is pivotal for model performance. This study investigates the comparative effectiveness of two weight selection strategies: Final Epoch Weight Selection (FEWS) and Optimal Epoch Weight Selection (OEWS). Designed for manufacturing contexts where collaboration typically involves a limited number of partners (two to four clients), our research focuses on federated image classification tasks. We employ various neural network architectures, including EfficientNet, ResNet, and VGG, to assess the impact of these weight selection strategies on model convergence and robustness.   Our research aims to determine whether FEWS or OEWS enhances the global FL model's performance across communication rounds (CRs). Through empirical analysis and rigorous experimentation, we seek to provide valuable insights for optimizing FL implementations in manufacturing, ensuring that collaborative efforts yield the most effective and reliable models with a limited number of participating clients. The findings from this study are expected to refine FL practices significantly in manufacturing, thereby enhancing the efficiency and performance of collaborative machine learning endeavors in this vital sector.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to tackle the problem of imbalanced multi-class semantic segmentation in deep learning systems. One of the key properties for a good training set is the balancing among the classes. When the input distribution is heavily imbalanced in the number of instances, the learning process could be hindered or difficult to carry on. To this end, we propose a Dynamic Label Injection (DLI) algorithm to impose a uniform distribution in the input batch. Our algorithm computes the current batch defect distribution and re-balances it by transferring defects using a combination of Poisson-based seamless image cloning and cut-paste techniques. A thorough experimental section on the Magnetic Tiles dataset shows better results of DLI compared to other balancing loss approaches also in the challenging weakly-supervised setup.

- **Summary**: Hand pose represents key information for action recognition in the egocentric perspective, where the user is interacting with objects. We propose to improve egocentric 3D hand pose estimation based on RGB frames only by using pseudo-depth images. Incorporating state-of-the-art single RGB image depth estimation techniques, we generate pseudo-depth representations of the frames and use distance knowledge to segment irrelevant parts of the scene. The resulting depth maps are then used as segmentation masks for the RGB frames. Experimental results on H2O Dataset confirm the high accuracy of the estimated pose with our method in an action recognition task. The 3D hand pose, together with information from object detection, is processed by a transformer-based action recognition network, resulting in an accuracy of 91.73%, outperforming all state-of-the-art methods. Estimations of 3D hand pose result in competitive performance with existing methods with a mean pose error of 28.66 mm. This method opens up new possibilities for employing distance information in egocentric 3D hand pose estimation without relying on depth sensors.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in photo-realistic novel view synthesis have been significantly driven by Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Nevertheless, the explicit nature of 3DGS data entails considerable storage requirements, highlighting a pressing need for more efficient data representations. To address this, we present Implicit Gaussian Splatting (IGS), an innovative hybrid model that integrates explicit point clouds with implicit feature embeddings through a multi-level tri-plane architecture. This architecture features 2D feature grids at various resolutions across different levels, facilitating continuous spatial domain representation and enhancing spatial correlations among Gaussian primitives. Building upon this foundation, we introduce a level-based progressive training scheme, which incorporates explicit spatial regularization. This method capitalizes on spatial correlations to enhance both the rendering quality and the compactness of the IGS representation. Furthermore, we propose a novel compression pipeline tailored for both point clouds and 2D feature grids, considering the entropy variations across different levels. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our algorithm can deliver high-quality rendering using only a few MBs, effectively balancing storage efficiency and rendering fidelity, and yielding results that are competitive with the state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: The dynamic nature of open-world scenarios has attracted more attention to class incremental learning (CIL). However, existing CIL methods typically presume the availability of complete ground-truth labels throughout the training process, an assumption rarely met in practical applications. Consequently, this paper explores a more challenging problem of unsupervised class incremental learning (UCIL). The essence of addressing this problem lies in effectively capturing comprehensive feature representations and discovering unknown novel classes. To achieve this, we first model the knowledge of class distribution by exploiting fine-grained prototypes. Subsequently, a granularity alignment technique is introduced to enhance the unsupervised class discovery. Additionally, we proposed a strategy to minimize overlap between novel and existing classes, thereby preserving historical knowledge and mitigating the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on the five datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Facial wrinkle detection plays a crucial role in cosmetic dermatology. Precise manual segmentation of facial wrinkles is challenging and time-consuming, with inherent subjectivity leading to inconsistent results among graders. To address this issue, we propose two solutions. First, we build and release the first public facial wrinkle dataset, `FFHQ-Wrinkle', an extension of the NVIDIA FFHQ dataset. This dataset includes 1,000 images with human labels and 50,000 images with automatically generated weak labels. This dataset can foster the research community to develop advanced wrinkle detection algorithms. Second, we introduce a training strategy for U-Net-like encoder-decoder models to detect wrinkles across the face automatically. Our method employs a two-stage training strategy: texture map pretraining and finetuning on human-labeled data. Initially, we pretrain models on a large dataset with weak labels (N=50k) or masked texture maps generated through computer vision techniques, without human intervention. Subsequently, we finetune the models using human-labeled data (N=1k), which consists of manually labeled wrinkle masks. During finetuning, the network inputs a combination of RGB and masked texture maps, comprising four channels. We effectively combine labels from multiple annotators to minimize subjectivity in manual labeling. Our strategies demonstrate improved segmentation performance in facial wrinkle segmentation both quantitatively and visually compared to existing pretraining methods.

- **Summary**: Endorectal ultrasound (ERUS) is an important imaging modality that provides high reliability for diagnosing the depth and boundary of invasion in colorectal cancer. However, the lack of a large-scale ERUS dataset with high-quality annotations hinders the development of automatic ultrasound diagnostics. In this paper, we collected and annotated the first benchmark dataset that covers diverse ERUS scenarios, i.e. colorectal cancer segmentation, detection, and infiltration depth staging. Our ERUS-10K dataset comprises 77 videos and 10,000 high-resolution annotated frames. Based on this dataset, we further introduce a benchmark model for colorectal cancer segmentation, named the Adaptive Sparse-context TRansformer (ASTR). ASTR is designed based on three considerations: scanning mode discrepancy, temporal information, and low computational complexity. For generalizing to different scanning modes, the adaptive scanning-mode augmentation is proposed to convert between raw sector images and linear scan ones. For mining temporal information, the sparse-context transformer is incorporated to integrate inter-frame local and global features. For reducing computational complexity, the sparse-context block is introduced to extract contextual features from auxiliary frames. Finally, on the benchmark dataset, the proposed ASTR model achieves a 77.6% Dice score in rectal cancer segmentation, largely outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Accurate assessment of lymph node size in 3D CT scans is crucial for cancer staging, therapeutic management, and monitoring treatment response. Existing state-of-the-art segmentation frameworks in medical imaging often rely on fully annotated datasets. However, for lymph node segmentation, these datasets are typically small due to the extensive time and expertise required to annotate the numerous lymph nodes in 3D CT scans. Weakly-supervised learning, which leverages incomplete or noisy annotations, has recently gained interest in the medical imaging community as a potential solution. Despite the variety of weakly-supervised techniques proposed, most have been validated only on private datasets or small publicly available datasets. To address this limitation, the Mediastinal Lymph Node Quantification (LNQ) challenge was organized in conjunction with the 26th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2023). This challenge aimed to advance weakly-supervised segmentation methods by providing a new, partially annotated dataset and a robust evaluation framework. A total of 16 teams from 5 countries submitted predictions to the validation leaderboard, and 6 teams from 3 countries participated in the evaluation phase. The results highlighted both the potential and the current limitations of weakly-supervised approaches. On one hand, weakly-supervised approaches obtained relatively good performance with a median Dice score of $61.0\%$. On the other hand, top-ranked teams, with a median Dice score exceeding $70\%$, boosted their performance by leveraging smaller but fully annotated datasets to combine weak supervision and full supervision. This highlights both the promise of weakly-supervised methods and the ongoing need for high-quality, fully annotated data to achieve higher segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of deepfake technologies has sparked widespread public concern, particularly as face forgery poses a serious threat to public information security. However, the unknown and diverse forgery techniques, varied facial features and complex environmental factors pose significant challenges for face forgery analysis. Existing datasets lack descriptions of these aspects, making it difficult for models to distinguish between real and forged faces using only visual information amid various confounding factors. In addition, existing methods do not yield user-friendly and explainable results, complicating the understanding of the model's decision-making process. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Open-World Face Forgery Analysis VQA (OW-FFA-VQA) task and the corresponding benchmark. To tackle this task, we first establish a dataset featuring a diverse collection of real and forged face images with essential descriptions and reliable forgery reasoning. Base on this dataset, we introduce FFAA: Face Forgery Analysis Assistant, consisting of a fine-tuned Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and Multi-answer Intelligent Decision System (MIDS). By integrating hypothetical prompts with MIDS, the impact of fuzzy classification boundaries is effectively mitigated, enhancing the model's robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only provides user-friendly explainable results but also significantly boosts accuracy and robustness compared to previous methods.

- **Summary**: Sign Language Assessment (SLA) tools are useful to aid in language learning and are underdeveloped. Previous work has focused on isolated signs or comparison against a single reference video to assess Sign Languages (SL). This paper introduces a novel SLA tool designed to evaluate the comprehensibility of SL by modelling the natural distribution of human motion. We train our pipeline on data from native signers and evaluate it using SL learners. We compare our results to ratings from a human raters study and find strong correlation between human ratings and our tool. We visually demonstrate our tools ability to detect anomalous results spatio-temporally, providing actionable feedback to aid in SL learning and assessment.

- **Summary**: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has gained significant attention due to its wide applications to video generation, editing, enhancement and translation, \etc. However, high-quality (HQ) video synthesis is extremely challenging because of the diverse and complex motions existed in real world. Most existing works struggle to address this problem by collecting large-scale HQ videos, which are inaccessible to the community. In this work, we show that publicly available limited and low-quality (LQ) data are sufficient to train a HQ video generator without recaptioning or finetuning. We factorize the whole T2V generation process into two steps: generating an image conditioned on a highly descriptive caption, and synthesizing the video conditioned on the generated image and a concise caption of motion details. Specifically, we present \emph{Factorized-Dreamer}, a factorized spatiotemporal framework with several critical designs for T2V generation, including an adapter to combine text and image embeddings, a pixel-aware cross attention module to capture pixel-level image information, a T5 text encoder to better understand motion description, and a PredictNet to supervise optical flows. We further present a noise schedule, which plays a key role in ensuring the quality and stability of video generation. Our model lowers the requirements in detailed captions and HQ videos, and can be directly trained on limited LQ datasets with noisy and brief captions such as WebVid-10M, largely alleviating the cost to collect large-scale HQ video-text pairs. Extensive experiments in a variety of T2V and image-to-video generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Factorized-Dreamer.

- **Summary**: Affordance, defined as the potential actions that an object offers, is crucial for robotic manipulation tasks. A deep understanding of affordance can lead to more intelligent AI systems. For example, such knowledge directs an agent to grasp a knife by the handle for cutting and by the blade when passing it to someone. In this paper, we present a streamlined affordance learning system that encompasses data collection, effective model training, and robot deployment. First, we collect training data from egocentric videos in an automatic manner. Different from previous methods that focus only on the object graspable affordance and represent it as coarse heatmaps, we cover both graspable (e.g., object handles) and functional affordances (e.g., knife blades, hammer heads) and extract data with precise segmentation masks. We then propose an effective model, termed Geometry-guided Affordance Transformer (GKT), to train on the collected data. GKT integrates an innovative Depth Feature Injector (DFI) to incorporate 3D shape and geometric priors, enhancing the model's understanding of affordances. To enable affordance-oriented manipulation, we further introduce Aff-Grasp, a framework that combines GKT with a grasp generation model. For comprehensive evaluation, we create an affordance evaluation dataset with pixel-wise annotations, and design real-world tasks for robot experiments. The results show that GKT surpasses the state-of-the-art by 15.9% in mIoU, and Aff-Grasp achieves high success rates of 95.5% in affordance prediction and 77.1% in successful grasping among 179 trials, including evaluations with seen, unseen objects, and cluttered scenes.

- **Summary**: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) task aims to segmenting a particular object instance throughout the entire video sequence given only the object mask of the first frame. Recently, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) is proposed, which is a foundation model towards solving promptable visual segmentation in images and videos. SAM 2 builds a data engine, which improves model and data via user interaction, to collect the largest video segmentation dataset to date. SAM 2 is a simple transformer architecture with streaming memory for real-time video processing, which trained on the date provides strong performance across a wide range of tasks. In this work, we evaluate the zero-shot performance of SAM 2 on the more challenging VOS datasets MOSE and LVOS. Without fine-tuning on the training set, SAM 2 achieved 75.79 J&F on the test set and ranked 4th place for 6th LSVOS Challenge VOS Track.

- **Summary**: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) relies on natural language expressions to segment target objects in video. In this year, LSVOS Challenge RVOS Track replaced the origin YouTube-RVOS benchmark with MeViS. MeViS focuses on referring the target object in a video through its motion descriptions instead of static attributes, posing a greater challenge to RVOS task. In this work, we integrate strengths of that leading RVOS and VOS models to build up a simple and effective pipeline for RVOS. Firstly, We finetune the state-of-the-art RVOS model to obtain mask sequences that are correlated with language descriptions. Secondly, based on a reliable and high-quality key frames, we leverage VOS model to enhance the quality and temporal consistency of the mask results. Finally, we further improve the performance of the RVOS model using semi-supervised learning. Our solution achieved 62.57 J&F on the MeViS test set and ranked 1st place for 6th LSVOS Challenge RVOS Track.

- **Summary**: Depth perception plays an essential role in the viewer experience for immersive virtual reality (VR) visual environments. However, previous research investigations in the depth quality of 3D/stereoscopic images are rather limited, and in particular, are largely lacking for 3D viewing of 360-degree omnidirectional content. In this work, we make one of the first attempts to develop an objective quality assessment model named depth quality index (DQI) for efficient no-reference (NR) depth quality assessment of stereoscopic omnidirectional images. Motivated by the perceptual characteristics of the human visual system (HVS), the proposed DQI is built upon multi-color-channel, adaptive viewport selection, and interocular discrepancy features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art image quality assessment (IQA) and depth quality assessment (DQA) approaches in predicting the perceptual depth quality when tested using both single-viewport and omnidirectional stereoscopic image databases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining the proposed depth quality model with existing IQA methods significantly boosts the performance in predicting the overall quality of 3D omnidirectional images.

- **Summary**: Mesh reconstruction based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is popular in a variety of applications such as computer graphics, virtual reality, and medical imaging due to its efficiency in handling complex geometric structures and facilitating real-time rendering. However, existing works often fail to capture fine geometric details accurately and struggle with optimizing rendering quality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm that progressively generates and optimizes meshes from multi-view images. Our approach initiates with the training of a NeRF model to establish an initial Signed Distance Field (SDF) and a view-dependent appearance field. Subsequently, we iteratively refine the SDF through a differentiable mesh extraction method, continuously updating both the vertex positions and their connectivity based on the loss from mesh differentiable rasterization, while also optimizing the appearance representation. To further leverage high-fidelity and detail-rich representations from NeRF, we propose an online-learning strategy based on Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to enhance viewpoints by adaptively incorporating images rendered by the initial NeRF model into the training dataset. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method delivers highly competitive and robust performance in both mesh rendering quality and geometric quality.

- **Summary**: Image restoration endeavors to reconstruct a high-quality, detail-rich image from a degraded counterpart, which is a pivotal process in photography and various computer vision systems. In real-world scenarios, different types of degradation can cause the loss of image details at various scales and degrade image contrast. Existing methods predominantly rely on CNN and Transformer to capture multi-scale representations. However, these methods are often limited by the high computational complexity of Transformers and the constrained receptive field of CNN, which hinder them from achieving superior performance and efficiency in image restoration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-Scale State-Space Model-based (MS-Mamba) for efficient image restoration that enhances the capacity for multi-scale representation learning through our proposed global and regional SSM modules. Additionally, an Adaptive Gradient Block (AGB) and a Residual Fourier Block (RFB) are proposed to improve the network's detail extraction capabilities by capturing gradients in various directions and facilitating learning details in the frequency domain. Extensive experiments on nine public benchmarks across four classic image restoration tasks, image deraining, dehazing, denoising, and low-light enhancement, demonstrate that our proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low computational complexity. The source code will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Monocular depth estimation in colonoscopy video aims to overcome the unusual lighting properties of the colonoscopic environment. One of the major challenges in this area is the domain gap between annotated but unrealistic synthetic data and unannotated but realistic clinical data. Previous attempts to bridge this domain gap directly target the depth estimation task itself. We propose a general pipeline of structure-preserving synthetic-to-real (sim2real) image translation (producing a modified version of the input image) to retain depth geometry through the translation process. This allows us to generate large quantities of realistic-looking synthetic images for supervised depth estimation with improved generalization to the clinical domain. We also propose a dataset of hand-picked sequences from clinical colonoscopies to improve the image translation process. We demonstrate the simultaneous realism of the translated images and preservation of depth maps via the performance of downstream depth estimation on various datasets.

- **Summary**: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) based on 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGS) has recently shown promise towards more accurate, dense 3D scene maps. However, existing 3DGS-based methods fail to address the global consistency of the scene via loop closure and/or global bundle adjustment. To this end, we propose LoopSplat, which takes RGB-D images as input and performs dense mapping with 3DGS submaps and frame-to-model tracking.

- **Summary**: Real-time high-accuracy optical flow estimation is crucial for various real-world applications. While recent learning-based optical flow methods have achieved high accuracy, they often come with significant computational costs. In this paper, we propose a highly efficient optical flow method that balances high accuracy with reduced computational demands. Building upon NeuFlow v1, we introduce new components including a much more light-weight backbone and a fast refinement module. Both these modules help in keeping the computational demands light while providing close to state of the art accuracy. Compares to other state of the art methods, our model achieves a 10x-70x speedup while maintaining comparable performance on both synthetic and real-world data. It is capable of running at over 20 FPS on 512x384 resolution images on a Jetson Orin Nano. The full training and evaluation code is available at https://github.com/neufieldrobotics/NeuFlow_v2.

- **Summary**: This study investigates the effects of occlusions on the fairness of face recognition systems, particularly focusing on demographic biases. Using the Racial Faces in the Wild (RFW) dataset and synthetically added realistic occlusions, we evaluate their effect on the performance of face recognition models trained on the BUPT-Balanced and BUPT-GlobalFace datasets. We note increases in the dispersion of FMR, FNMR, and accuracy alongside decreases in fairness according to Equilized Odds, Demographic Parity, STD of Accuracy, and Fairness Discrepancy Rate. Additionally, we utilize a pixel attribution method to understand the importance of occlusions in model predictions, proposing a new metric, Face Occlusion Impact Ratio (FOIR), that quantifies the extent to which occlusions affect model performance across different demographic groups. Our results indicate that occlusions exacerbate existing demographic biases, with models placing higher importance on occlusions in an unequal fashion, particularly affecting African individuals more severely.

- **Summary**: Signed Distance Function (SDF)-based volume rendering has demonstrated significant capabilities in surface reconstruction. Although promising, SDF-based methods often fail to capture detailed geometric structures, resulting in visible defects. By comparing SDF-based volume rendering to density-based volume rendering, we identify two main factors within the SDF-based approach that degrade surface quality: SDF-to-density representation and geometric regularization. These factors introduce challenges that hinder the optimization of the SDF field. To address these issues, we introduce NeuRodin, a novel two-stage neural surface reconstruction framework that not only achieves high-fidelity surface reconstruction but also retains the flexible optimization characteristics of density-based methods. NeuRodin incorporates innovative strategies that facilitate transformation of arbitrary topologies and reduce artifacts associated with density bias. Extensive evaluations on the Tanks and Temples and ScanNet++ datasets demonstrate the superiority of NeuRodin, showing strong reconstruction capabilities for both indoor and outdoor environments using solely posed RGB captures.

- **Summary**: Imbalanced datasets are a significant challenge in real-world scenarios. They lead to models that underperform on underrepresented classes, which is a critical issue in infrastructure inspection. This paper introduces the Enhanced Feature Pyramid Network (E-FPN), a deep learning model for the semantic segmentation of culverts and sewer pipes within imbalanced datasets. The E-FPN incorporates architectural innovations like sparsely connected blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions to improve feature extraction and handle object variations. To address dataset imbalance, the model employs strategies like class decomposition and data augmentation. Experimental results on the culvert-sewer defects dataset and a benchmark aerial semantic segmentation drone dataset show that the E-FPN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Intersection over Union (IoU) improvement of 13.8% and 27.2%, respectively. Additionally, class decomposition and data augmentation together boost the model's performance by approximately 6.9% IoU. The proposed E-FPN presents a promising solution for enhancing object segmentation in challenging, multi-class real-world datasets, with potential applications extending beyond culvert-sewer defect detection.

- **Summary**: Typically, the detection of marine debris relies on in-situ campaigns that are characterized by huge human effort and limited spatial coverage. Following the need of a rapid solution for the detection of floating plastic, methods based on remote sensing data have been proposed recently. Their main limitation is represented by the lack of a general reference for evaluating performance. Recently, the Marine Debris Archive (MARIDA) has been released as a standard dataset to develop and evaluate Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for detection of Marine Plastic Debris. The MARIDA dataset has been created for simplifying the comparison between detection solutions with the aim of stimulating the research in the field of marine environment preservation. In this work, an assessment of spectral based solutions is proposed by evaluating performance on MARIDA dataset. The outcome highlights the need of precise reference for fair evaluation.

- **Summary**: Long-context capability is critical for multi-modal foundation models. We introduce LongVILA, a full-stack solution for long-context vision-language models, including system, model training, and dataset development. On the system side, we introduce the first long-context Multi-Modal Sequence Parallelism (MM-SP) system that enables long training and inference, enabling 2M context length training on 256 GPUs without any gradient checkpointing. MM-SP is 2.1x - 5.7x faster than ring sequence parallelism and 1.1x - 1.4x faster than Megatron context parallelism + tensor parallelism in text-only settings. Moreover, it seamlessly integrates with Hugging Face Transformers. For model training, we propose a five-stage pipeline comprising alignment, pre-training, short supervised fine-tuning, context extension, and long supervised fine-tuning. On datasets, we construct large-scale visual language pre-training datasets and long video instruction-following datasets to support our multi-stage training process. LongVILA extends the number of frames of VILA from 8 to 1024, and improves the long video captioning score from 2.00 to 3.26 (1.6x), achieving 99.5% accuracy in 1400-frames video (274k context length) needle-in-a-haystack. LongVILA-8B demonstrates consistent accuracy improvements on long videos in the VideoMME benchmark as the number of frames increases.

- **Summary**: Open-world 3D generation has recently attracted considerable attention. While many single-image-to-3D methods have yielded visually appealing outcomes, they often lack sufficient controllability and tend to produce hallucinated regions that may not align with users' expectations. In this paper, we explore an important scenario in which the input consists of one or a few unposed 2D images of a single object, with little or no overlap. We propose a novel method, SpaRP, to reconstruct a 3D textured mesh and estimate the relative camera poses for these sparse-view images. SpaRP distills knowledge from 2D diffusion models and finetunes them to implicitly deduce the 3D spatial relationships between the sparse views. The diffusion model is trained to jointly predict surrogate representations for camera poses and multi-view images of the object under known poses, integrating all information from the input sparse views. These predictions are then leveraged to accomplish 3D reconstruction and pose estimation, and the reconstructed 3D model can be used to further refine the camera poses of input views. Through extensive experiments on three datasets, we demonstrate that our method not only significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of 3D reconstruction quality and pose prediction accuracy but also exhibits strong efficiency. It requires only about 20 seconds to produce a textured mesh and camera poses for the input views. Project page: https://chaoxu.xyz/sparp.

- **Summary**: Open-world 3D reconstruction models have recently garnered significant attention. However, without sufficient 3D inductive bias, existing methods typically entail expensive training costs and struggle to extract high-quality 3D meshes. In this work, we introduce MeshFormer, a sparse-view reconstruction model that explicitly leverages 3D native structure, input guidance, and training supervision. Specifically, instead of using a triplane representation, we store features in 3D sparse voxels and combine transformers with 3D convolutions to leverage an explicit 3D structure and projective bias. In addition to sparse-view RGB input, we require the network to take input and generate corresponding normal maps. The input normal maps can be predicted by 2D diffusion models, significantly aiding in the guidance and refinement of the geometry's learning. Moreover, by combining Signed Distance Function (SDF) supervision with surface rendering, we directly learn to generate high-quality meshes without the need for complex multi-stage training processes. By incorporating these explicit 3D biases, MeshFormer can be trained efficiently and deliver high-quality textured meshes with fine-grained geometric details. It can also be integrated with 2D diffusion models to enable fast single-image-to-3D and text-to-3D tasks. Project page: https://meshformer3d.github.io

- **Summary**: Large-scale vision-language models, such as CLIP, are known to contain harmful societal bias regarding protected attributes (e.g., gender and age). In this paper, we aim to address the problems of societal bias in CLIP. Although previous studies have proposed to debias societal bias through adversarial learning or test-time projecting, our comprehensive study of these works identifies two critical limitations: 1) loss of attribute information when it is explicitly disclosed in the input and 2) use of the attribute annotations during debiasing process. To mitigate societal bias in CLIP and overcome these limitations simultaneously, we introduce a simple-yet-effective debiasing method called SANER (societal attribute neutralizer) that eliminates attribute information from CLIP text features only of attribute-neutral descriptions. Experimental results show that SANER, which does not require attribute annotations and preserves original information for attribute-specific descriptions, demonstrates superior debiasing ability than the existing methods.

- **Summary**: Adversarial training enhances neural network robustness but suffers from a tendency to overfit and increased generalization errors on clean data. This work introduces CLAT, an innovative approach that mitigates adversarial overfitting by introducing parameter efficiency into the adversarial training process, improving both clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. Instead of tuning the entire model, CLAT identifies and fine-tunes robustness-critical layers - those predominantly learning non-robust features - while freezing the remaining model to enhance robustness. It employs dynamic critical layer selection to adapt to changes in layer criticality throughout the fine-tuning process. Empirically, CLAT can be applied on top of existing adversarial training methods, significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 95%, and achieves more than a 2% improvement in adversarial robustness compared to baseline methods.
