- **Summary**: Robust perception is crucial in autonomous vehicle navigation and localization. Visual processing tasks, like semantic segmentation, should work in varying weather conditions and during different times of day. Semantic segmentation is where each pixel is assigned a class, which is useful for locating overall features (1). Training a segmentation model requires large amounts of data, and the labeling process for segmentation data is especially tedious. Additionally, many large datasets include only images taken in clear weather. This is a problem because training a model exclusively on clear weather data hinders performance in adverse weather conditions like fog or rain. We hypothesize that given a dataset of only clear days images, applying image augmentation (such as random rain, fog, and brightness) during training allows for domain adaptation to diverse weather conditions. We used CARLA, a 3D realistic autonomous vehicle simulator, to collect 1200 images in clear weather composed of 29 classes from 10 different towns (2). We also collected 1200 images of random weather effects. We trained encoder-decoder UNet models to perform semantic segmentation. Applying augmentations significantly improved segmentation under weathered night conditions (p < 0.001). However, models trained on weather data have significantly lower losses than those trained on augmented data in all conditions except for clear days. This shows there is room for improvement in the domain adaptation approach. Future work should test more types of augmentations and also use real-life images instead of CARLA. Ideally, the augmented model meets or exceeds the performance of the weather model.

- **Summary**: In this paper we propose a score of an image to use for coreset selection in image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. The score is the entropy of an image as approximated by the bits-per-pixel of its compressed version. Thus the score is intrinsic to an image and does not require supervision or training. It is very simple to compute and readily available as all images are stored in a compressed format. The motivation behind our choice of score is that most other scores proposed in literature are expensive to compute. More importantly, we want a score that captures the perceptual complexity of an image. Entropy is one such measure, images with clutter tend to have a higher entropy. However sampling only low entropy iconic images, for example, leads to biased learning and an overall decrease in test performance with current deep learning models. To mitigate the bias we use a graph based method that increases the spatial diversity of the selected samples. We show that this simple score yields good results, particularly for semantic segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: In recent years, deep learning techniques have been used to develop sign language recognition systems, potentially serving as a communication tool for millions of hearing-impaired individuals worldwide. However, there are inherent challenges in creating such systems. Firstly, it is important to consider as many linguistic parameters as possible in gesture execution to avoid ambiguity between words. Moreover, to facilitate the real-world adoption of the created solution, it is essential to ensure that the chosen technology is realistic, avoiding expensive, intrusive, or low-mobility sensors, as well as very complex deep learning architectures that impose high computational requirements. Based on this, our work aims to propose an efficient sign language recognition system that utilizes low-cost sensors and techniques. To this end, an object detection model was trained specifically for detecting the interpreter's face and hands, ensuring focus on the most relevant regions of the image and generating inputs with higher semantic value for the classifier. Additionally, we introduced a novel approach to obtain features representing hand location and movement by leveraging spatial information derived from centroid positions of bounding boxes, thereby enhancing sign discrimination. The results demonstrate the efficiency of our handcrafted features, increasing accuracy by 7.96% on the AUTSL dataset, while adding fewer than 700 thousand parameters and incurring less than 10 milliseconds of additional inference time. These findings highlight the potential of our technique to strike a favorable balance between computational cost and accuracy, making it a promising approach for practical sign language recognition applications.

- **Summary**: In the rapidly expanding domain of web video content, the task of text-video retrieval has become increasingly critical, bridging the semantic gap between textual queries and video data. This paper introduces a novel data-centric approach, Generalized Query Expansion (GQE), to address the inherent information imbalance between text and video, enhancing the effectiveness of text-video retrieval systems. Unlike traditional model-centric methods that focus on designing intricate cross-modal interaction mechanisms, GQE aims to expand the text queries associated with videos both during training and testing phases. By adaptively segmenting videos into short clips and employing zero-shot captioning, GQE enriches the training dataset with comprehensive scene descriptions, effectively bridging the data imbalance gap. Furthermore, during retrieval, GQE utilizes Large Language Models (LLM) to generate a diverse set of queries and a query selection module to filter these queries based on relevance and diversity, thus optimizing retrieval performance while reducing computational overhead. Our contributions include a detailed examination of the information imbalance challenge, a novel approach to query expansion in video-text datasets, and the introduction of a query selection strategy that enhances retrieval accuracy without increasing computational costs. GQE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, including MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, and VATEX, demonstrating the effectiveness of addressing text-video retrieval from a data-centric perspective.

- **Summary**: Neural Collapse (NC) presents an elegant geometric structure that enables individual activations (features), class means and classifier (weights) vectors to reach \textit{optimal} inter-class separability during the terminal phase of training on a \textit{balanced} dataset. Once shifted to imbalanced classification, such an optimal structure of NC can be readily destroyed by the notorious \textit{minority collapse}, where the classifier vectors corresponding to the minority classes are squeezed. In response, existing works endeavor to recover NC typically by optimizing classifiers. However, we discover that this squeezing phenomenon is not only confined to classifier vectors but also occurs with class means.   Consequently, reconstructing NC solely at the classifier aspect may be futile, as the feature means remain compressed, leading to the violation of inherent \textit{self-duality} in NC (\textit{i.e.}, class means and classifier vectors converge mutually) and incidentally, resulting in an unsatisfactory collapse of individual activations towards the corresponding class means. To shake off these dilemmas, we present a unified \textbf{All}-around \textbf{N}eural \textbf{C}ollapse framework (AllNC), aiming to comprehensively restore NC across multiple aspects including individual activations, class means and classifier vectors. We thoroughly analyze its effectiveness and verify on multiple benchmark datasets that it achieves state-of-the-art in both balanced and imbalanced settings.

- **Summary**: Fonts are integral to creative endeavors, design processes, and artistic productions. The appropriate selection of a font can significantly enhance artwork and endow advertisements with a higher level of expressivity. Despite the availability of numerous diverse font designs online, traditional retrieval-based methods for font selection are increasingly being supplanted by generation-based approaches. These newer methods offer enhanced flexibility, catering to specific user preferences and capturing unique stylistic impressions. However, current impression font techniques based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) necessitate the utilization of multiple auxiliary losses to provide guidance during generation. Furthermore, these methods commonly employ weighted summation for the fusion of impression-related keywords. This leads to generic vectors with the addition of more impression keywords, ultimately lacking in detail generation capacity. In this paper, we introduce a diffusion-based method, termed \ourmethod, to generate fonts that vividly embody specific impressions, utilizing an input consisting of a single letter and a set of descriptive impression keywords. The core innovation of \ourmethod lies in the development of dual cross-attention modules, which process the characteristics of the letters and impression keywords independently but synergistically, ensuring effective integration of both types of information. Our experimental results, conducted on the MyFonts dataset, affirm that this method is capable of producing realistic, vibrant, and high-fidelity fonts that are closely aligned with user specifications. This confirms the potential of our approach to revolutionize font generation by accommodating a broad spectrum of user-driven design requirements.

- **Summary**: Deep learning brought boosts to auto diabetic retinopathy (DR) diagnosis, thus, greatly helping ophthalmologists for early disease detection, which contributes to preventing disease deterioration that may eventually lead to blindness. It has been proved that convolutional neural network (CNN)-aided lesion identifying or segmentation benefits auto DR screening. The key to fine-grained lesion tasks mainly lies in: (1) extracting features being both sensitive to tiny lesions and robust against DR-irrelevant interference, and (2) exploiting and re-using encoded information to restore lesion locations under extremely imbalanced data distribution. To this end, we propose a CNN-based DR diagnosis network with attention mechanism involved, termed lesion-aware network, to better capture lesion information from imbalanced data. Specifically, we design the lesion-aware module (LAM) to capture noise-like lesion areas across deeper layers, and the feature-preserve module (FPM) to assist shallow-to-deep feature fusion. Afterward, the proposed lesion-aware network (LANet) is constructed by embedding the LAM and FPM into the CNN decoders for DR-related information utilization. The proposed LANet is then further extended to a DR screening network by adding a classification layer. Through experiments on three public fundus datasets with pixel-level annotations, our method outperforms the mainstream methods with an area under curve of 0.967 in DR screening, and increases the overall average precision by 7.6%, 2.1%, and 1.2% in lesion segmentation on three datasets. Besides, the ablation study validates the effectiveness of the proposed sub-modules.

- **Summary**: Scale-aware monocular depth estimation poses a significant challenge in computer-aided endoscopic navigation. However, existing depth estimation methods that do not consider the geometric priors struggle to learn the absolute scale from training with monocular endoscopic sequences. Additionally, conventional methods face difficulties in accurately estimating details on tissue and instruments boundaries. In this paper, we tackle these problems by proposing a novel enhanced scale-aware framework that only uses monocular images with geometric modeling for depth estimation. Specifically, we first propose a multi-resolution depth fusion strategy to enhance the quality of monocular depth estimation. To recover the precise scale between relative depth and real-world values, we further calculate the 3D poses of instruments in the endoscopic scenes by algebraic geometry based on the image-only geometric primitives (i.e., boundaries and tip of instruments). Afterwards, the 3D poses of surgical instruments enable the scale recovery of relative depth maps. By coupling scale factors and relative depth estimation, the scale-aware depth of the monocular endoscopic scenes can be estimated. We evaluate the pipeline on in-house endoscopic surgery videos and simulated data. The results demonstrate that our method can learn the absolute scale with geometric modeling and accurately estimate scale-aware depth for monocular scenes.

- **Summary**: This paper examines the challenges and advancements in recognizing seals within their natural habitats using conventional photography, underscored by the emergence of machine learning technologies. We used the leopard seal, \emph{Hydrurga leptonyx}, a key species within Antarctic ecosystems, to review the different available methods found. As apex predators, Leopard seals are characterized by their significant ecological role and elusive nature so studying them is crucial to understand the health of their ecosystem. Traditional methods of monitoring seal species are often constrained by the labor-intensive and time-consuming processes required for collecting data, compounded by the limited insights these methods provide. The advent of machine learning, particularly through the application of vision transformers, heralds a new era of efficiency and precision in species monitoring. By leveraging state-of-the-art approaches in detection, segmentation, and recognition within digital imaging, this paper presents a synthesis of the current landscape, highlighting both the cutting-edge methodologies and the predominant challenges faced in accurately identifying seals through photographic data.

- **Summary**: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenging task that requires systems to provide accurate answers to questions based on image content. Current VQA models struggle with complex questions due to limitations in capturing and integrating multimodal information effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the Rank VQA model, which leverages a ranking-inspired hybrid training strategy to enhance VQA performance. The Rank VQA model integrates high-quality visual features extracted using the Faster R-CNN model and rich semantic text features obtained from a pre-trained BERT model. These features are fused through a sophisticated multimodal fusion technique employing multi-head self-attention mechanisms. Additionally, a ranking learning module is incorporated to optimize the relative ranking of answers, thus improving answer accuracy. The hybrid training strategy combines classification and ranking losses, enhancing the model's generalization ability and robustness across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Rank VQA model. Our model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on standard VQA datasets, including VQA v2.0 and COCO-QA, in terms of both accuracy and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). The superior performance of Rank VQA is evident in its ability to handle complex questions that require understanding nuanced details and making sophisticated inferences from the image and text. This work highlights the effectiveness of a ranking-based hybrid training strategy in improving VQA performance and lays the groundwork for further research in multimodal learning methods.



### KIND: Knowledge Integration and Diversion in Diffusion Models

- **Summary**: Pre-trained models have become the preferred backbone due to the expansion of model parameters, with techniques like Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFTs) typically fixing the parameters of these models. However, pre-trained models may not always be optimal, especially when there are discrepancies between training tasks and target tasks, potentially resulting in negative transfer. To address this, we introduce \textbf{KIND}, which performs \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{IN}tegration and \textbf{D}iversion in diffusion models. KIND first integrates knowledge by decomposing parameter matrices of models using $U$, $\Sigma$, and $V$ matrices, formally inspired by singular value decomposition (SVD). Then it explicitly partitions the components of these matrices into \textbf{learngenes} and \textbf{tailors} to condense common and class-specific knowledge, respectively, through a class gate. In this way, KIND redefines traditional pre-training methods by adjusting training objectives from maximizing model performance on current tasks to condensing transferable common knowledge, leveraging the \textit{Learngene} framework. We conduct experiments on ImageNet-1K and compare KIND with PEFT and other learngene methods. Results indicate that KIND achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other PEFT and learngene methods. Specifically, the images generated by KIND achieves more than 6.54 and 1.07 decrease in FID and sFID on DiT-L/2, utilizing only 45.4M trainable parameters and saving at least 35.4G FLOPs in computational cost.

- **Summary**: Multimodal learning leverages complementary information derived from different modalities, thereby enhancing performance in medical image segmentation. However, prevailing multimodal learning methods heavily rely on extensive well-annotated data from various modalities to achieve accurate segmentation performance. This dependence often poses a challenge in clinical settings due to limited availability of such data. Moreover, the inherent anatomical misalignment between different imaging modalities further complicates the endeavor to enhance segmentation performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised multimodal segmentation framework that is robust to scarce labeled data and misaligned modalities. Our framework employs a novel cross modality collaboration strategy to distill modality-independent knowledge, which is inherently associated with each modality, and integrates this information into a unified fusion layer for feature amalgamation. With a channel-wise semantic consistency loss, our framework ensures alignment of modality-independent information from a feature-wise perspective across modalities, thereby fortifying it against misalignments in multimodal scenarios. Furthermore, our framework effectively integrates contrastive consistent learning to regulate anatomical structures, facilitating anatomical-wise prediction alignment on unlabeled data in semi-supervised segmentation tasks. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to other multimodal methods across three tasks: cardiac, abdominal multi-organ, and thyroid-associated orbitopathy segmentations. It also demonstrates outstanding robustness in scenarios involving scarce labeled data and misaligned modalities.

- **Summary**: Although recent years have witnessed significant advancements in medical image segmentation, the pervasive issue of domain shift among medical images from diverse centres hinders the effective deployment of pre-trained models. Many Test-time Adaptation (TTA) methods have been proposed to address this issue by fine-tuning pre-trained models with test data during inference. These methods, however, often suffer from less-satisfactory optimization due to suboptimal optimization direction (dictated by the gradient) and fixed step-size (predicated on the learning rate). In this paper, we propose the Gradient alignment-based Test-time adaptation (GraTa) method to improve both the gradient direction and learning rate in the optimization procedure. Unlike conventional TTA methods, which primarily optimize the pseudo gradient derived from a self-supervised objective, our method incorporates an auxiliary gradient with the pseudo one to facilitate gradient alignment. Such gradient alignment enables the model to excavate the similarities between different gradients and correct the gradient direction to approximate the empirical gradient related to the current segmentation task. Additionally, we design a dynamic learning rate based on the cosine similarity between the pseudo and auxiliary gradients, thereby empowering the adaptive fine-tuning of pre-trained models on diverse test data. Extensive experiments establish the effectiveness of the proposed gradient alignment and dynamic learning rate and substantiate the superiority of our GraTa method over other state-of-the-art TTA methods on a benchmark medical image segmentation task. The code and weights of pre-trained source models will be available.

- **Summary**: Data association is an essential part in the tracking-by-detection based Multi-Object Tracking (MOT). Most trackers focus on how to design a better data association strategy to improve the tracking performance. The rule-based handcrafted association methods are simple and highly efficient but lack generalization capability to deal with complex scenes. While the learnt association methods can learn high-order contextual information to deal with various complex scenes, but they have the limitations of higher complexity and cost. To address these limitations, we propose a Robust Two-stage Association Tracker, named RTAT. The first-stage association is performed between tracklets and detections to generate tracklets with high purity, and the second-stage association is performed between tracklets to form complete trajectories. For the first-stage association, we use a simple data association strategy to generate tracklets with high purity by setting a low threshold for the matching cost in the assignment process. We conduct the tracklet association in the second-stage based on the framework of message-passing GNN. Our method models the tracklet association as a series of edge classification problem in hierarchical graphs, which can recursively merge short tracklets into longer ones. Our tracker RTAT ranks first on the test set of MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks in most of the main MOT metrics: HOTA, IDF1, and AssA. We achieve 67.2 HOTA, 84.7 IDF1, and 69.7 AssA on MOT17, and 66.2 HOTA, 82.5 IDF1, and 68.1 AssA on MOT20.

- **Summary**: The increasing prevalence of retinal diseases poses a significant challenge to the healthcare system, as the demand for ophthalmologists surpasses the available workforce. This imbalance creates a bottleneck in diagnosis and treatment, potentially delaying critical care. Traditional methods of generating medical reports from retinal images rely on manual interpretation, which is time-consuming and prone to errors, further straining ophthalmologists' limited resources. This thesis investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate medical report generation for retinal images. AI can quickly analyze large volumes of image data, identifying subtle patterns essential for accurate diagnosis. By automating this process, AI systems can greatly enhance the efficiency of retinal disease diagnosis, reducing doctors' workloads and enabling them to focus on more complex cases. The proposed AI-based methods address key challenges in automated report generation: (1) Improved methods for medical keyword representation enhance the system's ability to capture nuances in medical terminology; (2) A multi-modal deep learning approach captures interactions between textual keywords and retinal images, resulting in more comprehensive medical reports; (3) Techniques to enhance the interpretability of the AI-based report generation system, fostering trust and acceptance in clinical practice. These methods are rigorously evaluated using various metrics and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This thesis demonstrates AI's potential to revolutionize retinal disease diagnosis by automating medical report generation, ultimately improving clinical efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, and patient care.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is an important topic in computer vision with many relevant application in Earth observation. While supervised methods exist, the constraints of limited annotated data has encouraged development of unsupervised approaches. However, existing unsupervised methods resemble clustering and cannot be directly mapped to explicit target classes. In this paper, we deal with single shot semantic segmentation, where one example for the target class is provided, which is used to segment the target class from query/test images. Our approach exploits recently popular Segment Anything (SAM), a promptable foundation model. We specifically design several techniques to automatically generate prompts from the only example/key image in such a way that the segmentation is successfully achieved on a stitch or concatenation of the example/key and query/test images. Proposed technique does not involve any training phase and just requires one example image to grasp the concept. Furthermore, no text-based prompt is required for the proposed method. We evaluated the proposed techniques on building and car classes.

- **Summary**: Understanding the 3D semantics of a scene is a fundamental problem for various scenarios such as embodied agents. While NeRFs and 3DGS excel at novel-view synthesis, previous methods for understanding their semantics have been limited to incomplete 3D understanding: their segmentation results are 2D masks and their supervision is anchored at 2D pixels. This paper revisits the problem set to pursue a better 3D understanding of a scene modeled by NeRFs and 3DGS as follows. 1) We directly supervise the 3D points to train the language embedding field. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy without relying on multi-scale language embeddings. 2) We transfer the pre-trained language field to 3DGS, achieving the first real-time rendering speed without sacrificing training time or accuracy. 3) We introduce a 3D querying and evaluation protocol for assessing the reconstructed geometry and semantics together. Code, checkpoints, and annotations will be available online. Project page: https://hyunji12.github.io/Open3DRF

- **Summary**: Stereo matching in remote sensing has recently garnered increased attention, primarily focusing on supervised learning. However, datasets with ground truth generated by expensive airbone Lidar exhibit limited quantity and diversity, constraining the effectiveness of supervised networks. In contrast, unsupervised learning methods can leverage the increasing availability of very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images, offering considerable potential in the realm of stereo matching. Motivated by this intuition, we propose a novel unsupervised stereo matching network for VHR remote sensing images. A light-weight module to bridge confidence with predicted error is introduced to refine the core model. Robust unsupervised losses are formulated to enhance network convergence. The experimental results on US3D and WHU-Stereo datasets demonstrate that the proposed network achieves superior accuracy compared to other unsupervised networks and exhibits better generalization capabilities than supervised models.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in autonomous driving, augmented reality, robotics, and embodied intelligence have necessitated 3D perception algorithms. However, current 3D perception methods, particularly small models, struggle with processing logical reasoning, question-answering, and handling open scenario categories. On the other hand, generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel in general capacity but underperform in 3D tasks, due to weak spatial and local object perception, poor text-based geometric numerical output, and inability to handle camera focal variations. To address these challenges, we propose the following solutions: Spatial-Enhanced Local Feature Mining for better spatial feature extraction, 3D Query Token-Derived Info Decoding for precise geometric regression, and Geometry Projection-Based 3D Reasoning for handling camera focal length variations. We employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning for a pre-trained MLLM and develop LLMI3D, a powerful 3D perception MLLM. Additionally, we have constructed the IG3D dataset, which provides fine-grained descriptions and question-answer annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LLMI3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods.

- **Summary**: This paper focuses on Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection, addressing the challenge of identifying and understanding the interactions between humans and objects within a given image or video frame. Spearheaded by Detection Transformer (DETR), recent developments lead to significant improvements by replacing traditional region proposals by a set of learnable queries. However, despite the powerful representation capabilities provided by Transformers, existing Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection methods still yield low confidence levels when dealing with complex interactions and are prone to overlooking interactive actions. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach \textsc{UAHOI}, Uncertainty-aware Robust Human-Object Interaction Learning that explicitly estimates prediction uncertainty during the training process to refine both detection and interaction predictions. Our model not only predicts the HOI triplets but also quantifies the uncertainty of these predictions. Specifically, we model this uncertainty through the variance of predictions and incorporate it into the optimization objective, allowing the model to adaptively adjust its confidence threshold based on prediction variance. This integration helps in mitigating the adverse effects of incorrect or ambiguous predictions that are common in traditional methods without any hand-designed components, serving as an automatic confidence threshold. Our method is flexible to existing HOI detection methods and demonstrates improved accuracy. We evaluate \textsc{UAHOI} on two standard benchmarks in the field: V-COCO and HICO-DET, which represent challenging scenarios for HOI detection. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that \textsc{UAHOI} achieves significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods, enhancing both the accuracy and robustness of HOI detection.

- **Summary**: Existing human image personalized generation methods often require tedious training: either fine-tuning with a few images or retraining on large-scale datasets. In such cases, these methods are prone to overfitting and encounter difficulties when personalizing individuals of diverse styles. Moreover, these training-based approaches also struggle with multi-concept human image customizing. To this end, we propose MagicFace, the first method for universal-style human image personalized synthesis that enables single/multi-concept customization for humans of any style in a training-free manner. MagicFace introduces a coarse-to-fine generation pipeline, involving two sequential stages: semantic scene construction and concept feature injection. This is achieved by our Reference-aware Self-Attention (RSA) and Region-grouped Blend Attention (RBA) mechanisms. Specifically, in the first stage, RSA enables the latent image to query features from reference concepts simultaneously, extracting the coarse-grained overall semantic understanding to facilitate the initial semantic layout establishment. In the second stage, we employ an attention-based semantic segmentation method to pinpoint the generated regions of all concepts in the latent image at each step. Following this, RBA divides the pixels of the latent image into semantic groups, with each group querying fine-grained features from its reference concept, which ensures precise attribute alignment and feature injection. Throughout the two-stage process, a weight mask strategy is employed to ensure the model focuses more on the reference concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority in both human-centric subject-to-image synthesis and multi-concept human image customization. Our approach also can be applied to texture transformation, further enhancing its versatility and applicability.

- **Summary**: Most datasets used for supervised machine learning consist of a single label per data point. However, in cases where more information than just the class label is available, would it be possible to train models more efficiently? We introduce two novel model architectures, which we call hybrid concept-based models, that train using both class labels and additional information in the dataset referred to as concepts. In order to thoroughly assess their performance, we introduce ConceptShapes, an open and flexible class of datasets with concept labels. We show that the hybrid concept-based models outperform standard computer vision models and previously proposed concept-based models with respect to accuracy, especially in sparse data settings. We also introduce an algorithm for performing adversarial concept attacks, where an image is perturbed in a way that does not change a concept-based model's concept predictions, but changes the class prediction. The existence of such adversarial examples raises questions about the interpretable qualities promised by concept-based models.

- **Summary**: Medical foundation models are gaining prominence in the medical community for their ability to derive general representations from extensive collections of medical image-text pairs. Recent research indicates that these models are susceptible to backdoor attacks, which allow them to classify clean images accurately but fail when specific triggers are introduced. However, traditional backdoor attacks necessitate a considerable amount of additional data to maliciously pre-train a model. This requirement is often impractical in medical imaging applications due to the usual scarcity of data. Inspired by the latest developments in learnable prompts, this work introduces a method to embed a backdoor into the medical foundation model during the prompt learning phase. By incorporating learnable prompts within the text encoder and introducing imperceptible learnable noise trigger to the input images, we exploit the full capabilities of the medical foundation models (Med-FM). Our method, BAPLe, requires only a minimal subset of data to adjust the noise trigger and the text prompts for downstream tasks, enabling the creation of an effective backdoor attack. Through extensive experiments with four medical foundation models, each pre-trained on different modalities and evaluated across six downstream datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. BAPLe achieves a high backdoor success rate across all models and datasets, outperforming the baseline backdoor attack methods. Our work highlights the vulnerability of Med-FMs towards backdoor attacks and strives to promote the safe adoption of Med-FMs before their deployment in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Costal cartilage segmentation is crucial to various medical applications, necessitating precise and reliable techniques due to its complex anatomy and the importance of accurate diagnosis and surgical planning. We propose a novel deep learning-based approach called topology-guided deformable Mamba (TGDM) for costal cartilage segmentation. The TGDM is tailored to capture the intricate long-range costal cartilage relationships. Our method leverages a deformable model that integrates topological priors to enhance the adaptability and accuracy of the segmentation process. Furthermore, we developed a comprehensive benchmark that contains 165 cases for costal cartilage segmentation. This benchmark sets a new standard for evaluating costal cartilage segmentation techniques and provides a valuable resource for future research. Extensive experiments conducted on both in-domain benchmarks and out-of domain test sets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods, showing significant improvements in segmentation precision and robustness.

- **Summary**: Multimodal networks have demonstrated remarkable performance improvements over their unimodal counterparts. Existing multimodal networks are designed in a multi-branch fashion that, due to the reliance on fusion strategies, exhibit deteriorated performance if one or more modalities are missing. In this work, we propose a modality invariant multimodal learning method, which is less susceptible to the impact of missing modalities. It consists of a single-branch network sharing weights across multiple modalities to learn inter-modality representations to maximize performance as well as robustness to missing modalities. Extensive experiments are performed on four challenging datasets including textual-visual (UPMC Food-101, Hateful Memes, Ferramenta) and audio-visual modalities (VoxCeleb1). Our proposed method achieves superior performance when all modalities are present as well as in the case of missing modalities during training or testing compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Although convolutional neural networks have made outstanding achievements in visible light target detection, there are still many challenges in infrared small object detection because of the low signal-to-noise ratio, incomplete object structure, and a lack of reliable infrared small object dataset. To resolve limitations of the infrared small object dataset, a new dataset named InfraTiny was constructed, and more than 85% bounding box is less than 32x32 pixels (3218 images and a total of 20,893 bounding boxes). A multi-scale attention mechanism module (MSAM) and a Feature Fusion Augmentation Pyramid Module (FFAFPM) were proposed and deployed onto embedded devices. The MSAM enables the network to obtain scale perception information by acquiring different receptive fields, while the background noise information is suppressed to enhance feature extraction ability. The proposed FFAFPM can enrich semantic information, and enhance the fusion of shallow feature and deep feature, thus false positive results have been significantly reduced. By integrating the proposed methods into the YOLO model, which is named Infra-YOLO, infrared small object detection performance has been improved. Compared to yolov3, mAP@0.5 has been improved by 2.7%; and compared to yolov4, that by 2.5% on the InfraTiny dataset. The proposed Infra-YOLO was also transferred onto the embedded device in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for real application scenarios, where the channel pruning method is adopted to reduce FLOPs and to achieve a tradeoff between speed and accuracy. Even if the parameters of Infra-YOLO are reduced by 88% with the pruning method, a gain of 0.7% is still achieved on mAP@0.5 compared to yolov3, and a gain of 0.5% compared to yolov4. Experimental results show that the proposed MSAM and FFAFPM method can improve infrared small object detection performance compared with the previous benchmark method.

- **Summary**: Accurate classification of blood cells is of vital significance in the diagnosis of hematological disorders. However, in real-world scenarios, domain shifts caused by the variability in laboratory procedures and settings, result in a rapid deterioration of the model's generalization performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework of domain-invariant representation learning (DoRL) via segment anything model (SAM) for blood cell classification. The DoRL comprises two main components: a LoRA-based SAM (LoRA-SAM) and a cross-domain autoencoder (CAE). The advantage of DoRL is that it can extract domain-invariant representations from various blood cell datasets in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, we first leverage the large-scale foundation model of SAM, fine-tuned with LoRA, to learn general image embeddings and segment blood cells. Additionally, we introduce CAE to learn domain-invariant representations across different-domain datasets while mitigating images' artifacts. To validate the effectiveness of domain-invariant representations, we employ five widely used machine learning classifiers to construct blood cell classification models. Experimental results on two public blood cell datasets and a private real dataset demonstrate that our proposed DoRL achieves a new state-of-the-art cross-domain performance, surpassing existing methods by a significant margin.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) methods have shown promise in reconstructing high-resolution images with fine details from low-resolution counterparts. However, these approaches typically require tens or even hundreds of iterative samplings, resulting in significant latency. Recently, techniques have been devised to enhance the sampling efficiency of diffusion-based SR models via knowledge distillation. Nonetheless, when aligning the knowledge of student and teacher models, these solutions either solely rely on pixel-level loss constraints or neglect the fact that diffusion models prioritize varying levels of information at different time steps. To accomplish effective and efficient image super-resolution, we propose a time-aware diffusion distillation method, named TAD-SR. Specifically, we introduce a novel score distillation strategy to align the data distribution between the outputs of the student and teacher models after minor noise perturbation. This distillation strategy enables the student network to concentrate more on the high-frequency details. Furthermore, to mitigate performance limitations stemming from distillation, we integrate a latent adversarial loss and devise a time-aware discriminator that leverages diffusion priors to effectively distinguish between real images and generated images. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable or even superior performance compared to both previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and the teacher model in just one sampling step.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models usher a new era of video editing, flexibly manipulating the video contents with text prompts. Despite the widespread application demand in editing human-centered videos, these models face significant challenges in handling complex objects like humans. In this paper, we introduce DeCo, a novel video editing framework specifically designed to treat humans and the background as separate editable targets, ensuring global spatial-temporal consistency by maintaining the coherence of each individual component. Specifically, we propose a decoupled dynamic human representation that utilizes a parametric human body prior to generate tailored humans while preserving the consistent motions as the original video. In addition, we consider the background as a layered atlas to apply text-guided image editing approaches on it. To further enhance the geometry and texture of humans during the optimization, we extend the calculation of score distillation sampling into normal space and image space. Moreover, we tackle inconsistent lighting between the edited targets by leveraging a lighting-aware video harmonizer, a problem previously overlooked in decompose-edit-combine approaches. Extensive qualitative and numerical experiments demonstrate that DeCo outperforms prior video editing methods in human-centered videos, especially in longer videos.

- **Summary**: Previous works have shown that reducing parameter overhead and computations for transformer-based single image super-resolution (SISR) models (e.g., SwinIR) usually leads to a reduction of performance. In this paper, we present GRFormer, an efficient and lightweight method, which not only reduces the parameter overhead and computations, but also greatly improves performance. The core of GRFormer is Grouped Residual Self-Attention (GRSA), which is specifically oriented towards two fundamental components. Firstly, it introduces a novel grouped residual layer (GRL) to replace the Query, Key, Value (QKV) linear layer in self-attention, aimed at efficiently reducing parameter overhead, computations, and performance loss at the same time. Secondly, it integrates a compact Exponential-Space Relative Position Bias (ES-RPB) as a substitute for the original relative position bias to improve the ability to represent position information while further minimizing the parameter count. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GRFormer outperforms state-of-the-art transformer-based methods for $\times$2, $\times$3 and $\times$4 SISR tasks, notably outperforming SOTA by a maximum PSNR of 0.23dB when trained on the DIV2K dataset, while reducing the number of parameter and MACs by about \textbf{60\%} and \textbf{49\% } in only self-attention module respectively. We hope that our simple and effective method that can easily applied to SR models based on window-division self-attention can serve as a useful tool for further research in image super-resolution.

- **Summary**: A novel algorithm for video lane detection is proposed in this paper. First, we extract a feature map for a current frame and detect a latent mask for obstacles occluding lanes. Then, we enhance the feature map by developing an occlusion-aware memory-based refinement (OMR) module. It takes the obstacle mask and feature map from the current frame, previous output, and memory information as input, and processes them recursively in a video. Moreover, we apply a novel data augmentation scheme for training the OMR module effectively.

- **Summary**: Reconstruction-based methods have significantly advanced modern unsupervised anomaly detection. However, the strong capacity of neural networks often violates the underlying assumptions by reconstructing abnormal samples well. To alleviate this issue, we present a simple yet effective reconstruction framework named Attention-Guided Pertuation Network (AGPNet), which learns to add perturbation noise with an attention mask, for accurate unsupervised anomaly detection. Specifically, it consists of two branches, \ie, a plain reconstruction branch and an auxiliary attention-based perturbation branch. The reconstruction branch is simply a plain reconstruction network that learns to reconstruct normal samples, while the auxiliary branch aims to produce attention masks to guide the noise perturbation process for normal samples from easy to hard. By doing so, we are expecting to synthesize hard yet more informative anomalies for training, which enable the reconstruction branch to learn important inherent normal patterns both comprehensively and efficiently. Extensive experiments are conducted on three popular benchmarks covering MVTec-AD, VisA, and MVTec-3D, and show that our framework obtains leading anomaly detection performance under various setups including few-shot, one-class, and multi-class setups.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we construct a large-scale benchmark dataset for Ground-to-Aerial Video-based person Re-Identification, named G2A-VReID, which comprises 185,907 images and 5,576 tracklets, featuring 2,788 distinct identities. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset for video ReID under Ground-to-Aerial scenarios. G2A-VReID dataset has the following characteristics: 1) Drastic view changes; 2) Large number of annotated identities; 3) Rich outdoor scenarios; 4) Huge difference in resolution. Additionally, we propose a new benchmark approach for cross-platform ReID by transforming the cross-platform visual alignment problem into visual-semantic alignment through vision-language model (i.e., CLIP) and applying a parameter-efficient Video Set-Level-Adapter module to adapt image-based foundation model to video ReID tasks, termed VSLA-CLIP. Besides, to further reduce the great discrepancy across the platforms, we also devise the platform-bridge prompts for efficient visual feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on all existing video ReID datasets and our proposed G2A-VReID dataset.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has become an important approach in pretraining large neural networks, enabling unprecedented scaling of model and dataset sizes. While recent advances like I-JEPA have shown promising results for Vision Transformers, adapting such methods to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) presents unique challenges. In this paper, we introduce CNN-JEPA, a novel SSL method that successfully applies the joint embedding predictive architecture approach to CNNs. Our method incorporates a sparse CNN encoder to handle masked inputs, a fully convolutional predictor using depthwise separable convolutions, and an improved masking strategy. We demonstrate that CNN-JEPA outperforms I-JEPA with ViT architectures on ImageNet-100, achieving 73.3% linear top-1 accuracy with a standard ResNet-50 encoder. Compared to other CNN-based SSL methods, CNN-JEPA requires 17-35% less training time for the same number of epochs and approaches the linear and k-NN top-1 accuracies of BYOL, SimCLR, and VICReg. Our approach offers a simpler, more efficient alternative to existing SSL methods for CNNs, requiring minimal augmentations and no separate projector network.

- **Summary**: We introduce DiffSteISR, a pioneering framework for reconstructing real-world stereo images. DiffSteISR utilizes the powerful prior knowledge embedded in pre-trained text-to-image model to efficiently recover the lost texture details in low-resolution stereo images. Specifically, DiffSteISR implements a time-aware stereo cross attention with temperature adapter (TASCATA) to guide the diffusion process, ensuring that the generated left and right views exhibit high texture consistency thereby reducing disparity error between the super-resolved images and the ground truth (GT) images. Additionally, a stereo omni attention control network (SOA ControlNet) is proposed to enhance the consistency of super-resolved images with GT images in the pixel, perceptual, and distribution space. Finally, DiffSteISR incorporates a stereo semantic extractor (SSE) to capture unique viewpoint soft semantic information and shared hard tag semantic information, thereby effectively improving the semantic accuracy and consistency of the generated left and right images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DiffSteISR accurately reconstructs natural and precise textures from low-resolution stereo images while maintaining a high consistency of semantic and texture between the left and right views.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been shown to be a powerful approach for learning visual representations. In this study, we propose incorporating ZCA whitening as the final layer of the encoder in self-supervised learning to enhance the quality of learned features by normalizing and decorrelating them. Although whitening has been utilized in SSL in previous works, its potential to universally improve any SSL model has not been explored. We demonstrate that adding whitening as the last layer of SSL pretrained encoders is independent of the self-supervised learning method and encoder architecture, thus it improves performance for a wide range of SSL methods across multiple encoder architectures and datasets. Our experiments show that whitening is capable of improving linear and k-NN probing accuracy by 1-5%. Additionally, we propose metrics that allow for a comprehensive analysis of the learned features, provide insights into the quality of the representations and help identify collapse patterns.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we firstly tackle a more realistic Domain Adaptation (DA) setting: Source-Free Blending-Target Domain Adaptation (SF-BTDA), where we can not access to source domain data while facing mixed multiple target domains without any domain labels in prior. Compared to existing DA scenarios, SF-BTDA generally faces the co-existence of different label shifts in different targets, along with noisy target pseudo labels generated from the source model. In this paper, we propose a new method called Evidential Contrastive Alignment (ECA) to decouple the blending target domain and alleviate the effect from noisy target pseudo labels. First, to improve the quality of pseudo target labels, we propose a calibrated evidential learning module to iteratively improve both the accuracy and certainty of the resulting model and adaptively generate high-quality pseudo target labels. Second, we design a graph contrastive learning with the domain distance matrix and confidence-uncertainty criterion, to minimize the distribution gap of samples of a same class in the blended target domains, which alleviates the co-existence of different label shifts in blended targets. We conduct a new benchmark based on three standard DA datasets and ECA outperforms other methods with considerable gains and achieves comparable results compared with those that have domain labels or source data in prior.

- **Summary**: Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) uses a low-speed 2D camera to capture high-speed scenes as snapshot compressed measurements, followed by a reconstruction algorithm to retrieve the high-speed video frames. The fast evolving mobile devices and existing high-performance video SCI reconstruction algorithms motivate us to develop mobile reconstruction methods for real-world applications. Yet, it is still challenging to deploy previous reconstruction algorithms on mobile devices due to the complex inference process, let alone real-time mobile reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, there is no video SCI reconstruction model designed to run on the mobile devices. Towards this end, in this paper, we present an effective approach for video SCI reconstruction, dubbed MobileSCI, which can run at real-time speed on the mobile devices for the first time. Specifically, we first build a U-shaped 2D convolution-based architecture, which is much more efficient and mobile-friendly than previous state-of-the-art reconstruction methods. Besides, an efficient feature mixing block, based on the channel splitting and shuffling mechanisms, is introduced as a novel bottleneck block of our proposed MobileSCI to alleviate the computational burden. Finally, a customized knowledge distillation strategy is utilized to further improve the reconstruction quality. Extensive results on both simulated and real data show that our proposed MobileSCI can achieve superior reconstruction quality with high efficiency on the mobile devices. Particularly, we can reconstruct a 256 X 256 X 8 snapshot compressed measurement with real-time performance (about 35 FPS) on an iPhone 15.

- **Summary**: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and computed tomography (CT) are two common non-invasive imaging methods for assessing patients with cardiovascular disease. CMR typically acquires multiple sparse 2D slices, with unavoidable respiratory motion artefacts between slices, whereas CT acquires isotropic dense data but uses ionising radiation. In this study, we explore the combination of Slice Shifting Algorithm (SSA), Spatial Transformer Network (STN), and Label Transformer Network (LTN) to: 1) correct respiratory motion between segmented slices, and 2) transform sparse segmentation data into dense segmentation. All combinations were validated using synthetic motion-corrupted CMR slice segmentation generated from CT in 1699 cases, where the dense CT serves as the ground truth. In 199 testing cases, SSA-LTN achieved the best results for Dice score and Huasdorff distance (94.0% and 4.7 mm respectively, average over 5 labels) but gave topological errors in 8 cases. STN was effective as a plug-in tool for correcting all topological errors with minimal impact on overall performance (93.5% and 5.0 mm respectively). SSA also proves to be a valuable plug-in tool, enhancing performance over both STN-based and LTN-based models. The code for these different combinations is available at https://github.com/XESchong/STACOM2024.

- **Summary**: Referring segmentation aims to segment a target object related to a natural language expression. Key challenges of this task are understanding the meaning of complex and ambiguous language expressions and determining the relevant regions in the image with multiple objects by referring to the expression. Recent models have focused on the early fusion with the language features at the intermediate stage of the vision encoder, but these approaches have a limitation that the language features cannot refer to the visual information. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel architecture, Cross-aware early fusion with stage-divided Vision and Language Transformer encoders (CrossVLT), which allows both language and vision encoders to perform the early fusion for improving the ability of the cross-modal context modeling. Unlike previous methods, our method enables the vision and language features to refer to each other's information at each stage to mutually enhance the robustness of both encoders. Furthermore, unlike the conventional scheme that relies solely on the high-level features for the cross-modal alignment, we introduce a feature-based alignment scheme that enables the low-level to high-level features of the vision and language encoders to engage in the cross-modal alignment. By aligning the intermediate cross-modal features in all encoder stages, this scheme leads to effective cross-modal fusion. In this way, the proposed approach is simple but effective for referring image segmentation, and it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on three public benchmarks.

- **Summary**: The modeling and manipulation of 3D scenes captured from the real world are pivotal in various applications, attracting growing research interest. While previous works on editing have achieved interesting results through manipulating 3D meshes, they often require accurately reconstructed meshes to perform editing, which limits their application in 3D content generation. To address this gap, we introduce a novel single-image-driven 3D scene editing approach based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, enabling intuitive manipulation via directly editing the content on a 2D image plane. Our method learns to optimize the 3D Gaussians to align with an edited version of the image rendered from a user-specified viewpoint of the original scene. To capture long-range object deformation, we introduce positional loss into the optimization process of 3D Gaussian Splatting and enable gradient propagation through reparameterization. To handle occluded 3D Gaussians when rendering from the specified viewpoint, we build an anchor-based structure and employ a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy capable of handling long-range deformation while maintaining structural stability. Furthermore, we design a novel masking strategy to adaptively identify non-rigid deformation regions for fine-scale modeling. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in handling geometric details, long-range, and non-rigid deformation, demonstrating superior editing flexibility and quality compared to previous approaches.

- **Summary**: The flat lensless camera design reduces the camera size and weight significantly. In this design, the camera lens is replaced by another optical element that interferes with the incoming light. The image is recovered from the raw sensor measurements using a reconstruction algorithm. Yet, the quality of the reconstructed images is not satisfactory. To mitigate this, we propose utilizing a pre-trained diffusion model with a control network and a learned separable transformation for reconstruction. This allows us to build a prototype flat camera with high-quality imaging, presenting state-of-the-art results in both terms of quality and perceptuality. We demonstrate its ability to leverage also textual descriptions of the captured scene to further enhance reconstruction. Our reconstruction method which leverages the strong capabilities of a pre-trained diffusion model can be used in other imaging systems for improved reconstruction results.

- **Summary**: With the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the evaluation of multimodal models in the context of mathematical problems has become a valuable research field. Multimodal visual-textual mathematical reasoning serves as a critical indicator for evaluating the comprehension and complex multi-step quantitative reasoning abilities of MLLMs. However, previous multimodal math benchmarks have not sufficiently integrated visual and textual information. To address this gap, we proposed MathScape, a new benchmark that emphasizes the understanding and application of combined visual and textual information. MathScape is designed to evaluate photo-based math problem scenarios, assessing the theoretical understanding and application ability of MLLMs through a categorical hierarchical approach. We conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation on 11 advanced MLLMs, revealing that our benchmark is challenging even for the most sophisticated models. By analyzing the evaluation results, we identify the limitations of MLLMs, offering valuable insights for enhancing model performance.

- **Summary**: Data poisoning attacks on clustering algorithms have received limited attention, with existing methods struggling to scale efficiently as dataset sizes and feature counts increase. These attacks typically require re-clustering the entire dataset multiple times to generate predictions and assess the attacker's objectives, significantly hindering their scalability. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing Sonic, a novel genetic data poisoning attack that leverages incremental and scalable clustering algorithms, e.g., FISHDBC, as surrogates to accelerate poisoning attacks against graph-based and density-based clustering methods, such as HDBSCAN. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Sonic in poisoning the target clustering algorithms. We then conduct a comprehensive analysis of the factors affecting the scalability and transferability of poisoning attacks against clustering algorithms, and we conclude by examining the robustness of hyperparameters in our attack strategy Sonic.

- **Summary**: Beyond the Transformer, it is important to explore how to exploit the capacity of the MetaFormer, an architecture that is fundamental to the performance improvements of the Transformer. Previous studies have exploited it only for the backbone network. Unlike previous studies, we explore the capacity of the Metaformer architecture more extensively in the semantic segmentation task. We propose a powerful semantic segmentation network, MetaSeg, which leverages the Metaformer architecture from the backbone to the decoder. Our MetaSeg shows that the MetaFormer architecture plays a significant role in capturing the useful contexts for the decoder as well as for the backbone. In addition, recent segmentation methods have shown that using a CNN-based backbone for extracting the spatial information and a decoder for extracting the global information is more effective than using a transformer-based backbone with a CNN-based decoder. This motivates us to adopt the CNN-based backbone using the MetaFormer block and design our MetaFormer-based decoder, which consists of a novel self-attention module to capture the global contexts. To consider both the global contexts extraction and the computational efficiency of the self-attention for semantic segmentation, we propose a Channel Reduction Attention (CRA) module that reduces the channel dimension of the query and key into the one dimension. In this way, our proposed MetaSeg outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods with more efficient computational costs on popular semantic segmentation and a medical image segmentation benchmark, including ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-stuff, and Synapse. The code is available at https://github.com/hyunwoo137/MetaSeg.

- **Summary**: We propose progressive radiance distillation, an inverse rendering method that combines physically-based rendering with Gaussian-based radiance field rendering using a distillation progress map. Taking multi-view images as input, our method starts from a pre-trained radiance field guidance, and distills physically-based light and material parameters from the radiance field using an image-fitting process. The distillation progress map is initialized to a small value, which favors radiance field rendering. During early iterations when fitted light and material parameters are far from convergence, the radiance field fallback ensures the sanity of image loss gradients and avoids local minima that attracts under-fit states. As fitted parameters converge, the physical model gradually takes over and the distillation progress increases correspondingly. In presence of light paths unmodeled by the physical model, the distillation progress never finishes on affected pixels and the learned radiance field stays in the final rendering. With this designed tolerance for physical model limitations, we prevent unmodeled color components from leaking into light and material parameters, alleviating relighting artifacts. Meanwhile, the remaining radiance field compensates for the limitations of the physical model, guaranteeing high-quality novel views synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques quality-wise in both novel view synthesis and relighting. The idea of progressive radiance distillation is not limited to Gaussian splatting. We show that it also has positive effects for prominently specular scenes when adapted to a mesh-based inverse rendering method.

- **Summary**: Video Moment Retrieval, which aims to locate in-context video moments according to a natural language query, is an essential task for cross-modal grounding. Existing methods focus on enhancing the cross-modal interactions between all moments and the textual description for video understanding. However, constantly interacting with all locations is unreasonable because of uneven semantic distribution across the timeline and noisy visual backgrounds. This paper proposes a cross-modal Context Denoising Network (CDNet) for accurate moment retrieval by disentangling complex correlations and denoising irrelevant dynamics.Specifically, we propose a query-guided semantic disentanglement (QSD) to decouple video moments by estimating alignment levels according to the global and fine-grained correlation. A Context-aware Dynamic Denoisement (CDD) is proposed to enhance understanding of aligned spatial-temporal details by learning a group of query-relevant offsets. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CDNet achieves state-of-the-art performances.

- **Summary**: The field of autonomous driving increasingly demands high-quality annotated video training data. In this paper, we propose Panacea+, a powerful and universally applicable framework for generating video data in driving scenes. Built upon the foundation of our previous work, Panacea, Panacea+ adopts a multi-view appearance noise prior mechanism and a super-resolution module for enhanced consistency and increased resolution. Extensive experiments show that the generated video samples from Panacea+ greatly benefit a wide range of tasks on different datasets, including 3D object tracking, 3D object detection, and lane detection tasks on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 dataset. These results strongly prove Panacea+ to be a valuable data generation framework for autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: Stereo matching, a critical step of 3D reconstruction, has fully shifted towards deep learning due to its strong feature representation of remote sensing images. However, ground truth for stereo matching task relies on expensive airborne LiDAR data, thus making it difficult to obtain enough samples for supervised learning. To improve the generalization ability of stereo matching networks on cross-domain data from different sensors and scenarios, in this paper, we dedicate to study key training factors from three perspectives. (1) For the selection of training dataset, it is important to select data with similar regional target distribution as the test set instead of utilizing data from the same sensor. (2) For model structure, cascaded structure that flexibly adapts to different sizes of features is preferred. (3) For training manner, unsupervised methods generalize better than supervised methods, and we design an unsupervised early-stop strategy to help retain the best model with pre-trained weights as the basis. Extensive experiments are conducted to support the previous findings, on the basis of which we present an unsupervised stereo matching network with good generalization performance. We release the source code and the datasets at https://github.com/Elenairene/RKF_RSSM to reproduce the results and encourage future work.

- **Summary**: While deep face recognition models have demonstrated remarkable performance, they often struggle on the inputs from domains beyond their training data. Recent attempts aim to expand the training set by relying on computationally expensive and inherently challenging image-space augmentation of image generation modules. In an orthogonal direction, we present a simple yet effective method to expand the training data by interpolating between instance-level feature statistics across labeled and unlabeled sets. Our method, dubbed Targeted Style Adversary (TSA), is motivated by two observations: (i) the input domain is reflected in feature statistics, and (ii) face recognition model performance is influenced by style information. Shifting towards an unlabeled style implicitly synthesizes challenging training instances. We devise a recognizability metric to constraint our framework to preserve the inherent identity-related information of labeled instances. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through evaluations on unconstrained benchmarks, outperforming or being on par with its competitors while offering nearly a 70\% improvement in training speed and 40\% less memory consumption.

- **Summary**: 3D dense captioning is a task to localize objects in a 3D scene and generate descriptive sentences for each object. Recent approaches in 3D dense captioning have adopted transformer encoder-decoder frameworks from object detection to build an end-to-end pipeline without hand-crafted components. However, these approaches struggle with contradicting objectives where a single query attention has to simultaneously view both the tightly localized object regions and contextual environment. To overcome this challenge, we introduce SIA (See-It-All), a transformer pipeline that engages in 3D dense captioning with a novel paradigm called late aggregation. SIA simultaneously decodes two sets of queries-context query and instance query. The instance query focuses on localization and object attribute descriptions, while the context query versatilely captures the region-of-interest of relationships between multiple objects or with the global scene, then aggregated afterwards (i.e., late aggregation) via simple distance-based measures. To further enhance the quality of contextualized caption generation, we design a novel aggregator to generate a fully informed caption based on the surrounding context, the global environment, and object instances. Extensive experiments on two of the most widely-used 3D dense captioning datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a significant improvement over prior methods.

- **Summary**: Model merging is an efficient empowerment technique in the machine learning community that does not require the collection of raw training data and does not require expensive computation. As model merging becomes increasingly prevalent across various fields, it is crucial to understand the available model merging techniques comprehensively. However, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding a systematic and thorough review of these techniques. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of model merging methods and theories, their applications in various domains and settings, and future research directions. Specifically, we first propose a new taxonomic approach that exhaustively discusses existing model merging methods. Secondly, we discuss the application of model merging techniques in large language models, multimodal large language models, and 10+ machine learning subfields, including continual learning, multi-task learning, few-shot learning, etc. Finally, we highlight the remaining challenges of model merging and discuss future research directions.

- **Summary**: In videos containing spoofed faces, we may uncover the spoofing evidence based on either photometric or dynamic abnormality, even a combination of both. Prevailing face anti-spoofing (FAS) approaches generally concentrate on the single-frame scenario, however, purely photometric-driven methods overlook the dynamic spoofing clues that may be exposed over time. This may lead FAS systems to conclude incorrect judgments, especially in cases where it is easily distinguishable in terms of dynamics but challenging to discern in terms of photometrics. To this end, we propose the Graph Guided Video Vision Transformer (G$^2$V$^2$former), which combines faces with facial landmarks for photometric and dynamic feature fusion. We factorize the attention into space and time, and fuse them via a spatiotemporal block. Specifically, we design a novel temporal attention called Kronecker temporal attention, which has a wider receptive field, and is beneficial for capturing dynamic information. Moreover, we leverage the low-semantic motion of facial landmarks to guide the high-semantic change of facial expressions based on the motivation that regions containing landmarks may reveal more dynamic clues. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance under various scenarios. The codes will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures traditionally employ a grid-based approach to tokenization independent of the semantic content of an image. We propose a modular superpixel tokenization strategy which decouples tokenization and feature extraction; a shift from contemporary approaches where these are treated as an undifferentiated whole. Using on-line content-aware tokenization and scale- and shape-invariant positional embeddings, we perform experiments and ablations that contrast our approach with patch-based tokenization and randomized partitions as baselines. We show that our method significantly improves the faithfulness of attributions, gives pixel-level granularity on zero-shot unsupervised dense prediction tasks, while maintaining predictive performance in classification tasks. Our approach provides a modular tokenization framework commensurable with standard architectures, extending the space of ViTs to a larger class of semantically-rich models.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces the new and powerful image patch descriptor based on second order image statistics/derivatives. Here, the image patch is treated as a 3D surface with intensity being the 3rd dimension. The considered 3D surface has a rich set of second order features/statistics such as ridges, valleys, cliffs and so on, that can be easily captured by using the difference of rotating semi Gaussian filters. The originality of this method is based on successfully combining the response of the directional filters with that of the Difference of Gaussian (DOG) approach. The obtained descriptor shows a good discriminative power when dealing with the variations in illumination, scale, rotation, blur, viewpoint and compression. The experiments on image matching, demonstrates the advantage of the obtained descriptor when compared to its first order counterparts such as SIFT, DAISY, GLOH, GIST and LIDRIC.

- **Summary**: Near-duplicate images are often generated when applying repeated photometric and geometric transformations that produce imperceptible variants of the original image. Consequently, a deluge of near-duplicates can be circulated online posing copyright infringement concerns. The concerns are more severe when biometric data is altered through such nuanced transformations. In this work, we address the challenge of near-duplicate detection in face images by, firstly, identifying the original image from a set of near-duplicates and, secondly, deducing the relationship between the original image and the near-duplicates. We construct a tree-like structure, called an Image Phylogeny Tree (IPT) using a graph-theoretic approach to estimate the relationship, i.e., determine the sequence in which they have been generated. We further extend our method to create an ensemble of IPTs known as Image Phylogeny Forests (IPFs). We rigorously evaluate our method to demonstrate robustness across other modalities, unseen transformations by latest generative models and IPT configurations, thereby significantly advancing the state-of-the-art performance by 42% on IPF reconstruction accuracy.

- **Summary**: In the pathway toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), understanding human's affection is essential to enhance machine's cognition abilities. For achieving more sensual human-AI interaction, Multimodal Affective Computing (MAC) in human-spoken videos has attracted increasing attention. However, previous methods are mainly devoted to designing multimodal fusion algorithms, suffering from two issues: semantic imbalance caused by diverse pre-processing operations and semantic mismatch raised by inconsistent affection content contained in different modalities comparing with the multimodal ground truth. Besides, the usage of manual features extractors make they fail in building end-to-end pipeline for multiple MAC downstream tasks. To address above challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end framework named SemanticMAC to compute multimodal semantic-centric affection for human-spoken videos. We firstly employ pre-trained Transformer model in multimodal data pre-processing and design Affective Perceiver module to capture unimodal affective information. Moreover, we present a semantic-centric approach to unify multimodal representation learning in three ways, including gated feature interaction, multi-task pseudo label generation, and intra-/inter-sample contrastive learning. Finally, SemanticMAC effectively learn specific- and shared-semantic representations in the guidance of semantic-centric labels. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpass the state-of-the-art methods on 7 public datasets in four MAC downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Recent research on knowledge distillation has increasingly focused on logit distillation because of its simplicity, effectiveness, and versatility in model compression. In this paper, we introduce Refined Logit Distillation (RLD) to address the limitations of current logit distillation methods. Our approach is motivated by the observation that even high-performing teacher models can make incorrect predictions, creating a conflict between the standard distillation loss and the cross-entropy loss. This conflict can undermine the consistency of the student model's learning objectives. Previous attempts to use labels to empirically correct teacher predictions may undermine the class correlation. In contrast, our RLD employs labeling information to dynamically refine teacher logits. In this way, our method can effectively eliminate misleading information from the teacher while preserving crucial class correlations, thus enhancing the value and efficiency of distilled knowledge. Experimental results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate its superiority over existing methods. The code is provided at \text{https://github.com/zju-SWJ/RLD}.

- **Summary**: The intersection of computer vision and machine learning has emerged as a promising avenue for advancing historical research, facilitating a more profound exploration of our past. However, the application of machine learning approaches in historical palaeography is often met with criticism due to their perceived ``black box'' nature. In response to this challenge, we introduce NeuroPapyri, an innovative deep learning-based model specifically designed for the analysis of images containing ancient Greek papyri. To address concerns related to transparency and interpretability, the model incorporates an attention mechanism. This attention mechanism not only enhances the model's performance but also provides a visual representation of the image regions that significantly contribute to the decision-making process. Specifically calibrated for processing images of papyrus documents with lines of handwritten text, the model utilizes individual attention maps to inform the presence or absence of specific characters in the input image. This paper presents the NeuroPapyri model, including its architecture and training methodology. Results from the evaluation demonstrate NeuroPapyri's efficacy in document retrieval, showcasing its potential to advance the analysis of historical manuscripts.

- **Summary**: Deep learning based approaches are now widely used across biophysics to help automate a variety of tasks including image segmentation, feature selection, and deconvolution. However, the presence of multiple competing deep learning architectures, each with its own unique advantages and disadvantages, makes it challenging to select an architecture best suited for a specific application. As such, we present a comprehensive comparison of common models. Here, we focus on the task of segmentation assuming the typically small training dataset sizes available from biophysics experiments and compare the following four commonly used architectures: convolutional neural networks, U-Nets, vision transformers, and vision state space models. In doing so, we establish criteria for determining optimal conditions under which each model excels, thereby offering practical guidelines for researchers and practitioners in the field.

- **Summary**: The goal of image cropping is to identify visually appealing crops within an image. Conventional methods rely on specialized architectures trained on specific datasets, which struggle to be adapted to new requirements. Recent breakthroughs in large vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled visual in-context learning without explicit training. However, effective strategies for vision downstream tasks with VLMs remain largely unclear and underexplored. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to leverage VLMs for better image cropping. First, we propose an efficient prompt retrieval mechanism for image cropping to automate the selection of in-context examples. Second, we introduce an iterative refinement strategy to iteratively enhance the predicted crops. The proposed framework, named Cropper, is applicable to a wide range of cropping tasks, including free-form cropping, subject-aware cropping, and aspect ratio-aware cropping. Extensive experiments and a user study demonstrate that Cropper significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across several benchmarks.

- **Summary**: We demonstrate the efficiencies and explanatory abilities of extensions to the common tools of Autoencoders and LLM interpreters, in the novel context of comparing different cultural approaches to the same international news event. We develop a new Convolutional-Recurrent Variational Autoencoder (CRVAE) model that extends the modalities of previous CVAE models, by using fully-connected latent layers to embed in parallel the CNN encodings of video frames, together with the LSTM encodings of their related text derived from audio. We incorporate the model within a larger system that includes frame-caption alignment, latent space vector clustering, and a novel LLM-based cluster interpreter. We measure, tune, and apply this system to the task of summarizing a video into three to five thematic clusters, with each theme described by ten LLM-produced phrases. We apply this system to two news topics, COVID-19 and the Winter Olympics, and five other topics are in progress.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a popular choice of model for tasks in computer vision. When CNNs are made with many layers, resulting in a deep neural network, skip connections may be added to create an easier gradient optimization problem while retaining model expressiveness. In this paper, we show that arbitrarily complex, trained, linear CNNs with skip connections can be simplified into a single-layer model, resulting in greatly reduced computational requirements during prediction time. We also present a method for training nonlinear models with skip connections that are gradually removed throughout training, giving the benefits of skip connections without requiring computational overhead during during prediction time. These results are demonstrated with practical examples on Residual Networks (ResNet) architecture.
