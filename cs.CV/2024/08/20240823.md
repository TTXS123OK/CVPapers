- **Summary**: Vehicle environmental awareness is a crucial issue in improving road safety. Through a variety of sensors and vehicle-to-vehicle communication, vehicles can collect a wealth of data. However, to make these data useful, sensor data must be integrated effectively. This paper focuses on the integration of image data and vehicle-to-vehicle communication data. More specifically, our goal is to identify the locations of vehicles sending messages within images, a challenge termed the vehicle identification problem. In this paper, we employ a supervised learning model to tackle the vehicle identification problem. However, we face two practical issues: first, drivers are typically unwilling to share privacy-sensitive image data, and second, drivers usually do not engage in data labeling. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a comprehensive solution to the vehicle identification problem, which leverages federated learning and automatic labeling techniques in combination with the aforementioned supervised learning model. We have validated the feasibility of our proposed approach through experiments.

- **Summary**: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) is a technique in self-supervised learning that focuses on acquiring detailed visual representations from unlabeled images by estimating the missing pixels in randomly masked sections. It has proven to be a powerful tool for the preliminary training of Vision Transformers (ViTs), yielding impressive results across various tasks. Nevertheless, most MIM methods heavily depend on the random masking strategy to formulate the pretext task. This strategy necessitates numerous trials to ascertain the optimal dropping ratio, which can be resource-intensive, requiring the model to be pre-trained for anywhere between 800 to 1600 epochs. Furthermore, this approach may not be suitable for all datasets. In this work, we propose a new masking strategy that effectively helps the model capture global and local features. Based on this masking strategy, SymMIM, our proposed training pipeline for MIM is introduced. SymMIM achieves a new SOTA accuracy of 85.9\% on ImageNet using ViT-Large and surpasses previous SOTA across downstream tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation tasks, and so on.

- **Summary**: Active learning aims to alleviate the amount of labor involved in data labeling by automating the selection of unlabeled samples via an acquisition function. For example, variational adversarial active learning (VAAL) leverages an adversarial network to discriminate unlabeled samples from labeled ones using latent space information. However, VAAL has the following shortcomings: (i) it does not exploit target task information, and (ii) unlabeled data is only used for sample selection rather than model training. To address these limitations, we introduce novel techniques that significantly improve the use of abundant unlabeled data during training and take into account the task information. Concretely, we propose an improved pseudo-labeling algorithm that leverages information from all unlabeled data in a semi-supervised manner, thus allowing a model to explore a richer data space. In addition, we develop a ranking-based loss prediction module that converts predicted relative ranking information into a differentiable ranking loss. This loss can be embedded as a rank variable into the latent space of a variational autoencoder and then trained with a discriminator in an adversarial fashion for sample selection. We demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over the state of the art on various image classification and segmentation benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: This paper focuses on a data-centric approach to machine learning applications in the context of Conway's Game of Life. Specifically, we consider the task of training a minimal architecture network to learn the transition rules of Game of Life for a given number of steps ahead, which is known to be challenging due to restrictions on the allowed number of trainable parameters. An extensive quantitative analysis showcases the benefits of utilizing a strategically designed training dataset, with its advantages persisting regardless of other parameters of the learning configuration, such as network initialization weights or optimization algorithm. Importantly, our findings highlight the integral role of domain expert insights in creating effective machine learning applications for constrained real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: In video analysis, understanding the temporal context is crucial for recognizing object interactions, event patterns, and contextual changes over time. The proposed model leverages adjacency and semantic similarities between objects from neighboring video frames to construct context-aware temporal object embeddings. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on visual appearance, our temporal embedding model considers the contextual relationships between objects, creating a meaningful embedding space where temporally connected object's vectors are positioned in proximity. Empirical studies demonstrate that our context-aware temporal embeddings can be used in conjunction with conventional visual embeddings to enhance the effectiveness of downstream applications. Moreover, the embeddings can be used to narrate a video using a Large Language Model (LLM). This paper describes the intricate details of the proposed objective function to generate context-aware temporal object embeddings for video data and showcases the potential applications of the generated embeddings in video analysis and object classification tasks.

- **Summary**: Open-set face forgery detection poses significant security threats and presents substantial challenges for existing detection models. These detectors primarily have two limitations: they cannot generalize across unknown forgery domains and inefficiently adapt to new data. To address these issues, we introduce an approach that is both general and parameter-efficient for face forgery detection. It builds on the assumption that different forgery source domains exhibit distinct style statistics. Previous methods typically require fully fine-tuning pre-trained networks, consuming substantial time and computational resources. In turn, we design a forgery-style mixture formulation that augments the diversity of forgery source domains, enhancing the model's generalizability across unseen domains. Drawing on recent advancements in vision transformers (ViT) for face forgery detection, we develop a parameter-efficient ViT-based detection model that includes lightweight forgery feature extraction modules and enables the model to extract global and local forgery clues simultaneously. We only optimize the inserted lightweight modules during training, maintaining the original ViT structure with its pre-trained ImageNet weights. This training strategy effectively preserves the informative pre-trained knowledge while flexibly adapting the model to the task of Deepfake detection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the designed model achieves state-of-the-art generalizability with significantly reduced trainable parameters, representing an important step toward open-set Deepfake detection in the wild.

- **Summary**: Facial recognition systems are susceptible to both physical and digital attacks, posing significant security risks. Traditional approaches often treat these two attack types separately due to their distinct characteristics. Thus, when being combined attacked, almost all methods could not deal. Some studies attempt to combine the sparse data from both types of attacks into a single dataset and try to find a common feature space, which is often impractical due to the space is difficult to be found or even non-existent. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that uses the sparse model to handle sparse data, utilizing different parameter groups to process distinct regions of the sparse feature space. Specifically, we employ the Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework in our model, expert parameters are matched to tokens with varying weights during training and adaptively activated during testing. However, the traditional MoE struggles with the complex and irregular classification boundaries of this problem. Thus, we introduce a flexible self-adapting weighting mechanism, enabling the model to better fit and adapt. In this paper, we proposed La-SoftMoE CLIP, which allows for more flexible adaptation to the Unified Attack Detection (UAD) task, significantly enhancing the model's capability to handle diversity attacks. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed method has SOTA performance.

- **Summary**: This research focuses on developing a real-time posture monitoring and risk assessment system for manual lifting tasks using advanced AI and computer vision technologies. Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a significant concern for workers involved in manual lifting, and traditional methods for posture correction are often inadequate due to delayed feedback and lack of personalized assessment. Our proposed solution integrates AI-driven posture detection, detailed keypoint analysis, risk level determination, and real-time feedback delivered through a user-friendly web interface. The system aims to improve posture, reduce the risk of MSDs, and enhance user engagement. The research involves comprehensive data collection, model training, and iterative development to ensure high accuracy and user satisfaction. The solution's effectiveness is evaluated against existing methodologies, demonstrating significant improvements in real-time feedback and risk assessment. This study contributes to the field by offering a novel approach to posture correction that addresses existing gaps and provides practical, immediate benefits to users.

- **Summary**: Do neural network models of vision learn brain-aligned representations because they share architectural constraints and task objectives with biological vision or because they learn universal features of natural image processing? We characterized the universality of hundreds of thousands of representational dimensions from visual neural networks with varied construction. We found that networks with varied architectures and task objectives learn to represent natural images using a shared set of latent dimensions, despite appearing highly distinct at a surface level. Next, by comparing these networks with human brain representations measured with fMRI, we found that the most brain-aligned representations in neural networks are those that are universal and independent of a network's specific characteristics. Remarkably, each network can be reduced to fewer than ten of its most universal dimensions with little impact on its representational similarity to the human brain. These results suggest that the underlying similarities between artificial and biological vision are primarily governed by a core set of universal image representations that are convergently learned by diverse systems.

- **Summary**: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have revolutionized various fields by enabling task automation and reducing human error. However, their internal workings and decision-making processes remain obscure due to their black box nature. Consequently, the lack of interpretability limits the application of these models in high-risk scenarios. To address this issue, the emerging field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to explain and interpret the inner workings of DNNs. Despite advancements, XAI faces challenges such as the semantic gap between machine and human understanding, the trade-off between interpretability and performance, and the need for context-specific explanations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal framework named VALE Visual and Language Explanation. VALE integrates explainable AI techniques with advanced language models to provide comprehensive explanations. This framework utilizes visual explanations from XAI tools, an advanced zero-shot image segmentation model, and a visual language model to generate corresponding textual explanations. By combining visual and textual explanations, VALE bridges the semantic gap between machine outputs and human interpretation, delivering results that are more comprehensible to users. In this paper, we conduct a pilot study of the VALE framework for image classification tasks. Specifically, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) are used to identify the most influential regions in classified images. The object of interest is then extracted using the Segment Anything Model (SAM), and explanations are generated using state-of-the-art pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Extensive experimental studies are performed on two datasets: the ImageNet dataset and a custom underwater SONAR image dataset, demonstrating VALEs real-world applicability in underwater image classification.



### From Few to More: Scribble-based Medical Image Segmentation via Masked Context Modeling and Continuous Pseudo Labels

- **Summary**: Scribble-based weakly supervised segmentation techniques offer comparable performance to fully supervised methods while significantly reducing annotation costs, making them an appealing alternative. Existing methods often rely on auxiliary tasks to enforce semantic consistency and use hard pseudo labels for supervision. However, these methods often overlook the unique requirements of models trained with sparse annotations. Since the model must predict pixel-wise segmentation maps with limited annotations, the ability to handle varying levels of annotation richness is critical. In this paper, we adopt the principle of `from few to more' and propose MaCo, a weakly supervised framework designed for medical image segmentation. MaCo employs masked context modeling (MCM) and continuous pseudo labels (CPL). MCM uses an attention-based masking strategy to disrupt the input image, compelling the model's predictions to remain consistent with those of the original image. CPL converts scribble annotations into continuous pixel-wise labels by applying an exponential decay function to distance maps, resulting in continuous maps that represent the confidence of each pixel belonging to a specific category, rather than using hard pseudo labels. We evaluate MaCo against other weakly supervised methods using three public datasets. The results indicate that MaCo outperforms competing methods across all datasets, setting a new record in weakly supervised medical image segmentation.

- **Summary**: Detecting cracks with pixel-level precision for key structures is a significant challenge, as existing methods struggle to effectively integrate local textures and pixel dependencies of cracks. Furthermore, these methods often possess numerous parameters and substantial computational requirements, complicating deployment on edge devices. In this paper, we propose a staircase cascaded fusion crack segmentation network (CrackSCF) that generates high-quality crack segmentation maps using minimal computational resources. We constructed a staircase cascaded fusion module that effectively captures local patterns of cracks and long-range dependencies of pixels, and it can suppress background noise well. To reduce the computational resources required by the model, we introduced a lightweight convolution block, which replaces all convolution operations in the network, significantly reducing the required computation and parameters without affecting the network's performance. To evaluate our method, we created a challenging benchmark dataset called TUT and conducted experiments on this dataset and five other public datasets. The experimental results indicate that our method offers significant advantages over existing methods, especially in handling background noise interference and detailed crack segmentation. The F1 and mIoU scores on the TUT dataset are 0.8382 and 0.8473, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while requiring the least computational resources. The code and dataset is available at https://github.com/Karl1109/CrackSCF.

- **Summary**: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) face significant challenges due to complex underwater lighting conditions. Recently, mamba-based methods have achieved promising results in image enhancement tasks. However, these methods commonly rely on Vmamba, which focuses only on spatial information modeling and struggles to deal with the cross-color channel dependency problem in underwater images caused by the differential attenuation of light wavelengths, limiting the effective use of deep networks. In this paper, we propose a novel UIE framework called O-mamba. O-mamba employs an O-shaped dual-branch network to separately model spatial and cross-channel information, utilizing the efficient global receptive field of state-space models optimized for underwater images. To enhance information interaction between the two branches and effectively utilize multi-scale information, we design a Multi-scale Bi-mutual Promotion Module. This branch includes MS-MoE for fusing multi-scale information within branches, Mutual Promotion module for interaction between spatial and channel information across branches, and Cyclic Multi-scale optimization strategy to maximize the use of multi-scale information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.The code is available at https://github.com/chenydong/O-Mamba.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in computational pathology and artificial intelligence have significantly improved whole slide image (WSI) classification. However, the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of manual annotations present substantial challenges. Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a promising weakly supervised learning approach for WSI classification. Recently research revealed employing pseudo bag augmentation can encourage models to learn various data, thus bolstering models' performance. While directly inheriting the parents' labels can introduce more noise by mislabeling in training. To address this issue, we translate the WSI classification task from weakly supervised learning to semi-weakly supervised learning, termed SWS-MIL, where adaptive pseudo bag augmentation (AdaPse) is employed to assign labeled and unlabeled data based on a threshold strategy. Using the "student-teacher" pattern, we introduce a feature augmentation technique, MergeUp, which merges bags with low-priority bags to enhance inter-category information, increasing training data diversity. Experimental results on the CAMELYON-16, BRACS, and TCGA-LUNG datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art approaches, affirming its efficacy in WSI classification.

- **Summary**: Acoustic sonar imaging systems are widely used for underwater surveillance in both civilian and military sectors. However, acquiring high-quality sonar datasets for training Artificial Intelligence (AI) models confronts challenges such as limited data availability, financial constraints, and data confidentiality. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel benchmark dataset of Simulated Side-Scan Sonar images, which we term as 'S3Simulator dataset'. Our dataset creation utilizes advanced simulation techniques to accurately replicate underwater conditions and produce diverse synthetic sonar imaging. In particular, the cutting-edge AI segmentation tool i.e. Segment Anything Model (SAM) is leveraged for optimally isolating and segmenting the object images, such as ships and planes, from real scenes. Further, advanced Computer-Aided Design tools i.e. SelfCAD and simulation software such as Gazebo are employed to create the 3D model and to optimally visualize within realistic environments, respectively. Further, a range of computational imaging techniques are employed to improve the quality of the data, enabling the AI models for the analysis of the sonar images. Extensive analyses are carried out on S3simulator as well as real sonar datasets to validate the performance of AI models for underwater object classification. Our experimental results highlight that the S3Simulator dataset will be a promising benchmark dataset for research on underwater image analysis. https://github.com/bashakamal/S3Simulator.

- **Summary**: Deep learning techniques have revolutionized image classification by mimicking human cognition and automating complex decision-making processes. However, the deployment of AI systems in the wild, especially in high-security domains such as defence, is curbed by the lack of explainability of the model. To this end, eXplainable AI (XAI) is an emerging area of research that is intended to explore the unexplained hidden black box nature of deep neural networks. This paper explores the application of the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tool to interpret the underwater image classification results, one of the first works in the domain to the best of our knowledge. Our study delves into the realm of SONAR image classification using a custom dataset derived from diverse sources, including the Seabed Objects KLSG dataset, the camera SONAR dataset, the mine SONAR images dataset, and the SCTD dataset. An extensive analysis of transfer learning techniques for image classification using benchmark Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures such as VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, etc. is carried out. On top of this classification model, a post-hoc XAI technique, viz. Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) are incorporated to provide transparent justifications for the model's decisions by perturbing input data locally to see how predictions change. Furthermore, Submodular Picks LIME (SP-LIME) a version of LIME particular to images, that perturbs the image based on the submodular picks is also extensively studied. To this end, two submodular optimization algorithms i.e. Quickshift and Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) are leveraged towards submodular picks. The extensive analysis of XAI techniques highlights interpretability of the results in a more human-compliant way, thus boosting our confidence and reliability.

- **Summary**: Research on Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) towards the multi-image cross-modal instruction has received increasing attention and made significant progress, particularly in scenarios involving closely resembling images (e.g., change captioning). Existing MLLMs typically follow a two-step process in their pipelines: first, extracting visual tokens independently for each input image, and then aligning these visual tokens from different images with the Large Language Model (LLM) in its textual feature space. However, the independent extraction of visual tokens for each image may result in different semantics being prioritized for different images in the first step, leading to a lack of preservation of linking information among images for subsequent LLM analysis. This issue becomes more serious in scenarios where significant variations exist among the images (e.g., visual storytelling). To address this challenge, we introduce Semantic Alignment for Multi-modal large language models (SAM). By involving the bidirectional semantic guidance between different images in the visual-token extraction process, SAM aims to enhance the preservation of linking information for coherent analysis and align the semantics of different images before feeding them into LLM. As the test bed, we propose a large-scale dataset named MmLINK consisting of 69K samples. Different from most existing datasets for MLLMs fine-tuning, our MmLINK dataset comprises multi-modal instructions with significantly diverse images. Extensive experiments on the group captioning task and the storytelling task prove the effectiveness of our SAM model, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+37% for group captioning and +22% for storytelling on CIDEr score).

- **Summary**: With recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), there has been growing interest in using state of the art (SOTA) AI solutions to provide assistance in grading handwritten answer sheets. While a few commercial products exist, the question of whether AI-assistance can actually reduce grading effort and time has not yet been carefully considered in published literature. This work introduces an AI-assisted grading pipeline. The pipeline first uses text detection to automatically detect question regions present in a question paper PDF. Next, it uses SOTA text detection methods to highlight important keywords present in the handwritten answer regions of scanned answer sheets to assist in the grading process. We then evaluate a prototype implementation of the AI-assisted grading pipeline deployed on an existing e-learning management platform. The evaluation involves a total of 5 different real-life examinations across 4 different courses at a reputed institute; it consists of a total of 42 questions, 17 graders, and 468 submissions. We log and analyze the grading time for each handwritten answer while using AI assistance and without it. Our evaluations have shown that, on average, the graders take 31% less time while grading a single response and 33% less grading time while grading a single answer sheet using AI assistance.

- **Summary**: Dense image prediction tasks demand features with strong category information and precise spatial boundary details at high resolution. To achieve this, modern hierarchical models often utilize feature fusion, directly adding upsampled coarse features from deep layers and high-resolution features from lower levels. In this paper, we observe rapid variations in fused feature values within objects, resulting in intra-category inconsistency due to disturbed high-frequency features. Additionally, blurred boundaries in fused features lack accurate high frequency, leading to boundary displacement. Building upon these observations, we propose Frequency-Aware Feature Fusion (FreqFusion), integrating an Adaptive Low-Pass Filter (ALPF) generator, an offset generator, and an Adaptive High-Pass Filter (AHPF) generator. The ALPF generator predicts spatially-variant low-pass filters to attenuate high-frequency components within objects, reducing intra-class inconsistency during upsampling. The offset generator refines large inconsistent features and thin boundaries by replacing inconsistent features with more consistent ones through resampling, while the AHPF generator enhances high-frequency detailed boundary information lost during downsampling. Comprehensive visualization and quantitative analysis demonstrate that FreqFusion effectively improves feature consistency and sharpens object boundaries. Extensive experiments across various dense prediction tasks confirm its effectiveness. The code is made publicly available at https://github.com/Linwei-Chen/FreqFusion.

- **Summary**: Speech-driven 3D motion synthesis seeks to create lifelike animations based on human speech, with potential uses in virtual reality, gaming, and the film production. Existing approaches reply solely on speech audio for motion generation, leading to inaccurate and inflexible synthesis results. To mitigate this problem, we introduce a novel text-guided 3D human motion synthesis method, termed \textit{T3M}. Unlike traditional approaches, T3M allows precise control over motion synthesis via textual input, enhancing the degree of diversity and user customization. The experiment results demonstrate that T3M can greatly outperform the state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

- **Summary**: The unprecedented developments in segmentation foundational models have become a dominant force in the field of computer vision, introducing a multitude of previously unexplored capabilities in a wide range of natural images and videos. Specifically, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) signifies a noteworthy expansion of the prompt-driven paradigm into the domain of image segmentation. The recent introduction of SAM2 effectively extends the original SAM to a streaming fashion and demonstrates strong performance in video segmentation. However, due to the substantial distinctions between natural and medical images, the effectiveness of these models on biomedical images and videos is still under exploration. This paper presents an overview of recent efforts in applying and adapting SAM2 to biomedical images and videos. The findings indicate that while SAM2 shows promise in reducing annotation burdens and enabling zero-shot segmentation, its performance varies across different datasets and tasks. Addressing the domain gap between natural and medical images through adaptation and fine-tuning is essential to fully unleash SAM2's potential in clinical applications. To support ongoing research endeavors, we maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date SAM & SAM2-related papers and projects at https://github.com/YichiZhang98/SAM4MIS.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves fast and high-quality renderings by using numerous small Gaussians, which leads to significant memory consumption. This reliance on a large number of Gaussians restricts the application of 3DGS-based models on low-cost devices due to memory limitations. However, simply reducing the number of Gaussians to accommodate devices with less memory capacity leads to inferior quality compared to the quality that can be achieved on high-end hardware. To address this lack of scalability, we propose integrating a Flexible Level of Detail (FLoD) to 3DGS, to allow a scene to be rendered at varying levels of detail according to hardware capabilities. While existing 3DGSs with LoD focus on detailed reconstruction, our method provides reconstructions using a small number of Gaussians for reduced memory requirements, and a larger number of Gaussians for greater detail. Experiments demonstrate our various rendering options with tradeoffs between rendering quality and memory usage, thereby allowing real-time rendering across different memory constraints. Furthermore, we show that our method generalizes to different 3DGS frameworks, indicating its potential for integration into future state-of-the-art developments.

- **Summary**: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is an advanced imaging technique characterizing tissue microstructure and white matter structural connectivity of the human brain. The demand for high-quality dMRI data is growing, driven by the need for better resolution and improved tissue contrast. However, acquiring high-quality dMRI data is expensive and time-consuming. In this context, deep generative modeling emerges as a promising solution to enhance image quality while minimizing acquisition costs and scanning time. In this study, we propose a novel generative approach to perform dMRI generation using deep diffusion models. It can generate high dimension (4D) and high resolution data preserving the gradients information and brain structure. We demonstrated our method through an image mapping task aimed at enhancing the quality of dMRI images from 3T to 7T. Our approach demonstrates highly enhanced performance in generating dMRI images when compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. This achievement underscores a substantial progression in enhancing dMRI quality, highlighting the potential of our novel generative approach to revolutionize dMRI imaging standards.

- **Summary**: This work presents ParGo, a novel Partial-Global projector designed to connect the vision and language modalities for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous works that rely on global attention-based projectors, our ParGo bridges the representation gap between the separately pre-trained vision encoders and the LLMs by integrating global and partial views, which alleviates the overemphasis on prominent regions. To facilitate the effective training of ParGo, we collect a large-scale detail-captioned image-text dataset named ParGoCap-1M-PT, consisting of 1 million images paired with high-quality captions. Extensive experiments on several MLLM benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our ParGo, highlighting its superiority in aligning vision and language modalities. Compared to conventional Q-Former projector, our ParGo achieves an improvement of 259.96 in MME benchmark. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that ParGo significantly outperforms other projectors, particularly in tasks that emphasize detail perception ability.

- **Summary**: We propose a method that robustly exploits background and foreground in visual identification of individual animals. Experiments show that their automatic separation, made easy with methods like Segment Anything, together with independent foreground and background-related modeling, improves results. The two predictions are combined in a principled way, thanks to novel Per-Instance Temperature Scaling that helps the classifier to deal with appearance ambiguities in training and to produce calibrated outputs in the inference phase. For identity prediction from the background, we propose novel spatial and temporal models. On two problems, the relative error w.r.t. the baseline was reduced by 22.3% and 8.8%, respectively. For cases where objects appear in new locations, an example of background drift, accuracy doubles.

- **Summary**: We propose a new method - WildFusion - for individual identification of a broad range of animal species. The method fuses deep scores (e.g., MegaDescriptor or DINOv2) and local matching similarity (e.g., LoFTR and LightGlue) to identify individual animals. The global and local information fusion is facilitated by similarity score calibration. In a zero-shot setting, relying on local similarity score only, WildFusion achieved mean accuracy, measured on 17 datasets, of 76.2%. This is better than the state-of-the-art model, MegaDescriptor-L, whose training set included 15 of the 17 datasets. If a dataset-specific calibration is applied, mean accuracy increases by 2.3% percentage points. WildFusion, with both local and global similarity scores, outperforms the state-of-the-art significantly - mean accuracy reached 84.0%, an increase of 8.5 percentage points; the mean relative error drops by 35%. We make the code and pre-trained models publicly available5, enabling immediate use in ecology and conservation.

- **Summary**: Recognizing errors in assembly and maintenance procedures is valuable for industrial applications, since it can increase worker efficiency and prevent unplanned down-time. Although assembly state recognition is gaining attention, none of the current works investigate assembly error localization. Therefore, we propose StateDiffNet, which localizes assembly errors based on detecting the differences between a (correct) intended assembly state and a test image from a similar viewpoint. StateDiffNet is trained on synthetically generated image pairs, providing full control over the type of meaningful change that should be detected. The proposed approach is the first to correctly localize assembly errors taken from real ego-centric video data for both states and error types that are never presented during training. Furthermore, the deployment of change detection to this industrial application provides valuable insights and considerations into the mechanisms of state-of-the-art change detection algorithms. The code and data generation pipeline are publicly available at: https://timschoonbeek.github.io/error_seg.

- **Summary**: Accurately detecting and classifying damage in analogue media such as paintings, photographs, textiles, mosaics, and frescoes is essential for cultural heritage preservation. While machine learning models excel in correcting global degradation if the damage operator is known a priori, we show that they fail to predict where the damage is even after supervised training; thus, reliable damage detection remains a challenge. We introduce DamBench, a dataset for damage detection in diverse analogue media, with over 11,000 annotations covering 15 damage types across various subjects and media. We evaluate CNN, Transformer, and text-guided diffusion segmentation models, revealing their limitations in generalising across media types.

  (work in progress)
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Image segmentation is a long-standing challenge in computer vision, studied continuously over several decades, as evidenced by seminal algorithms such as N-Cut, FCN, and MaskFormer. With the advent of foundation models (FMs), contemporary segmentation methodologies have embarked on a new epoch by either adapting FMs (e.g., CLIP, Stable Diffusion, DINO) for image segmentation or developing dedicated segmentation foundation models (e.g., SAM). These approaches not only deliver superior segmentation performance, but also herald newfound segmentation capabilities previously unseen in deep learning context. However, current research in image segmentation lacks a detailed analysis of distinct characteristics, challenges, and solutions associated with these advancements. This survey seeks to fill this gap by providing a thorough review of cutting-edge research centered around FM-driven image segmentation. We investigate two basic lines of research -- generic image segmentation (i.e., semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation), and promptable image segmentation (i.e., interactive segmentation, referring segmentation, few-shot segmentation) -- by delineating their respective task settings, background concepts, and key challenges. Furthermore, we provide insights into the emergence of segmentation knowledge from FMs like CLIP, Stable Diffusion, and DINO. An exhaustive overview of over 300 segmentation approaches is provided to encapsulate the breadth of current research efforts. Subsequently, we engage in a discussion of open issues and potential avenues for future research. We envisage that this fresh, comprehensive, and systematic survey catalyzes the evolution of advanced image segmentation systems.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation of microscopy cell images by deep learning is a significant technique. We considered that the Transformers, which have recently outperformed CNNs in image recognition, could also be improved and developed for cell image segmentation. Transformers tend to focus more on contextual information than on detailed information. This tendency leads to a lack of detailed information for segmentation. Therefore, to supplement or reinforce the missing detailed information, we hypothesized that feedback processing in the human visual cortex should be effective. Our proposed Feedback Former is a novel architecture for semantic segmentation, in which Transformers is used as an encoder and has a feedback processing mechanism. Feature maps with detailed information are fed back to the lower layers from near the output of the model to compensate for the lack of detailed information which is the weakness of Transformers and improve the segmentation accuracy. By experiments on three cell image datasets, we confirmed that our method surpasses methods without feedback, demonstrating its superior accuracy in cell image segmentation. Our method achieved higher segmentation accuracy while consuming less computational cost than conventional feedback approaches. Moreover, our method offered superior precision without simply increasing the model size of Transformer encoder, demonstrating higher accuracy with lower computational cost.

- **Summary**: Event-based vision sensors produce an asynchronous stream of events which are triggered when the pixel intensity variation exceeds a predefined threshold. Such sensors offer significant advantages, including reduced data redundancy, micro-second temporal resolution, and low power consumption, making them valuable for applications in robotics and computer vision. In this work, we consider the problem of video reconstruction from events, and propose an approach for dynamic feedback control of activation thresholds, in which a controller network analyzes the past emitted events and predicts the optimal distribution of activation thresholds for the following time segment. Additionally, we allow a user-defined target peak-event-rate for which the control network is conditioned and optimized to predict per-column activation thresholds that would eventually produce the best possible video reconstruction. The proposed OnTheFly control scheme is data-driven and trained in an end-to-end fashion using probabilistic relaxation of the discrete event representation. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms both fixed and randomly-varying threshold schemes by 6-12% in terms of LPIPS perceptual image dissimilarity metric, and by 49% in terms of event rate, achieving superior reconstruction quality while enabling a fine-tuned balance between performance accuracy and the event rate. Additionally, we show that sampling strategies provided by our OnTheFly control are interpretable and reflect the characteristics of the scene. Our results, derived from a physically-accurate simulator, underline the promise of the proposed methodology in enhancing the utility of event cameras for image reconstruction and other downstream tasks, paving the way for hardware implementation of dynamic feedback EVS control in silicon.

- **Summary**: Multiple object tracking (MOT) depends heavily on selection of true positive detected bounding boxes. However, this aspect of the problem is mostly overlooked or mitigated by employing two-stage association and utilizing low confidence detections in the second stage. Recently proposed BoostTrack attempts to avoid the drawbacks of multiple stage association approach and use low-confidence detections by applying detection confidence boosting. In this paper, we identify the limitations of the confidence boost used in BoostTrack and propose a method to improve its performance. To construct a richer similarity measure and enable a better selection of true positive detections, we propose to use a combination of shape, Mahalanobis distance and novel soft BIoU similarity. We propose a soft detection confidence boost technique which calculates new confidence scores based on the similarity measure and the previous confidence scores, and we introduce varying similarity threshold to account for lower similarity measure between detections and tracklets which are not regularly updated. The proposed additions are mutually independent and can be used in any MOT algorithm.   Combined with the BoostTrack+ baseline, our method achieves near state of the art results on the MOT17 dataset and new state of the art HOTA and IDF1 scores on the MOT20 dataset.

- **Summary**: Following the advancements in text-guided image generation technology exemplified by Stable Diffusion, video generation is gaining increased attention in the academic community. However, relying solely on text guidance for video generation has serious limitations, as videos contain much richer content than images, especially in terms of motion. This information can hardly be adequately described with plain text. Fortunately, in computer vision, various visual representations can serve as additional control signals to guide generation. With the help of these signals, video generation can be controlled in finer detail, allowing for greater flexibility for different applications. Integrating various controls, however, is nontrivial. In this paper, we propose a universal framework called EasyControl. By propagating and injecting condition features through condition adapters, our method enables users to control video generation with a single condition map. With our framework, various conditions including raw pixels, depth, HED, etc., can be integrated into different Unet-based pre-trained video diffusion models at a low practical cost. We conduct comprehensive experiments on public datasets, and both quantitative and qualitative results indicate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. EasyControl significantly improves various evaluation metrics across multiple validation datasets compared to previous works. Specifically, for the sketch-to-video generation task, EasyControl achieves an improvement of 152.0 on FVD and 19.9 on IS, respectively, in UCF101 compared with VideoComposer. For fidelity, our model demonstrates powerful image retention ability, resulting in high FVD and IS in UCF101 and MSR-VTT compared to other image-to-video models.

- **Summary**: 3D Object Affordance Grounding aims to predict the functional regions on a 3D object and has laid the foundation for a wide range of applications in robotics. Recent advances tackle this problem via learning a mapping between 3D regions and a single human-object interaction image. However, the geometric structure of the 3D object and the object in the human-object interaction image are not always consistent, leading to poor generalization. To address this issue, we propose to learn generalizable invariant affordance knowledge from multiple human-object interaction images within the same affordance category. Specifically, we introduce the \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}mage Guided Invariant-\textbf{F}eature-Aware 3D \textbf{A}ffordance \textbf{G}rounding (\textbf{MIFAG}) framework. It grounds 3D object affordance regions by identifying common interaction patterns across multiple human-object interaction images. First, the Invariant Affordance Knowledge Extraction Module (\textbf{IAM}) utilizes an iterative updating strategy to gradually extract aligned affordance knowledge from multiple images and integrate it into an affordance dictionary. Then, the Affordance Dictionary Adaptive Fusion Module (\textbf{ADM}) learns comprehensive point cloud representations that consider all affordance candidates in multiple images. Besides, the Multi-Image and Point Affordance (\textbf{MIPA}) benchmark is constructed and our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various experimental comparisons.

- **Summary**: The classification of indoor scenes is a critical component in various applications, such as intelligent robotics for assistive living. While deep learning has significantly advanced this field, models often suffer from reduced performance due to image corruption. This paper presents an innovative approach to indoor scene recognition that leverages multimodal data fusion, integrating caption-based semantic features with visual data to enhance both accuracy and robustness against corruption. We examine two multimodal networks that synergize visual features from CNN models with semantic captions via a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Our study shows that this fusion markedly improves model performance, with notable gains in Top-1 accuracy when evaluated against a corrupted subset of the Places365 dataset. Moreover, while standalone visual models displayed high accuracy on uncorrupted images, their performance deteriorated significantly with increased corruption severity. Conversely, the multimodal models demonstrated improved accuracy in clean conditions and substantial robustness to a range of image corruptions. These results highlight the efficacy of incorporating high-level contextual information through captions, suggesting a promising direction for enhancing the resilience of classification systems.

- **Summary**: Existing vehicle detectors are usually obtained by training a typical detector (e.g., YOLO, RCNN, DETR series) on vehicle images based on a pre-trained backbone (e.g., ResNet, ViT). Some researchers also exploit and enhance the detection performance using pre-trained large foundation models. However, we think these detectors may only get sub-optimal results because the large models they use are not specifically designed for vehicles. In addition, their results heavily rely on visual features, and seldom of they consider the alignment between the vehicle's semantic information and visual representations. In this work, we propose a new vehicle detection paradigm based on a pre-trained foundation vehicle model (VehicleMAE) and a large language model (T5), termed VFM-Det. It follows the region proposal-based detection framework and the features of each proposal can be enhanced using VehicleMAE. More importantly, we propose a new VAtt2Vec module that predicts the vehicle semantic attributes of these proposals and transforms them into feature vectors to enhance the vision features via contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on three vehicle detection benchmark datasets thoroughly proved the effectiveness of our vehicle detector. Specifically, our model improves the baseline approach by $+5.1\%$, $+6.2\%$ on the $AP_{0.5}$, $AP_{0.75}$ metrics, respectively, on the Cityscapes dataset.The source code of this work will be released at https://github.com/Event-AHU/VFM-Det.

- **Summary**: Recently, the dynamic scene reconstruction using Gaussians has garnered increased interest. Mainstream approaches typically employ a global deformation field to warp a 3D scene in the canonical space. However, the inherently low-frequency nature of implicit neural fields often leads to ineffective representations of complex motions. Moreover, their structural rigidity can hinder adaptation to scenes with varying resolutions and durations. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel approach utilizing discrete 3D control points. This method models local rays physically and establishes a motion-decoupling coordinate system, which effectively merges traditional graphics with learnable pipelines for a robust and efficient local 6-degrees-of-freedom (6-DoF) motion representation. Additionally, we have developed a generalized framework that incorporates our control points with Gaussians. Starting from an initial 3D reconstruction, our workflow decomposes the streaming 4D real-world reconstruction into four independent submodules: 3D segmentation, 3D control points generation, object-wise motion manipulation, and residual compensation. Our experiments demonstrate that this method outperforms existing state-of-the-art 4D Gaussian Splatting techniques on both the Neu3DV and CMU-Panoptic datasets. Our approach also significantly accelerates training, with the optimization of our 3D control points achievable within just 2 seconds per frame on a single NVIDIA 4070 GPU.

- **Summary**: Privacy data protection in the medical field poses challenges to data sharing, limiting the ability to integrate data across hospitals for training high-precision auxiliary diagnostic models. Traditional centralized training methods are difficult to apply due to violations of privacy protection principles. Federated learning, as a distributed machine learning framework, helps address this issue, but it requires multiple hospitals to participate in training simultaneously, which is hard to achieve in practice. To address these challenges, we propose a medical privacy data training framework based on data vectors. This framework allows each hospital to fine-tune pre-trained models on private data, calculate data vectors (representing the optimization direction of model parameters in the solution space), and sum them up to generate synthetic weights that integrate model information from multiple hospitals. This approach enhances model performance without exchanging private data or requiring synchronous training. Experimental results demonstrate that this method effectively utilizes dispersed private data resources while protecting patient privacy. The auxiliary diagnostic model trained using this approach significantly outperforms models trained independently by a single hospital, providing a new perspective for resolving the conflict between medical data privacy protection and model training and advancing the development of medical intelligence.

- **Summary**: Animating human face images aims to synthesize a desired source identity in a natural-looking way mimicking a driving video's facial movements. In this context, Generative Adversarial Networks have demonstrated remarkable potential in real-time face reenactment using a single source image, yet are constrained by limited geometry consistency compared to graphic-based approaches. In this paper, we introduce Geometry-guided GAN for Face Animation (G3FA) to tackle this limitation. Our novel approach empowers the face animation model to incorporate 3D information using only 2D images, improving the image generation capabilities of the talking head synthesis model. We integrate inverse rendering techniques to extract 3D facial geometry properties, improving the feedback loop to the generator through a weighted average ensemble of discriminators. In our face reenactment model, we leverage 2D motion warping to capture motion dynamics along with orthogonal ray sampling and volume rendering techniques to produce the ultimate visual output. To evaluate the performance of our G3FA, we conducted comprehensive experiments using various evaluation protocols on VoxCeleb2 and TalkingHead benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework compared to the state-of-the-art real-time face animation methods.

- **Summary**: Using the latent diffusion model has proven effective in developing novel 3D generation techniques. To harness the latent diffusion model, a key challenge is designing a high-fidelity and efficient representation that links the latent space and the 3D space. In this paper, we introduce Atlas Gaussians, a novel representation for feed-forward native 3D generation. Atlas Gaussians represent a shape as the union of local patches, and each patch can decode 3D Gaussians. We parameterize a patch as a sequence of feature vectors and design a learnable function to decode 3D Gaussians from the feature vectors. In this process, we incorporate UV-based sampling, enabling the generation of a sufficiently large, and theoretically infinite, number of 3D Gaussian points. The large amount of 3D Gaussians enables high-quality details of generation results. Moreover, due to local awareness of the representation, the transformer-based decoding procedure operates on a patch level, ensuring efficiency. We train a variational autoencoder to learn the Atlas Gaussians representation, and then apply a latent diffusion model on its latent space for learning 3D Generation. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the prior arts of feed-forward native 3D generation.

- **Summary**: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial in diagnosing various abdominal conditions and anomalies. Traditional MRI scans often yield anisotropic data due to technical constraints, resulting in varying resolutions across spatial dimensions, which limits diagnostic accuracy and volumetric analysis. Super-resolution (SR) techniques aim to address these limitations by reconstructing isotropic high-resolution images from anisotropic data. However, current SR methods often rely on indirect mappings and limited training data, focusing mainly on two-dimensional improvements rather than achieving true three-dimensional isotropy. We introduce SIMPLE, a Simultaneous Multi-Plane Self-Supervised Learning approach for isotropic MRI restoration from anisotropic data. Our method leverages existing anisotropic clinical data acquired in different planes, bypassing the need for simulated downsampling processes. By considering the inherent three-dimensional nature of MRI data, SIMPLE ensures realistic isotropic data generation rather than solely improving through-plane slices. This approach flexibility allows it to be extended to multiple contrast types and acquisition methods commonly used in clinical settings. Our experiments show that SIMPLE outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively using the Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and semi-quantitatively through radiologist evaluations. The generated isotropic volume facilitates more accurate volumetric analysis and 3D reconstructions, promising significant improvements in clinical diagnostic capabilities.

- **Summary**: Map-free relocalization technology is crucial for applications in autonomous navigation and augmented reality, but relying on pre-built maps is often impractical. It faces significant challenges due to limitations in matching methods and the inherent lack of scale in monocular images. These issues lead to substantial rotational and metric errors and even localization failures in real-world scenarios. Large matching errors significantly impact the overall relocalization process, affecting both rotational and translational accuracy. Due to the inherent limitations of the camera itself, recovering the metric scale from a single image is crucial, as this significantly impacts the translation error. To address these challenges, we propose a map-free relocalization method enhanced by instance knowledge and depth knowledge. By leveraging instance-based matching information to improve global matching results, our method significantly reduces the possibility of mismatching across different objects. The robustness of instance knowledge across the scene helps the feature point matching model focus on relevant regions and enhance matching accuracy. Additionally, we use estimated metric depth from a single image to reduce metric errors and improve scale recovery accuracy. By integrating methods dedicated to mitigating large translational and rotational errors, our approach demonstrates superior performance in map-free relocalization techniques.

- **Summary**: Adversarial training is one of the most effective methods for enhancing model robustness. Recent approaches incorporate adversarial distillation in adversarial training architectures. However, we notice two scenarios of defense methods that limit their performance: (1) Previous methods primarily use static ground truth for adversarial training, but this often causes robust overfitting; (2) The loss functions are either Mean Squared Error or KL-divergence leading to a sub-optimal performance on clean accuracy. To solve those problems, we propose a dynamic label adversarial training (DYNAT) algorithm that enables the target model to gradually and dynamically gain robustness from the guide model's decisions. Additionally, we found that a budgeted dimension of inner optimization for the target model may contribute to the trade-off between clean accuracy and robust accuracy. Therefore, we propose a novel inner optimization method to be incorporated into the adversarial training. This will enable the target model to adaptively search for adversarial examples based on dynamic labels from the guiding model, contributing to the robustness of the target model. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our approach.

- **Summary**: Designing a freeform surface to reflect or refract light to achieve a target distribution is a challenging inverse problem. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end optimization strategy for an optical surface mesh. Our formulation leverages a novel differentiable rendering model, and is directly driven by the difference between the resulting light distribution and the target distribution. We also enforce geometric constraints related to fabrication requirements, to facilitate CNC milling and polishing of the designed surface. To address the issue of local minima, we formulate a face-based optimal transport problem between the current mesh and the target distribution, which makes effective large changes to the surface shape. The combination of our optimal transport update and rendering-guided optimization produces an optical surface design with a resulting image closely resembling the target, while the fabrication constraints in our optimization help to ensure consistency between the rendering model and the final physical results. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated on a variety of target images using both simulated rendering and physical prototypes.

- **Summary**: Incomplete multi-view data classification poses significant challenges due to the common issue of missing views in real-world scenarios. Despite advancements, existing methods often fail to provide reliable predictions, largely due to the uncertainty of missing views and the inconsistent quality of imputed data. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel framework called Evidential Deep Partial Multi-View Classification (EDP-MVC). Initially, we use K-means imputation to address missing views, creating a complete set of multi-view data. However, the potential conflicts and uncertainties within this imputed data can affect the reliability of downstream inferences. To manage this, we introduce a Conflict-Aware Evidential Fusion Network (CAEFN), which dynamically adjusts based on the reliability of the evidence, ensuring trustworthy discount fusion and producing reliable inference outcomes. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets reveal EDP-MVC not only matches but often surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Real-time visual feedback from catheterization analysis is crucial for enhancing surgical safety and efficiency during endovascular interventions. However, existing datasets are often limited to specific tasks, small scale, and lack the comprehensive annotations necessary for broader endovascular intervention understanding. To tackle these limitations, we introduce CathAction, a large-scale dataset for catheterization understanding. Our CathAction dataset encompasses approximately 500,000 annotated frames for catheterization action understanding and collision detection, and 25,000 ground truth masks for catheter and guidewire segmentation. For each task, we benchmark recent related works in the field. We further discuss the challenges of endovascular intentions compared to traditional computer vision tasks and point out open research questions. We hope that CathAction will facilitate the development of endovascular intervention understanding methods that can be applied to real-world applications. The dataset is available at https://airvlab.github.io/cathdata/.

- **Summary**: This paper presents preliminary work on a novel connection between certified robustness in machine learning and the modeling of 3D objects. We highlight an intriguing link between the Maximal Certified Radius (MCR) of a classifier representing a space's occupancy and the space's Signed Distance Function (SDF). Leveraging this relationship, we propose to use the certification method of randomized smoothing (RS) to compute SDFs. Since RS' high computational cost prevents its practical usage as a way to compute SDFs, we propose an algorithm to efficiently run RS in low-dimensional applications, such as 3D space, by expressing RS' fundamental operations as Gaussian smoothing on pre-computed voxel grids. Our approach offers an innovative and practical tool to compute SDFs, validated through proof-of-concept experiments in novel view synthesis. This paper bridges two previously disparate areas of machine learning, opening new avenues for further exploration and potential cross-domain advancements.

- **Summary**: We address the problem of verifying neural networks against geometric transformations of the input image, including rotation, scaling, shearing, and translation. The proposed method computes provably sound piecewise linear constraints for the pixel values by using sampling and linear approximations in combination with branch-and-bound Lipschitz optimisation. A feature of the method is that it obtains tighter over-approximations of the perturbation region than the present state-of-the-art. We report results from experiments on a comprehensive set of benchmarks. We show that our proposed implementation resolves more verification cases than present approaches while being more computationally efficient.

- **Summary**: Category-level object pose and shape estimation from a single depth image has recently drawn research attention due to its wide applications in robotics and self-driving. The task is particularly challenging because the three unknowns, object pose, object shape, and model-to-measurement correspondences, are compounded together but only a single view of depth measurements is provided. The vast majority of the prior work heavily relies on data-driven approaches to obtain solutions to at least one of the unknowns and typically two, running with the risk of failing to generalize to unseen domains. The shape representations used in the prior work also mainly focus on point cloud and signed distance field (SDF). In stark contrast to the prior work, we approach the problem using an iterative estimation method that does not require learning from any pose-annotated data. In addition, we adopt a novel mesh-based object active shape model that has not been explored by the previous literature. Our algorithm, named ShapeICP, has its foundation in the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm but is equipped with additional features for the category-level pose and shape estimation task. The results show that even without using any pose-annotated data, ShapeICP surpasses many data-driven approaches that rely on the pose data for training, opening up new solution space for researchers to consider.

- **Summary**: Generating dense multiview images from text prompts is crucial for creating high-fidelity 3D assets. Nevertheless, existing methods struggle with space-view correspondences, resulting in sparse and low-quality outputs. In this paper, we introduce CoSER, a novel consistent dense Multiview Text-to-Image Generator for Text-to-3D, achieving both efficiency and quality by meticulously learning neighbor-view coherence and further alleviating ambiguity through the swift traversal of all views. For achieving neighbor-view consistency, each viewpoint densely interacts with adjacent viewpoints to perceive the global spatial structure, and aggregates information along motion paths explicitly defined by physical principles to refine details. To further enhance cross-view consistency and alleviate content drift, CoSER rapidly scan all views in spiral bidirectional manner to aware holistic information and then scores each point based on semantic material. Subsequently, we conduct weighted down-sampling along the spatial dimension based on scores, thereby facilitating prominent information fusion across all views with lightweight computation. Technically, the core module is built by integrating the attention mechanism with a selective state space model, exploiting the robust learning capabilities of the former and the low overhead of the latter. Extensive evaluation shows that CoSER is capable of producing dense, high-fidelity, content-consistent multiview images that can be flexibly integrated into various 3D generation models.

- **Summary**: Temporal action detection (TAD) is challenging, yet fundamental for real-world video applications. Recently, DETR-based models for TAD have been prevailing thanks to their unique benefits. However, transformers demand a huge dataset, and unfortunately data scarcity in TAD causes a severe degeneration. In this paper, we identify two crucial problems from data scarcity: attention collapse and imbalanced performance. To this end, we propose a new pre-training strategy, Long-Term Pre-training (LTP), tailored for transformers. LTP has two main components: 1) class-wise synthesis, 2) long-term pretext tasks. Firstly, we synthesize long-form video features by merging video snippets of a target class and non-target classes. They are analogous to untrimmed data used in TAD, despite being created from trimmed data. In addition, we devise two types of long-term pretext tasks to learn long-term dependency. They impose long-term conditions such as finding second-to-fourth or short-duration actions. Our extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performances in DETR-based methods on ActivityNet-v1.3 and THUMOS14 by a large margin. Moreover, we demonstrate that LTP significantly relieves the data scarcity issues in TAD.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models have achieved promising results in breast cancer classification, yet their 'black-box' nature raises interpretability concerns. This research addresses the crucial need to gain insights into the decision-making process of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for mammogram classification, specifically focusing on the underlying reasons for the CNN's predictions of breast cancer. For CNNs trained on the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) dataset, we compared the post-hoc interpretability techniques LIME, Grad-CAM, and Kernel SHAP in terms of explanatory depth and computational efficiency. The results of this analysis indicate that Grad-CAM, in particular, provides comprehensive insights into the behavior of the CNN, revealing distinctive patterns in normal, benign, and malignant breast tissue. We discuss the implications of the current findings for the use of machine learning models and interpretation techniques in clinical practice.

- **Summary**: Crop field detection is a critical component of precision agriculture, essential for optimizing resource allocation and enhancing agricultural productivity. This study introduces KonvLiNA, a novel framework that integrates Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (cKAN) with Nystr\"om attention mechanisms for effective crop field detection. Leveraging KAN adaptive activation functions and the efficiency of Nystr\"om attention in handling largescale data, KonvLiNA significantly enhances feature extraction, enabling the model to capture intricate patterns in complex agricultural environments. Experimental results on rice crop dataset demonstrate KonvLiNA superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 0.415 AP and 0.459 AR with the Swin-L backbone, outperforming traditional YOLOv8 by significant margins. Additionally, evaluation on the COCO dataset showcases competitive performance across small, medium, and large objects, highlighting KonvLiNA efficacy in diverse agricultural settings. This work highlights the potential of hybrid KAN and attention mechanisms for advancing precision agriculture through improved crop field detection and management.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a curated list of 90 objects essential for the navigation of blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals, encompassing road, sidewalk, and indoor environments. We develop the initial list by analyzing 21 publicly available videos featuring BLV individuals navigating various settings. Then, we refine the list through feedback from a focus group study involving blind, low-vision, and sighted companions of BLV individuals. A subsequent analysis reveals that most contemporary datasets used to train recent computer vision models contain only a small subset of the objects in our proposed list. Furthermore, we provide detailed object labeling for these 90 objects across 31 video segments derived from the original 21 videos. Finally, we make the object list, the 21 videos, and object labeling in the 31 video segments publicly available. This paper aims to fill the existing gap and foster the development of more inclusive and effective navigation aids for the BLV community.

- **Summary**: Many people die from lung-related diseases every year. X-ray is an effective way to test if one is diagnosed with a lung-related disease or not. This study concentrates on categorizing three distinct types of lung X-rays: those depicting healthy lungs, those showing lung opacities, and those indicative of viral pneumonia. Accurately diagnosing the disease at an early phase is critical. In this paper, five different pre-trained models will be tested on the Lung X-ray Image Dataset. SqueezeNet, VGG11, ResNet18, DenseNet, and MobileNetV2 achieved accuracies of 0.64, 0.85, 0.87, 0.88, and 0.885, respectively. MobileNetV2, as the best-performing pre-trained model, will then be further analyzed as the base model. Eventually, our own model, MobileNet-Lung based on MobileNetV2, with fine-tuning and an additional layer of attention within feature layers, was invented to tackle the lung disease classification task and achieved an accuracy of 0.933. This result is significantly improved compared with all five pre-trained models.

- **Summary**: Videos showcasing specific products are increasingly important for E-commerce. Key moments naturally exist as the first appearance of a specific product, presentation of its distinctive features, the presence of a buying link, etc. Adding proper sound effects (SFX) to these key moments, or video decoration with SFX (VDSFX), is crucial for enhancing the user engaging experience. Previous studies about adding SFX to videos perform video to SFX matching at a holistic level, lacking the ability of adding SFX to a specific moment. Meanwhile, previous studies on video highlight detection or video moment retrieval consider only moment localization, leaving moment to SFX matching untouched. By contrast, we propose in this paper D&M, a unified method that accomplishes key moment detection and moment to SFX matching simultaneously. Moreover, for the new VDSFX task we build a large-scale dataset SFX-Moment from an E-commerce platform. For a fair comparison, we build competitive baselines by extending a number of current video moment detection methods to the new task. Extensive experiments on SFX-Moment show the superior performance of the proposed method over the baselines. Code and data will be released.

- **Summary**: Customized video generation aims to generate high-quality videos guided by text prompts and subject's reference images. However, since it is only trained on static images, the fine-tuning process of subject learning disrupts abilities of video diffusion models (VDMs) to combine concepts and generate motions. To restore these abilities, some methods use additional video similar to the prompt to fine-tune or guide the model. This requires frequent changes of guiding videos and even re-tuning of the model when generating different motions, which is very inconvenient for users. In this paper, we propose CustomCrafter, a novel framework that preserves the model's motion generation and conceptual combination abilities without additional video and fine-tuning to recovery. For preserving conceptual combination ability, we design a plug-and-play module to update few parameters in VDMs, enhancing the model's ability to capture the appearance details and the ability of concept combinations for new subjects. For motion generation, we observed that VDMs tend to restore the motion of video in the early stage of denoising, while focusing on the recovery of subject details in the later stage. Therefore, we propose Dynamic Weighted Video Sampling Strategy. Using the pluggability of our subject learning modules, we reduce the impact of this module on motion generation in the early stage of denoising, preserving the ability to generate motion of VDMs. In the later stage of denoising, we restore this module to repair the appearance details of the specified subject, thereby ensuring the fidelity of the subject's appearance. Experimental results show that our method has a significant improvement compared to previous methods.

- **Summary**: Multi-camera tracking plays a pivotal role in various real-world applications. While end-to-end methods have gained significant interest in single-camera tracking, multi-camera tracking remains predominantly reliant on heuristic techniques. In response to this gap, this paper introduces Multi-Camera Tracking tRansformer (MCTR), a novel end-to-end approach tailored for multi-object detection and tracking across multiple cameras with overlapping fields of view. MCTR leverages end-to-end detectors like DEtector TRansformer (DETR) to produce detections and detection embeddings independently for each camera view. The framework maintains set of track embeddings that encaplusate global information about the tracked objects, and updates them at every frame by integrating the local information from the view-specific detection embeddings. The track embeddings are probabilistically associated with detections in every camera view and frame to generate consistent object tracks. The soft probabilistic association facilitates the design of differentiable losses that enable end-to-end training of the entire system. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on MMPTrack and AI City Challenge, two recently introduced large-scale multi-camera multi-object tracking datasets.

- **Summary**: Semiconductor imaging and analysis are critical yet understudied in deep learning, limiting our ability for precise control and optimization in semiconductor manufacturing. We introduce a small-scale multimodal framework for analyzing semiconductor electron microscopy images (MAEMI) through vision-language instruction tuning. We generate a customized instruction-following dataset using large multimodal models on microscopic image analysis. We perform knowledge transfer from larger to smaller models through knowledge distillation, resulting in improved accuracy of smaller models on visual question answering (VQA) tasks. This approach eliminates the need for expensive, human expert-annotated datasets for microscopic image analysis tasks. Enterprises can further finetune MAEMI on their intellectual data, enhancing privacy and performance on low-cost consumer hardware. Our experiments show that MAEMI outperforms traditional methods, adapts to data distribution shifts, and supports high-throughput screening.

- **Summary**: Face anti-spoofing algorithms play a pivotal role in the robust deployment of face recognition systems against presentation attacks. Conventionally, full facial images are required by such systems to correctly authenticate individuals, but the widespread requirement of masks due to the current COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new challenges for these biometric authentication systems. Hence, in this work, we investigate the performance of presentation attack detection (PAD) algorithms under synthetic facial occlusions using masks and glasses. We have used five variants of masks to cover the lower part of the face with varying coverage areas (low-coverage, medium-coverage, high-coverage, round coverage), and 3D cues. We have also used different variants of glasses that cover the upper part of the face. We systematically tested the performance of four PAD algorithms under these occlusion attacks using a benchmark dataset. We have specifically looked at four different baseline PAD algorithms that focus on, texture, image quality, frame difference/motion, and abstract features through a convolutional neural network (CNN). Additionally we have introduced a new hybrid model that uses CNN and local binary pattern textures. Our experiment shows that adding the occlusions significantly degrades the performance of all of the PAD algorithms. Our results show the vulnerability of face anti-spoofing algorithms with occlusions, which could be in the usage of such algorithms in the post-pandemic era.

- **Summary**: 3D immersive scene generation is a challenging yet critical task in computer vision and graphics. A desired virtual 3D scene should 1) exhibit omnidirectional view consistency, and 2) allow for free exploration in complex scene hierarchies. Existing methods either rely on successive scene expansion via inpainting or employ panorama representation to represent large FOV scene environments. However, the generated scene suffers from semantic drift during expansion and is unable to handle occlusion among scene hierarchies. To tackle these challenges, we introduce LayerPano3D, a novel framework for full-view, explorable panoramic 3D scene generation from a single text prompt. Our key insight is to decompose a reference 2D panorama into multiple layers at different depth levels, where each layer reveals the unseen space from the reference views via diffusion prior. LayerPano3D comprises multiple dedicated designs: 1) we introduce a novel text-guided anchor view synthesis pipeline for high-quality, consistent panorama generation. 2) We pioneer the Layered 3D Panorama as underlying representation to manage complex scene hierarchies and lift it into 3D Gaussians to splat detailed 360-degree omnidirectional scenes with unconstrained viewing paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates state-of-the-art 3D panoramic scene in both full view consistency and immersive exploratory experience. We believe that LayerPano3D holds promise for advancing 3D panoramic scene creation with numerous applications.

- **Summary**: Early detection of autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder marked by social communication challenges, is crucial for timely intervention. Recent advancements have utilized naturalistic home videos captured via the mobile application GuessWhat. Through interactive games played between children and their guardians, GuessWhat has amassed over 3,000 structured videos from 382 children, both diagnosed with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This collection provides a robust dataset for training computer vision models to detect ASD-related phenotypic markers, including variations in emotional expression, eye contact, and head movements. We have developed a protocol to curate high-quality videos from this dataset, forming a comprehensive training set. Utilizing this set, we trained individual LSTM-based models using eye gaze, head positions, and facial landmarks as input features, achieving test AUCs of 86%, 67%, and 78%, respectively. To boost diagnostic accuracy, we applied late fusion techniques to create ensemble models, improving the overall AUC to 90%. This approach also yielded more equitable results across different genders and age groups. Our methodology offers a significant step forward in the early detection of ASD by potentially reducing the reliance on subjective assessments and making early identification more accessibly and equitable.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models are capable of generating photo-realistic images that combine elements which likely do not appear together in the training set, demonstrating the ability to compositionally generalize. Nonetheless, the precise mechanism of compositionality and how it is acquired through training remains elusive. Inspired by cognitive neuroscientific approaches, we consider a highly reduced setting to examine whether and when diffusion models learn semantically meaningful and factorized representations of composable features. We performed extensive controlled experiments on conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) trained to generate various forms of 2D Gaussian data. We found that the models learn factorized but not fully continuous manifold representations for encoding continuous features of variation underlying the data. With such representations, models demonstrate superior feature compositionality but limited ability to interpolate over unseen values of a given feature. Our experimental results further demonstrate that diffusion models can attain compositionality with few compositional examples, suggesting a more efficient way to train DDPMs. Finally, we connect manifold formation in diffusion models to percolation theory in physics, offering insight into the sudden onset of factorized representation learning. Our thorough toy experiments thus contribute a deeper understanding of how diffusion models capture compositional structure in data.

- **Summary**: Comprehensive evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has recently garnered widespread attention in the research community. However, we observe that existing benchmarks present several common barriers that make it difficult to measure the significant challenges that models face in the real world, including: 1) small data scale leads to a large performance variance; 2) reliance on model-based annotations results in restricted data quality; 3) insufficient task difficulty, especially caused by the limited image resolution. To tackle these issues, we introduce MME-RealWorld. Specifically, we collect more than $300$K images from public datasets and the Internet, filtering $13,366$ high-quality images for annotation. This involves the efforts of professional $25$ annotators and $7$ experts in MLLMs, contributing to $29,429$ question-answer pairs that cover $43$ subtasks across $5$ real-world scenarios, extremely challenging even for humans. As far as we know, MME-RealWorld is the largest manually annotated benchmark to date, featuring the highest resolution and a targeted focus on real-world applications. We further conduct a thorough evaluation involving $28$ prominent MLLMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Our results show that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where none of them reach $60\%$ accuracy. The challenges of perceiving high-resolution images and understanding complex real-world scenarios remain urgent issues to be addressed.
