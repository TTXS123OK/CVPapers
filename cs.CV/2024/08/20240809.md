- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the challenge of generating novel views of real-world objects with limited multi-view images through our proposed approach, FewShotNeRF. Our method utilizes meta-learning to acquire optimal initialization, facilitating rapid adaptation of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) to specific scenes. The focus of our meta-learning process is on capturing shared geometry and textures within a category, embedded in the weight initialization. This approach expedites the learning process of NeRFs and leverages recent advancements in positional encodings to reduce the time required for fitting a NeRF to a scene, thereby accelerating the inner loop optimization of meta-learning. Notably, our method enables meta-learning on a large number of 3D scenes to establish a robust 3D prior for various categories. Through extensive evaluations on the Common Objects in 3D open source dataset, we empirically demonstrate the efficacy and potential of meta-learning in generating high-quality novel views of objects.

- **Summary**: We introduce Hyper-YOLO, a new object detection method that integrates hypergraph computations to capture the complex high-order correlations among visual features. Traditional YOLO models, while powerful, have limitations in their neck designs that restrict the integration of cross-level features and the exploitation of high-order feature interrelationships. To address these challenges, we propose the Hypergraph Computation Empowered Semantic Collecting and Scattering (HGC-SCS) framework, which transposes visual feature maps into a semantic space and constructs a hypergraph for high-order message propagation. This enables the model to acquire both semantic and structural information, advancing beyond conventional feature-focused learning. Hyper-YOLO incorporates the proposed Mixed Aggregation Network (MANet) in its backbone for enhanced feature extraction and introduces the Hypergraph-Based Cross-Level and Cross-Position Representation Network (HyperC2Net) in its neck. HyperC2Net operates across five scales and breaks free from traditional grid structures, allowing for sophisticated high-order interactions across levels and positions. This synergy of components positions Hyper-YOLO as a state-of-the-art architecture in various scale models, as evidenced by its superior performance on the COCO dataset. Specifically, Hyper-YOLO-N significantly outperforms the advanced YOLOv8-N and YOLOv9-T with 12\% $\text{AP}^{val}$ and 9\% $\text{AP}^{val}$ improvements.

- **Summary**: Background. Fully automatic analysis of myocardial perfusion MRI datasets enables rapid and objective reporting of stress/rest studies in patients with suspected ischemic heart disease. Developing deep learning techniques that can analyze multi-center datasets despite limited training data and variations in software and hardware is an ongoing challenge.   Methods. Datasets from 3 medical centers acquired at 3T (n = 150 subjects) were included: an internal dataset (inD; n = 95) and two external datasets (exDs; n = 55) used for evaluating the robustness of the trained deep neural network (DNN) models against differences in pulse sequence (exD-1) and scanner vendor (exD-2). A subset of inD (n = 85) was used for training/validation of a pool of DNNs for segmentation, all using the same spatiotemporal U-Net architecture and hyperparameters but with different parameter initializations. We employed a space-time sliding-patch analysis approach that automatically yields a pixel-wise "uncertainty map" as a byproduct of the segmentation process. In our approach, a given test case is segmented by all members of the DNN pool and the resulting uncertainty maps are leveraged to automatically select the "best" one among the pool of solutions.   Results. The proposed DAUGS analysis approach performed similarly to the established approach on the internal dataset (p = n.s.) whereas it significantly outperformed on the external datasets (p < 0.005 for exD-1 and exD-2). Moreover, the number of image series with "failed" segmentation was significantly lower for the proposed vs. the established approach (4.3% vs. 17.1%, p < 0.0005).   Conclusions. The proposed DAUGS analysis approach has the potential to improve the robustness of deep learning methods for segmentation of multi-center stress perfusion datasets with variations in the choice of pulse sequence, site location or scanner vendor.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we overview one promising avenue of progress at the mathematical foundation of deep learning: the connection between deep networks and function approximation by affine splines (continuous piecewise linear functions in multiple dimensions). In particular, we will overview work over the past decade on understanding certain geometrical properties of a deep network's affine spline mapping, in particular how it tessellates its input space. As we will see, the affine spline connection and geometrical viewpoint provide a powerful portal through which to view, analyze, and improve the inner workings of a deep network.

- **Summary**: Significant research efforts have been made to scale and improve vision-language model (VLM) training approaches. Yet, with an ever-growing number of benchmarks, researchers are tasked with the heavy burden of implementing each protocol, bearing a non-trivial computational cost, and making sense of how all these benchmarks translate into meaningful axes of progress. To facilitate a systematic evaluation of VLM progress, we introduce UniBench: a unified implementation of 50+ VLM benchmarks spanning a comprehensive range of carefully categorized capabilities from object recognition to spatial awareness, counting, and much more. We showcase the utility of UniBench for measuring progress by evaluating nearly 60 publicly available vision-language models, trained on scales of up to 12.8B samples. We find that while scaling training data or model size can boost many vision-language model capabilities, scaling offers little benefit for reasoning or relations. Surprisingly, we also discover today's best VLMs struggle on simple digit recognition and counting tasks, e.g. MNIST, which much simpler networks can solve. Where scale falls short, we find that more precise interventions, such as data quality or tailored-learning objectives offer more promise. For practitioners, we also offer guidance on selecting a suitable VLM for a given application. Finally, we release an easy-to-run UniBench code-base with the full set of 50+ benchmarks and comparisons across 59 models as well as a distilled, representative set of benchmarks that runs in 5 minutes on a single GPU.

- **Summary**: Multiple instance learning (MIL) problem is currently solved from either bag-classification or instance-classification perspective, both of which ignore important information contained in some instances and result in limited performance. For example, existing methods often face difficulty in learning hard positive instances. In this paper, we formulate MIL as a semi-supervised instance classification problem, so that all the labeled and unlabeled instances can be fully utilized to train a better classifier. The difficulty in this formulation is that all the labeled instances are negative in MIL, and traditional self-training techniques used in semi-supervised learning tend to degenerate in generating pseudo labels for the unlabeled instances in this scenario. To resolve this problem, we propose a weakly-supervised self-training method, in which we utilize the positive bag labels to construct a global constraint and a local constraint on the pseudo labels to prevent them from degenerating and force the classifier to learn hard positive instances. It is worth noting that easy positive instances are instances are far from the decision boundary in the classification process, while hard positive instances are those close to the decision boundary. Through iterative optimization, the pseudo labels can gradually approach the true labels. Extensive experiments on two MNIST synthetic datasets, five traditional MIL benchmark datasets and two histopathology whole slide image datasets show that our method achieved new SOTA performance on all of them. The code will be publicly available.



### One Shot is Enough for Sequential Infrared Small Target Segmentation

- **Summary**: Infrared small target sequences exhibit strong similarities between frames and contain rich contextual information, which motivates us to achieve sequential infrared small target segmentation with minimal data. Inspired by the success of large segmentation models led by Segment Anything Model (SAM) across various downstream tasks, we propose a one-shot and training-free method that perfectly adapts SAM's zero-shot generalization capabilities to sequential infrared small target segmentation. Given one annotated frame as a reference, our method can accurately segment small targets in other frames of the sequence. Specifically, we first obtain a confidence map through local feature matching between reference image and test image. Then, the highest point in the confidence map is as a prompt, and we design the Point Prompt-Centric Focusing (PPCF) module to address the over-segmentation of small targets with blurry boundaries. Subsequently, to prevent miss and false detections, we introduce the Triple-Level Ensemble (TLE) module that ensembles the masks obtained at different levels from the first two steps to produce the final mask. Experiments demonstrate that our method requires only one shot to achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods based on traditional many-shot supervision and even superior performance in a few-shot setting. Moreover, ablation studies confirm the robustness of our approach to variations in one-shot samples, changes in scenes, and the presence of multiple targets.

- **Summary**: Precisely estimating lumen boundaries in intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is needed for sizing interventional stents to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Unfortunately, current segmentation networks like the UNet lack the precision needed for clinical adoption in IVUS workflows. This arises due to the difficulty of automatically learning accurate lumen contour from limited training data while accounting for the radial geometry of IVUS imaging. We propose the Geo-UNet framework to address these issues via a design informed by the geometry of the lumen contour segmentation task. We first convert the input data and segmentation targets from Cartesian to polar coordinates. Starting from a convUNet feature extractor, we propose a two-task setup, one for conventional pixel-wise labeling and the other for single boundary lumen-contour localization. We directly combine the two predictions by passing the predicted lumen contour through a new activation (named CDFeLU) to filter out spurious pixel-wise predictions. Our unified loss function carefully balances area-based, distance-based, and contour-based penalties to provide near clinical-grade generalization in unseen patient data. We also introduce a lightweight, inference-time technique to enhance segmentation smoothness. The efficacy of our framework on a venous IVUS dataset is shown against state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: Sparse-view 3D reconstruction stands as a formidable challenge in computer vision, aiming to build complete three-dimensional models from a limited array of viewing perspectives. This task confronts several difficulties: 1) the limited number of input images that lack consistent information; 2) dependence on the quality of input images; and 3) the substantial size of model parameters. To address these challenges, we propose a self-augmented coarse-to-fine Gaussian splatting paradigm, enhanced with a structure-aware mask, for sparse-view 3D reconstruction. In particular, our method initially employs a coarse Gaussian model to obtain a basic 3D representation from sparse-view inputs. Subsequently, we develop a fine Gaussian network to enhance consistent and detailed representation of the output with both 3D geometry augmentation and perceptual view augmentation. During training, we design a structure-aware masking strategy to further improve the model's robustness against sparse inputs and noise.Experimental results on the MipNeRF360 and OmniObject3D datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances for sparse input views in both perceptual quality and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based industrial anomaly detection models have achieved remarkably high accuracy on commonly used benchmark datasets. However, the robustness of those models may not be satisfactory due to the existence of adversarial examples, which pose significant threats to the practical deployment of deep anomaly detectors. Recently, it has been shown that diffusion models can be used to purify the adversarial noises and thus build a robust classifier against adversarial attacks. Unfortunately, we found that naively applying this strategy in anomaly detection (i.e., placing a purifier before an anomaly detector) will suffer from a high anomaly miss rate since the purifying process can easily remove both the anomaly signal and the adversarial perturbations, causing the later anomaly detector failed to detect anomalies. To tackle this issue, we explore the possibility of performing anomaly detection and adversarial purification simultaneously. We propose a simple yet effective adversarially robust anomaly detection method, \textit{AdvRAD}, that allows the diffusion model to act both as an anomaly detector and adversarial purifier. We also extend our proposed method for certified robustness to $l_2$ norm bounded perturbations. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed method exhibits outstanding (certified) adversarial robustness while also maintaining equally strong anomaly detection performance on par with the state-of-the-art methods on industrial anomaly detection benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in executing instructions for a variety of single-image tasks. Despite this progress, significant challenges remain in modeling long image sequences. In this work, we introduce the versatile multi-modal large language model, mPLUG-Owl3, which enhances the capability for long image-sequence understanding in scenarios that incorporate retrieved image-text knowledge, interleaved image-text, and lengthy videos. Specifically, we propose novel hyper attention blocks to efficiently integrate vision and language into a common language-guided semantic space, thereby facilitating the processing of extended multi-image scenarios. Extensive experimental results suggest that mPLUG-Owl3 achieves state-of-the-art performance among models with a similar size on single-image, multi-image, and video benchmarks. Moreover, we propose a challenging long visual sequence evaluation named Distractor Resistance to assess the ability of models to maintain focus amidst distractions. Finally, with the proposed architecture, mPLUG-Owl3 demonstrates outstanding performance on ultra-long visual sequence inputs. We hope that mPLUG-Owl3 can contribute to the development of more efficient and powerful multimodal large language models.

- **Summary**: Automatic Chart Question Answering (ChartQA) is challenging due to the complex distribution of chart elements with patterns of the underlying data not explicitly displayed in charts. To address this challenge, we design a joint multimodal scene graph for charts to explicitly represent the relationships between chart elements and their patterns. Our proposed multimodal scene graph includes a visual graph and a textual graph to jointly capture the structural and semantical knowledge from the chart. This graph module can be easily integrated with different vision transformers as inductive bias. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating the proposed graph module enhances the understanding of charts' elements' structure and semantics, thereby improving performance on publicly available benchmarks, ChartQA and OpenCQA.

- **Summary**: This study utilizes the advanced capabilities of the GPT-4 multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) to explore its potential in iris recognition - a field less common and more specialized than face recognition. By focusing on this niche yet crucial area, we investigate how well AI tools like ChatGPT can understand and analyze iris images. Through a series of meticulously designed experiments employing a zero-shot learning approach, the capabilities of ChatGPT-4 was assessed across various challenging conditions including diverse datasets, presentation attacks, occlusions such as glasses, and other real-world variations. The findings convey ChatGPT-4's remarkable adaptability and precision, revealing its proficiency in identifying distinctive iris features, while also detecting subtle effects like makeup on iris recognition. A comparative analysis with Gemini Advanced - Google's AI model - highlighted ChatGPT-4's better performance and user experience in complex iris analysis tasks. This research not only validates the use of LLMs for specialized biometric applications but also emphasizes the importance of nuanced query framing and interaction design in extracting significant insights from biometric data. Our findings suggest a promising path for future research and the development of more adaptable, efficient, robust and interactive biometric security solutions.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot image recognition (ZSIR) aims at empowering models to recognize and reason in unseen domains via learning generalized knowledge from limited data in the seen domain. The gist for ZSIR is to execute element-wise representation and reasoning from the input visual space to the target semantic space, which is a bottom-up modeling paradigm inspired by the process by which humans observe the world, i.e., capturing new concepts by learning and combining the basic components or shared characteristics. In recent years, element-wise learning techniques have seen significant progress in ZSIR as well as widespread application. However, to the best of our knowledge, there remains a lack of a systematic overview of this topic. To enrich the literature and provide a sound basis for its future development, this paper presents a broad review of recent advances in element-wise ZSIR. Concretely, we first attempt to integrate the three basic ZSIR tasks of object recognition, compositional recognition, and foundation model-based open-world recognition into a unified element-wise perspective and provide a detailed taxonomy and analysis of the main research approaches. Then, we collect and summarize some key information and benchmarks, such as detailed technical implementations and common datasets. Finally, we sketch out the wide range of its related applications, discuss vital challenges, and suggest potential future directions.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation requires models to effectively integrate visual representations with open-vocabulary semantic labels. While Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models shine in recognizing visual concepts from text, they often struggle with segment coherence due to their limited localization ability. In contrast, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) excel at acquiring spatially consistent local visual representations, yet they fall short in semantic understanding. This paper introduces ProxyCLIP, an innovative framework designed to harmonize the strengths of both CLIP and VFMs, facilitating enhanced open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. ProxyCLIP leverages the spatial feature correspondence from VFMs as a form of proxy attention to augment CLIP, thereby inheriting the VFMs' robust local consistency and maintaining CLIP's exceptional zero-shot transfer capacity. We propose an adaptive normalization and masking strategy to get the proxy attention from VFMs, allowing for adaptation across different VFMs. Remarkably, as a training-free approach, ProxyCLIP significantly improves the average mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) across eight benchmarks from 40.3 to 44.4, showcasing its exceptional efficacy in bridging the gap between spatial precision and semantic richness for the open-vocabulary segmentation task.

- **Summary**: Recently, representation learning with contrastive learning algorithms has been successfully applied to challenging unlabeled datasets. However, these methods are unable to distinguish important features from unimportant ones under simply unsupervised settings, and definitions of importance vary according to the type of downstream task or analysis goal, such as the identification of objects or backgrounds. In this paper, we focus on unsupervised image clustering as the downstream task and propose a representation learning method that enhances features critical to the clustering task. We extend a clustering-friendly contrastive learning method and incorporate a contrastive analysis approach, which utilizes a reference dataset to separate important features from unimportant ones, into the design of loss functions. Conducting an experimental evaluation of image clustering for three datasets with characteristic backgrounds, we show that for all datasets, our method achieves higher clustering scores compared with conventional contrastive analysis and deep clustering methods.

- **Summary**: The task of image captioning has recently been gaining popularity, and with it the complex task of evaluating the quality of image captioning models. In this work, we present the first survey and taxonomy of over 70 different image captioning metrics and their usage in hundreds of papers. We find that despite the diversity of proposed metrics, the vast majority of studies rely on only five popular metrics, which we show to be weakly correlated with human judgements. Instead, we propose EnsembEval -- an ensemble of evaluation methods achieving the highest reported correlation with human judgements across 5 image captioning datasets, showing there is a lot of room for improvement by leveraging a diverse set of metrics.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised multi-organ medical image segmentation aids physicians in improving disease diagnosis and treatment planning and reduces the time and effort required for organ annotation.Existing state-of-the-art methods train the labeled data with ground truths and train the unlabeled data with pseudo-labels. However, the two training flows are separate, which does not reflect the interrelationship between labeled and unlabeled data.To address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised multi-organ segmentation method called GuidedNet, which leverages the knowledge from labeled data to guide the training of unlabeled data. The primary goals of this study are to improve the quality of pseudo-labels for unlabeled data and to enhance the network's learning capability for both small and complex organs.A key concept is that voxel features from labeled and unlabeled data that are close to each other in the feature space are more likely to belong to the same class.On this basis, a 3D Consistent Gaussian Mixture Model (3D-CGMM) is designed to leverage the feature distributions from labeled data to rectify the generated pseudo-labels.Furthermore, we introduce a Knowledge Transfer Cross Pseudo Supervision (KT-CPS) strategy, which leverages the prior knowledge obtained from the labeled data to guide the training of the unlabeled data, thereby improving the segmentation accuracy for both small and complex organs. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, FLARE22 and AMOS, demonstrated that GuidedNet is capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Active learning (AL) aims to enhance model performance by selectively collecting highly informative data, thereby minimizing annotation costs. However, in practical scenarios, unlabeled data may contain out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, leading to wasted annotation costs if data is incorrectly selected. Recent research has explored methods to apply AL to open-set data, but these methods often require or incur unavoidable cost losses to minimize them. To address these challenges, we propose a novel selection strategy, CLIPN for AL (CLIPNAL), which minimizes cost losses without requiring OOD samples. CLIPNAL sequentially evaluates the purity and informativeness of data. First, it utilizes a pre-trained vision-language model to detect and exclude OOD data by leveraging linguistic and visual information of in-distribution (ID) data without additional training. Second, it selects highly informative data from the remaining ID data, and then the selected samples are annotated by human experts. Experimental results on datasets with various open-set conditions demonstrate that CLIPNAL achieves the lowest cost loss and highest performance across all scenarios.

- **Summary**: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have revolutionized search and rescue (SAR) operations, but the lack of specialized human detection datasets for training machine learning models poses a significant challenge.To address this gap, this paper introduces the Combination to Application (C2A) dataset, synthesized by overlaying human poses onto UAV-captured disaster scenes. Through extensive experimentation with state-of-the-art detection models, we demonstrate that models fine-tuned on the C2A dataset exhibit substantial performance improvements compared to those pre-trained on generic aerial datasets. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of combining the C2A dataset with general human datasets to achieve optimal performance and generalization across various scenarios. This points out the crucial need for a tailored dataset to enhance the effectiveness of SAR operations. Our contributions also include developing dataset creation pipeline and integrating diverse human poses and disaster scenes information to assess the severity of disaster scenarios. Our findings advocate for future developments, to ensure that SAR operations benefit from the most realistic and effective AI-assisted interventions possible.

- **Summary**: Due to domain shift, deep learning image classifiers perform poorly when applied to a domain different from the training one. For instance, a classifier trained on chest X-ray (CXR) images from one hospital may not generalize to images from another hospital due to variations in scanner settings or patient characteristics. In this paper, we introduce our CROCODILE framework, showing how tools from causality can foster a model's robustness to domain shift via feature disentanglement, contrastive learning losses, and the injection of prior knowledge. This way, the model relies less on spurious correlations, learns the mechanism bringing from images to prediction better, and outperforms baselines on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We apply our method to multi-label lung disease classification from CXRs, utilizing over 750000 images from four datasets. Our bias-mitigation method improves domain generalization and fairness, broadening the applicability and reliability of deep learning models for a safer medical image analysis.

- **Summary**: Deep Neural Networks are well known for efficiently fitting training data, yet experiencing poor generalization capabilities whenever some kind of bias dominates over the actual task labels, resulting in models learning "shortcuts". In essence, such models are often prone to learn spurious correlations between data and labels. In this work, we tackle the problem of learning from biased data in the very realistic unsupervised scenario, i.e., when the bias is unknown. This is a much harder task as compared to the supervised case, where auxiliary, bias-related annotations, can be exploited in the learning process. This paper proposes a novel 2-stage learning pipeline featuring a data augmentation strategy able to regularize the training. First, biased/unbiased samples are identified by training over-biased models. Second, such subdivision (typically noisy) is exploited within a data augmentation framework, properly combining the original samples while learning mixing parameters, which has a regularization effect. Experiments on synthetic and realistic biased datasets show state-of-the-art classification accuracy, outperforming competing methods, ultimately proving robust performance on both biased and unbiased examples. Notably, being our training method totally agnostic to the level of bias, it also positively affects performance for any, even apparently unbiased, dataset, thus improving the model generalization regardless of the level of bias (or its absence) in the data.

- **Summary**: Visual Spatial Description (VSD) aims to generate texts that describe the spatial relationships between objects within images. Traditional visual spatial relationship classification (VSRC) methods typically output the spatial relationship between two objects in an image, often neglecting world knowledge and lacking general language capabilities. In this paper, we propose a Large Language-and-Vision Assistant for Visual Spatial Description, named LLaVA-VSD, which is designed for the classification, description, and open-ended description of visual spatial relationships. Specifically, the model first constructs a VSD instruction-following dataset using given figure-caption pairs for the three tasks. It then employs LoRA to fine-tune a Large Language and Vision Assistant for VSD, which has 13 billion parameters and supports high-resolution images. Finally, a large language model (Qwen-2) is used to refine the generated sentences, enhancing their diversity and accuracy. LLaVA-VSD demonstrates excellent multimodal conversational capabilities and can follow open-ended instructions to assist with inquiries about object relationships in images.

- **Summary**: Medical visual question answering (VQA) bridges the gap between visual information and clinical decision-making, enabling doctors to extract understanding from clinical images and videos. In particular, surgical VQA can enhance the interpretation of surgical data, aiding in accurate diagnoses, effective education, and clinical interventions. However, the inability of VQA models to visually indicate the regions of interest corresponding to the given questions results in incomplete comprehension of the surgical scene. To tackle this, we propose the surgical visual question localized-answering (VQLA) for precise and context-aware responses to specific queries regarding surgical images. Furthermore, to address the strong demand for safety in surgical scenarios and potential corruptions in image acquisition and transmission, we propose a novel approach called Calibrated Co-Attention Gated Vision-Language (C$^2$G-ViL) embedding to integrate and align multimodal information effectively. Additionally, we leverage the adversarial sample-based contrastive learning strategy to boost our performance and robustness. We also extend our EndoVis-18-VQLA and EndoVis-17-VQLA datasets to broaden the scope and application of our data. Extensive experiments on the aforementioned datasets demonstrate the remarkable performance and robustness of our solution. Our solution can effectively combat real-world image corruption. Thus, our proposed approach can serve as an effective tool for assisting surgical education, patient care, and enhancing surgical outcomes.

- **Summary**: We present lazy visual grounding, a two-stage approach of unsupervised object mask discovery followed by object grounding, for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Plenty of the previous art casts this task as pixel-to-text classification without object-level comprehension, leveraging the image-to-text classification capability of pretrained vision-and-language models. We argue that visual objects are distinguishable without the prior text information as segmentation is essentially a vision task. Lazy visual grounding first discovers object masks covering an image with iterative Normalized cuts and then later assigns text on the discovered objects in a late interaction manner. Our model requires no additional training yet shows great performance on five public datasets: Pascal VOC, Pascal Context, COCO-object, COCO-stuff, and ADE 20K. Especially, the visually appealing segmentation results demonstrate the model capability to localize objects precisely. Paper homepage: https://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/research/lazygrounding

- **Summary**: In recent years, there has been a significant focus on research related to text-guided image inpainting. However, the task remains challenging due to several constraints, such as ensuring alignment between the image and the text, and maintaining consistency in distribution between corrupted and uncorrupted regions. In this paper, thus, we propose a dual affine transformation generative adversarial network (DAFT-GAN) to maintain the semantic consistency for text-guided inpainting. DAFT-GAN integrates two affine transformation networks to combine text and image features gradually for each decoding block. Moreover, we minimize information leakage of uncorrupted features for fine-grained image generation by encoding corrupted and uncorrupted regions of the masked image separately. Our proposed model outperforms the existing GAN-based models in both qualitative and quantitative assessments with three benchmark datasets (MS-COCO, CUB, and Oxford) for text-guided image inpainting.

- **Summary**: In the domain of cloud-based deep learning, the imperative for external computational resources coexists with acute privacy concerns, particularly identity leakage. To address this challenge, we introduce XNN and XNN-d, pioneering methodologies that infuse neural network features with randomized perturbations, striking a harmonious balance between utility and privacy. XNN, designed for the training phase, ingeniously blends random permutation with matrix multiplication techniques to obfuscate feature maps, effectively shielding private data from potential breaches without compromising training integrity. Concurrently, XNN-d, devised for the inference phase, employs adversarial training to integrate generative adversarial noise. This technique effectively counters black-box access attacks aimed at identity extraction, while a distilled face recognition network adeptly processes the perturbed features, ensuring accurate identification. Our evaluation demonstrates XNN's effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing methods in reducing identity leakage while maintaining a high model accuracy.

- **Summary**: The Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which exploits pretrained text-to-image model diffusion models as priors to 3D model training, has achieved significant success. Currently, the flow-based diffusion model has become a new trend for generations. Yet, adapting SDS to flow-based diffusion models in 3D generation remains unexplored. Our work is aimed to bridge this gap. In this paper, we adapt SDS to rectified flow and re-examine the over-smoothing issue under this novel framework. The issue can be explained that the model learns an average of multiple ODE trajectories. Then we propose DreamCouple, which instead of randomly sampling noise, uses a rectified flow model to find the coupled noise. Its Unique Couple Matching (UCM) loss guides the model to learn different trajectories and thus solves the over-smoothing issue. We apply our method to both NeRF and 3D Gaussian splatting and achieve state-of-the-art performances. We also identify some other interesting open questions such as initialization issues for NeRF and faster training convergence. Our code will be released soon.

- **Summary**: As the open community of large language models (LLMs) matures, multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have promised an elegant bridge between vision and language. However, current research is inherently constrained by challenges such as the need for high-quality instruction pairs and the loss of visual information in image-to-text training objectives. To this end, we propose a Visual Token Complement framework (VTC) that helps MLLMs regain the missing visual features and thus improve response accuracy. Specifically, our VTC integrates text-to-image generation as a guide to identifying the text-irrelevant features, and a visual selector is then developed to generate complementary visual tokens to enrich the original visual input. Moreover, an iterative strategy is further designed to extract more visual information by iteratively using the visual selector without any additional training. Notably, the training pipeline requires no additional image-text pairs, resulting in a desired instruction tuning-free property. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of our VTC.

- **Summary**: Automotive radar systems have evolved to provide not only range, azimuth and Doppler velocity, but also elevation data. This additional dimension allows for the representation of 4D radar as a 3D point cloud. As a result, existing deep learning methods for 3D object detection, which were initially developed for LiDAR data, are often applied to these radar point clouds. However, this neglects the special characteristics of 4D radar data, such as the extreme sparsity and the optimal utilization of velocity information. To address these gaps in the state-of-the-art, we present RadarPillars, a pillar-based object detection network.   By decomposing radial velocity data, introducing PillarAttention for efficient feature extraction, and studying layer scaling to accommodate radar sparsity, RadarPillars significantly outperform state-of-the-art detection results on the View-of-Delft dataset. Importantly, this comes at a significantly reduced parameter count, surpassing existing methods in terms of efficiency and enabling real-time performance on edge devices.

- **Summary**: Stripe-like space target detection (SSTD) is crucial for space situational awareness. Traditional unsupervised methods often fail in low signal-to-noise ratio and variable stripe-like space targets scenarios, leading to weak generalization. Although fully supervised learning methods improve model generalization, they require extensive pixel-level labels for training. In the SSTD task, manually creating these labels is often inaccurate and labor-intensive. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods reduce the need for these labels and enhance model generalizability, but their performance is limited by pseudo-label quality. To address this, we introduce an innovative Collaborative Static-Dynamic Teacher (CSDT) SSL framework, which includes static and dynamic teacher models as well as a student model. This framework employs a customized adaptive pseudo-labeling (APL) strategy, transitioning from initial static teaching to adaptive collaborative teaching, guiding the student model's training. The exponential moving average (EMA) mechanism further enhances this process by feeding new stripe-like knowledge back to the dynamic teacher model through the student model, creating a positive feedback loop that continuously enhances the quality of pseudo-labels. Moreover, we present MSSA-Net, a novel SSTD network featuring a multi-scale dual-path convolution (MDPC) block and a feature map weighted attention (FMWA) block, designed to extract diverse stripe-like features within the CSDT SSL training framework. Extensive experiments verify the state-of-the-art performance of our framework on the AstroStripeSet and various ground-based and space-based real-world datasets.

- **Summary**: Counting fish larvae is an important, yet demanding and time consuming, task in aquaculture. In order to address this problem, in this work, we evaluate four neural network architectures, including convolutional neural networks and transformers, in different sizes, in the task of fish larvae counting. For the evaluation, we present a new annotated image dataset with less data collection requirements than preceding works, with images of spotted sorubim and dourado larvae. By using image tiling techniques, we achieve a MAPE of 4.46% ($\pm 4.70$) with an extra large real time detection transformer, and 4.71% ($\pm 4.98$) with a medium-sized YOLOv8.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in video compression have seen significant coding performance improvements with the development of new standards and learning-based video codecs. However, most of these works focus on application scenarios that allow a certain amount of system delay (e.g., Random Access mode in MPEG codecs), which is not always acceptable for live delivery. This paper conducts a comparative study of state-of-the-art conventional and learned video coding methods based on a low delay configuration. Specifically, this study includes two MPEG standard codecs (H.266/VVC VTM and JVET ECM), two AOM codecs (AV1 libaom and AVM), and two recent neural video coding models (DCVC-DC and DCVC-FM). To allow a fair and meaningful comparison, the evaluation was performed on test sequences defined in the AOM and MPEG common test conditions in the YCbCr 4:2:0 color space. The evaluation results show that the JVET ECM codecs offer the best overall coding performance among all codecs tested, with a 16.1% (based on PSNR) average BD-rate saving over AOM AVM, and 11.0% over DCVC-FM. We also observed inconsistent performance with the learned video codecs, DCVC-DC and DCVC-FM, for test content with large background motions.

- **Summary**: Optic disc and cup segmentation helps in the diagnosis of glaucoma, myocardial infarction, and diabetic retinopathy. Most deep learning methods developed to perform segmentation tasks are built on top of a U-Net-based model architecture. Nevertheless, U-Net and its variants have a tendency to over-segment/ under-segment the required regions of interest. Since the most important outcome is the value of cup-to-disc ratio and not the segmented regions themselves, we are more concerned about the boundaries rather than the regions under the boundaries. This makes learning edges important as compared to learning the regions. In the proposed work, the authors aim to extract both edges of the optic disc and cup from the ground truth using a Laplacian filter. Next, edges are reconstructed to obtain an edge ground truth in addition to the optic disc-cup ground truth. Utilizing both ground truths, the authors study several U-Net and its variant architectures with and without optic disc and cup edges as target, along with the optic disc-cup ground truth for segmentation. The authors have used the REFUGE benchmark dataset and the Drishti-GS dataset to perform the study, and the results are tabulated for the dice and the Hausdorff distance metrics. In the case of the REFUGE dataset, the optic disc mean dice score has improved from 0.7425 to 0.8859 while the mean Hausdorff distance has reduced from 6.5810 to 3.0540 for the baseline U-Net model. Similarly, the optic cup mean dice score has improved from 0.6970 to 0.8639 while the mean Hausdorff distance has reduced from 5.2340 to 2.6323 for the same model. Similar improvement has been observed for the Drishti-GS dataset as well. Compared to the baseline U-Net and its variants (i.e) the Attention U-Net and the U-Net++, the models that learn integrated edges along with the optic disc and cup regions performed well in both validation and testing datasets.

- **Summary**: One of the unspoken challenges of tractography is choosing the right parameters for a given dataset or bundle. In order to tackle this challenge, we explore the multi-dimensional parameter space of tractography using streamline-specific parameters (SSP). We 1) validate a state-of-the-art probabilistic tracking method using per-streamline parameters on synthetic data, and 2) show how we can gain insights into the parameter space by focusing on streamline acceptance using real-world data. We demonstrate the potential added value of SSP to the current state of tractography by showing how SSP can be used to reveal patterns in the parameter space.

- **Summary**: Existing top-performance autonomous driving systems typically rely on the multi-modal fusion strategy for reliable scene understanding. This design is however fundamentally restricted due to overlooking the modality-specific strengths and finally hampering the model performance. To address this limitation, in this work, we introduce a novel modality interaction strategy that allows individual per-modality representations to be learned and maintained throughout, enabling their unique characteristics to be exploited during the whole perception pipeline. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, we design DeepInteraction++, a multi-modal interaction framework characterized by a multi-modal representational interaction encoder and a multi-modal predictive interaction decoder. Specifically, the encoder is implemented as a dual-stream Transformer with specialized attention operation for information exchange and integration between separate modality-specific representations. Our multi-modal representational learning incorporates both object-centric, precise sampling-based feature alignment and global dense information spreading, essential for the more challenging planning task. The decoder is designed to iteratively refine the predictions by alternately aggregating information from separate representations in a unified modality-agnostic manner, realizing multi-modal predictive interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework on both 3D object detection and end-to-end autonomous driving tasks.

- **Summary**: Pretrained models have become a commodity and offer strong results on a broad range of tasks. In this work, we focus on classification and seek to learn a unique encoder able to take from several complementary pretrained models. We aim at even stronger generalization across a variety of classification tasks. We propose to learn such an encoder via multi-teacher distillation. We first thoroughly analyse standard distillation when driven by multiple strong teachers with complementary strengths. Guided by this analysis, we gradually propose improvements to the basic distillation setup. Among those, we enrich the architecture of the encoder with a ladder of expendable projectors, which increases the impact of intermediate features during distillation, and we introduce teacher dropping, a regularization mechanism that better balances the teachers' influence. Our final distillation strategy leads to student models of the same capacity as any of the teachers, while retaining or improving upon the performance of the best teacher for each task.

- **Summary**: Vision and Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task that requires agents to understand instructions and navigate to the destination in a visual environment.One of the key challenges in outdoor VLN is keeping track of which part of the instruction was completed. To alleviate this problem, previous works mainly focus on grounding the natural language to the visual input, but neglecting the crucial role of the agent's spatial position information in the grounding process. In this work, we first explore the substantial effect of spatial position locating on the grounding of outdoor VLN, drawing inspiration from human navigation. In real-world navigation scenarios, before planning a path to the destination, humans typically need to figure out their current location. This observation underscores the pivotal role of spatial localization in the navigation process. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, Locating be for Planning (Loc4Plan), designed to incorporate spatial perception for action planning in outdoor VLN tasks. The main idea behind Loc4Plan is to perform the spatial localization before planning a decision action based on corresponding guidance, which comprises a block-aware spatial locating (BAL) module and a spatial-aware action planning (SAP) module. Specifically, to help the agent perceive its spatial location in the environment, we propose to learn a position predictor that measures how far the agent is from the next intersection for reflecting its position, which is achieved by the BAL module. After the locating process, we propose the SAP module to incorporate spatial information to ground the corresponding guidance and enhance the precision of action planning. Extensive experiments on the Touchdown and map2seq datasets show that the proposed Loc4Plan outperforms the SOTA methods.

- **Summary**: The training phase of deep neural networks requires substantial resources and as such is often performed on cloud servers. However, this raises privacy concerns when the training dataset contains sensitive content, e.g., face images. In this work, we propose a method to perform the training phase of a deep learning model on both an edge device and a cloud server that prevents sensitive content being transmitted to the cloud while retaining the desired information. The proposed privacy-preserving method uses adversarial early exits to suppress the sensitive content at the edge and transmits the task-relevant information to the cloud. This approach incorporates noise addition during the training phase to provide a differential privacy guarantee. We extensively test our method on different facial datasets with diverse face attributes using various deep learning architectures, showcasing its outstanding performance. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of privacy preservation through successful defenses against different white-box and deep reconstruction attacks.

- **Summary**: Early detection of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is essential to enable timely intervention and potential treatment. Accurate detection of AD/MCI is challenging due to the high complexity, cost, and often invasive nature of current diagnostic techniques, which limit their suitability for large-scale population screening. Given the shared embryological origins and physiological characteristics of the retina and brain, retinal imaging is emerging as a potentially rapid and cost-effective alternative for the identification of individuals with or at high risk of AD. In this paper, we present a novel PolarNet+ that uses retinal optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) to discriminate early-onset AD (EOAD) and MCI subjects from controls. Our method first maps OCTA images from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates, allowing approximate sub-region calculation to implement the clinician-friendly early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) grid analysis. We then introduce a multi-view module to serialize and analyze the images along three dimensions for comprehensive, clinically useful information extraction. Finally, we abstract the sequence embedding into a graph, transforming the detection task into a general graph classification problem. A regional relationship module is applied after the multi-view module to excavate the relationship between the sub-regions. Such regional relationship analyses validate known eye-brain links and reveal new discriminative patterns.

- **Summary**: Numerous safety- or security-critical systems depend on cameras to perceive their surroundings, further allowing artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze the captured images to make important decisions. However, a concerning attack vector has emerged, namely, electromagnetic waves, which pose a threat to the integrity of these systems. Such attacks enable attackers to manipulate the images remotely, leading to incorrect AI decisions, e.g., autonomous vehicles missing detecting obstacles ahead resulting in collisions. The lack of understanding regarding how different systems react to such attacks poses a significant security risk. Furthermore, no effective solutions have been demonstrated to mitigate this threat.   To address these gaps, we modeled the attacks and developed a simulation method for generating adversarial images. Through rigorous analysis, we confirmed that the effects of the simulated adversarial images are indistinguishable from those from real attacks. This method enables researchers and engineers to rapidly assess the susceptibility of various AI vision applications to these attacks, without the need for constructing complicated attack devices. In our experiments, most of the models demonstrated vulnerabilities to these attacks, emphasizing the need to enhance their robustness. Fortunately, our modeling and simulation method serves as a stepping stone toward developing more resilient models. We present a pilot study on adversarial training to improve their robustness against attacks, and our results demonstrate a significant improvement by recovering up to 91% performance, offering a promising direction for mitigating this threat.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: This paper introduces EasyInv, an easy yet novel approach that significantly advances the field of DDIM Inversion by addressing the inherent inefficiencies and performance limitations of traditional iterative optimization methods. At the core of our EasyInv is a refined strategy for approximating inversion noise, which is pivotal for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the inversion process. By prioritizing the initial latent state, which encapsulates rich information about the original images, EasyInv steers clear of the iterative refinement of noise items. Instead, we introduce a methodical aggregation of the latent state from the preceding time step with the current state, effectively increasing the influence of the initial latent state and mitigating the impact of noise. We illustrate that EasyInv is capable of delivering results that are either on par with or exceed those of the conventional DDIM Inversion approach, especially under conditions where the model's precision is limited or computational resources are scarce. Concurrently, our EasyInv offers an approximate threefold enhancement regarding inference efficiency over off-the-shelf iterative optimization techniques.

- **Summary**: As wearable-based data annotation remains, to date, a tedious, time-consuming task requiring researchers to dedicate substantial time, benchmark datasets within the field of Human Activity Recognition in lack richness and size compared to datasets available within related fields. Recently, vision foundation models such as CLIP have gained significant attention, helping the vision community advance in finding robust, generalizable feature representations. With the majority of researchers within the wearable community relying on vision modalities to overcome the limited expressiveness of wearable data and accurately label their to-be-released benchmark datasets offline, we propose a novel, clustering-based annotation pipeline to significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be annotated by a human annotator. We show that using our approach, the annotation of centroid clips suffices to achieve average labelling accuracies close to 90% across three publicly available HAR benchmark datasets. Using the weakly annotated datasets, we further demonstrate that we can match the accuracy scores of fully-supervised deep learning classifiers across all three benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) automates the identification of unusual events, such as security threats in surveillance videos. In real-world applications, VAD models must effectively operate in cross-domain settings, identifying rare anomalies and scenarios not well-represented in the training data. However, existing cross-domain VAD methods focus on unsupervised learning, resulting in performance that falls short of real-world expectations. Since acquiring weak supervision, i.e., video-level labels, for the source domain is cost-effective, we conjecture that combining it with external unlabeled data has notable potential to enhance cross-domain performance. To this end, we introduce a novel weakly-supervised framework for Cross-Domain Learning (CDL) in VAD that incorporates external data during training by estimating its prediction bias and adaptively minimizing that using the predicted uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDL framework through comprehensive experiments conducted in various configurations on two large-scale VAD datasets: UCF-Crime and XD-Violence. Our method significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art works in cross-domain evaluations, achieving an average absolute improvement of 19.6% on UCF-Crime and 12.87% on XD-Violence.

- **Summary**: Despite the promising progress of face image super-resolution, video face super-resolution remains relatively under-explored. Existing approaches either adapt general video super-resolution networks to face datasets or apply established face image super-resolution models independently on individual video frames. These paradigms encounter challenges either in reconstructing facial details or maintaining temporal consistency. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework called Kalman-inspired Feature Propagation (KEEP), designed to maintain a stable face prior over time. The Kalman filtering principles offer our method a recurrent ability to use the information from previously restored frames to guide and regulate the restoration process of the current frame. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in capturing facial details consistently across video frames. Code and video demo are available at https://jnjaby.github.io/projects/KEEP.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces Multi-Garment Customized Model Generation, a unified framework based on Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) aimed at addressing the unexplored task of synthesizing images with free combinations of multiple pieces of clothing. The method focuses on generating customized models wearing various targeted outfits according to different text prompts. The primary challenge lies in maintaining the natural appearance of the dressed model while preserving the complex textures of each piece of clothing, ensuring that the information from different garments does not interfere with each other. To tackle these challenges, we first developed a garment encoder, which is a trainable UNet copy with shared weights, capable of extracting detailed features of garments in parallel. Secondly, our framework supports the conditional generation of multiple garments through decoupled multi-garment feature fusion, allowing multiple clothing features to be injected into the backbone network, significantly alleviating conflicts between garment information. Additionally, the proposed garment encoder is a plug-and-play module that can be combined with other extension modules such as IP-Adapter and ControlNet, enhancing the diversity and controllability of the generated models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing alternatives, opening up new avenues for the task of generating images with multiple-piece clothing combinations

- **Summary**: The remarkable multimodal capabilities and interactive experience of GPT-4o underscore their necessity in practical applications, yet open-source models rarely excel in both areas. In this paper, we introduce VITA, the first-ever open-source Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adept at simultaneous processing and analysis of Video, Image, Text, and Audio modalities, and meanwhile has an advanced multimodal interactive experience. Starting from Mixtral 8x7B as a language foundation, we expand its Chinese vocabulary followed by bilingual instruction tuning. We further endow the language model with visual and audio capabilities through two-stage multi-task learning of multimodal alignment and instruction tuning. VITA demonstrates robust foundational capabilities of multilingual, vision, and audio understanding, as evidenced by its strong performance across a range of both unimodal and multimodal benchmarks. Beyond foundational capabilities, we have made considerable progress in enhancing the natural multimodal human-computer interaction experience. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to exploit non-awakening interaction and audio interrupt in MLLM. VITA is the first step for the open-source community to explore the seamless integration of multimodal understanding and interaction. While there is still lots of work to be done on VITA to get close to close-source counterparts, we hope that its role as a pioneer can serve as a cornerstone for subsequent research.

- **Summary**: Full-complexity Earth system models (ESMs) are computationally very expensive, limiting their use in exploring the climate outcomes of multiple emission pathways. More efficient emulators that approximate ESMs can directly map emissions onto climate outcomes, and benchmarks are being used to evaluate their accuracy on standardized tasks and datasets. We investigate a popular benchmark in data-driven climate emulation, ClimateBench, on which deep learning-based emulators are currently achieving the best performance. We implement a linear regression-based emulator, akin to pattern scaling, and find that it outperforms the incumbent 100M-parameter deep learning foundation model, ClimaX, on 3 out of 4 regionally-resolved surface-level climate variables. While emulating surface temperature is expected to be predominantly linear, this result is surprising for emulating precipitation. We identify that this outcome is a result of high levels of internal variability in the benchmark targets. To address internal variability, we update the benchmark targets with ensemble averages from the MPI-ESM1.2-LR model that contain 50 instead of 3 climate simulations per emission pathway. Using the new targets, we show that linear pattern scaling continues to be more accurate on temperature, but can be outperformed by a deep learning-based model for emulating precipitation. We publish our code, data, and an interactive tutorial at github.com/blutjens/climate-emulator.

- **Summary**: Object detection is crucial in various cutting-edge applications, such as autonomous vehicles and advanced robotics systems, primarily relying on data from conventional frame-based RGB sensors. However, these sensors often struggle with issues like motion blur and poor performance in challenging lighting conditions. In response to these challenges, event-based cameras have emerged as an innovative paradigm. These cameras, mimicking the human eye, demonstrate superior performance in environments with fast motion and extreme lighting conditions while consuming less power. This study introduces ReYOLOv8, an advanced object detection framework that enhances a leading frame-based detection system with spatiotemporal modeling capabilities. We implemented a low-latency, memory-efficient method for encoding event data to boost the system's performance. We also developed a novel data augmentation technique tailored to leverage the unique attributes of event data, thus improving detection accuracy. Our models outperformed all comparable approaches in the GEN1 dataset, focusing on automotive applications, achieving mean Average Precision (mAP) improvements of 5%, 2.8%, and 2.5% across nano, small, and medium scales, respectively.These enhancements were achieved while reducing the number of trainable parameters by an average of 4.43% and maintaining real-time processing speeds between 9.2ms and 15.5ms. On the PEDRo dataset, which targets robotics applications, our models showed mAP improvements ranging from 9% to 18%, with 14.5x and 3.8x smaller models and an average speed enhancement of 1.67x.

- **Summary**: With the advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), datasets used for visual question answering (VQA) and referring expression comprehension have seen a resurgence. However, the most popular datasets used to evaluate MLLMs are some of the earliest ones created, and they have many known problems, including extreme bias, spurious correlations, and an inability to permit fine-grained analysis. In this paper, we pioneer evaluating recent MLLMs (LLaVA 1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, BLIP2, InstructBLIP, GPT-4V, and GPT-4o) on datasets designed to address weaknesses in earlier ones. We assess three VQA datasets: 1) TDIUC, which permits fine-grained analysis on 12 question types; 2) TallyQA, which has simple and complex counting questions; and 3) DVQA, which requires optical character recognition for chart understanding. We also study VQDv1, a dataset that requires identifying all image regions that satisfy a given query. Our experiments reveal the weaknesses of many MLLMs that have not previously been reported. Our code is integrated into the widely used LAVIS framework for MLLM evaluation, enabling the rapid assessment of future MLLMs. Project webpage: https://kevinlujian.github.io/MLLM_Evaluations/

We propose Spherical World-Locking (SWL) as a general framework for egocentric scene representation, which implicitly transforms multisensory streams with respect to measurements of head orientation. Compared to conventional head-locked egocentric representations with a 2D planar field-of-view, SWL effectively offsets challenges posed by self-motion, allowing for improved spatial synchronization between input modalities. Using a set of multisensory embeddings on a worldlocked sphere, we design a unified encoder-decoder transformer architecture that preserves the spherical structure of the scene representation, without requiring expensive projections between image and world coordinate systems. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on multiple benchmark tasks for egocentric video understanding, including audio-visual active speaker localization, auditory spherical source localization, and behavior anticipation in everyday activities.

- **Summary**: We describe a large-scale dataset--{\em DeepSpeak}--of real and deepfake footage of people talking and gesturing in front of their webcams. The real videos in this first version of the dataset consist of $9$ hours of footage from $220$ diverse individuals. Constituting more than 25 hours of footage, the fake videos consist of a range of different state-of-the-art face-swap and lip-sync deepfakes with natural and AI-generated voices. We expect to release future versions of this dataset with different and updated deepfake technologies. This dataset is made freely available for research and non-commercial uses; requests for commercial use will be considered.

- **Summary**: Placenta volume measured from 3D ultrasound (3DUS) images is an important tool for tracking the growth trajectory and is associated with pregnancy outcomes. Manual segmentation is the gold standard, but it is time-consuming and subjective. Although fully automated deep learning algorithms perform well, they do not always yield high-quality results for each case. Interactive segmentation models could address this issue. However, there is limited work on interactive segmentation models for the placenta. Despite their segmentation accuracy, these methods may not be feasible for clinical use as they require relatively large computational power which may be especially prohibitive in low-resource environments, or on mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a lightweight interactive segmentation model aiming for clinical use to interactively segment the placenta from 3DUS images in real-time. The proposed model adopts the segmentation from our fully automated model for initialization and is designed in a human-in-the-loop manner to achieve iterative improvements. The Dice score and normalized surface Dice are used as evaluation metrics. The results show that our model can achieve superior performance in segmentation compared to state-of-the-art models while using significantly fewer parameters. Additionally, the proposed model is much faster for inference and robust to poor initial masks. The code is available at https://github.com/MedICL-VU/PRISM-placenta.
