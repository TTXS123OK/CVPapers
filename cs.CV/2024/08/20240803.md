- **Summary**: Although segmenting natural images has shown impressive performance, these techniques cannot be directly applied to medical image segmentation. Medical image segmentation is particularly complicated by inherent uncertainties. For instance, the ambiguous boundaries of tissues can lead to diverse but plausible annotations from different clinicians. These uncertainties cause significant discrepancies in clinical interpretations and impact subsequent medical interventions. Therefore, achieving quantitative segmentations from uncertain medical images becomes crucial in clinical practice. To address this, we propose a novel approach that integrates an \textbf{uncertainty-aware model} with \textbf{human-in-the-loop interaction}. The uncertainty-aware model proposes several plausible segmentations to address the uncertainties inherent in medical images, while the human-in-the-loop interaction iteratively modifies the segmentation under clinician supervision. This collaborative model ensures that segmentation is not solely dependent on automated techniques but is also refined through clinician expertise. As a result, our approach represents a significant advancement in the field which enhances the safety of medical image segmentation. It not only offers a comprehensive solution to produce quantitative segmentation from inherent uncertain medical images, but also establishes a synergistic balance between algorithmic precision and clincian knowledge. We evaluated our method on various publicly available multi-clinician annotated datasets: REFUGE2, LIDC-IDRI and QUBIQ. Our method showcases superior segmentation capabilities, outperforming a wide range of deterministic and uncertainty-aware models. We also demonstrated that our model produced significantly better results with fewer interactions compared to previous interactive models. We will release the code to foster further research in this area.

- **Summary**: In recent years, talking head generation has become a focal point for researchers. Considerable effort is being made to refine lip-sync motion, capture expressive facial expressions, generate natural head poses, and achieve high video quality. However, no single model has yet achieved equivalence across all these metrics. This paper aims to animate a 3D face using Jamba, a hybrid Transformers-Mamba model. Mamba, a pioneering Structured State Space Model (SSM) architecture, was designed to address the constraints of the conventional Transformer architecture. Nevertheless, it has several drawbacks. Jamba merges the advantages of both Transformer and Mamba approaches, providing a holistic solution. Based on the foundational Jamba block, we present JambaTalk to enhance motion variety and speed through multimodal integration. Extensive experiments reveal that our method achieves performance comparable or superior to state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: Maps are essential for diverse applications, such as vehicle navigation and autonomous robotics. Both require spatial models for effective route planning and localization. This paper addresses the challenge of road graph construction for autonomous vehicles. Despite recent advances, creating a road graph remains labor-intensive and has yet to achieve full automation. The goal of this paper is to generate such graphs automatically and accurately. Modern cars are equipped with onboard sensors used for today's advanced driver assistance systems like lane keeping. We propose using global navigation satellite system (GNSS) traces and basic image data acquired from these standard sensors in consumer vehicles to estimate road-level maps with minimal effort. We exploit the spatial information in the data by framing the problem as a road centerline semantic segmentation task using a convolutional neural network. We also utilize the data's time series nature to refine the neural network's output by using map matching. We implemented and evaluated our method using a fleet of real consumer vehicles, only using the deployed onboard sensors. Our evaluation demonstrates that our approach not only matches existing methods on simpler road configurations but also significantly outperforms them on more complex road geometries and topologies. This work received the 2023 Woven by Toyota Invention Award.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) is the latest generation foundation model for image and video segmentation. Trained on the expansive Segment Anything Video (SA-V) dataset, which comprises 35.5 million masks across 50.9K videos, SAM 2 advances its predecessor's capabilities by supporting zero-shot segmentation through various prompts (e.g., points, boxes, and masks). Its robust zero-shot performance and efficient memory usage make SAM 2 particularly appealing for surgical tool segmentation in videos, especially given the scarcity of labeled data and the diversity of surgical procedures. In this study, we evaluate the zero-shot video segmentation performance of the SAM 2 model across different types of surgeries, including endoscopy and microscopy. We also assess its performance on videos featuring single and multiple tools of varying lengths to demonstrate SAM 2's applicability and effectiveness in the surgical domain. We found that: 1) SAM 2 demonstrates a strong capability for segmenting various surgical videos; 2) When new tools enter the scene, additional prompts are necessary to maintain segmentation accuracy; and 3) Specific challenges inherent to surgical videos can impact the robustness of SAM 2.

- **Summary**: We introduce Multi-Cylindrical Panoramic Depth Estimation (MCPDepth), a two-stage framework for omnidirectional depth estimation via stereo matching between multiple cylindrical panoramas. MCPDepth uses cylindrical panoramas for initial stereo matching and then fuses the resulting depth maps across views. A circular attention module is employed to overcome the distortion along the vertical axis. MCPDepth exclusively utilizes standard network components, simplifying deployment to embedded devices and outperforming previous methods that require custom kernels. We theoretically and experimentally compare spherical and cylindrical projections for stereo matching, highlighting the advantages of the cylindrical projection. MCPDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance with an 18.8% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) for depth on the outdoor synthetic dataset Deep360 and a 19.9% reduction on the indoor real-scene dataset 3D60.

- **Summary**: Recent work in visual SLAM has shown the effectiveness of using deep network backbones. Despite excellent accuracy, however, such approaches are often expensive to run or do not generalize well zero-shot. Their runtime can also fluctuate wildly while their frontend and backend fight for access to GPU resources. To address these problems, we introduce Deep Patch Visual (DPV) SLAM, a method for monocular visual SLAM on a single GPU. DPV-SLAM maintains a high minimum framerate and small memory overhead (5-7G) compared to existing deep SLAM systems. On real-world datasets, DPV-SLAM runs at 1x-4x real-time framerates. We achieve comparable accuracy to DROID-SLAM on EuRoC and TartanAir while running 2.5x faster using a fraction of the memory. DPV-SLAM is an extension to the DPVO visual odometry system; its code can be found in the same repository: https://github.com/princeton-vl/DPVO



### SAT3D: Image-driven Semantic Attribute Transfer in 3D

- **Summary**: GAN-based image editing task aims at manipulating image attributes in the latent space of generative models. Most of the previous 2D and 3D-aware approaches mainly focus on editing attributes in images with ambiguous semantics or regions from a reference image, which fail to achieve photographic semantic attribute transfer, such as the beard from a photo of a man. In this paper, we propose an image-driven Semantic Attribute Transfer method in 3D (SAT3D) by editing semantic attributes from a reference image. For the proposed method, the exploration is conducted in the style space of a pre-trained 3D-aware StyleGAN-based generator by learning the correlations between semantic attributes and style code channels. For guidance, we associate each attribute with a set of phrase-based descriptor groups, and develop a Quantitative Measurement Module (QMM) to quantitatively describe the attribute characteristics in images based on descriptor groups, which leverages the image-text comprehension capability of CLIP. During the training process, the QMM is incorporated into attribute losses to calculate attribute similarity between images, guiding target semantic transferring and irrelevant semantics preserving. We present our 3D-aware attribute transfer results across multiple domains and also conduct comparisons with classical 2D image editing methods, demonstrating the effectiveness and customizability of our SAT3D.

- **Summary**: Deepfake detection faces increasing challenges since the fast growth of generative models in developing massive and diverse Deepfake technologies. Recent advances rely on introducing heuristic features from spatial or frequency domains rather than modeling general forgery features within backbones. To address this issue, we turn to the backbone design with two intuitive priors from spatial and frequency detectors, \textit{i.e.,} learning robust spatial attributes and frequency distributions that are discriminative for real and fake samples. To this end, we propose an efficient network for face forgery detection named MkfaNet, which consists of two core modules. For spatial contexts, we design a Multi-Kernel Aggregator that adaptively selects organ features extracted by multiple convolutions for modeling subtle facial differences between real and fake faces. For the frequency components, we propose a Multi-Frequency Aggregator to process different bands of frequency components by adaptively reweighing high-frequency and low-frequency features. Comprehensive experiments on seven popular deepfake detection benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed MkfaNet variants achieve superior performances in both within-domain and across-domain evaluations with impressive efficiency of parameter usage.

- **Summary**: Video grounding is a fundamental problem in multimodal content understanding, aiming to localize specific natural language queries in an untrimmed video. However, current video grounding datasets merely focus on simple events and are either limited to shorter videos or brief sentences, which hinders the model from evolving toward stronger multimodal understanding capabilities. To address these limitations, we present a large-scale video grounding dataset named SynopGround, in which more than 2800 hours of videos are sourced from popular TV dramas and are paired with accurately localized human-written synopses. Each paragraph in the synopsis serves as a language query and is manually annotated with precise temporal boundaries in the long video. These paragraph queries are tightly correlated to each other and contain a wealth of abstract expressions summarizing video storylines and specific descriptions portraying event details, which enables the model to learn multimodal perception on more intricate concepts over longer context dependencies. Based on the dataset, we further introduce a more complex setting of video grounding dubbed Multi-Paragraph Video Grounding (MPVG), which takes as input multiple paragraphs and a long video for grounding each paragraph query to its temporal interval. In addition, we propose a novel Local-Global Multimodal Reasoner (LGMR) to explicitly model the local-global structures of long-term multimodal inputs for MPVG. Our method provides an effective baseline solution to the multi-paragraph video grounding problem. Extensive experiments verify the proposed model's effectiveness as well as its superiority in long-term multi-paragraph video grounding over prior state-of-the-arts. Dataset and code are publicly available. Project page: https://synopground.github.io/.



### HIVE: HIerarchical Volume Encoding for Neural Implicit Surface Reconstruction

- **Summary**: Neural implicit surface reconstruction has become a new trend in reconstructing a detailed 3D shape from images. In previous methods, however, the 3D scene is only encoded by the MLPs which do not have an explicit 3D structure. To better represent 3D shapes, we introduce a volume encoding to explicitly encode the spatial information. We further design hierarchical volumes to encode the scene structures in multiple scales. The high-resolution volumes capture the high-frequency geometry details since spatially varying features could be learned from different 3D points, while the low-resolution volumes enforce the spatial consistency to keep the shape smooth since adjacent locations possess the same low-resolution feature. In addition, we adopt a sparse structure to reduce the memory consumption at high-resolution volumes, and two regularization terms to enhance results smoothness. This hierarchical volume encoding could be appended to any implicit surface reconstruction method as a plug-and-play module, and can generate a smooth and clean reconstruction with more details. Superior performance is demonstrated in DTU, EPFL, and BlendedMVS datasets with significant improvement on the standard metrics.

- **Summary**: 3D content creation has long been a complex and time-consuming process, often requiring specialized skills and resources. While recent advancements have allowed for text-guided 3D object and scene generation, they still fall short of providing sufficient control over the generation process, leading to a gap between the user's creative vision and the generated results. In this paper, we present iControl3D, a novel interactive system that empowers users to generate and render customizable 3D scenes with precise control. To this end, a 3D creator interface has been developed to provide users with fine-grained control over the creation process. Technically, we leverage 3D meshes as an intermediary proxy to iteratively merge individual 2D diffusion-generated images into a cohesive and unified 3D scene representation. To ensure seamless integration of 3D meshes, we propose to perform boundary-aware depth alignment before fusing the newly generated mesh with the existing one in 3D space. Additionally, to effectively manage depth discrepancies between remote content and foreground, we propose to model remote content separately with an environment map instead of 3D meshes. Finally, our neural rendering interface enables users to build a radiance field of their scene online and navigate the entire scene. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. The code will be made available at https://github.com/xingyi-li/iControl3D.

- **Summary**: Identifying risky driving behavior in real-world situations is essential for the safety of both drivers and pedestrians. However, integrating natural language models in this field remains relatively untapped. To address this, we created a novel multi-modal instruction tuning dataset and driver coaching inference system. Our primary use case is dashcam-based coaching for commercial drivers. The North American Dashcam Market is expected to register a CAGR of 15.4 percent from 2022 to 2027. Our dataset enables language models to learn visual instructions across various risky driving scenarios, emphasizing detailed reasoning crucial for effective driver coaching and managerial comprehension. Our model is trained on road-facing and driver-facing RGB camera footage, capturing the comprehensive scope of driving behavior in vehicles equipped with dashcams.



### SiamMo: Siamese Motion-Centric 3D Object Tracking

- **Summary**: Current 3D single object tracking methods primarily rely on the Siamese matching-based paradigm, which struggles with textureless and incomplete LiDAR point clouds. Conversely, the motion-centric paradigm avoids appearance matching, thus overcoming these issues. However, its complex multi-stage pipeline and the limited temporal modeling capability of a single-stream architecture constrain its potential. In this paper, we introduce SiamMo, a novel and simple Siamese motion-centric tracking approach. Unlike the traditional single-stream architecture, we employ Siamese feature extraction for motion-centric tracking. This decouples feature extraction from temporal fusion, significantly enhancing tracking performance. Additionally, we design a Spatio-Temporal Feature Aggregation module to integrate Siamese features at multiple scales, capturing motion information effectively. We also introduce a Box-aware Feature Encoding module to encode object size priors into motion estimation. SiamMo is a purely motion-centric tracker that eliminates the need for additional processes like segmentation and box refinement. Without whistles and bells, SiamMo not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks but also demonstrates exceptional robustness in challenging scenarios. SiamMo sets a new record on the KITTI tracking benchmark with 90.1\% precision while maintaining a high inference speed of 108 FPS. The code will be released at https://github.com/HDU-VRLab/SiamMo.

- **Summary**: While generative models have made significant advancements in recent years, they also raise concerns such as privacy breaches and biases. Machine unlearning has emerged as a viable solution, aiming to remove specific training data, e.g., containing private information and bias, from models. In this paper, we study the machine unlearning problem in Image-to-Image (I2I) generative models. Previous studies mainly treat it as a single objective optimization problem, offering a solitary solution, thereby neglecting the varied user expectations towards the trade-off between complete unlearning and model utility. To address this issue, we propose a controllable unlearning framework that uses a control coefficient $\varepsilon$ to control the trade-off. We reformulate the I2I generative model unlearning problem into a $\varepsilon$-constrained optimization problem and solve it with a gradient-based method to find optimal solutions for unlearning boundaries. These boundaries define the valid range for the control coefficient. Within this range, every yielded solution is theoretically guaranteed with Pareto optimality. We also analyze the convergence rate of our framework under various control functions. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets across three mainstream I2I models demonstrate the effectiveness of our controllable unlearning framework.

- **Summary**: Effective fraud detection and analysis of government-issued identity documents, such as passports, driver's licenses, and identity cards, are essential in thwarting identity theft and bolstering security on online platforms. The training of accurate fraud detection and analysis tools depends on the availability of extensive identity document datasets. However, current publicly available benchmark datasets for identity document analysis, including MIDV-500, MIDV-2020, and FMIDV, fall short in several respects: they offer a limited number of samples, cover insufficient varieties of fraud patterns, and seldom include alterations in critical personal identifying fields like portrait images, limiting their utility in training models capable of detecting realistic frauds while preserving privacy.   In response to these shortcomings, our research introduces a new benchmark dataset, IDNet, designed to advance privacy-preserving fraud detection efforts. The IDNet dataset comprises 837,060 images of synthetically generated identity documents, totaling approximately 490 gigabytes, categorized into 20 types from $10$ U.S. states and 10 European countries. We evaluate the utility and present use cases of the dataset, illustrating how it can aid in training privacy-preserving fraud detection methods, facilitating the generation of camera and video capturing of identity documents, and testing schema unification and other identity document management functionalities.

- **Summary**: Landslides inflict substantial societal and economic damage, underscoring their global significance as recurrent and destructive natural disasters. Recent landslides in northern parts of India and Nepal have caused significant disruption, damaging infrastructure and posing threats to local communities. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning technique, have shown remarkable success in image processing. Because of their sophisticated architectures, advanced CNN-based models perform better in landslide detection than conventional algorithms. The purpose of this work is to investigate CNNs' potential in more detail, with an emphasis on comparison of CNN based models for better landslide detection. We compared four traditional semantic segmentation models (U-Net, LinkNet, PSPNet, and FPN) and utilized the ResNet50 backbone encoder to implement them. Moreover, we have experimented with the hyperparameters such as learning rates, batch sizes, and regularization techniques to fine-tune the models. We have computed the confusion matrix for each model and used performance metrics including precision, recall and f1-score to evaluate and compare the deep learning models. According to the experimental results, LinkNet gave the best results among the four models having an Accuracy of 97.49% and a F1-score of 85.7% (with 84.49% precision, 87.07% recall). We have also presented a comprehensive comparison of all pixel-wise confusion matrix results and the time taken to train each model.

- **Summary**: Fully supervised training of semantic segmentation models is costly and challenging because each pixel within an image needs to be labeled. Therefore, the sparse pixel-level annotation methods have been introduced to train models with a subset of pixels within each image. We introduce a Bayesian active learning framework based on sparse pixel-level annotation that utilizes a pixel-level Bayesian uncertainty measure based on Balanced Entropy (BalEnt) [84]. BalEnt captures the information between the models' predicted marginalized probability distribution and the pixel labels. BalEnt has linear scalability with a closed analytical form and can be calculated independently per pixel without relational computations with other pixels. We train our proposed active learning framework for Cityscapes, Camvid, ADE20K and VOC2012 benchmark datasets and show that it reaches supervised levels of mIoU using only a fraction of labeled pixels while outperforming the previous state-of-the-art active learning models with a large margin.

- **Summary**: In skeletal-based action recognition, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) based methods face limitations due to their complexity and high energy consumption. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained attention in recent years for their low energy consumption, but existing methods combining GCNs and SNNs fail to fully utilize the temporal characteristics of skeletal sequences, leading to increased storage and computational costs. To address this issue, we propose a Signal-SGN(Spiking Graph Convolutional Network), which leverages the temporal dimension of skeletal sequences as the spiking timestep and treats features as discrete stochastic signals. The core of the network consists of a 1D Spiking Graph Convolutional Network (1D-SGN) and a Frequency Spiking Convolutional Network (FSN). The SGN performs graph convolution on single frames and incorporates spiking network characteristics to capture inter-frame temporal relationships, while the FSN uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and complex convolution to extract temporal-frequency features. We also introduce a multi-scale wavelet transform feature fusion module(MWTF) to capture spectral features of temporal signals, enhancing the model's classification capability. We propose a pluggable temporal-frequency spatial semantic feature extraction module(TFSM) to enhance the model's ability to distinguish features without increasing inference-phase consumption. Our numerous experiments on the NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets demonstrate that the proposed models not only surpass existing SNN-based methods in accuracy but also reduce computational and storage costs during training. Furthermore, they achieve competitive accuracy compared to corresponding GCN-based methods, which is quite remarkable.

- **Summary**: With the advancement of vision transformers (ViTs) and self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques, pre-trained large ViTs have become the new foundation models for computer vision applications. However, studies have shown that, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ViTs are also susceptible to adversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations in the input can fool the model into making false predictions. This paper studies the transferability of such an adversarial vulnerability from a pre-trained ViT model to downstream tasks. We focus on \emph{sample-wise} transfer attacks and propose a novel attack method termed \emph{Downstream Transfer Attack (DTA)}. For a given test image, DTA leverages a pre-trained ViT model to craft the adversarial example and then applies the adversarial example to attack a fine-tuned version of the model on a downstream dataset. During the attack, DTA identifies and exploits the most vulnerable layers of the pre-trained model guided by a cosine similarity loss to craft highly transferable attacks. Through extensive experiments with pre-trained ViTs by 3 distinct pre-training methods, 3 fine-tuning schemes, and across 10 diverse downstream datasets, we show that DTA achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) exceeding 90\%, surpassing existing methods by a huge margin. When used with adversarial training, the adversarial examples generated by our DTA can significantly improve the model's robustness to different downstream transfer attacks.

- **Summary**: Recently, transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable performance on audio-visual segmentation (AVS) tasks. However, their expensive computational cost makes real-time inference impractical. By characterizing attention maps of the network, we identify two key obstacles in AVS models: 1) attention dissipation, corresponding to the over-concentrated attention weights by Softmax within restricted frames, and 2) inefficient, burdensome transformer decoder, caused by narrow focus patterns in early stages. In this paper, we introduce AVESFormer, the first real-time Audio-Visual Efficient Segmentation transformer that achieves fast, efficient and light-weight simultaneously. Our model leverages an efficient prompt query generator to correct the behaviour of cross-attention. Additionally, we propose ELF decoder to bring greater efficiency by facilitating convolutions suitable for local features to reduce computational burdens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AVESFormer significantly enhances model performance, achieving 79.9% on S4, 57.9% on MS3 and 31.2% on AVSS, outperforming previous state-of-the-art and achieving an excellent trade-off between performance and speed.

- **Summary**: We present a general and intuitive ambiguity model for intersections, junctions and other structures in binary edge images. The model is combined with edge tracing, where edges are ordered sequences of connected pixels. The objective is to provide a versatile preprocessing method for tasks such as figure-ground segmentation, object recognition, topological analysis, etc. By using only a small set of straightforward principles, the results are intuitive to describe. This helps to implement subsequent processing steps, such as resolving ambiguous edge connections at junctions. By using an augmented edge map, neighboring edges can be directly accessed using quick local search operations. The edge tracing uses recursion, which leads to compact programming code. We explain our algorithm using pseudocode, compare it with related methods, and show how simple modular postprocessing steps can be used to optimize the results. The complete algorithm, including all data structures, requires less than 50 lines of pseudocode. We also provide a C++ implementation of our method.

- **Summary**: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is essential for mobile robotics, enabling autonomous navigation in dynamic, unstructured outdoor environments without relying on external positioning systems. In agricultural applications, where environmental conditions can be particularly challenging due to variable lighting or weather conditions, Visual-Inertial SLAM has emerged as a potential solution. This paper benchmarks several open-source Visual-Inertial SLAM systems, including ORB-SLAM3, VINS-Fusion, OpenVINS, Kimera, and SVO Pro, to evaluate their performance in agricultural settings. We focus on the impact of loop closing on localization accuracy and computational demands, providing a comprehensive analysis of these systems' effectiveness in real-world environments and especially their application to embedded systems in agricultural robotics. Our contributions further include an assessment of varying frame rates on localization accuracy and computational load. The findings highlight the importance of loop closing in improving localization accuracy while managing computational resources efficiently, offering valuable insights for optimizing Visual-Inertial SLAM systems for practical outdoor applications in mobile robotics.

  Retrieval, specifically in the Large Language Model for Evaluation in IR
  (LLM4Eval) Workshop in 2024
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Evaluating the quality of automatically generated image descriptions is challenging, requiring metrics that capture various aspects such as grammaticality, coverage, correctness, and truthfulness. While human evaluation offers valuable insights, its cost and time-consuming nature pose limitations. Existing automated metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and CIDEr aim to bridge this gap but often show weak correlations with human judgment. We address this challenge by introducing a novel evaluation framework rooted in a modern large language model (LLM), such as GPT-4 or Gemini, capable of image generation. In our proposed framework, we begin by feeding an input image into a designated image captioning model, chosen for evaluation, to generate a textual description. Using this description, an LLM then creates a new image. By extracting features from both the original and LLM-created images, we measure their similarity using a designated similarity metric. A high similarity score suggests that the image captioning model has accurately generated textual descriptions, while a low similarity score indicates discrepancies, revealing potential shortcomings in the model's performance. Human-annotated reference captions are not required in our proposed evaluation framework, which serves as a valuable tool for evaluating the effectiveness of image captioning models. Its efficacy is confirmed through human evaluation.

- **Summary**: Audio-driven talking head generation is a significant and challenging task applicable to various fields such as virtual avatars, film production, and online conferences. However, the existing GAN-based models emphasize generating well-synchronized lip shapes but overlook the visual quality of generated frames, while diffusion-based models prioritize generating high-quality frames but neglect lip shape matching, resulting in jittery mouth movements. To address the aforementioned problems, we introduce a two-stage diffusion-based model. The first stage involves generating synchronized facial landmarks based on the given speech. In the second stage, these generated landmarks serve as a condition in the denoising process, aiming to optimize mouth jitter issues and generate high-fidelity, well-synchronized, and temporally coherent talking head videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model yields the best performance.

- **Summary**: Since the introduction of the self-attention mechanism and the adoption of the Transformer architecture for Computer Vision tasks, the Vision Transformer-based architectures gained a lot of popularity in the field, being used for tasks such as image classification, object detection and image segmentation. However, efficiently leveraging the attention mechanism in vision transformers for the Monocular 3D Object Detection task remains an open question. In this paper, we present LAM3D, a framework that Leverages self-Attention mechanism for Monocular 3D object Detection. To do so, the proposed method is built upon a Pyramid Vision Transformer v2 (PVTv2) as feature extraction backbone and 2D/3D detection machinery. We evaluate the proposed method on the KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, proving the applicability of the proposed solution in the autonomous driving domain and outperforming reference methods. Moreover, due to the usage of self-attention, LAM3D is able to systematically outperform the equivalent architecture that does not employ self-attention.

- **Summary**: In the field of object detection, domain generalisation (DG) aims to ensure robust performance across diverse and unseen target domains by learning the robust domain-invariant features corresponding to the objects of interest across multiple source domains. While there are many approaches established for performing DG for the task of classification, there has been a very little focus on object detection. In this paper, we propose a domain penalisation (DP) framework for the task of object detection, where the data is assumed to be sampled from multiple source domains and tested on completely unseen test domains. We assign penalisation weights to each domain, with the values updated based on the detection networks performance on the respective source domains. By prioritising the domains that needs more attention, our approach effectively balances the training process. We evaluate our solution on the GWHD 2021 dataset, a component of the WiLDS benchmark and we compare against ERM and GroupDRO as these are primarily loss function based. Our extensive experimental results reveals that the proposed approach improves the accuracy by 0.3 percent and 0.5 percent on validation and test out-of-distribution (OOD) sets, respectively for FasterRCNN. We also compare the performance of our approach on FCOS detector and show that our approach improves the baseline OOD performance over the existing approaches by 1.3 percent and 1.4 percent on validation and test sets, respectively. This study underscores the potential of performance based domain penalisation in enhancing the generalisation ability of object detection models across diverse environments.

- **Summary**: Rice plays a vital role as a primary food source for over half of the world's population, and its production is critical for global food security. Nevertheless, rice cultivation is frequently affected by various diseases that can severely decrease yield and quality. Therefore, early and accurate detection of rice diseases is necessary to prevent their spread and minimize crop losses. In this research, we explore three mobile-compatible CNN architectures, namely ShuffleNet, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet-B0, for rice leaf disease classification. These models are selected due to their compatibility with mobile devices, as they demand less computational power and memory compared to other CNN models. To enhance the performance of the three models, we added two fully connected layers separated by a dropout layer. We used early stop creation to prevent the model from being overfiting. The results of the study showed that the best performance was achieved by the EfficientNet-B0 model with an accuracy of 99.8%. Meanwhile, MobileNetV2 and ShuffleNet only achieved accuracies of 84.21% and 66.51%, respectively. This study shows that EfficientNet-B0 when combined with the proposed layer and early stop, can produce a high-accuracy model.

- **Summary**: Driver action recognition, aiming to accurately identify drivers' behaviours, is crucial for enhancing driver-vehicle interactions and ensuring driving safety. Unlike general action recognition, drivers' environments are often challenging, being gloomy and dark, and with the development of sensors, various cameras such as IR and depth cameras have emerged for analyzing drivers' behaviors. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal fusion transformer, named MultiFuser, which identifies cross-modal interrelations and interactions among multimodal car cabin videos and adaptively integrates different modalities for improved representations. Specifically, MultiFuser comprises layers of Bi-decomposed Modules to model spatiotemporal features, with a modality synthesizer for multimodal features integration. Each Bi-decomposed Module includes a Modal Expertise ViT block for extracting modality-specific features and a Patch-wise Adaptive Fusion block for efficient cross-modal fusion. Extensive experiments are conducted on Drive&Act dataset and the results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Accurate behavior prediction for vehicles is essential but challenging for autonomous driving. Most existing studies show satisfying performance under regular scenarios, but most neglected safety-critical scenarios. In this study, a spatio-temporal dual-encoder network named STDA for safety-critical scenarios was developed. Considering the exceptional capabilities of human drivers in terms of situational awareness and comprehending risks, driver attention was incorporated into STDA to facilitate swift identification of the critical regions, which is expected to improve both performance and interpretability. STDA contains four parts: the driver attention prediction module, which predicts driver attention; the fusion module designed to fuse the features between driver attention and raw images; the temporary encoder module used to enhance the capability to interpret dynamic scenes; and the behavior prediction module to predict the behavior. The experiment data are used to train and validate the model. The results show that STDA improves the G-mean from 0.659 to 0.719 when incorporating driver attention and adopting a temporal encoder module. In addition, extensive experimentation has been conducted to validate that the proposed module exhibits robust generalization capabilities and can be seamlessly integrated into other mainstream models.

- **Summary**: In pathology, accurate and efficient analysis of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) slides is crucial for timely and effective cancer diagnosis. Although many deep learning solutions for nuclei instance segmentation and classification exist in the literature, they often entail high computational costs and resource requirements, thus limiting their practical usage in medical applications. To address this issue, we introduce a novel convolutional neural network, NuLite, a U-Net-like architecture designed explicitly on Fast-ViT, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight CNN. We obtained three versions of our model, NuLite-S, NuLite-M, and NuLite-H, trained on the PanNuke dataset. The experimental results prove that our models equal CellViT (SOTA) in terms of panoptic quality and detection. However, our lightest model, NuLite-S, is 40 times smaller in terms of parameters and about 8 times smaller in terms of GFlops, while our heaviest model is 17 times smaller in terms of parameters and about 7 times smaller in terms of GFlops. Moreover, our model is up to about 8 times faster than CellViT. Lastly, to prove the effectiveness of our solution, we provide a robust comparison of external datasets, namely CoNseP, MoNuSeg, and GlySAC. Our model is publicly available at https://github.com/CosmoIknosLab/NuLite

- **Summary**: The recent surge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has fundamentally reshaped the landscape of AI research and industry, shedding light on a promising path toward the next AI milestone. However, significant challenges remain preventing MLLMs from being practical in real-world applications. The most notable challenge comes from the huge cost of running an MLLM with a massive number of parameters and extensive computation. As a result, most MLLMs need to be deployed on high-performing cloud servers, which greatly limits their application scopes such as mobile, offline, energy-sensitive, and privacy-protective scenarios. In this work, we present MiniCPM-V, a series of efficient MLLMs deployable on end-side devices. By integrating the latest MLLM techniques in architecture, pretraining and alignment, the latest MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 has several notable features: (1) Strong performance, outperforming GPT-4V-1106, Gemini Pro and Claude 3 on OpenCompass, a comprehensive evaluation over 11 popular benchmarks, (2) strong OCR capability and 1.8M pixel high-resolution image perception at any aspect ratio, (3) trustworthy behavior with low hallucination rates, (4) multilingual support for 30+ languages, and (5) efficient deployment on mobile phones. More importantly, MiniCPM-V can be viewed as a representative example of a promising trend: The model sizes for achieving usable (e.g., GPT-4V) level performance are rapidly decreasing, along with the fast growth of end-side computation capacity. This jointly shows that GPT-4V level MLLMs deployed on end devices are becoming increasingly possible, unlocking a wider spectrum of real-world AI applications in the near future.

- **Summary**: Street-to-satellite image synthesis focuses on generating realistic satellite images from corresponding ground street-view images while maintaining a consistent content layout, similar to looking down from the sky. The significant differences in perspectives create a substantial domain gap between the views, making this cross-view generation task particularly challenging. In this paper, we introduce SkyDiffusion, a novel cross-view generation method for synthesizing satellite images from street-view images, leveraging diffusion models and Bird's Eye View (BEV) paradigm. First, we design a Curved-BEV method to transform street-view images to the satellite view, reformulating the challenging cross-domain image synthesis task into a conditional generation problem. Curved-BEV also includes a "Multi-to-One" mapping strategy for combining multiple street-view images within the same satellite coverage area, effectively solving the occlusion issues in dense urban scenes. Next, we design a BEV-controlled diffusion model to generate satellite images consistent with the street-view content, which also incorporates a light manipulation module to optimize the lighting condition of the synthesized image using a reference satellite. Experimental results demonstrate that SkyDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both suburban (CVUSA & CVACT) and urban (VIGOR-Chicago) cross-view datasets, with an average SSIM increase of 14.5% and a FID reduction of 29.6%, achieving realistic and content-consistent satellite image generation.

- **Summary**: 3D speech-driven facial animation generation has received much attention in both industrial applications and academic research. Since the non-verbal facial cues that exist across the face in reality are non-deterministic, the generated results should be diverse. However, most recent methods are deterministic models that cannot learn a many-to-many mapping between audio and facial motion to generate diverse facial animations. To address this problem, we propose GLDiTalker, which introduces a motion prior along with some stochasticity to reduce the uncertainty of cross-modal mapping while increasing non-determinacy of the non-verbal facial cues that reside throughout the face. Particularly, GLDiTalker uses VQ-VAE to map facial motion mesh sequences into latent space in the first stage, and then iteratively adds and removes noise to the latent facial motion features in the second stage. In order to integrate different levels of spatial information, the Spatial Pyramidal SpiralConv Encoder is also designed to extract multi-scale features. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Painting classification plays a vital role in organizing, finding, and suggesting artwork for digital and classic art galleries. Existing methods struggle with adapting knowledge from the real world to artistic images during training, leading to poor performance when dealing with different datasets. Our innovation lies in addressing these challenges through a two-step process. First, we generate more data using Style Transfer with Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN), bridging the gap between diverse styles. Then, our classifier gains a boost with feature-map adaptive spatial attention modules, improving its understanding of artistic details. Moreover, we tackle the problem of imbalanced class representation by dynamically adjusting augmented samples. Through a dual-stage process involving careful hyperparameter search and model fine-tuning, we achieve an impressive 87.24\% accuracy using the ResNet-50 backbone over 40 training epochs. Our study explores quantitative analyses that compare different pretrained backbones, investigates model optimization through ablation studies, and examines how varying augmentation levels affect model performance. Complementing this, our qualitative experiments offer valuable insights into the model's decision-making process using spatial attention and its ability to differentiate between easy and challenging samples based on confidence ranking.

- **Summary**: In the field of exploration geophysics, seismic vibrator is one of the widely used seismic sources to acquire seismic data, which is usually named vibroseis. "Ringing effect" is a common problem in vibroseis data processing due to the limited frequency bandwidth of the vibrator, which degrades the performance of first-break picking. In this paper, we proposed a novel deringing model for vibroseis data using deep convolutional neural network (CNN). In this model we use end-to-end training strategy to obtain the deringed data directly, and skip connections to improve model training process and preserve the details of vibroseis data. For real vibroseis deringing task we synthesize training data and corresponding labels from real vibroseis data and utilize them to train the deep CNN model. Experiments are conducted both on synthetic data and real vibroseis data. The experiment results show that deep CNN model can attenuate the ringing effect effectively and expand the bandwidth of vibroseis data. The STA/LTA ratio method for first-break picking also shows improvement on deringed vibroseis data using deep CNN model.

- **Summary**: Adapter based fine-tuning has been studied for improving the performance of SAM on downstream tasks. However, there is still a significant performance gap between fine-tuned SAMs and domain-specific models. To reduce the gap, we propose Two-Stream SAM (TS-SAM). On the one hand, inspired by the side network in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), we designed a lightweight Convolutional Side Adapter (CSA), which integrates the powerful features from SAM into side network training for comprehensive feature fusion. On the other hand, in line with the characteristics of segmentation tasks, we designed Multi-scale Refinement Module (MRM) and Feature Fusion Decoder (FFD) to keep both the detailed and semantic features. Extensive experiments on ten public datasets from three tasks demonstrate that TS-SAM not only significantly outperforms the recently proposed SAM-Adapter and SSOM, but achieves competitive performance with the SOTA domain-specific models.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) achieve impressive rendering performance by learning volumetric 3D representation from several images of different views. However, it is difficult to reconstruct a sharp NeRF from blurry input as it often occurs in the wild. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Efficient Event-Enhanced NeRF (E$^3$NeRF) by utilizing the combination of RGB images and event streams. To effectively introduce event streams into the neural volumetric representation learning process, we propose an event-enhanced blur rendering loss and an event rendering loss, which guide the network via modeling the real blur process and event generation process, respectively. Specifically, we leverage spatial-temporal information from the event stream to evenly distribute learning attention over temporal blur while simultaneously focusing on blurry texture through the spatial attention. Moreover, a camera pose estimation framework for real-world data is built with the guidance of the events to generalize the method to practical applications. Compared to previous image-based or event-based NeRF, our framework makes more profound use of the internal relationship between events and images. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate that E$^3$NeRF can effectively learn a sharp NeRF from blurry images, especially in non-uniform motion and low-light scenes.

- **Summary**: This study aims to learn a translation from visible to infrared imagery, bridging the domain gap between the two modalities so as to improve accuracy on downstream tasks including object detection. Previous approaches attempt to perform bi-domain feature fusion through iterative optimization or end-to-end deep convolutional networks. However, we pose the problem as similar to that of image translation, adopting a two-stage training strategy with a Generative Adversarial Network and an object detection model. The translation model learns a conversion that preserves the structural detail of visible images while preserving the texture and other characteristics of infrared images. Images so generated are used to train standard object detection frameworks including Yolov5, Mask and Faster RCNN. We also investigate the usefulness of integrating a super-resolution step into our pipeline to further improve model accuracy, and achieve an improvement of as high as 5.3% mAP.

- **Summary**: User-generated videos (UGVs) uploaded from mobile phones to social media sites like YouTube and TikTok are short and non-repetitive. We summarize a transitory UGV into several keyframes in linear time via fast graph sampling based on Gershgorin disc alignment (GDA). Specifically, we first model a sequence of $N$ frames in a UGV as an $M$-hop path graph $\mathcal{G}^o$ for $M \ll N$, where the similarity between two frames within $M$ time instants is encoded as a positive edge based on feature similarity. Towards efficient sampling, we then "unfold" $\mathcal{G}^o$ to a $1$-hop path graph $\mathcal{G}$, specified by a generalized graph Laplacian matrix $\mathcal{L}$, via one of two graph unfolding procedures with provable performance bounds. We show that maximizing the smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\min}(\mathbf{B})$ of a coefficient matrix $\mathbf{B} = \textit{diag}\left(\mathbf{h}\right) + \mu \mathcal{L}$, where $\mathbf{h}$ is the binary keyframe selection vector, is equivalent to minimizing a worst-case signal reconstruction error. We maximize instead the Gershgorin circle theorem (GCT) lower bound $\lambda^-_{\min}(\mathbf{B})$ by choosing $\mathbf{h}$ via a new fast graph sampling algorithm that iteratively aligns left-ends of Gershgorin discs for all graph nodes (frames). Extensive experiments on multiple short video datasets show that our algorithm achieves comparable or better video summarization performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, at a substantially reduced complexity.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning methods have shown promising results in solving many practical problems when only a few labels are available. The existing methods assume that the class distributions of labeled and unlabeled data are equal; however, their performances are significantly degraded in class distribution mismatch scenarios where out-of-distribution (OOD) data exist in the unlabeled data. Previous safe semi-supervised learning studies have addressed this problem by making OOD data less likely to affect training based on labeled data. However, even if the studies effectively filter out the unnecessary OOD data, they can lose the basic information that all data share regardless of class. To this end, we propose to apply a self-supervised contrastive learning approach to fully exploit a large amount of unlabeled data. We also propose a contrastive loss function with coefficient schedule to aggregate as an anchor the labeled negative examples of the same class into positive examples. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on image classification datasets - CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and CIFAR-100+Tiny ImageNet - under various mismatch ratios. The results show that self-supervised contrastive learning significantly improves classification accuracy. Moreover, aggregating the in-distribution examples produces better representation and consequently further improves classification accuracy.

- **Summary**: In Zero-Shot ObjectNav, an embodied ground agent is expected to navigate to a target object specified by a natural language label without any environment-specific fine-tuning. This is challenging, given the limited view of a ground agent and its independent exploratory behavior. To address these issues, we consider an assistive overhead agent with a bounded global view alongside the ground agent and present two coordinated navigation schemes for judicious exploration. We establish the influence of the Generative Communication (GC) between the embodied agents equipped with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in improving zero-shot ObjectNav, achieving a 10% improvement in the ground agent's ability to find the target object in comparison with an unassisted setup in simulation. We further analyze the GC for unique traits quantifying the presence of hallucination and cooperation. In particular, we identify a unique trait of "preemptive hallucination" specific to our embodied setting, where the overhead agent assumes that the ground agent has executed an action in the dialogue when it is yet to move. Finally, we conduct real-world inferences with GC and showcase qualitative examples where countering pre-emptive hallucination via prompt finetuning improves real-world ObjectNav performance.

- **Summary**: Previous studies aiming to optimize and bundle-adjust camera poses using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), such as BARF and DBARF, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in 3D scene reconstruction. However, these approaches have been designed for pinhole-camera pose optimization and do not perform well under radial image distortions such as those in fisheye cameras. Furthermore, inaccurate depth initialization in DBARF results in erroneous geometric information affecting the overall convergence and quality of results. In this paper, we propose adaptive GRUs with a flexible bundle-adjustment method adapted to radial distortions and incorporate feature-based recurrent neural networks to generate continuous novel views from fisheye datasets. Other NeRF methods for fisheye images, such as SCNeRF and OMNI-NeRF, use projected ray distance loss for distorted pose refinement, causing severe artifacts, long rendering time, and are difficult to use in downstream tasks, where the dense voxel representation generated by a NeRF method needs to be converted into a mesh representation. We also address depth initialization issues by adding MiDaS-based depth priors for pinhole images. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the generalization capacity of FBINeRF and show high-fidelity results for both pinhole-camera and fisheye-camera NeRFs.
