- **Summary**: Recent years have witnessed substantial advancements in the field of 3D reconstruction from 2D images, particularly following the introduction of the neural radiance field (NeRF) technique. However, reconstructing a 3D high dynamic range (HDR) radiance field, which aligns more closely with real-world conditions, from 2D multi-exposure low dynamic range (LDR) images continues to pose significant challenges. Approaches to this issue fall into two categories: grid-based and implicit-based. Implicit methods, using multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), face inefficiencies, limited solvability, and overfitting risks. Conversely, grid-based methods require significant memory and struggle with image quality and long training times. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian Splatting-a recent, high-quality, real-time 3D reconstruction technique-into this domain. We further develop the High Dynamic Range Gaussian Splatting (HDR-GS) method, designed to address the aforementioned challenges. This method enhances color dimensionality by including luminance and uses an asymmetric grid for tone-mapping, swiftly and precisely converting pixel irradiance to color. Our approach improves HDR scene recovery accuracy and integrates a novel coarse-to-fine strategy to speed up model convergence, enhancing robustness against sparse viewpoints and exposure extremes, and preventing local optima. Extensive testing confirms that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art techniques in both synthetic and real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: NeRFs have achieved incredible success in novel view synthesis. However, the accuracy of the implicit geometry is unsatisfactory because the passive static environmental illumination has low spatial frequency and cannot provide enough information for accurate geometry reconstruction. In this work, we propose ActiveNeRF, a 3D geometry reconstruction framework, which improves the geometry quality of NeRF by actively projecting patterns of high spatial frequency onto the scene using a projector which has a constant relative pose to the camera. We design a learnable active pattern rendering pipeline which jointly learns the scene geometry and the active pattern. We find that, by adding the active pattern and imposing its consistency across different views, our proposed method outperforms state of the art geometry reconstruction methods qualitatively and quantitatively in both simulation and real experiments.

- **Summary**: Point cloud completion aims to recover accurate global geometry and preserve fine-grained local details from partial point clouds. Conventional methods typically predict unseen points directly from 3D point cloud coordinates or use self-projected multi-view depth maps to ease this task. However, these gray-scale depth maps cannot reach multi-view consistency, consequently restricting the performance. In this paper, we introduce a GeoFormer that simultaneously enhances the global geometric structure of the points and improves the local details. Specifically, we design a CCM Feature Enhanced Point Generator to integrate image features from multi-view consistent canonical coordinate maps (CCMs) and align them with pure point features, thereby enhancing the global geometry feature. Additionally, we employ the Multi-scale Geometry-aware Upsampler module to progressively enhance local details. This is achieved through cross attention between the multi-scale features extracted from the partial input and the features derived from previously estimated points. Extensive experiments on the PCN, ShapeNet-55/34, and KITTI benchmarks demonstrate that our GeoFormer outperforms recent methods, achieving the state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Sparse view computed tomography (CT) reconstruction poses a challenging ill-posed inverse problem, necessitating effective regularization techniques. In this letter, we employ $L_p$-norm ($0<p<1$) regularization to induce sparsity and introduce inertial steps, leading to the development of the inertial $L_p$-norm half-quadratic splitting algorithm. We rigorously prove the convergence of this algorithm. Furthermore, we leverage deep learning to initialize the conjugate gradient method, resulting in a deep unrolling network with theoretical guarantees. Our extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm surpasses existing methods, particularly excelling in fewer scanned views and complex noise conditions.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel MV-DETR pipeline which is effective while efficient transformer based detection method. Given input RGBD data, we notice that there are super strong pretraining weights for RGB data while less effective works for depth related data. First and foremost , we argue that geometry and texture cues are both of vital importance while could be encoded separately. Secondly, we find that visual texture feature is relatively hard to extract compared with geometry feature in 3d space. Unfortunately, single RGBD dataset with thousands of data is not enough for training an discriminating filter for visual texture feature extraction. Last but certainly not the least, we designed a lightweight VG module consists of a visual textual encoder, a geometry encoder and a VG connector. Compared with previous state of the art works like V-DETR, gains from pretrained visual encoder could be seen. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 dataset shows the effectiveness of our method. It is worth mentioned that our method achieve 78\% AP which create new state of the art on ScanNetv2 benchmark.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable image-language capabilities, but their widespread use faces challenges in cost-effective training and adaptation. Existing approaches often necessitate expensive language model retraining and limited adaptability. Additionally, the current focus on zero-shot performance improvements offers insufficient guidance for task-specific tuning. We propose CROME, an efficient vision-language instruction tuning framework. It features a novel gated cross-modal adapter that effectively combines visual and textual representations prior to input into a frozen LLM. This lightweight adapter, trained with minimal parameters, enables efficient cross-modal understanding. Notably, CROME demonstrates superior zero-shot performance on standard visual question answering and instruction-following benchmarks. Moreover, it yields fine-tuning with exceptional parameter efficiency, competing with task-specific specialist state-of-the-art methods. CROME demonstrates the potential of pre-LM alignment for building scalable, adaptable, and parameter-efficient multimodal models.

- **Summary**: Although humans have the innate ability to imagine multiple possible actions from videos, it remains an extraordinary challenge for computers due to the intricate camera movements and montages. Most existing motion generation methods predominantly rely on manually collected motion datasets, usually tediously sourced from motion capture (Mocap) systems or Multi-View cameras, unavoidably resulting in a limited size that severely undermines their generalizability. Inspired by recent advance of diffusion models, we probe a simple and effective way to capture motions from videos and propose a novel Video-to-Motion-Generation framework (ViMo) which could leverage the immense trove of untapped video content to produce abundant and diverse 3D human motions. Distinct from prior work, our videos could be more causal, including complicated camera movements and occlusions. Striking experimental results demonstrate the proposed model could generate natural motions even for videos where rapid movements, varying perspectives, or frequent occlusions might exist. We also show this work could enable three important downstream applications, such as generating dancing motions according to arbitrary music and source video style. Extensive experimental results prove that our model offers an effective and scalable way to generate diversity and realistic motions. Code and demos will be public soon.

- **Summary**: Video temporal grounding is an emerging topic aiming to identify specific clips within videos. In addition to pre-trained video models, contemporary methods utilize pre-trained vision-language models (VLM) to capture detailed characteristics of diverse scenes and objects from video frames. However, as pre-trained on images, VLM may struggle to distinguish action-sensitive patterns from static objects, making it necessary to adapt them to specific data domains for effective feature representation over temporal grounding. We address two primary challenges to achieve this goal. Specifically, to mitigate high adaptation costs, we propose an efficient preliminary in-domain fine-tuning paradigm for feature adaptation, where downstream-adaptive features are learned through several pretext tasks. Furthermore, to integrate action-sensitive information into VLM, we introduce Action-Cue-Injected Temporal Prompt Learning (ActPrompt), which injects action cues into the image encoder of VLM for better discovering action-sensitive patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActPrompt is an off-the-shelf training framework that can be effectively applied to various SOTA methods, resulting in notable improvements. The complete code used in this study is provided in the supplementary materials.

- **Summary**: Recent years have seen an increasing interest in physical adversarial attacks, which aim to craft deployable patterns for deceiving deep neural networks, especially for person detectors. However, the adversarial patterns of existing patch-based attacks heavily suffer from the self-coupling issue, where a degradation, caused by physical transformations, in any small patch segment can result in a complete adversarial dysfunction, leading to poor robustness in the complex real world. Upon this observation, we introduce the Decoupled adversarial Patch (DePatch) attack to address the self-coupling issue of adversarial patches. Specifically, we divide the adversarial patch into block-wise segments, and reduce the inter-dependency among these segments through randomly erasing out some segments during the optimization. We further introduce a border shifting operation and a progressive decoupling strategy to improve the overall attack capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method over other physical adversarial attacks, especially in the real world.

- **Summary**: Existing EEW approaches often treat phase picking, location estimation, and magnitude estimation as separate tasks, lacking a unified framework. Additionally, most deep learning models in seismology rely on full three-component waveforms and are not suitable for real-time streaming data. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified seismic neural network called Fast Information Streaming Handler (FisH). FisH is designed to process real-time streaming seismic data and generate simultaneous results for phase picking, location estimation, and magnitude estimation in an end-to-end fashion. By integrating these tasks within a single model, FisH simplifies the overall process and leverages the nonlinear relationships between tasks for improved performance. The FisH model utilizes RetNet as its backbone, enabling parallel processing during training and recurrent handling during inference. This capability makes FisH suitable for real-time applications, reducing latency in EEW systems. Extensive experiments conducted on the STEAD benchmark dataset provide strong validation for the effectiveness of our proposed FisH model. The results demonstrate that FisH achieves impressive performance across multiple seismic event detection and characterization tasks. Specifically, it achieves an F1 score of 0.99/0.96. Also, FisH demonstrates precise earthquake location estimation, with location error of only 6.0km, a distance error of 2.6km, and a back-azimuth error of 19{\deg}. The model also exhibits accurate earthquake magnitude estimation, with a magnitude error of just 0.14. Additionally, FisH is capable of generating real-time estimations, providing location and magnitude estimations with a location error of 8.06km and a magnitude error of 0.18 within a mere 3 seconds after the P-wave arrives.

- **Summary**: The development of autonomous driving technology must be inseparable from pedestrian detection. Because of the fast speed of the vehicle, the accuracy and real-time performance of the pedestrian detection algorithm are very important. YOLO, as an efficient and simple one-stage target detection method, is often used for pedestrian detection in various environments. However, this series of detectors face some challenges, such as excessive computation and undesirable detection rate when facing occluded pedestrians. In this paper, we propose an improved lightweight YOLOv5 model to deal with these problems. This model can achieve better pedestrian detection accuracy with fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs), especially for occluded targets. In order to achieve the above goals, we made improvements based on the YOLOv5 model framework and introduced Ghost module and SE block. Furthermore, we designed a local feature fusion module (FFM) to deal with occlusion in pedestrian detection. To verify the validity of our method, two datasets, Citypersons and CUHK Occlusion, were selected for the experiment. The experimental results show that, compared with the original yolov5s model, the average precision (AP) of our method is significantly improved, while the number of parameters is reduced by 27.9% and FLOPs are reduced by 19.0%.

- **Summary**: The face swapping technique based on deepfake methods poses significant social risks to personal identity security. While numerous deepfake detection methods have been proposed as countermeasures against malicious face swapping, they can only output binary labels (Fake/Real) for distinguishing fake content without reliable and traceable evidence. To achieve visual forensics and target face attribution, we propose a novel task named face retracing, which considers retracing the original target face from the given fake one via inverse mapping. Toward this goal, we propose an IDRetracor that can retrace arbitrary original target identities from fake faces generated by multiple face swapping methods. Specifically, we first adopt a mapping resolver to perceive the possible solution space of the original target face for the inverse mappings. Then, we propose mapping-aware convolutions to retrace the original target face from the fake one. Such convolutions contain multiple kernels that can be combined under the control of the mapping resolver to tackle different face swapping mappings dynamically. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the IDRetracor exhibits promising retracing performance from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives.

- **Summary**: Object detection is an important part in the field of computer vision, and the effect of object detection is directly determined by the regression accuracy of the prediction box. As the key to model training, IoU (Intersection over Union) greatly shows the difference between the current prediction box and the Ground Truth box. Subsequent researchers have continuously added more considerations to IoU, such as center distance, aspect ratio, and so on. However, there is an upper limit to just refining the geometric differences; And there is a potential connection between the new consideration index and the IoU itself, and the direct addition or subtraction between the two may lead to the problem of "over-consideration". Based on this, we propose a new IoU loss function, called Unified-IoU (UIoU), which is more concerned with the weight assignment between different quality prediction boxes. Specifically, the loss function dynamically shifts the model's attention from low-quality prediction boxes to high-quality prediction boxes in a novel way to enhance the model's detection performance on high-precision or intensive datasets and achieve a balance in training speed. Our proposed method achieves better performance on multiple datasets, especially at a high IoU threshold, UIoU has a more significant improvement effect compared with other improved IoU losses. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/lxj-drifter/UIOU_files.

- **Summary**: Aiming to generalize the label knowledge from a source domain with continuous outputs to an unlabeled target domain, Domain Adaptation Regression (DAR) is developed for complex practical learning problems. However, due to the continuity problem in regression, existing conditional distribution alignment theory and methods with discrete prior, which are proven to be effective in classification settings, are no longer applicable. In this work, focusing on the feasibility problems in DAR, we establish the sufficiency theory for the regression model, which shows the generalization error can be sufficiently dominated by the cross-domain conditional discrepancy. Further, to characterize conditional discrepancy with continuous conditioning variable, a novel Conditional Operator Discrepancy (COD) is proposed, which admits the metric property on conditional distributions via the kernel embedding theory. Finally, to minimize the discrepancy, a COD-based conditional invariant representation learning model is proposed, and the reformulation is derived to show that reasonable modifications on moment statistics can further improve the discriminability of the adaptation model. Extensive experiments on standard DAR datasets verify the validity of theoretical results and the superiority over SOTA DAR methods.

- **Summary**: The recent monkeypox outbreak has raised significant public health concerns due to its rapid spread across multiple countries. Monkeypox can be difficult to distinguish from chickenpox and measles in the early stages because the symptoms of all three diseases are similar. Modern deep learning algorithms can be used to identify diseases, including COVID-19, by analyzing images of the affected areas. In this study, we introduce a lightweight model that merges two pre-trained architectures, EfficientNetV2B3 and ResNet151V2, to classify human monkeypox disease. We have also incorporated the squeeze-and-excitation attention network module to focus on the important parts of the feature maps for classifying the monkeypox images. This attention module provides channels and spatial attention to highlight significant areas within feature maps. We evaluated the effectiveness of our model by extensively testing it on a publicly available Monkeypox Skin Lesions Dataset using a four-fold cross-validation approach. The evaluation metrics of our model were compared with the existing others. Our model achieves a mean validation accuracy of 96.52%, with precision, recall, and F1-score values of 96.58%, 96.52%, and 96.51%, respectively.

- **Summary**: Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task in Earth observation. While most change detection methods detect all changes, there is a growing need for specialized methods targeting specific changes relevant to particular applications while discarding the other changes. For instance, urban management might prioritize detecting the disappearance of buildings due to natural disasters or other reasons. Furthermore, while most supervised change detection methods require large-scale training datasets, in many applications only one or two training examples might be available instead of large datasets. Addressing such needs, we propose a focused CD approach using the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a versatile vision foundation model. Our method leverages a binary mask of the object of interest in pre-change images to detect their disappearance in post-change images. By using SAM's robust segmentation capabilities, we create prompts from the pre-change mask, use those prompts to segment the post-change image, and identify missing objects. This unsupervised approach demonstrated for building disappearance detection, is adaptable to various domains requiring specialized CD. Our contributions include defining a novel CD problem, proposing a method using SAM, and demonstrating its effectiveness. The proposed method also has benefits related to privacy preservation.

- **Summary**: Stable Diffusion Models (SDMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in image synthesis. However, their broad application is impeded by their large model sizes and intensive computational requirements, which typically require expensive cloud servers for deployment. On the flip side, while there are many compact models tailored for edge devices that can reduce these demands, they often compromise on semantic integrity and visual quality when compared to full-sized SDMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hybrid SD, an innovative, training-free SDMs inference framework designed for edge-cloud collaborative inference. Hybrid SD distributes the early steps of the diffusion process to the large models deployed on cloud servers, enhancing semantic planning. Furthermore, small efficient models deployed on edge devices can be integrated for refining visual details in the later stages. Acknowledging the diversity of edge devices with differing computational and storage capacities, we employ structural pruning to the SDMs U-Net and train a lightweight VAE. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our compressed models achieve state-of-the-art parameter efficiency (225.8M) on edge devices with competitive image quality. Additionally, Hybrid SD reduces the cloud cost by 66% with edge-cloud collaborative inference.

- **Summary**: 3D dense captioning is a task involving the localization of objects and the generation of descriptions for each object in a 3D scene. Recent approaches have attempted to incorporate contextual information by modeling relationships with object pairs or aggregating the nearest neighbor features of an object. However, the contextual information constructed in these scenarios is limited in two aspects: first, objects have multiple positional relationships that exist across the entire global scene, not only near the object itself. Second, it faces with contradicting objectives--where localization and attribute descriptions are generated better with tight localization, while descriptions involving global positional relations are generated better with contextualized features of the global scene. To overcome this challenge, we introduce BiCA, a transformer encoder-decoder pipeline that engages in 3D dense captioning for each object with Bi-directional Contextual Attention. Leveraging parallelly decoded instance queries for objects and context queries for non-object contexts, BiCA generates object-aware contexts, where the contexts relevant to each object is summarized, and context-aware objects, where the objects relevant to the summarized object-aware contexts are aggregated. This extension relieves previous methods from the contradicting objectives, enhancing both localization performance and enabling the aggregation of contextual features throughout the global scene; thus improving caption generation performance simultaneously. Extensive experiments on two of the most widely-used 3D dense captioning datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a significant improvement over prior methods.

- **Summary**: Diffractive neural networks hold great promise for applications requiring intensive computational processing. Considerable attention has focused on diffractive networks for either spatially coherent or spatially incoherent illumination. Here we illustrate that, as opposed to imaging systems, in diffractive networks the degree of spatial coherence has a dramatic effect. In particular, we show that when the spatial coherence length on the object is comparable to the minimal feature size preserved by the optical system, neither the incoherent nor the coherent extremes serve as acceptable approximations. Importantly, this situation is inherent to many settings involving active illumination, including reflected light microscopy, autonomous vehicles and smartphones. Following this observation, we propose a general framework for training diffractive networks for any specified degree of spatial and temporal coherence, supporting all types of linear and nonlinear layers. Using our method, we numerically optimize networks for image classification, and thoroughly investigate their performance dependence on the illumination coherence properties. We further introduce the concept of coherence-blind networks, which have enhanced resilience to changes in illumination conditions. Our findings serve as a steppingstone toward adopting all-optical neural networks in real-world applications, leveraging nothing but natural light.

- **Summary**: Image demosaicing and denoising play a critical role in the raw imaging pipeline. These processes have often been treated as independent, without considering their interactions. Indeed, most classic denoising methods handle noisy RGB images, not raw images. Conversely, most demosaicing methods address the demosaicing of noise free images. The real problem is to jointly denoise and demosaic noisy raw images. But the question of how to proceed is still not yet clarified. In this paper, we carry-out extensive experiments and a mathematical analysis to tackle this problem by low complexity algorithms. Indeed, both problems have been only addressed jointly by end-to-end heavy weight convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are currently incompatible with low power portable imaging devices and remain by nature domain (or device) dependent. Our study leads us to conclude that, with moderate noise, demosaicing should be applied first, followed by denoising. This requires a simple adaptation of classic denoising algorithms to demosaiced noise, which we justify and specify. Although our main conclusion is ``demosaic first, then denoise'', we also discover that for high noise, there is a moderate PSNR gain by a more complex strategy: partial CFA denoising followed by demosaicing, and by a second denoising on the RGB image. These surprising results are obtained by a black-box optimization of the pipeline, which could be applied to any other pipeline. We validate our results on simulated and real noisy CFA images obtained from several benchmarks.

- **Summary**: In this work, we survey recent studies on masked image modeling (MIM), an approach that emerged as a powerful self-supervised learning technique in computer vision. The MIM task involves masking some information, e.g. pixels, patches, or even latent representations, and training a model, usually an autoencoder, to predicting the missing information by using the context available in the visible part of the input. We identify and formalize two categories of approaches on how to implement MIM as a pretext task, one based on reconstruction and one based on contrastive learning. Then, we construct a taxonomy and review the most prominent papers in recent years. We complement the manually constructed taxonomy with a dendrogram obtained by applying a hierarchical clustering algorithm. We further identify relevant clusters via manually inspecting the resulting dendrogram. Our review also includes datasets that are commonly used in MIM research. We aggregate the performance results of various masked image modeling methods on the most popular datasets, to facilitate the comparison of competing methods. Finally, we identify research gaps and propose several interesting directions of future work.

- **Summary**: Inspired by Geoffrey Hinton emphasis on generative modeling, To recognize shapes, first learn to generate them, we explore the use of 3D diffusion models for object classification. Leveraging the density estimates from these models, our approach, the Diffusion Classifier for 3D Objects (DC3DO), enables zero-shot classification of 3D shapes without additional training. On average, our method achieves a 12.5 percent improvement compared to its multiview counterparts, demonstrating superior multimodal reasoning over discriminative approaches. DC3DO employs a class-conditional diffusion model trained on ShapeNet, and we run inferences on point clouds of chairs and cars. This work highlights the potential of generative models in 3D object classification.

- **Summary**: The ability to distill object-centric abstractions from intricate visual scenes underpins human-level generalization. Despite the significant progress in object-centric learning methods, learning object-centric representations in the 3D physical world remains a crucial challenge. In this work, we propose SlotLifter, a novel object-centric radiance model addressing scene reconstruction and decomposition jointly via slot-guided feature lifting. Such a design unites object-centric learning representations and image-based rendering methods, offering state-of-the-art performance in scene decomposition and novel-view synthesis on four challenging synthetic and four complex real-world datasets, outperforming existing 3D object-centric learning methods by a large margin. Through extensive ablative studies, we showcase the efficacy of designs in SlotLifter, revealing key insights for potential future directions.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a scene-level inverse rendering framework that uses multi-view images to decompose the scene into geometry, SVBRDF, and 3D spatially-varying lighting. While multi-view images have been widely used for object-level inverse rendering, scene-level inverse rendering has primarily been studied using single-view images due to the lack of a dataset containing high dynamic range multi-view images with ground-truth geometry, material, and spatially-varying lighting. To improve the quality of scene-level inverse rendering, a novel framework called Multi-view Attention Inverse Rendering (MAIR) was recently introduced. MAIR performs scene-level multi-view inverse rendering by expanding the OpenRooms dataset, designing efficient pipelines to handle multi-view images, and splitting spatially-varying lighting. Although MAIR showed impressive results, its lighting representation is fixed to spherical Gaussians, which limits its ability to render images realistically. Consequently, MAIR cannot be directly used in applications such as material editing. Moreover, its multi-view aggregation networks have difficulties extracting rich features because they only focus on the mean and variance between multi-view features. In this paper, we propose its extended version, called MAIR++. MAIR++ addresses the aforementioned limitations by introducing an implicit lighting representation that accurately captures the lighting conditions of an image while facilitating realistic rendering. Furthermore, we design a directional attention-based multi-view aggregation network to infer more intricate relationships between views. Experimental results show that MAIR++ not only achieves better performance than MAIR and single-view-based methods, but also displays robust performance on unseen real-world scenes.

- **Summary**: All-in-one image restoration tasks are becoming increasingly important, especially for ultra-high-definition (UHD) images. Existing all-in-one UHD image restoration methods usually boost the model's performance by introducing prompt or customized dynamized networks for different degradation types. For the inference stage, it might be friendly, but in the training stage, since the model encounters multiple degraded images of different quality in an epoch, these cluttered learning objectives might be information pollution for the model. To address this problem, we propose a new training paradigm for general image restoration models, which we name \textbf{Review Learning}, which enables image restoration models to be capable enough to handle multiple types of degradation without prior knowledge and prompts. This approach begins with sequential training of an image restoration model on several degraded datasets, combined with a review mechanism that enhances the image restoration model's memory for several previous classes of degraded datasets. In addition, we design a lightweight all-purpose image restoration network that can efficiently reason about degraded images with 4K ($3840 \times 2160$) resolution on a single consumer-grade GPU.

- **Summary**: Accurate classification of blood cells plays a vital role in hematological analysis as it aids physicians in diagnosing various medical conditions. In this study, we present a novel approach for classifying blood cell images known as BC-SAM. BC-SAM leverages the large-scale foundation model of Segment Anything Model (SAM) and incorporates a fine-tuning technique using LoRA, allowing it to extract general image embeddings from blood cell images. To enhance the applicability of BC-SAM across different blood cell image datasets, we introduce an unsupervised cross-domain autoencoder that focuses on learning intrinsic features while suppressing artifacts in the images. To assess the performance of BC-SAM, we employ four widely used machine learning classifiers (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, and XGBoost) to construct blood cell classification models and compare them against existing state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results conducted on two publicly available blood cell datasets (Matek-19 and Acevedo-20) demonstrate that our proposed BC-SAM achieves a new state-of-the-art result, surpassing the baseline methods with a significant improvement.

- **Summary**: Biomedical imaging and RNA sequencing with single-cell resolution improves our understanding of white blood cell diseases like leukemia. By combining morphological and transcriptomic data, we can gain insights into cellular functions and trajectoriess involved in blood cell differentiation. However, existing methodologies struggle with integrating morphological and transcriptomic data, leaving a significant research gap in comprehensively understanding the dynamics of cell differentiation. Here, we introduce an unsupervised method that explores and reconstructs these two modalities and uncovers the relationship between different subtypes of white blood cells from human peripheral blood smears in terms of morphology and their corresponding transcriptome. Our method is based on a beta-variational autoencoder (\beta-VAE) with a customized loss function, incorporating a R-CNN architecture to distinguish single-cell from background and to minimize any interference from artifacts. This implementation of \beta-VAE shows good reconstruction capability along with continuous latent embeddings, while maintaining clear differentiation between single-cell classes. Our novel approach is especially helpful to uncover the correlation of two latent features in complex biological processes such as formation of granules in the cell (granulopoiesis) with gene expression patterns. It thus provides a unique tool to improve the understanding of white blood cell maturation for biomedicine and diagnostics.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as general purpose tools for addressing a variety of complex computer vision problems. Such models have been shown to be highly capable, but, at the same time, also lacking some basic visual understanding skills. In this paper, we set out to understand the limitations of SoTA VLMs on fundamental visual tasks: object classification, understanding spatial arrangement, and ability to delineate individual object instances (through counting), by constructing a series of tests that probe which components of design, specifically, maybe lacking. Importantly, we go significantly beyond the current benchmarks, that simply measure final performance of VLM, by also comparing and contrasting it to performance of probes trained directly on features obtained from visual encoder (image embeddings), as well as intermediate vision-language projection used to bridge image-encoder and LLM-decoder ouput in many SoTA models (e.g., LLaVA, BLIP, InstructBLIP). In doing so, we uncover nascent shortcomings in VLMs response and make a number of important observations which could help train and develop more effective VLM models in future.

- **Summary**: Visual Dialog (VD) is a task where an agent answers a series of image-related questions based on a multi-round dialog history. However, previous VD methods often treat the entire dialog history as a simple text input, disregarding the inherent conversational information flows at the round level. In this paper, we introduce Multi-round Dialogue State Tracking model (MDST), a framework that addresses this limitation by leveraging the dialogue state learned from dialog history to answer questions. MDST captures each round of dialog history, constructing internal dialogue state representations defined as 2-tuples of vision-language representations. These representations effectively ground the current question, enabling the generation of accurate answers. Experimental results on the VisDial v1.0 dataset demonstrate that MDST achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in generative setting. Furthermore, through a series of human studies, we validate the effectiveness of MDST in generating long, consistent, and human-like answers while consistently answering a series of questions correctly.

- **Summary**: Personalized text-to-image generation has gained significant attention for its capability to generate high-fidelity portraits of specific identities conditioned on user-defined prompts. Existing methods typically involve test-time fine-tuning or instead incorporating an additional pre-trained branch. However, these approaches struggle to simultaneously address the demands of efficiency, identity fidelity, and preserving the model's original generative capabilities. In this paper, we propose DiffLoRA, a novel approach that leverages diffusion models as a hypernetwork to predict personalized low-rank adaptation (LoRA) weights based on the reference images. By integrating these LoRA weights into the text-to-image model, DiffLoRA achieves personalization during inference without further training. Additionally, we propose an identity-oriented LoRA weight construction pipeline to facilitate the training of DiffLoRA. By utilizing the dataset produced by this pipeline, our DiffLoRA consistently generates high-performance and accurate LoRA weights. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving both time efficiency and maintaining identity fidelity throughout the personalization process.

- **Summary**: With recent generative models facilitating photo-realistic image synthesis, the proliferation of synthetic images has also engendered certain negative impacts on social platforms, thereby raising an urgent imperative to develop effective detectors. Current synthetic image detection (SID) pipelines are primarily dedicated to crafting universal artifact features, accompanied by an oversight about SID training paradigm. In this paper, we re-examine the SID problem and identify two prevalent biases in current training paradigms, i.e., weakened artifact features and overfitted artifact features. Meanwhile, we discover that the imaging mechanism of synthetic images contributes to heightened local correlations among pixels, suggesting that detectors should be equipped with local awareness. In this light, we propose SAFE, a lightweight and effective detector with three simple image transformations. Firstly, for weakened artifact features, we substitute the down-sampling operator with the crop operator in image pre-processing to help circumvent artifact distortion. Secondly, for overfitted artifact features, we include ColorJitter and RandomRotation as additional data augmentations, to help alleviate irrelevant biases from color discrepancies and semantic differences in limited training samples. Thirdly, for local awareness, we propose a patch-based random masking strategy tailored for SID, forcing the detector to focus on local regions at training. Comparative experiments are conducted on an open-world dataset, comprising synthetic images generated by 26 distinct generative models. Our pipeline achieves a new state-of-the-art performance, with remarkable improvements of 4.5% in accuracy and 2.9% in average precision against existing methods.

- **Summary**: Current out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods typically assume balanced in-distribution (ID) data, while most real-world data follow a long-tailed distribution. Previous approaches to long-tailed OOD detection often involve balancing the ID data by reducing the semantics of head classes. However, this reduction can severely affect the classification accuracy of ID data. The main challenge of this task lies in the severe lack of features for tail classes, leading to confusion with OOD data. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel Prioritizing Attention to Tail (PATT) method using augmentation instead of reduction. Our main intuition involves using a mixture of von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions to model the ID data and a temperature scaling module to boost the confidence of ID data. This enables us to generate infinite contrastive pairs, implicitly enhancing the semantics of ID classes while promoting differentiation between ID and OOD data. To further strengthen the detection of OOD data without compromising the classification performance of ID data, we propose feature calibration during the inference phase. By extracting an attention weight from the training set that prioritizes the tail classes and reduces the confidence in OOD data, we improve the OOD detection capability. Extensive experiments verified that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Recent works utilize CLIP to perform the challenging unsupervised semantic segmentation task where only images without annotations are available. However, we observe that when adopting CLIP to such a pixel-level understanding task, unexpected bias (including class-preference bias and space-preference bias) occurs. Previous works don't explicitly model the bias, which largely constrains the segmentation performance. In this paper, we propose to explicitly model and rectify the bias existing in CLIP to facilitate the unsupervised semantic segmentation task. Specifically, we design a learnable ''Reference'' prompt to encode class-preference bias and a projection of the positional embedding in vision transformer to encode space-preference bias respectively. To avoid interference, two kinds of biases are firstly independently encoded into the Reference feature and the positional feature. Via a matrix multiplication between two features, a bias logit map is generated to explicitly represent two kinds of biases. Then we rectify the logits of CLIP via a simple element-wise subtraction. To make the rectified results smoother and more contextual, we design a mask decoder which takes the feature of CLIP and rectified logits as input and outputs a rectified segmentation mask with the help of Gumbel-Softmax operation. To make the bias modeling and rectification process meaningful and effective, a contrastive loss based on masked visual features and the text features of different classes is imposed. To further improve the segmentation, we distill the knowledge from the rectified CLIP to the advanced segmentation architecture via minimizing our designed mask-guided, feature-guided and text-guided loss terms. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that ReCLIP++ performs favorably against previous SOTAs. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/dogehhh/ReCLIP.

- **Summary**: Existing methods on audio-visual deepfake detection mainly focus on high-level features for modeling inconsistencies between audio and visual data. As a result, these approaches usually overlook finer audio-visual artifacts, which are inherent to deepfakes. Herein, we propose the introduction of fine-grained mechanisms for detecting subtle artifacts in both spatial and temporal domains. First, we introduce a local audio-visual model capable of capturing small spatial regions that are prone to inconsistencies with audio. For that purpose, a fine-grained mechanism based on a spatially-local distance coupled with an attention module is adopted. Second, we introduce a temporally-local pseudo-fake augmentation to include samples incorporating subtle temporal inconsistencies in our training set. Experiments on the DFDC and the FakeAVCeleb datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of generalization as compared to the state-of-the-art under both in-dataset and cross-dataset settings.

- **Summary**: Otoscopy is a diagnostic procedure to examine the ear canal and eardrum using an otoscope. It identifies conditions like infections, foreign bodies, ear drum perforations and ear abnormalities. We propose a novel resource efficient deep learning and transformer based framework, Sumotosima (Summarizer for otoscopic images), an end-to-end pipeline for classification followed by summarization. Our framework works on combination of triplet and cross-entropy losses. Additionally, we use Knowledge Enhanced Multimodal BART whose input is fused textual and image embedding. The objective is to provide summaries that are well-suited for patients, ensuring clarity and efficiency in understanding otoscopic images. Given the lack of existing datasets, we have curated our own OCASD (Otoscopic Classification And Summary Dataset), which includes 500 images with 5 unique categories annotated with their class and summaries by Otolaryngologists. Sumotosima achieved a result of 98.03%, which is 7.00%, 3.10%, 3.01% higher than K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines, respectively, in classification tasks. For summarization, Sumotosima outperformed GPT-4o and LLaVA by 88.53% and 107.57% in ROUGE scores, respectively. We have made our code and dataset publicly available at https://github.com/anas2908/Sumotosima

- **Summary**: Nature disasters play a key role in shaping human-urban infrastructure interactions. Effective and efficient response to natural disasters is essential for building resilience and a sustainable urban environment. Two types of information are usually the most necessary and difficult to gather in disaster response. The first information is about disaster damage perception, which shows how badly people think that urban infrastructure has been damaged. The second information is geolocation awareness, which means how people whereabouts are made available. In this paper, we proposed a novel disaster mapping framework, namely CVDisaster, aiming at simultaneously addressing geolocalization and damage perception estimation using cross-view Street-View Imagery (SVI) and Very High-Resolution satellite imagery. CVDisaster consists of two cross-view models, where CVDisaster-Geoloc refers to a cross-view geolocalization model based on a contrastive learning objective with a Siamese ConvNeXt image encoder, and CVDisaster-Est is a cross-view classification model based on a Couple Global Context Vision Transformer (CGCViT). Taking Hurricane IAN as a case study, we evaluate the CVDisaster framework by creating a novel cross-view dataset (CVIAN) and conducting extensive experiments. As a result, we show that CVDisaster can achieve highly competitive performance (over 80% for geolocalization and 75% for damage perception estimation) with even limited fine-tuning efforts, which largely motivates future cross-view models and applications within a broader GeoAI research community.

- **Summary**: The rapid evolution of deep learning and its integration with autonomous driving systems have led to substantial advancements in 3D perception using multimodal sensors. Notably, radar sensors show greater robustness compared to cameras and lidar under adverse weather and varying illumination conditions. This study delves into the often-overlooked yet crucial issue of domain shift in 4D radar-based object detection, examining how varying environmental conditions, such as different weather patterns and road types, impact 3D object detection performance. Our findings highlight distinct domain shifts across various weather scenarios, revealing unique dataset sensitivities that underscore the critical role of radar point cloud generation. Additionally, we demonstrate that transitioning between different road types, especially from highways to urban settings, introduces notable domain shifts, emphasizing the necessity for diverse data collection across varied road environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of domain shift effects on 4D radar-based object detection. We believe this empirical study contributes to understanding the complex nature of domain shifts in radar data and suggests paths forward for data collection strategy in the face of environmental variability.

- **Summary**: Learning intrinsic bias from limited data has been considered the main reason for the failure of deepfake detection with generalizability. Apart from the discovered content and specific-forgery bias, we reveal a novel spatial bias, where detectors inertly anticipate observing structural forgery clues appearing at the image center, also can lead to the poor generalization of existing methods. We present ED$^4$, a simple and effective strategy, to address aforementioned biases explicitly at the data level in a unified framework rather than implicit disentanglement via network design. In particular, we develop ClockMix to produce facial structure preserved mixtures with arbitrary samples, which allows the detector to learn from an exponentially extended data distribution with much more diverse identities, backgrounds, local manipulation traces, and the co-occurrence of multiple forgery artifacts. We further propose the Adversarial Spatial Consistency Module (AdvSCM) to prevent extracting features with spatial bias, which adversarially generates spatial-inconsistent images and constrains their extracted feature to be consistent. As a model-agnostic debiasing strategy, ED$^4$ is plug-and-play: it can be integrated with various deepfake detectors to obtain significant benefits. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority over existing deepfake detection approaches.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in vision-language foundational models have enabled development of systems that can perform visual understanding and reasoning tasks. However, it is unclear if these models are robust to distribution shifts, and how their performance and generalization capabilities vary under changes in data distribution. In this project we strive to answer the question "Are vision-language foundational models robust to distribution shifts like human perception?" Specifically, we consider a diverse range of vision-language models and compare how the performance of these systems is affected by corruption based distribution shifts (such as \textit{motion blur, fog, snow, gaussian noise}) commonly found in practical real-world scenarios. We analyse the generalization capabilities qualitatively and quantitatively on zero-shot image classification task under aforementioned distribution shifts. Our code will be avaible at \url{https://github.com/shivam-chandhok/CPSC-540-Project}

- **Summary**: Retinal fundus imaging plays an essential role in diagnosing various stages of diabetic retinopathy, where exudates are critical markers of early disease onset. Prompt detection of these exudates is pivotal for enabling optometrists to arrest or significantly decelerate the disease progression. This paper introduces a novel, lightweight convolutional neural network architecture tailored for automated exudate detection, designed to identify these markers efficiently and accurately. To address the challenge of limited training data, we have incorporated domain-specific data augmentations to enhance the model's generalizability. Furthermore, we applied a suite of regularization techniques within our custom architecture to boost diagnostic accuracy while optimizing computational efficiency. Remarkably, this streamlined model contains only 4.73 million parameters a reduction of nearly 60% compared to the standard ResNet-18 model, which has 11.69 million parameters. Despite its reduced complexity, our model achieves an impressive F1 score of 90%, demonstrating its efficacy in the early detection of diabetic retinopathy through fundus imaging.

- **Summary**: Visual neural decoding refers to the process of extracting and interpreting original visual experiences from human brain activity. Recent advances in metric learning-based EEG visual decoding methods have delivered promising results and demonstrated the feasibility of decoding novel visual categories from brain activity. However, methods that directly map EEG features to the CLIP embedding space may introduce mapping bias and cause semantic inconsistency among features, thereby degrading alignment and impairing decoding performance. To further explore the semantic consistency between visual and neural signals. In this work, we construct a joint semantic space and propose a Visual-EEG Semantic Decouple Framework that explicitly extracts the semantic-related features of these two modalities to facilitate optimal alignment. Specifically, a cross-modal information decoupling module is introduced to guide the extraction of semantic-related information from modalities. Then, by quantifying the mutual information between visual image and EEG features, we observe a strong positive correlation between the decoding performance and the magnitude of mutual information. Furthermore, inspired by the mechanisms of visual object understanding from neuroscience, we propose an intra-class geometric consistency approach during the alignment process. This strategy maps visual samples within the same class to consistent neural patterns, which further enhances the robustness and the performance of EEG visual decoding. Experiments on a large Image-EEG dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot neural decoding tasks.

- **Summary**: Token compression expedites the training and inference of Vision Transformers (ViTs) by reducing the number of the redundant tokens, e.g., pruning inattentive tokens or merging similar tokens. However, when applied to downstream tasks, these approaches suffer from significant performance drop when the compression degrees are mismatched between training and inference stages, which limits the application of token compression on off-the-shelf trained models. In this paper, we propose a model arithmetic framework to decouple the compression degrees between the two stages. In advance, we additionally perform a fast parameter-efficient self-distillation stage on the pre-trained models to obtain a small plugin, called Token Compensator (ToCom), which describes the gap between models across different compression degrees. During inference, ToCom can be directly inserted into any downstream off-the-shelf models with any mismatched training and inference compression degrees to acquire universal performance improvements without further training. Experiments on over 20 downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. On CIFAR100, fine-grained visual classification, and VTAB-1k, ToCom can yield up to a maximum improvement of 2.3%, 1.5%, and 2.0% in the average performance of DeiT-B, respectively.

- **Summary**: With the ever-growing variety of object detection approaches, this study explores a series of experiments that combine reinforcement learning (RL)-based visual attention methods with saliency ranking techniques to investigate transparent and sustainable solutions. By integrating saliency ranking for initial bounding box prediction and subsequently applying RL techniques to refine these predictions through a finite set of actions over multiple time steps, this study aims to enhance RL object detection accuracy. Presented as a series of experiments, this research investigates the use of various image feature extraction methods and explores diverse Deep Q-Network (DQN) architectural variations for deep reinforcement learning-based localisation agent training. Additionally, we focus on optimising the detection pipeline at every step by prioritising lightweight and faster models, while also incorporating the capability to classify detected objects, a feature absent in previous RL approaches. We show that by evaluating the performance of these trained agents using the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset, faster and more optimised models were developed. Notably, the best mean Average Precision (mAP) achieved in this study was 51.4, surpassing benchmarks set by RL-based single object detectors in the literature.

- **Summary**: The task of recognizing the age-separated faces of an individual, Age-Invariant Face Recognition (AIFR), has received considerable research efforts in Europe, America, and Asia, compared to Africa. Thus, AIFR research efforts have often under-represented/misrepresented the African ethnicity with non-indigenous Africans. This work developed an AIFR system for indigenous African faces to reduce the misrepresentation of African ethnicity in facial image analysis research. We adopted a pre-trained deep learning model (VGGFace) for AIFR on a dataset of 5,000 indigenous African faces (FAGE\_v2) collected for this study. FAGE\_v2 was curated via Internet image searches of 500 individuals evenly distributed across 10 African countries. VGGFace was trained on FAGE\_v2 to obtain the best accuracy of 81.80\%. We also performed experiments on an African-American subset of the CACD dataset and obtained the best accuracy of 91.5\%. The results show a significant difference in the recognition accuracies of indigenous versus non-indigenous Africans.

- **Summary**: This project proposes a new method that uses fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to integrate ResNet-50 self-supervised and RepVGG supervised learning. The source image dataset HWOBC oracle is taken as input, the target image is selected, and finally the most similar image is output in turn without any manual intervention. The same feature encoding method is not used for images of different modalities. Before the model training, the image data is preprocessed, and the image is enhanced by random rotation processing, self-square graph equalization theory algorithm, and gamma transform, which effectively enhances the key feature learning. Finally, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is used to combine the results of supervised training and unsupervised training, which can better solve the "most similar" problem that is difficult to quantify. At present, there are many unknown oracle-bone inscriptions waiting for us to crack. Contacting with the glyphs can provide new ideas for cracking.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel approach for structure-preserving planar simplification of indoor scene point clouds for both simulated and real-world environments. Initially, the scene point cloud undergoes preprocessing steps, including noise reduction and Manhattan world alignment, to ensure robustness and coherence in subsequent analyses. We segment each captured scene into structured (walls-ceiling-floor) and non-structured (indoor objects) scenes. Leveraging a RANSAC algorithm, we extract primitive planes from the input point cloud, facilitating the segmentation and simplification of the structured scene. The best-fitting wall meshes are then generated from the primitives, followed by adjacent mesh merging with the vertex-translation algorithm which preserves the mesh layout. To accurately represent ceilings and floors, we employ the mesh clipping algorithm which clips the ceiling and floor meshes with respect to wall normals. In the case of indoor scenes, we apply a surface reconstruction technique to enhance the fidelity. This paper focuses on the intricate steps of the proposed scene simplification methodology, addressing complex scenarios such as multi-story and slanted walls and ceilings. We also conduct qualitative and quantitative performance comparisons against popular surface reconstruction, shape approximation, and floorplan generation approaches.

- **Summary**: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has achieved significant success in the realm of self-supervised learning (SSL) for visual recognition. The image encoder pre-trained through MIM, involving the masking and subsequent reconstruction of input images, attains state-of-the-art performance in various downstream vision tasks. However, most existing works focus on improving the performance of MIM.In this work, we take a different angle by studying the pre-training data privacy of MIM. Specifically, we propose the first membership inference attack against image encoders pre-trained by MIM, which aims to determine whether an image is part of the MIM pre-training dataset. The key design is to simulate the pre-training paradigm of MIM, i.e., image masking and subsequent reconstruction, and then obtain reconstruction errors. These reconstruction errors can serve as membership signals for achieving attack goals, as the encoder is more capable of reconstructing the input image in its training set with lower errors. Extensive evaluations are conducted on three model architectures and three benchmark datasets. Empirical results show that our attack outperforms baseline methods. Additionally, we undertake intricate ablation studies to analyze multiple factors that could influence the performance of the attack.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the problem of inverse rendering from photometric images. Existing approaches for this problem suffer from the effects of self-shadows, inter-reflections, and lack of constraints on the surface reflectance, leading to inaccurate decomposition of reflectance and illumination due to the ill-posed nature of inverse rendering. In this work, we propose a new method for neural inverse rendering. Our method jointly optimizes the light source position to account for the self-shadows in images, and computes indirect illumination using a differentiable rendering layer and an importance sampling strategy. To enhance surface reflectance decomposition, we introduce a new regularization by distilling DINO features to foster accurate and consistent material decomposition. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in reflectance decomposition.

- **Summary**: The integration of data from diverse sensor modalities (e.g., camera and LiDAR) constitutes a prevalent methodology within the ambit of autonomous driving scenarios. Recent advancements in efficient point cloud transformers have underscored the efficacy of integrating information in sparse formats. When it comes to fusion, since image patches are dense in pixel space with ambiguous depth, it necessitates additional design considerations for effective fusion. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive exploration of design choices for Transformer-based sparse cameraLiDAR fusion. This investigation encompasses strategies for image-to-3D and LiDAR-to-2D mapping, attention neighbor grouping, single modal tokenizer, and micro-structure of Transformer. By amalgamating the most effective principles uncovered through our investigation, we introduce FlatFusion, a carefully designed framework for sparse camera-LiDAR fusion. Notably, FlatFusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art sparse Transformer-based methods, including UniTR, CMT, and SparseFusion, achieving 73.7 NDS on the nuScenes validation set with 10.1 FPS with PyTorch.

- **Summary**: Gait recognition has attracted increasing attention from academia and industry as a human recognition technology from a distance in non-intrusive ways without requiring cooperation. Although advanced methods have achieved impressive success in lab scenarios, most of them perform poorly in the wild. Recently, some Convolution Neural Networks (ConvNets) based methods have been proposed to address the issue of gait recognition in the wild. However, the temporal receptive field obtained by convolution operations is limited for long gait sequences. If directly replacing convolution blocks with visual transformer blocks, the model may not enhance a local temporal receptive field, which is important for covering a complete gait cycle. To address this issue, we design a Global-Local Temporal Receptive Field Network (GLGait). GLGait employs a Global-Local Temporal Module (GLTM) to establish a global-local temporal receptive field, which mainly consists of a Pseudo Global Temporal Self-Attention (PGTA) and a temporal convolution operation. Specifically, PGTA is used to obtain a pseudo global temporal receptive field with less memory and computation complexity compared with a multi-head self-attention (MHSA). The temporal convolution operation is used to enhance the local temporal receptive field. Besides, it can also aggregate pseudo global temporal receptive field to a true holistic temporal receptive field. Furthermore, we also propose a Center-Augmented Triplet Loss (CTL) in GLGait to reduce the intra-class distance and expand the positive samples in the training stage. Extensive experiments show that our method obtains state-of-the-art results on in-the-wild datasets, $i.e.$, Gait3D and GREW. The code is available at https://github.com/bgdpgz/GLGait.

- **Summary**: Recently, the remarkable success of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) from image-text matching has sparked an interest in image-to-video adaptation. However, most current approaches retain the full forward pass for each frame, leading to a high computation overhead for processing entire videos. In this paper, we present InTI, a novel approach for compressive image-to-video adaptation using dynamic Inter-frame Token Interpolation. InTI aims to softly preserve the informative tokens without disrupting their coherent spatiotemporal structure. Specifically, each token pair at identical positions within neighbor frames is linearly aggregated into a new token, where the aggregation weights are generated by a multi-scale context-aware network. In this way, the information of neighbor frames can be adaptively compressed in a point-by-point manner, thereby effectively reducing the number of processed frames by half each time. Importantly, InTI can be seamlessly integrated with existing adaptation methods, achieving strong performance without extra-complex design. On Kinetics-400, InTI reaches a top-1 accuracy of 87.1 with a remarkable 37.5% reduction in GFLOPs compared to naive adaptation. When combined with additional temporal modules, InTI achieves a top-1 accuracy of 87.6 with a 37% reduction in GFLOPs. Similar conclusions have been verified in other common datasets.

- **Summary**: Glossy objects present a significant challenge for 3D reconstruction from multi-view input images under natural lighting. In this paper, we introduce PBIR-NIE, an inverse rendering framework designed to holistically capture the geometry, material attributes, and surrounding illumination of such objects. We propose a novel parallax-aware non-distant environment map as a lightweight and efficient lighting representation, accurately modeling the near-field background of the scene, which is commonly encountered in real-world capture setups. This feature allows our framework to accommodate complex parallax effects beyond the capabilities of standard infinite-distance environment maps. Our method optimizes an underlying signed distance field (SDF) through physics-based differentiable rendering, seamlessly connecting surface gradients between a triangle mesh and the SDF via neural implicit evolution (NIE). To address the intricacies of highly glossy BRDFs in differentiable rendering, we integrate the antithetic sampling algorithm to mitigate variance in the Monte Carlo gradient estimator. Consequently, our framework exhibits robust capabilities in handling glossy object reconstruction, showcasing superior quality in geometry, relighting, and material estimation.

- **Summary**: The integration of Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Computer-Aided Process Planning (CAPP), and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) plays a crucial role in modern manufacturing, facilitating seamless transitions from digital designs to physical products. However, a significant challenge within this integration is the Automatic Feature Recognition (AFR) of CAD models, especially in the context of hybrid manufacturing that combines subtractive and additive manufacturing processes. Traditional AFR methods, focused mainly on the identification of subtractive (machined) features including holes, fillets, chamfers, pockets, and slots, fail to recognize features pertinent to additive manufacturing. Furthermore, the traditional methods fall short in accurately extracting geometric dimensions and orientations, which are also key factors for effective manufacturing process planning. This paper presents a novel approach for creating a synthetic CAD dataset that encompasses features relevant to both additive and subtractive machining through Python Open Cascade. The Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Neural Network (HGCNN) model is implemented to accurately identify the composite additive-subtractive features within the synthetic CAD dataset. The key novelty and contribution of the proposed methodology lie in its ability to recognize a wide range of manufacturing features, and precisely extracting their dimensions, orientations, and stock sizes. The proposed model demonstrates remarkable feature recognition accuracy exceeding 97% and a dimension extraction accuracy of 100% for identified features. Therefore, the proposed methodology enhances the integration of CAD, CAPP, and CAM within hybrid manufacturing by providing precise feature recognition and dimension extraction. It facilitates improved manufacturing process planning, by enabling more informed decision-making.

- **Summary**: We present a novel method for measuring the frequency of periodic phenomena, e.g., rotation, flicker and vibration, by an event camera, a device asynchronously reporting brightness changes at independently operating pixels with high temporal resolution. The approach assumes that for a periodic phenomenon, a highly similar set of events is generated within a specific spatio-temporal window at a time difference corresponding to the phenomenon's period. The sets of similar events are detected by 3D spatio-temporal correlation in the event stream space. The proposed method, EE3P3D, is evaluated on a dataset of 12 sequences of periodic phenomena, i.e. flashing light and vibration, and periodic motion, e.g., rotation, ranging from 3.2 Hz to 2 kHz (equivalent to 192 - 120 000 RPM). EE3P3D significantly outperforms published methods on this dataset, achieving a mean relative error of 0.1%.

- **Summary**: 3D perception tasks, such as 3D object detection and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) segmentation using multi-camera images, have drawn significant attention recently. Despite the fact that accurately estimating both semantic and 3D scene layouts are crucial for this task, existing techniques often neglect the synergistic effects of semantic and depth cues, leading to the occurrence of classification and position estimation errors. Additionally, the input-independent nature of initial queries also limits the learning capacity of Transformer-based models. To tackle these challenges, we propose an input-aware Transformer framework that leverages Semantics and Depth as priors (named SDTR). Our approach involves the use of an S-D Encoder that explicitly models semantic and depth priors, thereby disentangling the learning process of object categorization and position estimation. Moreover, we introduce a Prior-guided Query Builder that incorporates the semantic prior into the initial queries of the Transformer, resulting in more effective input-aware queries. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Lyft benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method in both 3D object detection and BEV segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: Building models that can understand and reason about 3D scenes is difficult owing to the lack of data sources for 3D supervised training and large-scale training regimes. In this work we ask - How can the knowledge in a pre-trained language model be leveraged for 3D scene understanding without any 3D pre-training. The aim of this work is to establish whether pre-trained LLMs possess priors/knowledge required for reasoning in 3D space and how can we prompt them such that they can be used for general purpose spatial reasoning and object understanding in 3D. To this end, we present SceneGPT, an LLM based scene understanding system which can perform 3D spatial reasoning without training or explicit 3D supervision. The key components of our framework are - 1) a 3D scene graph, that serves as scene representation, encoding the objects in the scene and their spatial relationships 2) a pre-trained LLM that can be adapted with in context learning for 3D spatial reasoning. We evaluate our framework qualitatively on object and scene understanding tasks including object semantics, physical properties and affordances (object-level) and spatial understanding (scene-level).

- **Summary**: Dataset distillation has emerged as a technique aiming to condense informative features from large, natural datasets into a compact and synthetic form. While recent advancements have refined this technique, its performance is bottlenecked by the prevailing class-specific synthesis paradigm. Under this paradigm, synthetic data is optimized exclusively for a pre-assigned one-hot label, creating an implicit class barrier in feature condensation. This leads to inefficient utilization of the distillation budget and oversight of inter-class feature distributions, which ultimately limits the effectiveness and efficiency, as demonstrated in our analysis.   To overcome these constraints, this paper presents the Inter-class Feature Compensator (INFER), an innovative distillation approach that transcends the class-specific data-label framework widely utilized in current dataset distillation methods. Specifically, INFER leverages a Universal Feature Compensator (UFC) to enhance feature integration across classes, enabling the generation of multiple additional synthetic instances from a single UFC input. This significantly improves the efficiency of the distillation budget.   Moreover, INFER enriches inter-class interactions during the distillation, thereby enhancing the effectiveness and generalizability of the distilled data. By allowing for the linear interpolation of labels similar to those in the original dataset, INFER meticulously optimizes the synthetic data and dramatically reduces the size of soft labels in the synthetic dataset to almost zero, establishing a new benchmark for efficiency and effectiveness in dataset distillation.

- **Summary**: This study introduces a novel approach to enhance the spatial-temporal resolution of time-event pixels based on luminance changes captured by event cameras. These cameras present unique challenges due to their low resolution and the sparse, asynchronous nature of the data they collect. Current event super-resolution algorithms are not fully optimized for the distinct data structure produced by event cameras, resulting in inefficiencies in capturing the full dynamism and detail of visual scenes with improved computational complexity. To bridge this gap, our research proposes a method that integrates binary spikes with Sigma Delta Neural Networks (SDNNs), leveraging spatiotemporal constraint learning mechanism designed to simultaneously learn the spatial and temporal distributions of the event stream. The proposed network is evaluated using widely recognized benchmark datasets, including N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, ASL-DVS, and Event-NFS. A comprehensive evaluation framework is employed, assessing both the accuracy, through root mean square error (RMSE), and the computational efficiency of our model. The findings demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods, specifically, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art performance in computational efficiency, achieving a 17.04-fold improvement in event sparsity and a 32.28-fold increase in synaptic operation efficiency over traditional artificial neural networks, alongside a two-fold better performance over spiking neural networks.

- **Summary**: This paper provides insight into the effectiveness of zero-shot, prompt-based, Segment Anything Model (SAM), and its updated version, SAM 2, and the non-promptable, conventional convolutional network (CNN), in segmenting solar panels, in RGB aerial imagery, across lighting conditions, spatial resolutions, and prompt strategies. SAM 2 demonstrates improvements over SAM, particularly in sub-optimal lighting conditions when prompted by points. Both SAMs, prompted by user-box, outperformed CNN, in all scenarios. Additionally, YOLOv9 prompting outperformed user points prompting. In high-resolution imagery, both in optimal and sub-optimal lighting conditions, Eff-UNet outperformed both SAM models prompted by YOLOv9 boxes, positioning Eff-UNet as the appropriate model for automatic segmentation in high-resolution data. In low-resolution data, user box prompts were found crucial to achieve a reasonable performance. This paper provides details on strengths and limitations of each model and outlines robustness of user prompted image segmentation models in inconsistent resolution and lighting conditions of remotely sensed data.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel cross-spectral rendering framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that generates realistic and semantically meaningful splats from registered multi-view spectrum and segmentation maps. This extension enhances the representation of scenes with multiple spectra, providing insights into the underlying materials and segmentation. We introduce an improved physically-based rendering approach for Gaussian splats, estimating reflectance and lights per spectra, thereby enhancing accuracy and realism. In a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach with respect to other recent learning-based spectral scene representation approaches (i.e., XNeRF and SpectralNeRF) as well as other non-spectral state-of-the-art learning-based approaches. Our work also demonstrates the potential of spectral scene understanding for precise scene editing techniques like style transfer, inpainting, and removal. Thereby, our contributions address challenges in multi-spectral scene representation, rendering, and editing, offering new possibilities for diverse applications.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models are emerging models that generate images by iteratively denoising random Gaussian noise using deep neural networks. These models typically exhibit high computational and memory demands, necessitating effective post-training quantization for high-performance inference. Recent works propose low-bitwidth (e.g., 8-bit or 4-bit) quantization for diffusion models, however 4-bit integer quantization typically results in low-quality images. We observe that on several widely used hardware platforms, there is little or no difference in compute capability between floating-point and integer arithmetic operations of the same bitwidth (e.g., 8-bit or 4-bit). Therefore, we propose an effective floating-point quantization method for diffusion models that provides better image quality compared to integer quantization methods. We employ a floating-point quantization method that was effective for other processing tasks, specifically computer vision and natural language tasks, and tailor it for diffusion models by integrating weight rounding learning during the mapping of the full-precision values to the quantized values in the quantization process. We comprehensively study integer and floating-point quantization methods in state-of-the-art diffusion models. Our floating-point quantization method not only generates higher-quality images than that of integer quantization methods, but also shows no noticeable degradation compared to full-precision models (32-bit floating-point), when both weights and activations are quantized to 8-bit floating-point values, while has minimal degradation with 4-bit weights and 8-bit activations.

- **Summary**: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a fundamental task in image understanding. While deep-learning-based HOI methods provide high performance in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP), they are computationally expensive and opaque in training and inference processes. An Efficient HOI (EHOI) detector is proposed in this work to strike a good balance between detection performance, inference complexity, and mathematical transparency. EHOI is a two-stage method. In the first stage, it leverages a frozen object detector to localize the objects and extract various features as intermediate outputs. In the second stage, the first-stage outputs predict the interaction type using the XGBoost classifier. Our contributions include the application of error correction codes (ECCs) to encode rare interaction cases, which reduces the model size and the complexity of the XGBoost classifier in the second stage. Additionally, we provide a mathematical formulation of the relabeling and decision-making process. Apart from the architecture, we present qualitative results to explain the functionalities of the feedforward modules. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of ECC-coded interaction labels and the excellent balance of detection performance and complexity of the proposed EHOI method.

- **Summary**: Pathological diagnosis remains the definitive standard for identifying tumors. The rise of multimodal large models has simplified the process of integrating image analysis with textual descriptions. Despite this advancement, the substantial costs associated with training and deploying these complex multimodal models, together with a scarcity of high-quality training datasets, create a significant divide between cutting-edge technology and its application in the clinical setting. We had meticulously compiled a dataset of approximately 45,000 cases, covering over 6 different tasks, including the classification of organ tissues, generating pathology report descriptions, and addressing pathology-related questions and answers. We have fine-tuned multimodal large models, specifically LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternLM, with this dataset to enhance instruction-based performance. We conducted a qualitative assessment of the capabilities of the base model and the fine-tuned model in performing image captioning and classification tasks on the specific dataset. The evaluation results demonstrate that the fine-tuned model exhibits proficiency in addressing typical pathological questions. We hope that by making both our models and datasets publicly available, they can be valuable to the medical and research communities.

- **Summary**: Segmentation of crop fields is essential for enhancing agricultural productivity, monitoring crop health, and promoting sustainable practices. Deep learning models adopted for this task must ensure accurate and reliable predictions to avoid economic losses and environmental impact. The newly proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) offer promising advancements in the performance of neural networks. This paper analyzes the integration of KAN layers into the U-Net architecture (U-KAN) to segment crop fields using Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellite images and provides an analysis of the performance and explainability of these networks. Our findings indicate a 2\% improvement in IoU compared to the traditional full-convolutional U-Net model in fewer GFLOPs. Furthermore, gradient-based explanation techniques show that U-KAN predictions are highly plausible and that the network has a very high ability to focus on the boundaries of cultivated areas rather than on the areas themselves. The per-channel relevance analysis also reveals that some channels are irrelevant to this task.

- **Summary**: A soundscape is defined by the acoustic environment a person perceives at a location. In this work, we propose a framework for mapping soundscapes across the Earth. Since soundscapes involve sound distributions that span varying spatial scales, we represent locations with multi-scale satellite imagery and learn a joint representation among this imagery, audio, and text. To capture the inherent uncertainty in the soundscape of a location, we design the representation space to be probabilistic. We also fuse ubiquitous metadata (including geolocation, time, and data source) to enable learning of spatially and temporally dynamic representations of soundscapes. We demonstrate the utility of our framework by creating large-scale soundscape maps integrating both audio and text with temporal control. To facilitate future research on this task, we also introduce a large-scale dataset, GeoSound, containing over $300k$ geotagged audio samples paired with both low- and high-resolution satellite imagery. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art on both GeoSound and the existing SoundingEarth dataset. Our dataset and code is available at https://github.com/mvrl/PSM.

- **Summary**: Fingerspelling poses challenges for sign language processing due to its high-frequency motion and use for open-vocabulary terms. While prior work has studied fingerspelling recognition, there has been little attention to evaluating how well sign language translation models understand fingerspelling in the context of entire sentences -- and improving this capability. We manually annotate instances of fingerspelling within FLEURS-ASL and use them to evaluate the effect of two simple measures to improve fingerspelling recognition within American Sign Language to English translation: 1) use a model family (ByT5) with character- rather than subword-level tokenization, and 2) mix fingerspelling recognition data into the translation training mixture. We find that 1) substantially improves understanding of fingerspelling (and therefore translation quality overall), but the effect of 2) is mixed.
