- **Summary**: Person Re-Identification (ReID) aims to retrieve relevant individuals in non-overlapping camera images and has a wide range of applications in the field of public safety. In recent years, with the development of Vision Transformer (ViT) and self-supervised learning techniques, the performance of person ReID based on self-supervised pre-training has been greatly improved. Person ReID requires extracting highly discriminative local fine-grained features of the human body, while traditional ViT is good at extracting context-related global features, making it difficult to focus on local human body features. To this end, this article introduces the recently emerged Masked Image Modeling (MIM) self-supervised learning method into person ReID, and effectively extracts high-quality global and local features through large-scale unsupervised pre-training by combining masked image modeling and discriminative contrastive learning, and then conducts supervised fine-tuning training in the person ReID task. This person feature extraction method based on ViT with masked image modeling (PersonViT) has the good characteristics of unsupervised, scalable, and strong generalization capabilities, overcoming the problem of difficult annotation in supervised person ReID, and achieves state-of-the-art results on publicly available benchmark datasets, including MSMT17, Market1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and Occluded-Duke. The code and pre-trained models of the PersonViT method are released at https://github.com/hustvl/PersonViT to promote further research in the person ReID fie

- **Summary**: With the support of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies, the 3D virtual eyeglasses try-on application is well on its way to becoming a new trending solution that offers a "try on" option to select the perfect pair of eyeglasses at the comfort of your own home. Reconstructing eyeglasses frames from a single image with traditional depth and image-based methods is extremely difficult due to their unique characteristics such as lack of sufficient texture features, thin elements, and severe self-occlusions. In this paper, we propose the first mesh deformation-based reconstruction framework for recovering high-precision 3D full-frame eyeglasses models from a single RGB image, leveraging prior and domain-specific knowledge. Specifically, based on the construction of a synthetic eyeglasses frame dataset, we first define a class-specific eyeglasses frame template with pre-defined keypoints. Then, given an input eyeglasses frame image with thin structure and few texture features, we design a keypoint detector and refiner to detect predefined keypoints in a coarse-to-fine manner to estimate the camera pose accurately. After that, using differentiable rendering, we propose a novel optimization approach for producing correct geometry by progressively performing free-form deformation (FFD) on the template mesh. We define a series of loss functions to enforce consistency between the rendered result and the corresponding RGB input, utilizing constraints from inherent structure, silhouettes, keypoints, per-pixel shading information, and so on. Experimental results on both the synthetic dataset and real images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

- **Summary**: The line is a prevalent element in man-made environments, inherently encoding spatial structural information, thus making it a more robust choice for feature representation in practical applications. Despite its apparent advantages, previous rolling shutter bundle adjustment (RSBA) methods have only supported sparse feature points, which lack robustness, particularly in degenerate environments. In this paper, we introduce the first rolling shutter line-based bundle adjustment solution, RSL-BA. Specifically, we initially establish the rolling shutter camera line projection theory utilizing Pl\"ucker line parameterization. Subsequently, we derive a series of reprojection error formulations which are stable and efficient. Finally, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that our method can prevent three common degeneracies, one of which is first discovered in this paper. Extensive synthetic and real data experiments demonstrate that our method achieves efficiency and accuracy comparable to existing point-based rolling shutter bundle adjustment solutions.

- **Summary**: Understanding and predicting viewer attention in omnidirectional videos (ODVs) is crucial for enhancing user engagement in virtual and augmented reality applications. Although both audio and visual modalities are essential for saliency prediction in ODVs, the joint exploitation of these two modalities has been limited, primarily due to the absence of large-scale audio-visual saliency databases and comprehensive analyses. This paper comprehensively investigates audio-visual attention in ODVs from both subjective and objective perspectives. Specifically, we first introduce a new audio-visual saliency database for omnidirectional videos, termed AVS-ODV database, containing 162 ODVs and corresponding eye movement data collected from 60 subjects under three audio modes including mute, mono, and ambisonics. Based on the constructed AVS-ODV database, we perform an in-depth analysis of how audio influences visual attention in ODVs. To advance the research on audio-visual saliency prediction for ODVs, we further establish a new benchmark based on the AVS-ODV database by testing numerous state-of-the-art saliency models, including visual-only models and audio-visual models. In addition, given the limitations of current models, we propose an innovative omnidirectional audio-visual saliency prediction network (OmniAVS), which is built based on the U-Net architecture, and hierarchically fuses audio and visual features from the multimodal aligned embedding space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed OmniAVS model outperforms other state-of-the-art models on both ODV AVS prediction and traditional AVS predcition tasks. The AVS-ODV database and OmniAVS model will be released to facilitate future research.

- **Summary**: Audio-driven lip sync has recently drawn significant attention due to its widespread application in the multimedia domain. Individuals exhibit distinct lip shapes when speaking the same utterance, attributed to the unique speaking styles of individuals, posing a notable challenge for audio-driven lip sync. Earlier methods for such task often bypassed the modeling of personalized speaking styles, resulting in sub-optimal lip sync conforming to the general styles. Recent lip sync techniques attempt to guide the lip sync for arbitrary audio by aggregating information from a style reference video, yet they can not preserve the speaking styles well due to their inaccuracy in style aggregation. This work proposes an innovative audio-aware style reference scheme that effectively leverages the relationships between input audio and reference audio from style reference video to address the style-preserving audio-driven lip sync. Specifically, we first develop an advanced Transformer-based model adept at predicting lip motion corresponding to the input audio, augmented by the style information aggregated through cross-attention layers from style reference video. Afterwards, to better render the lip motion into realistic talking face video, we devise a conditional latent diffusion model, integrating lip motion through modulated convolutional layers and fusing reference facial images via spatial cross-attention layers. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed approach in achieving precise lip sync, preserving speaking styles, and generating high-fidelity, realistic talking face videos.

- **Summary**: Audio-driven talking face video generation has attracted increasing attention due to its huge industrial potential. Some previous methods focus on learning a direct mapping from audio to visual content. Despite progress, they often struggle with the ambiguity of the mapping process, leading to flawed results. An alternative strategy involves facial structural representations (e.g., facial landmarks) as intermediaries. This multi-stage approach better preserves the appearance details but suffers from error accumulation due to the independent optimization of different stages. Moreover, most previous methods rely on generative adversarial networks, prone to training instability and mode collapse. To address these challenges, our study proposes a novel landmark-based diffusion model for talking face generation, which leverages facial landmarks as intermediate representations while enabling end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we first establish the less ambiguous mapping from audio to landmark motion of lip and jaw. Then, we introduce an innovative conditioning module called TalkFormer to align the synthesized motion with the motion represented by landmarks via differentiable cross-attention, which enables end-to-end optimization for improved lip synchronization. Besides, TalkFormer employs implicit feature warping to align the reference image features with the target motion for preserving more appearance details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can synthesize high-fidelity and lip-synced talking face videos, preserving more subject appearance details from the reference image.

- **Summary**: Existing multimodal-based human action recognition approaches are either computationally expensive, which limits their applicability in real-time scenarios, or fail to exploit the spatial temporal information of multiple data modalities. In this work, we present an efficient pose-driven attention-guided multimodal network (EPAM-Net) for action recognition in videos. Specifically, we adapted X3D networks for both RGB and pose streams to capture spatio-temporal features from RGB videos and their skeleton sequences. Then skeleton features are utilized to help the visual network stream focusing on key frames and their salient spatial regions using a spatial temporal attention block. Finally, the scores of the two streams of the proposed network are fused for final classification. The experimental results show that our method achieves competitive performance on NTU-D 60 and NTU RGB-D 120 benchmark datasets. Moreover, our model provides a 6.2--9.9x reduction in FLOPs (floating-point operation, in number of multiply-adds) and a 9--9.6x reduction in the number of network parameters. The code will be available at https://github.com/ahmed-nady/Multimodal-Action-Recognition.

- **Summary**: Laryngo-pharyngeal cancer (LPC) is a highly fatal malignant disease affecting the head and neck region. Previous studies on endoscopic tumor detection, particularly those leveraging dual-branch network architectures, have shown significant advancements in tumor detection. These studies highlight the potential of dual-branch networks in improving diagnostic accuracy by effectively integrating global and local (lesion) feature extraction. However, they are still limited in their capabilities to accurately locate the lesion region and capture the discriminative feature information between the global and local branches. To address these issues, we propose a novel SAM-guided fusion network (SAM-FNet), a dual-branch network for laryngo-pharyngeal tumor detection. By leveraging the powerful object segmentation capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), we introduce the SAM into the SAM-FNet to accurately segment the lesion region. Furthermore, we propose a GAN-like feature optimization (GFO) module to capture the discriminative features between the global and local branches, enhancing the fusion feature complementarity. Additionally, we collect two LPC datasets from the First Affiliated Hospital (FAHSYSU) and the Sixth Affiliated Hospital (SAHSYSU) of Sun Yat-sen University. The FAHSYSU dataset is used as the internal dataset for training the model, while the SAHSYSU dataset is used as the external dataset for evaluating the model's performance. Extensive experiments on both datasets of FAHSYSU and SAHSYSU demonstrate that the SAM-FNet can achieve competitive results, outperforming the state-of-the-art counterparts.

- **Summary**: Researchers have been developing Hand Gesture Recognition (HGR) systems to enhance natural, efficient, and authentic human-computer interaction, especially benefiting those who rely solely on hand gestures for communication. Despite significant progress, the automatic and precise identification of hand gestures remains a considerable challenge in computer vision. Recent studies have focused on specific modalities like RGB images, skeleton data, and spatiotemporal interest points. This paper provides a comprehensive review of HGR techniques and data modalities from 2014 to 2024, exploring advancements in sensor technology and computer vision. We highlight accomplishments using various modalities, including RGB, Skeleton, Depth, Audio, EMG, EEG, and Multimodal approaches and identify areas needing further research. We reviewed over 200 articles from prominent databases, focusing on data collection, data settings, and gesture representation. Our review assesses the efficacy of HGR systems through their recognition accuracy and identifies a gap in research on continuous gesture recognition, indicating the need for improved vision-based gesture systems. The field has experienced steady research progress, including advancements in hand-crafted features and deep learning (DL) techniques. Additionally, we report on the promising developments in HGR methods and the area of multimodal approaches. We hope this survey will serve as a potential guideline for diverse data modality-based HGR research.

- **Summary**: Implicit degradation modeling-based blind super-resolution (SR) has attracted more increasing attention in the community due to its excellent generalization to complex degradation scenarios and wide application range. How to extract more discriminative degradation representations and fully adapt them to specific image features is the key to this task. In this paper, we propose a new Content-decoupled Contrastive Learning-based blind image super-resolution (CdCL) framework following the typical blind SR pipeline. This framework introduces negative-free contrastive learning technique for the first time to model the implicit degradation representation, in which a new cyclic shift sampling strategy is designed to ensure decoupling between content features and degradation features from the data perspective, thereby improving the purity and discriminability of the learned implicit degradation space. In addition, to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of implicit degradation-based blind super-resolving, we design a detail-aware implicit degradation adaption module with lower complexity, which adapts degradation information to the specific LR image from both channel and spatial perspectives. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data prove that the proposed CdCL comprehensively improves the quantitative and qualitative results of contrastive learning-based implicit blind SR paradigm, and achieves SOTA PSNR in this field. Even if the number of parameters is halved, our method still achieves very competitive results.

- **Summary**: Unidirectional imagers form images of input objects only in one direction, e.g., from field-of-view (FOV) A to FOV B, while blocking the image formation in the reverse direction, from FOV B to FOV A. Here, we report unidirectional imaging under spatially partially coherent light and demonstrate high-quality imaging only in the forward direction (A->B) with high power efficiency while distorting the image formation in the backward direction (B->A) along with low power efficiency. Our reciprocal design features a set of spatially engineered linear diffractive layers that are statistically optimized for partially coherent illumination with a given phase correlation length. Our analyses reveal that when illuminated by a partially coherent beam with a correlation length of ~1.5 w or larger, where w is the wavelength of light, diffractive unidirectional imagers achieve robust performance, exhibiting asymmetric imaging performance between the forward and backward directions - as desired. A partially coherent unidirectional imager designed with a smaller correlation length of less than 1.5 w still supports unidirectional image transmission, but with a reduced figure of merit. These partially coherent diffractive unidirectional imagers are compact (axially spanning less than 75 w), polarization-independent, and compatible with various types of illumination sources, making them well-suited for applications in asymmetric visual information processing and communication.

- **Summary**: Event cameras have the potential to revolutionize the field of robot vision, particularly in areas like stereo disparity estimation, owing to their high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. Many studies use deep learning for event camera stereo disparity estimation. However, these methods fail to fully exploit the temporal information in the event stream to acquire clear event representations. Additionally, there is room for further reduction in pixel shifts in the feature maps before constructing the cost volume. In this paper, we propose EV-MGDispNet, a novel event-based stereo disparity estimation method. Firstly, we propose an edge-aware aggregation (EAA) module, which fuses event frames and motion confidence maps to generate a novel clear event representation. Then, we propose a motion-guided attention (MGA) module, where motion confidence maps utilize deformable transformer encoders to enhance the feature map with more accurate edges. Finally, we also add a census left-right consistency loss function to enhance the left-right consistency of stereo event representation. Through conducting experiments within challenging real-world driving scenarios, we validate that our method outperforms currently known state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) metrics.

- **Summary**: In emergencies, the ability to quickly and accurately gather environmental data and command information, and to make timely decisions, is particularly critical. Traditional semantic communication frameworks, primarily based on a single modality, are susceptible to complex environments and lighting conditions, thereby limiting decision accuracy. To this end, this paper introduces a multimodal generative semantic communication framework named mm-GESCO. The framework ingests streams of visible and infrared modal image data, generates fused semantic segmentation maps, and transmits them using a combination of one-hot encoding and zlib compression techniques to enhance data transmission efficiency. At the receiving end, the framework can reconstruct the original multimodal images based on the semantic maps. Additionally, a latent diffusion model based on contrastive learning is designed to align different modal data within the latent space, allowing mm-GESCO to reconstruct latent features of any modality presented at the input. Experimental results demonstrate that mm-GESCO achieves a compression ratio of up to 200 times, surpassing the performance of existing semantic communication frameworks and exhibiting excellent performance in downstream tasks such as object classification and detection.

- **Summary**: Cross-view geolocalization identifies the geographic location of street view images by matching them with a georeferenced satellite database. Significant challenges arise due to the drastic appearance and geometry differences between views. In this paper, we propose a new approach for cross-view image geo-localization, i.e., the Panorama-BEV Co-Retrieval Network. Specifically, by utilizing the ground plane assumption and geometric relations, we convert street view panorama images into the BEV view, reducing the gap between street panoramas and satellite imagery. In the existing retrieval of street view panorama images and satellite images, we introduce BEV and satellite image retrieval branches for collaborative retrieval. By retaining the original street view retrieval branch, we overcome the limited perception range issue of BEV representation. Our network enables comprehensive perception of both the global layout and local details around the street view capture locations. Additionally, we introduce CVGlobal, a global cross-view dataset that is closer to real-world scenarios. This dataset adopts a more realistic setup, with street view directions not aligned with satellite images. CVGlobal also includes cross-regional, cross-temporal, and street view to map retrieval tests, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of algorithm performance. Our method excels in multiple tests on common cross-view datasets such as CVUSA, CVACT, VIGOR, and our newly introduced CVGlobal, surpassing the current state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: As Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) advances, a variety of methods have been developed to generate text, images, videos, and 3D objects from single or multimodal inputs, contributing efforts to emulate human-like cognitive content creation. However, generating realistic large-scale scenes from a single input presents a challenge due to the complexities involved in ensuring consistency across extrapolated views generated by models. Benefiting from recent video generation models and implicit neural representations, we propose Scene123, a 3D scene generation model, that not only ensures realism and diversity through the video generation framework but also uses implicit neural fields combined with Masked Autoencoders (MAE) to effectively ensures the consistency of unseen areas across views. Specifically, we initially warp the input image (or an image generated from text) to simulate adjacent views, filling the invisible areas with the MAE model. However, these filled images usually fail to maintain view consistency, thus we utilize the produced views to optimize a neural radiance field, enhancing geometric consistency.   Moreover, to further enhance the details and texture fidelity of generated views, we employ a GAN-based Loss against images derived from the input image through the video generation model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic and consistent scenes from a single prompt. Both qualitative and quantitative results indicate that our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods. We show encourage video examples at https://yiyingyang12.github.io/Scene123.github.io/.

- **Summary**: Recent diffusion-based unrestricted attacks generate imperceptible adversarial examples with high transferability compared to previous unrestricted attacks and restricted attacks. However, existing works on diffusion-based unrestricted attacks are mostly focused on images yet are seldom explored in videos. In this paper, we propose the Recursive Token Merging for Video Diffusion-based Unrestricted Adversarial Attack (ReToMe-VA), which is the first framework to generate imperceptible adversarial video clips with higher transferability. Specifically, to achieve spatial imperceptibility, ReToMe-VA adopts a Timestep-wise Adversarial Latent Optimization (TALO) strategy that optimizes perturbations in diffusion models' latent space at each denoising step. TALO offers iterative and accurate updates to generate more powerful adversarial frames. TALO can further reduce memory consumption in gradient computation. Moreover, to achieve temporal imperceptibility, ReToMe-VA introduces a Recursive Token Merging (ReToMe) mechanism by matching and merging tokens across video frames in the self-attention module, resulting in temporally consistent adversarial videos. ReToMe concurrently facilitates inter-frame interactions into the attack process, inducing more diverse and robust gradients, thus leading to better adversarial transferability.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have significantly advanced the field of art content synthesis. However, current portrait stylization methods generally require either model fine-tuning based on examples or the employment of DDIM Inversion to revert images to noise space, both of which substantially decelerate the image generation process. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents an inversion-free portrait stylization framework based on diffusion models that accomplishes content and style feature fusion in merely four sampling steps. We observed that Latent Consistency Models employing consistency distillation can effectively extract representative Consistency Features from noisy images. To blend the Consistency Features extracted from both content and style images, we introduce a Style Enhancement Attention Control technique that meticulously merges content and style features within the attention space of the target image. Moreover, we propose a feature merging strategy to amalgamate redundant features in Consistency Features, thereby reducing the computational load of attention control. Extensive experiments have validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework in enhancing stylization efficiency and fidelity. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/liujin112/ZePo}.

- **Summary**: Recently, point clouds have been widely used in computer vision, whereas their collection is time-consuming and expensive. As such, point cloud datasets are the valuable intellectual property of their owners and deserve protection. To detect and prevent unauthorized use of these datasets, especially for commercial or open-sourced ones that cannot be sold again or used commercially without permission, we intend to identify whether a suspicious third-party model is trained on our protected dataset under the black-box setting. We achieve this goal by designing a scalable clean-label backdoor-based dataset watermark for point clouds that ensures both effectiveness and stealthiness. Unlike existing clean-label watermark schemes, which are susceptible to the number of categories, our method could watermark samples from all classes instead of only from the target one. Accordingly, it can still preserve high effectiveness even on large-scale datasets with many classes. Specifically, we perturb selected point clouds with non-target categories in both shape-wise and point-wise manners before inserting trigger patterns without changing their labels. The features of perturbed samples are similar to those of benign samples from the target class. As such, models trained on the watermarked dataset will have a distinctive yet stealthy backdoor behavior, i.e., misclassifying samples from the target class whenever triggers appear, since the trained DNNs will treat the inserted trigger pattern as a signal to deny predicting the target label. We also design a hypothesis-test-guided dataset ownership verification based on the proposed watermark. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted, verifying the effectiveness of our method and its resistance to potential removal methods.

- **Summary**: Gaze estimation is pivotal in human scene comprehension tasks, particularly in medical diagnostic analysis. Eye-tracking technology facilitates the recording of physicians' ocular movements during image interpretation, thereby elucidating their visual attention patterns and information-processing strategies. In this paper, we initially define the context-aware gaze estimation problem in medical radiology report settings. To understand the attention allocation and cognitive behavior of radiologists during the medical image interpretation process, we propose a context-aware Gaze EstiMation (GEM) network that utilizes eye gaze data collected from radiologists to simulate their visual search behavior patterns throughout the image interpretation process. It consists of a context-awareness module, visual behavior graph construction, and visual behavior matching. Within the context-awareness module, we achieve intricate multimodal registration by establishing connections between medical reports and images. Subsequently, for a more accurate simulation of genuine visual search behavior patterns, we introduce a visual behavior graph structure, capturing such behavior through high-order relationships (edges) between gaze points (nodes). To maintain the authenticity of visual behavior, we devise a visual behavior-matching approach, adjusting the high-order relationships between them by matching the graph constructed from real and estimated gaze points. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of GEM over existing methods and its strong generalizability, which also provides a new direction for the effective utilization of diverse modalities in medical image interpretation and enhances the interpretability of models in the field of medical imaging. https://github.com/Tiger-SN/GEM

- **Summary**: Cross-modal retrieval is crucial in understanding latent correspondences across modalities. However, existing methods implicitly assume well-matched training data, which is impractical as real-world data inevitably involves imperfect alignments, i.e., noisy correspondences. Although some works explore similarity-based strategies to address such noise, they suffer from sub-optimal similarity predictions influenced by modality-exclusive information (MEI), e.g., background noise in images and abstract definitions in texts. This issue arises as MEI is not shared across modalities, thus aligning it in training can markedly mislead similarity predictions. Moreover, although intuitive, directly applying previous cross-modal disentanglement methods suffers from limited noise tolerance and disentanglement efficacy. Inspired by the robustness of information bottlenecks against noise, we introduce DisNCL, a novel information-theoretic framework for feature Disentanglement in Noisy Correspondence Learning, to adaptively balance the extraction of MII and MEI with certifiable optimal cross-modal disentanglement efficacy. DisNCL then enhances similarity predictions in modality-invariant subspace, thereby greatly boosting similarity-based alleviation strategy for noisy correspondences. Furthermore, DisNCL introduces soft matching targets to model noisy many-to-many relationships inherent in multi-modal input for noise-robust and accurate cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments confirm DisNCL's efficacy by 2% average recall improvement. Mutual information estimation and visualization results show that DisNCL learns meaningful MII/MEI subspaces, validating our theoretical analyses.

- **Summary**: In recent years, point cloud analysis methods based on the Transformer architecture have made significant progress, particularly in the context of multimedia applications such as 3D modeling, virtual reality, and autonomous systems. However, the high computational resource demands of the Transformer architecture hinder its scalability, real-time processing capabilities, and deployment on mobile devices and other platforms with limited computational resources. This limitation remains a significant obstacle to its practical application in scenarios requiring on-device intelligence and multimedia processing. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient point cloud analysis architecture, \textbf{Point} \textbf{M}LP-\textbf{T}ransformer (PointMT). This study tackles the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism by introducing a linear complexity local attention mechanism for effective feature aggregation. Additionally, to counter the Transformer's focus on token differences while neglecting channel differences, we introduce a parameter-free channel temperature adaptation mechanism that adaptively adjusts the attention weight distribution in each channel, enhancing the precision of feature aggregation. To improve the Transformer's slow convergence speed due to the limited scale of point cloud datasets, we propose an MLP-Transformer hybrid module, which significantly enhances the model's convergence speed. Furthermore, to boost the feature representation capability of point tokens, we refine the classification head, enabling point tokens to directly participate in prediction. Experimental results on multiple evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that PointMT achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining an optimal balance between performance and accuracy.

- **Summary**: The ability to anticipate others' goals and intentions is at the basis of human-human social interaction. Such ability, largely based on non-verbal communication, is also a key to having natural and pleasant interactions with artificial agents, like robots. In this work, we discuss a preliminary experiment on the use of head pose as a visual cue to understand and anticipate action goals, particularly reaching and transporting movements. By reasoning on the spatio-temporal connections between the head, hands and objects in the scene, we will show that short-range anticipation is possible, laying the foundations for future applications to human-robot interaction.

- **Summary**: Metallic mesh is a transparent electromagnetic shielding film with a fine metal line structure. However, it can develop defects that affect the optoelectronic performance whether in the production preparation or in actual use. The development of in-situ non-destructive testing (NDT) devices for metallic mesh requires long working distances, reflective optical path design, and miniaturization. To address the limitations of existing smartphone microscopes, which feature short working distances and inadequate transmission imaging for industrial in-situ inspection, we propose a novel long-working distance reflective smartphone microscopy system (LD-RSM). LD-RSM builds a 4f optical imaging system with external optical components and a smartphone, utilizing a beam splitter to achieve reflective imaging with the illumination system and imaging system on the same side of the sample. It achieves an optical resolution of 4.92$\mu$m and a working distance of up to 22.23 mm. Additionally, we introduce a dual prior weighted Robust Principal Component Analysis (DW-RPCA) for defect detection. This approach leverages spectral filter fusion and Hough transform to model different defect types, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of defect identification. Coupled with an optimized threshold segmentation algorithm, DW-RPCA method achieves a pixel-level accuracy of 84.8%. Our work showcases strong potential for growth in the field of in-situ on-line inspection of industrial products.

- **Summary**: This work introduces an innovative method for estimating attention levels (cognitive load) using an ensemble of facial analysis techniques applied to webcam videos. Our method is particularly useful, among others, in e-learning applications, so we trained, evaluated, and compared our approach on the mEBAL2 database, a public multi-modal database acquired in an e-learning environment. mEBAL2 comprises data from 60 users who performed 8 different tasks. These tasks varied in difficulty, leading to changes in their cognitive loads. Our approach adapts state-of-the-art facial analysis technologies to quantify the users' cognitive load in the form of high or low attention. Several behavioral signals and physiological processes related to the cognitive load are used, such as eyeblink, heart rate, facial action units, and head pose, among others. Furthermore, we conduct a study to understand which individual features obtain better results, the most efficient combinations, explore local and global features, and how temporary time intervals affect attention level estimation, among other aspects. We find that global facial features are more appropriate for multimodal systems using score-level fusion, particularly as the temporal window increases. On the other hand, local features are more suitable for fusion through neural network training with score-level fusion approaches. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art accuracies using the public mEBAL2 benchmark.

- **Summary**: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful technique for determining high-resolution 3D biomolecular structures from imaging data. As this technique can capture dynamic biomolecular complexes, 3D reconstruction methods are increasingly being developed to resolve this intrinsic structural heterogeneity. However, the absence of standardized benchmarks with ground truth structures and validation metrics limits the advancement of the field. Here, we propose CryoBench, a suite of datasets, metrics, and performance benchmarks for heterogeneous reconstruction in cryo-EM. We propose five datasets representing different sources of heterogeneity and degrees of difficulty. These include conformational heterogeneity generated from simple motions and random configurations of antibody complexes and from tens of thousands of structures sampled from a molecular dynamics simulation. We also design datasets containing compositional heterogeneity from mixtures of ribosome assembly states and 100 common complexes present in cells. We then perform a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art heterogeneous reconstruction tools including neural and non-neural methods and their sensitivity to noise, and propose new metrics for quantitative comparison of methods. We hope that this benchmark will be a foundational resource for analyzing existing methods and new algorithmic development in both the cryo-EM and machine learning communities.

- **Summary**: First-Person-View (FPV) holds immense potential for revolutionizing the trajectory of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), offering an exhilarating avenue for navigating complex building structures. Yet, traditional Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) methods face challenges such as sampling single points per iteration and requiring an extensive array of views for supervision. UAV videos exacerbate these issues with limited viewpoints and significant spatial scale variations, resulting in inadequate detail rendering across diverse scales. In response, we introduce FPV-NeRF, addressing these challenges through three key facets: (1) Temporal consistency. Leveraging spatio-temporal continuity ensures seamless coherence between frames; (2) Global structure. Incorporating various global features during point sampling preserves space integrity; (3) Local granularity. Employing a comprehensive framework and multi-resolution supervision for multi-scale scene feature representation tackles the intricacies of UAV video spatial scales. Additionally, due to the scarcity of publicly available FPV videos, we introduce an innovative view synthesis method using NeRF to generate FPV perspectives from UAV footage, enhancing spatial perception for drones. Our novel dataset spans diverse trajectories, from outdoor to indoor environments, in the UAV domain, differing significantly from traditional NeRF scenarios. Through extensive experiments encompassing both interior and exterior building structures, FPV-NeRF demonstrates a superior understanding of the UAV flying space, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in our curated UAV dataset.

- **Summary**: Online person re-identification services face privacy breaches from potential data leakage and recovery attacks, exposing cloud-stored images to malicious attackers and triggering public concern. The privacy protection of pedestrian images is crucial. Previous privacy-preserving person re-identification methods are unable to resist recovery attacks and compromise accuracy. In this paper, we propose an iterative method (PixelFade) to optimize pedestrian images into noise-like images to resist recovery attacks. We first give an in-depth study of protected images from previous privacy methods, which reveal that the chaos of protected images can disrupt the learning of recovery models. Accordingly, Specifically, we propose Noise-guided Objective Function with the feature constraints of a specific authorization model, optimizing pedestrian images to normal-distributed noise images while preserving their original identity information as per the authorization model. To solve the above non-convex optimization problem, we propose a heuristic optimization algorithm that alternately performs the Constraint Operation and the Partial Replacement Operation. This strategy not only safeguards that original pixels are replaced with noises to protect privacy, but also guides the images towards an improved optimization direction to effectively preserve discriminative features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PixelFade outperforms previous methods in resisting recovery attacks and Re-ID performance.

- **Summary**: Neural architecture search (NAS) automates neural network design by using optimization algorithms to navigate architecture spaces, reducing the burden of manual architecture design. While NAS has achieved success, applying it to emerging domains, such as analyzing unstructured 3D point clouds, remains underexplored due to the data lying in non-Euclidean spaces, unlike images. This paper presents Success-History-based Self-adaptive Differential Evolution with a Joint Point Interaction Dimension Search (SHSADE-PIDS), an evolutionary NAS framework that encodes discrete deep neural network architectures to continuous spaces and performs searches in the continuous spaces for efficient point cloud neural architectures. Comprehensive experiments on challenging 3D segmentation and classification benchmarks demonstrate SHSADE-PIDS's capabilities. It discovered highly efficient architectures with higher accuracy, significantly advancing prior NAS techniques. For segmentation on SemanticKITTI, SHSADE-PIDS attained 64.51% mean IoU using only 0.55M parameters and 4.5GMACs, reducing overhead by over 22-26X versus other top methods. For ModelNet40 classification, it achieved 93.4% accuracy with just 1.31M parameters, surpassing larger models. SHSADE-PIDS provided valuable insights into bridging evolutionary algorithms with neural architecture optimization, particularly for emerging frontiers like point cloud learning.

- **Summary**: Object re-identification (ReID) in large camera networks has many challenges. First, the similar appearances of objects degrade ReID performances. This challenge cannot be addressed by existing appearance-based ReID methods. Second, most ReID studies are performed in laboratory settings and do not consider ReID problems in real-world scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel ReID framework that leverages a spatial-temporal fusion network and causal identity matching (CIM). The framework estimates camera network topology using the proposed adaptive Parzen window and combines appearance features with spatial-temporal cue within the Fusion Network. It achieved outstanding performance across several datasets, including VeRi776, Vehicle-3I, and Market-1501, achieving up to 99.70% rank-1 accuracy and 95.5% mAP. Furthermore, the proposed CIM approach, which dynamically assigns gallery sets based on the camera network topology, further improved ReID accuracy and robustness in real-world settings, evidenced by a 94.95% mAP and 95.19% F1 score on the Vehicle-3I dataset. The experimental results support the effectiveness of incorporating spatial-temporal information and CIM for real-world ReID scenarios regardless of the data domain (e.g., vehicle, person).

- **Summary**: Video anomaly detection (VAD) in autonomous driving scenario is an important task, however it involves several challenges due to the ego-centric views and moving camera. Due to this, it remains largely under-explored. While recent developments in weakly-supervised VAD methods have shown remarkable progress in detecting critical real-world anomalies in static camera scenario, the development and validation of such methods are yet to be explored for moving camera VAD. This is mainly due to existing datasets like DoTA not following training pre-conditions of weakly-supervised learning. In this paper, we aim to promote weakly-supervised method development for autonomous driving VAD. We reorganize the DoTA dataset and aim to validate recent powerful weakly-supervised VAD methods on moving camera scenarios. Further, we provide a detailed analysis of what modifications on state-of-the-art methods can significantly improve the detection performance. Towards this, we propose a "feature transformation block" and through experimentation we show that our propositions can empower existing weakly-supervised VAD methods significantly in improving the VAD in autonomous driving. Our codes/dataset/demo will be released at github.com/ut21/WSAD-Driving

- **Summary**: Darwinian evolution of the biological brain is documented through multiple lines of evidence, although the modes of evolutionary changes remain unclear. Drawing inspiration from the evolved neural systems (e.g., visual cortex), deep learning models have demonstrated superior performance in visual tasks, among others. While the success of training deep neural networks has been relying on back-propagation (BP) and its variants to learn representations from data, BP does not incorporate the evolutionary processes that govern biological neural systems. This work proposes a neural network optimization framework based on evolutionary theory. Specifically, BP-trained deep neural networks for visual recognition tasks obtained from the ending epochs are considered the primordial ancestors (initial population). Subsequently, the population evolved with differential evolution. Extensive experiments are carried out to examine the relationships between Darwinian evolution and neural network optimization, including the correspondence between datasets, environment, models, and living species. The empirical results show that the proposed framework has positive impacts on the network, with reduced over-fitting and an order of magnitude lower time complexity compared to BP. Moreover, the experiments show that the proposed framework performs well on deep neural networks and big datasets.

- **Summary**: Road intersection monitoring and control research often utilize bird's eye view (BEV) simulators. In real traffic settings, achieving a BEV akin to that in a simulator necessitates the deployment of drones or specific sensor mounting, which is neither feasible nor practical. Consequently, traffic intersection management remains confined to simulation environments given these constraints. In this paper, we address the gap between simulated environments and real-world implementation by introducing a novel deep-learning model that converts a single camera's perspective of a road intersection into a BEV. We created a simulation environment that closely resembles a real-world traffic junction. The proposed model transforms the vehicles into BEV images, facilitating road intersection monitoring and control model processing. Inspired by image transformation techniques, we propose a Spatial-Transformer Double Decoder-UNet (SDD-UNet) model that aims to eliminate the transformed image distortions. In addition, the model accurately estimates the vehicle's positions and enables the direct application of simulation-trained models in real-world contexts. SDD-UNet model achieves an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) above 95% which is 40% better than the original UNet model. The mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.102 and the centroid of the predicted mask is 0.14 meters displaced, on average, indicating high accuracy.

- **Summary**: Reduced biquaternion (RB), as a four-dimensional algebra highly suitable for representing color pixels, has recently garnered significant attention from numerous scholars. In this paper, for color image processing problems, we introduce a concept of the non-negative RB matrix and then use the multiplication properties of RB to propose a non-negative RB matrix factorization (NRBMF) model. The NRBMF model is introduced to address the challenge of reasonably establishing a non-negative quaternion matrix factorization model, which is primarily hindered by the multiplication properties of traditional quaternions. Furthermore, this paper transforms the problem of solving the NRBMF model into an RB alternating non-negative least squares (RB-ANNLS) problem. Then, by introducing a method to compute the gradient of the real function with RB matrix variables, we solve the RB-ANNLS optimization problem using the RB projected gradient algorithm and conduct a convergence analysis of the algorithm. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed NRBMF model in color face recognition.

- **Summary**: This paper explores self-supervised disentangled representation learning within sequential data, focusing on separating time-independent and time-varying factors in videos. We propose a new model that breaks the usual independence assumption between those factors by explicitly accounting for the causal relationship between the static/dynamic variables and that improves the model expressivity through additional Normalizing Flows. A formal definition of the factors is proposed. This formalism leads to the derivation of sufficient conditions for the ground truth factors to be identifiable, and to the introduction of a novel theoretically grounded disentanglement constraint that can be directly and efficiently incorporated into our new framework. The experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms previous complex state-of-the-art techniques in scenarios where the dynamics of a scene are influenced by its content.

- **Summary**: Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that collects and processes data at or near the source of data generation. The on-device learning at edge relies on device-to-device wireless communication to facilitate real-time data sharing and collaborative decision-making among multiple devices. This significantly improves the adaptability of the edge computing system to the changing environments. However, as the scale of the edge computing system is getting larger, communication among devices is becoming the bottleneck because of the limited bandwidth of wireless communication leads to large data transfer latency. To reduce the amount of device-to-device data transmission and accelerate on-device learning, in this paper, we propose Residual-INR, a fog computing-based communication-efficient on-device learning framework by utilizing implicit neural representation (INR) to compress images/videos into neural network weights. Residual-INR enhances data transfer efficiency by collecting JPEG images from edge devices, compressing them into INR format at the fog node, and redistributing them for on-device learning. By using a smaller INR for full image encoding and a separate object INR for high-quality object region reconstruction through residual encoding, our technique can reduce the encoding redundancy while maintaining the object quality. Residual-INR is a promising solution for edge on-device learning because it reduces data transmission by up to 5.16 x across a network of 10 edge devices. It also facilitates CPU-free accelerated on-device learning, achieving up to 2.9 x speedup without sacrificing accuracy. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sharclab/Residual-INR.

- **Summary**: Retinal foundation models aim to learn generalizable representations from diverse retinal images, facilitating label-efficient model adaptation across various ophthalmic tasks. Despite their success, current retinal foundation models are generally restricted to a single imaging modality, such as Color Fundus Photography (CFP) or Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), limiting their versatility. Moreover, these models may struggle to fully leverage expert annotations and overlook the valuable domain knowledge essential for domain-specific representation learning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce UrFound, a retinal foundation model designed to learn universal representations from both multimodal retinal images and domain knowledge. UrFound is equipped with a modality-agnostic image encoder and accepts either CFP or OCT images as inputs. To integrate domain knowledge into representation learning, we encode expert annotation in text supervision and propose a knowledge-guided masked modeling strategy for model pre-training. It involves reconstructing randomly masked patches of retinal images while predicting masked text tokens conditioned on the corresponding retinal image. This approach aligns multimodal images and textual expert annotations within a unified latent space, facilitating generalizable and domain-specific representation learning. Experimental results demonstrate that UrFound exhibits strong generalization ability and data efficiency when adapting to various tasks in retinal image analysis. By training on ~180k retinal images, UrFound significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art retinal foundation model trained on up to 1.6 million unlabelled images across 8 public retinal datasets.

- **Summary**: We present PRTGaussian, a realtime relightable novel-view synthesis method made possible by combining 3D Gaussians and Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT). By fitting relightable Gaussians to multi-view OLAT data, our method enables real-time, free-viewpoint relighting. By estimating the radiance transfer based on high-order spherical harmonics, we achieve a balance between capturing detailed relighting effects and maintaining computational efficiency. We utilize a two-stage process: in the first stage, we reconstruct a coarse geometry of the object from multi-view images. In the second stage, we initialize 3D Gaussians with the obtained point cloud, then simultaneously refine the coarse geometry and learn the light transport for each Gaussian. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets show that our approach can achieve fast and high-quality relighting for general objects.

- **Summary**: Conventional geometry-based SLAM systems lack dense 3D reconstruction capabilities since their data association usually relies on feature correspondences. Additionally, learning-based SLAM systems often fall short in terms of real-time performance and accuracy. Balancing real-time performance with dense 3D reconstruction capabilities is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a real-time RGB-D SLAM system that incorporates a novel view synthesis technique, 3D Gaussian Splatting, for 3D scene representation and pose estimation. This technique leverages the real-time rendering performance of 3D Gaussian Splatting with rasterization and allows for differentiable optimization in real time through CUDA implementation. We also enable mesh reconstruction from 3D Gaussians for explicit dense 3D reconstruction. To estimate accurate camera poses, we utilize a rotation-translation decoupled strategy with inverse optimization. This involves iteratively updating both in several iterations through gradient-based optimization. This process includes differentiably rendering RGB, depth, and silhouette maps and updating the camera parameters to minimize a combined loss of photometric loss, depth geometry loss, and visibility loss, given the existing 3D Gaussian map. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles to accurately represent surfaces due to the multi-view inconsistency of 3D Gaussians, which can lead to reduced accuracy in both camera pose estimation and scene reconstruction. To address this, we utilize depth priors as additional regularization to enforce geometric constraints, thereby improving the accuracy of both pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. We also provide extensive experimental results on public benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in terms of pose accuracy, geometric accuracy, and rendering performance.

- **Summary**: Abstract   Background: Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and computed tomography (CT) imaging are vital in diagnosing, managing, and monitoring lung diseases. A common issue in practice is the lack of access to recorded pulmonary functions despite available chest CT scans.   Purpose: To develop and validate a deep learning algorithm for predicting pulmonary function directly from chest CT scans.   Methods: The development cohort came from the Pittsburgh Lung Screening Study (PLuSS) (n=3619). The validation cohort came from the Specialized Centers of Clinically Oriented Research (SCCOR) in COPD (n=662). A deep learning model called BeyondCT, combining a three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, was used to predict forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) from non-contrasted inspiratory chest CT scans. A 3D CNN model without ViT was used for comparison. Subject demographics (age, gender, smoking status) were also incorporated into the model. Performance was compared to actual PFTs using mean absolute error (MAE, L), percentage error, and R square.   Results: The 3D-CNN model achieved MAEs of 0.395 L and 0.383 L, percentage errors of 13.84% and 18.85%, and R square of 0.665 and 0.679 for FVC and FEV1, respectively. The BeyondCT model without demographics had MAEs of 0.362 L and 0.371 L, percentage errors of 10.89% and 14.96%, and R square of 0.719 and 0.727, respectively. Including demographics improved performance (p<0.05), with MAEs of 0.356 L and 0.353 L, percentage errors of 10.79% and 14.82%, and R square of 0.77 and 0.739 for FVC and FEV1 in the test set.   Conclusion: The BeyondCT model showed robust performance in predicting lung function from non-contrast inspiratory chest CT scans.

- **Summary**: Road infrastructure maintenance in developing countries faces unique challenges due to resource constraints and diverse environmental factors. This study addresses the critical need for efficient, accurate, and locally-relevant pavement distress detection methods in these regions. We present a novel deep learning approach combining YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection models with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to simultaneously detect and classify multiple pavement distress types. The model demonstrates robust performance in detecting and classifying potholes, longitudinal cracks, alligator cracks, and raveling, with confidence scores ranging from 0.46 to 0.93. While some misclassifications occur in complex scenarios, these provide insights into unique challenges of pavement assessment in developing countries. Additionally, we developed a web-based application for real-time distress detection from images and videos. This research advances automated pavement distress detection and provides a tailored solution for developing countries, potentially improving road safety, optimizing maintenance strategies, and contributing to sustainable transportation infrastructure development.
