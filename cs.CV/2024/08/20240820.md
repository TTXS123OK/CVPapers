- **Summary**: Multimodal generative models are crucial for various applications. We propose an approach that combines an expressive energy-based model (EBM) prior with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference in the latent space for multimodal generation. The EBM prior acts as an informative guide, while MCMC inference, specifically through short-run Langevin dynamics, brings the posterior distribution closer to its true form. This method not only provides an expressive prior to better capture the complexity of multimodality but also improves the learning of shared latent variables for more coherent generation across modalities. Our proposed method is supported by empirical experiments, underscoring the effectiveness of our EBM prior with MCMC inference in enhancing cross-modal and joint generative tasks in multimodal contexts.

- **Summary**: Event camera-based visual tracking has drawn more and more attention in recent years due to the unique imaging principle and advantages of low energy consumption, high dynamic range, and dense temporal resolution. Current event-based tracking algorithms are gradually hitting their performance bottlenecks, due to the utilization of vision Transformer and the static template for target object localization. In this paper, we propose a novel Mamba-based visual tracking framework that adopts the state space model with linear complexity as a backbone network. The search regions and target template are fed into the vision Mamba network for simultaneous feature extraction and interaction. The output tokens of search regions will be fed into the tracking head for target localization. More importantly, we consider introducing a dynamic template update strategy into the tracking framework using the Memory Mamba network. By considering the diversity of samples in the target template library and making appropriate adjustments to the template memory module, a more effective dynamic template can be integrated. The effective combination of dynamic and static templates allows our Mamba-based tracking algorithm to achieve a good balance between accuracy and computational cost on multiple large-scale datasets, including EventVOT, VisEvent, and FE240hz. The source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/MambaEVT

  Event-based Sign Language Translation
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a core task in the field of AI-assisted disability. Unlike traditional SLT based on visible light videos, which is easily affected by factors such as lighting, rapid hand movements, and privacy breaches, this paper proposes the use of high-definition Event streams for SLT, effectively mitigating the aforementioned issues. This is primarily because Event streams have a high dynamic range and dense temporal signals, which can withstand low illumination and motion blur well. Additionally, due to their sparsity in space, they effectively protect the privacy of the target person. More specifically, we propose a new high-resolution Event stream sign language dataset, termed Event-CSL, which effectively fills the data gap in this area of research. It contains 14,827 videos, 14,821 glosses, and 2,544 Chinese words in the text vocabulary. These samples are collected in a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes, encompassing multiple angles, light intensities, and camera movements. We have benchmarked existing mainstream SLT works to enable fair comparison for future efforts. Based on this dataset and several other large-scale datasets, we propose a novel baseline method that fully leverages the Mamba model's ability to integrate temporal information of CNN features, resulting in improved sign language translation outcomes. Both the benchmark dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenESL

- **Summary**: Textile pilling assessment is critical for textile quality control. We collect thousands of 3D point cloud images in the actual test environment of textiles and organize and label them as TextileNet8 dataset. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first publicly available eight-categories 3D point cloud dataset in the field of textile pilling assessment. Based on PointGPT, the GPT-like big model of point cloud analysis, we incorporate the global features of the input point cloud extracted from the non-parametric network into it, thus proposing the PointGPT+NN model. Using TextileNet8 as a benchmark, the experimental results show that the proposed PointGPT+NN model achieves an overall accuracy (OA) of 91.8% and a mean per-class accuracy (mAcc) of 92.2%. Test results on other publicly available datasets also validate the competitive performance of the proposed PointGPT+NN model. The proposed TextileNet8 dataset will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Cervical cancer is a crucial global health concern for women, and the persistent infection of High-risk HPV mainly triggers this remains a global health challenge, with young women diagnosis rates soaring from 10\% to 40\% over three decades. While Pap smear screening is a prevalent diagnostic method, visual image analysis can be lengthy and often leads to mistakes. Early detection of the disease can contribute significantly to improving patient outcomes. In recent decades, many researchers have employed machine learning techniques that achieved promise in cervical cancer detection processes based on medical images. In recent years, many researchers have employed various deep-learning techniques to achieve high-performance accuracy in detecting cervical cancer but are still facing various challenges. This research proposes an innovative and novel approach to automate cervical cancer image classification using Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed method leverages the strengths of both MHSA mechanisms and CNN to effectively capture both local and global features within cervical images in two streams. MHSA facilitates the model's ability to focus on relevant regions of interest, while CNN extracts hierarchical features that contribute to accurate classification. Finally, we combined the two stream features and fed them into the classification module to refine the feature and the classification. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we used the SIPaKMeD dataset, which classifies cervical cells into five categories. Our model achieved a remarkable accuracy of 98.522\%. This performance has high recognition accuracy of medical image classification and holds promise for its applicability in other medical image recognition tasks.

- **Summary**: Assessing the forensic value of hand images involves the use of unique features and patterns present in an individual's hand. The human hand has distinct characteristics, such as the pattern of veins, fingerprints, and the geometry of the hand itself. This paper investigates the use of vision transformers (ViTs) for classification of hand images. We use explainability tools to explore the internal representations of ViTs and assess their impact on the model outputs. Utilizing the internal understanding of ViTs, we introduce distillation methods that allow a student model to adaptively extract knowledge from a teacher model while learning on data of a different domain to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Two publicly available hand image datasets are used to conduct a series of experiments to evaluate performance of the ViTs and our proposed adaptive distillation methods. The experimental results demonstrate that ViT models significantly outperform traditional machine learning methods and the internal states of ViTs are useful for explaining the model outputs in the classification task. By averting catastrophic forgetting, our distillation methods achieve excellent performance on data from both source and target domains, particularly when these two domains exhibit significant dissimilarity. The proposed approaches therefore can be developed and implemented effectively for real-world applications such as access control, identity verification, and authentication systems.

- **Summary**: People commonly communicate in English, Arabic, and Bengali spoken languages through various mediums. However, deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals primarily use body language and sign language to express their needs and achieve independence. Sign language research is burgeoning to enhance communication with the deaf community. While many researchers have made strides in recognizing sign languages such as French, British, Arabic, Turkish, and American, there has been limited research on Bangla sign language (BdSL) with less-than-satisfactory results. One significant barrier has been the lack of a comprehensive Bangla sign language dataset. In our work, we introduced a new BdSL dataset comprising alphabets totaling 18,000 images, with each image being 224x224 pixels in size. Our dataset encompasses 36 Bengali symbols, of which 30 are consonants and the remaining six are vowels. Despite our dataset contribution, many existing systems continue to grapple with achieving high-performance accuracy for BdSL. To address this, we devised a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, integrating multiple convolutional layers, activation functions, dropout techniques, and LSTM layers. Upon evaluating our hybrid-CNN model with the newly created BdSL dataset, we achieved an accuracy rate of 97.92\%. We are confident that both our BdSL dataset and hybrid CNN model will be recognized as significant milestones in BdSL research.

- **Summary**: Transformers, renowned for their powerful feature extraction capabilities, have played an increasingly prominent role in various vision tasks. Especially, recent advancements present transformer with hierarchical structures such as Dilated Neighborhood Attention Transformer (DiNAT), demonstrating outstanding ability to efficiently capture both global and local features. However, transformers' application in edge detection has not been fully exploited. In this paper, we propose EdgeNAT, a one-stage transformer-based edge detector with DiNAT as the encoder, capable of extracting object boundaries and meaningful edges both accurately and efficiently. On the one hand, EdgeNAT captures global contextual information and detailed local cues with DiNAT, on the other hand, it enhances feature representation with a novel SCAF-MLA decoder by utilizing both inter-spatial and inter-channel relationships of feature maps. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both RGB and depth images. Notably, on the widely used BSDS500 dataset, our L model achieves impressive performances, with ODS F-measure and OIS F-measure of 86.0%, 87.6% for multi-scale input,and 84.9%, and 86.3% for single-scale input, surpassing the current state-of-the-art EDTER by 1.2%, 1.1%, 1.7%, and 1.6%, respectively. Moreover, as for throughput, our approach runs at 20.87 FPS on RTX 4090 GPU with single-scale input. The code for our method will be released soon.

- **Summary**: With diet and nutrition apps reaching 1.4 billion users in 2022 [1], it's no surprise that health apps like MyFitnessPal, Noom, and Calorie Counter, are surging in popularity. However, one major setback [2] of nearly all nutrition applications is that users must enter food data manually, which is time-consuming and tedious. Thus, there has been an increasing demand for applications that can accurately identify food items, analyze their nutritional content, and offer dietary recommendations in real-time. This paper introduces a comprehensive system that combines advanced computer vision techniques with nutrition analysis, implemented in a versatile mobile and web application. The system is divided into three key components: 1) food detection using the YOLOv8 model, 2) nutrient analysis via the Edamam Nutrition Analysis API, and 3) personalized meal recommendations using the Edamam Meal Planning and Recipe Search APIs. Designed for both mobile and web platforms, the application ensures fast processing times with an intuitive user interface, with features such as data visualizations using Chart.js, a login system, and personalized settings for dietary preferences, allergies, and cuisine choices. Preliminary results showcase the system's effectiveness, making it a valuable tool for users to make informed dietary decisions.

- **Summary**: The goal of image style transfer is to render an image guided by a style reference while maintaining the original content. Existing image-guided methods rely on specific style reference images, restricting their wider application and potentially compromising result quality. As a flexible alternative, text-guided methods allow users to describe the desired style using text prompts. Despite their versatility, these methods often struggle with maintaining style consistency, reflecting the described style accurately, and preserving the content of the target image. To address these challenges, we introduce FAGStyle, a zero-shot text-guided diffusion image style transfer method. Our approach enhances inter-patch information interaction by incorporating the Sliding Window Crop technique and Feature Augmentation on Geodesic Surface into our style control loss. Furthermore, we integrate a Pre-Shape self-correlation consistency loss to ensure content consistency. FAGStyle demonstrates superior performance over existing methods, consistently achieving stylization that retains the semantic content of the source image. Experimental results confirms the efficacy of FAGStyle across a diverse range of source contents and styles, both imagined and common.

- **Summary**: Point cloud semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the perception of an intelligent agent. Nevertheless, the discriminative capability of the segmentation network is influenced by the quantity of samples available for different categories. To mitigate the cognitive bias induced by class imbalance, this paper introduces a novel method, namely subspace prototype guidance (\textbf{SPG}), to guide the training of segmentation network. Specifically, the point cloud is initially separated into independent point sets by category to provide initial conditions for the generation of feature subspaces. The auxiliary branch which consists of an encoder and a projection head maps these point sets into separate feature subspaces. Subsequently, the feature prototypes which are extracted from the current separate subspaces and then combined with prototypes of historical subspaces guide the feature space of main branch to enhance the discriminability of features of minority categories. The prototypes derived from the feature space of main branch are also employed to guide the training of the auxiliary branch, forming a supervisory loop to maintain consistent convergence of the entire network. The experiments conducted on the large public benchmarks (i.e. S3DIS, ScanNet v2, ScanNet200, Toronto-3D) and collected real-world data illustrate that the proposed method significantly improves the segmentation performance and surpasses the state-of-the-art method.

- **Summary**: Pringle maneuver (PM) in laparoscopic liver resection aims to reduce blood loss and provide a clear surgical view by intermittently blocking blood inflow of the liver, whereas prolonged PM may cause ischemic injury. To comprehensively monitor this surgical procedure and provide timely warnings of ineffective and prolonged blocking, we suggest two complementary AI-assisted surgical monitoring tasks: workflow recognition and blocking effectiveness detection in liver resections. The former presents challenges in real-time capturing of short-term PM, while the latter involves the intraoperative discrimination of long-term liver ischemia states. To address these challenges, we meticulously collect a novel dataset, called PmLR50, consisting of 25,037 video frames covering various surgical phases from 50 laparoscopic liver resection procedures. Additionally, we develop an online baseline for PmLR50, termed PmNet. This model embraces Masked Temporal Encoding (MTE) and Compressed Sequence Modeling (CSM) for efficient short-term and long-term temporal information modeling, and embeds Contrastive Prototype Separation (CPS) to enhance action discrimination between similar intraoperative operations. Experimental results demonstrate that PmNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art surgical workflow recognition methods on the PmLR50 benchmark. Our research offers potential clinical applications for the laparoscopic liver surgery community. Source code and data will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: The labelling difficulty has been a longstanding problem in deep image matting. To escape from fine labels, this work explores using rough annotations such as trimaps coarsely indicating the foreground/background as supervision. We present that the cooperation between learned semantics from indicated known regions and proper assumed matting rules can help infer alpha values at transition areas. Inspired by the nonlocal principle in traditional image matting, we build a directional distance consistency loss (DDC loss) at each pixel neighborhood to constrain the alpha values conditioned on the input image. DDC loss forces the distance of similar pairs on the alpha matte and on its corresponding image to be consistent. In this way, the alpha values can be propagated from learned known regions to unknown transition areas. With only images and trimaps, a matting model can be trained under the supervision of a known loss and the proposed DDC loss. Experiments on AM-2K and P3M-10K dataset show that our paradigm achieves comparable performance with the fine-label-supervised baseline, while sometimes offers even more satisfying results than human-labelled ground truth.

- **Summary**: Referring Video Object Segmentation is an emerging multi-modal task that aims to segment objects in the video given a natural language expression. In this work, we build two instance-centric models and fuse predicted results from frame-level and instance-level. First, we introduce instance mask into the DETR-based model for query initialization to achieve temporal enhancement and employ SAM for spatial refinement. Secondly, we build an instance retrieval model conducting binary instance mask classification whether the instance is referred. Finally, we fuse predicted results and our method achieved a score of 52.67 J&F in the validation phase and 60.36 J&F in the test phase, securing the final ranking of 3rd place in the 6-th LSVOS Challenge RVOS Track.

- **Summary**: Stable diffusion networks have emerged as a groundbreaking development for their ability to produce realistic and detailed visual content. This characteristic renders them ideal decoders, capable of producing high-quality and aesthetically pleasing reconstructions. In this paper, we introduce the first diffusion-based point cloud compression method, dubbed Diff-PCC, to leverage the expressive power of the diffusion model for generative and aesthetically superior decoding. Different from the conventional autoencoder fashion, a dual-space latent representation is devised in this paper, in which a compressor composed of two independent encoding backbones is considered to extract expressive shape latents from distinct latent spaces. At the decoding side, a diffusion-based generator is devised to produce high-quality reconstructions by considering the shape latents as guidance to stochastically denoise the noisy point clouds. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed Diff-PCC achieves state-of-the-art compression performance (e.g., 7.711 dB BD-PSNR gains against the latest G-PCC standard at ultra-low bitrate) while attaining superior subjective quality. Source code will be made publicly available.

Traditional methods rely on fiducial markers, involving much manual labor and careful setup. Recent advancements in deep learning offer markerless techniques, but they present challenges, including the need for retraining networks for each robot, the requirement of accurate mesh models for data generation, and the need to address the sim-to-real gap. In this letter, we propose Kalib, an automatic and universal markerless hand-eye calibration pipeline that leverages the generalizability of visual foundation models to eliminate these barriers. In each calibration process, Kalib uses keypoint tracking and proprioceptive sensors to estimate the transformation between a robot's coordinate space and its corresponding points in camera space. Our method does not require training new networks or access to mesh models. Through evaluations in simulation environments and the real-world dataset DROID, Kalib demonstrates superior accuracy compared to recent baseline methods. This approach provides an effective and flexible calibration process for various robot systems by simplifying setup and removing dependency on precise physical markers.

- **Summary**: We introduce Scaffold Prompt Tuning (ScaPT), a novel prompt-based framework for adapting large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) pre-trained models to downstream tasks, with high parameter efficiency and improved performance compared to fine-tuning and baselines for prompt tuning. The full fine-tuning updates all pre-trained parameters, which may distort the learned feature space and lead to overfitting with limited training data which is common in fMRI fields. In contrast, we design a hierarchical prompt structure that transfers the knowledge learned from high-resource tasks to low-resource ones. This structure, equipped with a Deeply-conditioned Input-Prompt (DIP) mapping module, allows for efficient adaptation by updating only 2% of the trainable parameters. The framework enhances semantic interpretability through attention mechanisms between inputs and prompts, and it clusters prompts in the latent space in alignment with prior knowledge. Experiments on public resting state fMRI datasets reveal ScaPT outperforms fine-tuning and multitask-based prompt tuning in neurodegenerative diseases diagnosis/prognosis and personality trait prediction, even with fewer than 20 participants. It highlights ScaPT's efficiency in adapting pre-trained fMRI models to low-resource tasks.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have revolutionized customized text-to-image generation, allowing for efficient synthesis of photos from personal data with textual descriptions. However, these advancements bring forth risks including privacy breaches and unauthorized replication of artworks. Previous researches primarily center around using prompt-specific methods to generate adversarial examples to protect personal images, yet the effectiveness of existing methods is hindered by constrained adaptability to different prompts. In this paper, we introduce a Prompt-Agnostic Adversarial Perturbation (PAP) method for customized diffusion models. PAP first models the prompt distribution using a Laplace Approximation, and then produces prompt-agnostic perturbations by maximizing a disturbance expectation based on the modeled distribution. This approach effectively tackles the prompt-agnostic attacks, leading to improved defense stability. Extensive experiments in face privacy and artistic style protection, demonstrate the superior generalization of our method in comparison to existing techniques.

The detailed implementation steps are demonstrated with an explanation. Whilst the proposed CNN architecture is demonstrated to achieve more than 99% accuracy for the test dataset, the computational procedure of CNN remains a black box. The visualisation based on Grad-CAM is attempted to explain such very high accuracy and may provide useful information for physicians. Future motivation based on this work is discussed.

- **Summary**: Text-Video Retrieval (TVR) aims to align and associate relevant video content with corresponding natural language queries. Most existing TVR methods are based on large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP). However, due to the inherent plain structure of CLIP, few TVR methods explore the multi-scale representations which offer richer contextual information for a more thorough understanding. To this end, we propose MUSE, a multi-scale mamba with linear computational complexity for efficient cross-resolution modeling. Specifically, the multi-scale representations are generated by applying a feature pyramid on the last single-scale feature map. Then, we employ the Mamba structure as an efficient multi-scale learner to jointly learn scale-wise representations. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive studies to investigate different model structures and designs. Extensive results on three popular benchmarks have validated the superiority of MUSE.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: This work introduces a novel and generalizable multi-view Hand Mesh Reconstruction (HMR) model, named POEM, designed for practical use in real-world hand motion capture scenarios. The advances of the POEM model consist of two main aspects. First, concerning the modeling of the problem, we propose embedding a static basis point within the multi-view stereo space. A point represents a natural form of 3D information and serves as an ideal medium for fusing features across different views, given its varied projections across these views. Consequently, our method harnesses a simple yet effective idea: a complex 3D hand mesh can be represented by a set of 3D basis points that 1) are embedded in the multi-view stereo, 2) carry features from the multi-view images, and 3) encompass the hand in it. The second advance lies in the training strategy. We utilize a combination of five large-scale multi-view datasets and employ randomization in the number, order, and poses of the cameras. By processing such a vast amount of data and a diverse array of camera configurations, our model demonstrates notable generalizability in the real-world applications. As a result, POEM presents a highly practical, plug-and-play solution that enables user-friendly, cost-effective multi-view motion capture for both left and right hands. The model and source codes are available at https://github.com/JubSteven/POEM-v2.

- **Summary**: Although neural rendering has made significant advancements in creating lifelike, animatable full-body and head avatars, incorporating detailed expressions into full-body avatars remains largely unexplored. We present DEGAS, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based modeling method for full-body avatars with rich facial expressions. Trained on multiview videos of a given subject, our method learns a conditional variational autoencoder that takes both the body motion and facial expression as driving signals to generate Gaussian maps in the UV layout. To drive the facial expressions, instead of the commonly used 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) in 3D head avatars, we propose to adopt the expression latent space trained solely on 2D portrait images, bridging the gap between 2D talking faces and 3D avatars. Leveraging the rendering capability of 3DGS and the rich expressiveness of the expression latent space, the learned avatars can be reenacted to reproduce photorealistic rendering images with subtle and accurate facial expressions. Experiments on an existing dataset and our newly proposed dataset of full-body talking avatars demonstrate the efficacy of our method. We also propose an audio-driven extension of our method with the help of 2D talking faces, opening new possibilities to interactive AI agents.

- **Summary**: Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) converts sign videos directly into spoken language sentences without relying on glosses. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable translation performance in gloss-free methods by harnessing their powerful natural language generation capabilities. However, these methods often rely on domain-specific fine-tuning of visual encoders to achieve optimal results. By contrast, this paper emphasizes the importance of capturing the spatial configurations and motion dynamics inherent in sign language. With this in mind, we introduce Spatial and Motion-based Sign Language Translation (SpaMo), a novel LLM-based SLT framework. The core idea of SpaMo is simple yet effective. We first extract spatial and motion features using off-the-shelf visual encoders and then input these features into an LLM with a language prompt. Additionally, we employ a visual-text alignment process as a warm-up before the SLT supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that SpaMo achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets, PHOENIX14T and How2Sign.

- **Summary**: In high-energy physics, anti-neutrons ($\bar{n}$) are fundamental particles that frequently appear as final-state particles, and the reconstruction of their kinematic properties provides an important probe for understanding the governing principles. However, this confronts significant challenges instrumentally with the electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC), a typical experimental sensor but recovering the information of incident $\bar{n}$ insufficiently. In this study, we introduce Vision Calorimeter (ViC), a baseline method for anti-neutron reconstruction that leverages deep learning detectors to analyze the implicit relationships between EMC responses and incident $\bar{n}$ characteristics. Our motivation lies in that energy distributions of $\bar{n}$ samples deposited in the EMC cell arrays embody rich contextual information. Converted to 2-D images, such contextual energy distributions can be used to predict the status of $\bar{n}$ ($i.e.$, incident position and momentum) through a deep learning detector along with pseudo bounding boxes and a specified training objective. Experimental results demonstrate that ViC substantially outperforms the conventional reconstruction approach, reducing the prediction error of incident position by 42.81% (from 17.31$^{\circ}$ to 9.90$^{\circ}$). More importantly, this study for the first time realizes the measurement of incident $\bar{n}$ momentum, underscoring the potential of deep learning detectors for particle reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Background: Breast ultrasound is prominently used in diagnosing breast tumors. At present, many automatic systems based on deep learning have been developed to help radiologists in diagnosis. However, training such systems remains challenging because they are usually data-hungry and demand amounts of labeled data, which need professional knowledge and are expensive. Methods: We adopted a triplet network and a self-supervised contrastive learning technique to learn representations from unlabeled breast ultrasound video clips. We further designed a new hard triplet loss to to learn representations that particularly discriminate positive and negative image pairs that are hard to recognize. We also constructed a pretraining dataset from breast ultrasound videos (1,360 videos from 200 patients), which includes an anchor sample dataset with 11,805 images, a positive sample dataset with 188,880 images, and a negative sample dataset dynamically generated from video clips. Further, we constructed a finetuning dataset, including 400 images from 66 patients. We transferred the pretrained network to a downstream benign/malignant classification task and compared the performance with other state-of-the-art models, including three models pretrained on ImageNet and a previous contrastive learning model retrained on our datasets. Results and conclusion: Experiments revealed that our model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.952, which is significantly higher than the others. Further, we assessed the dependence of our pretrained model on the number of labeled data and revealed that <100 samples were required to achieve an AUC of 0.901. The proposed framework greatly reduces the demand for labeled data and holds potential for use in automatic breast ultrasound image diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Effectively summarizing dense 3D point cloud data and extracting motion information of moving objects (moving object segmentation, MOS) is crucial to autonomous driving and robotics applications. How to effectively utilize motion and semantic features and avoid information loss during 3D-to-2D projection is still a key challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view MOS model (MV-MOS) by fusing motion-semantic features from different 2D representations of point clouds. To effectively exploit complementary information, the motion branches of the proposed model combines motion features from both bird's eye view (BEV) and range view (RV) representations. In addition, a semantic branch is introduced to provide supplementary semantic features of moving objects. Finally, a Mamba module is utilized to fuse the semantic features with motion features and provide effective guidance for the motion branches. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed multi-branch fusion MOS framework via comprehensive experiments, and our proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on the SemanticKITTI benchmark.

- **Summary**: Despite recent advancements in text-to-image generation, most existing methods struggle to create images with multiple objects and complex spatial relationships in 3D world. To tackle this limitation, we introduce a generic AI system, namely MUSES, for 3D-controllable image generation from user queries. Specifically, our MUSES addresses this challenging task by developing a progressive workflow with three key components, including (1) Layout Manager for 2D-to-3D layout lifting, (2) Model Engineer for 3D object acquisition and calibration, (3) Image Artist for 3D-to-2D image rendering. By mimicking the collaboration of human professionals, this multi-modal agent pipeline facilitates the effective and automatic creation of images with 3D-controllable objects, through an explainable integration of top-down planning and bottom-up generation. Additionally, we find that existing benchmarks lack detailed descriptions of complex 3D spatial relationships of multiple objects. To fill this gap, we further construct a new benchmark of T2I-3DisBench (3D image scene), which describes diverse 3D image scenes with 50 detailed prompts. Extensive experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of MUSES on both T2I-CompBench and T2I-3DisBench, outperforming recent strong competitors such as DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion 3. These results demonstrate a significant step of MUSES forward in bridging natural language, 2D image generation, and 3D world.

- **Summary**: SOTA facial expression recognition (FER) methods fail on test sets that have domain gaps with the train set. Recent domain adaptation FER methods need to acquire labeled or unlabeled samples of target domains to fine-tune the FER model, which might be infeasible in real-world deployment. In this paper, we aim to improve the zero-shot generalization ability of FER methods on different unseen test sets using only one train set. Inspired by how humans first detect faces and then select expression features, we propose a novel FER pipeline to extract expression-related features from any given face images. Our method is based on the generalizable face features extracted by large models like CLIP. However, it is non-trivial to adapt the general features of CLIP for specific tasks like FER. To preserve the generalization ability of CLIP and the high precision of the FER model, we design a novel approach that learns sigmoid masks based on the fixed CLIP face features to extract expression features. To further improve the generalization ability on unseen test sets, we separate the channels of the learned masked features according to the expression classes to directly generate logits and avoid using the FC layer to reduce overfitting. We also introduce a channel-diverse loss to make the learned masks separated. Extensive experiments on five different FER datasets verify that our method outperforms SOTA FER methods by large margins. Code is available in https://github.com/zyh-uaiaaaa/Generalizable-FER.

- **Summary**: Over the past two decades, researchers in the field of visual aesthetics have studied numerous quantitative (objective) image properties and how they relate to visual aesthetic appreciation. However, results are difficult to compare between research groups. One reason is that researchers use different sets of image properties in their studies. But even if the same properties are used, the image pre-processing techniques may differ and often researchers use their own customized scripts to calculate the image properties. To provide greater accessibility and comparability of research results in visual experimental aesthetics, we developed an open-access and easy-to-use toolbox (called the 'Aesthetics Toolbox'). The Toolbox allows users to calculate a well-defined set of quantitative image properties popular in contemporary research. The properties include lightness and color statistics, Fourier spectral properties, fractality, self-similarity, symmetry, as well as different entropy measures and CNN-based variances. Compatible with most devices, the Toolbox provides an intuitive click-and-drop web interface. In the Toolbox, we integrated the original scripts of four different research groups and translated them into Python 3. To ensure that results were consistent across analyses, we took care that results from the Python versions of the scripts were the same as those from the original scripts. The toolbox, detailed documentation, and a link to the cloud version are available via Github: https://github.com/RBartho/Aesthetics-Toolbox. In summary, we developed a toolbox that helps to standardize and simplify the calculation of quantitative image properties for visual aesthetics research.

- **Comment**: OccMamba is Coming!
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Air-ground robots (AGRs) are widely used in surveillance and disaster response due to their exceptional mobility and versatility (i.e., flying and driving). Current AGR navigation systems perform well in static occlusion-prone environments (e.g., indoors) by using 3D semantic occupancy networks to predict occlusions for complete local mapping and then computing Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) for path planning. However, these systems face challenges in dynamic, severe occlusion scenes (e.g., crowds) due to limitations in perception networks' low prediction accuracy and path planners' high computation overhead. In this paper, we propose OMEGA, which contains OccMamba with an Efficient AGR-Planner to address the above-mentioned problems. OccMamba adopts a novel architecture that separates semantic and occupancy prediction into independent branches, incorporating two mamba blocks within these branches. These blocks efficiently extract semantic and geometric features in 3D environments with linear complexity, ensuring that the network can learn long-distance dependencies to improve prediction accuracy. Semantic and geometric features are combined within the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space to minimise computational overhead during feature fusion. The resulting semantic occupancy map is then seamlessly integrated into the local map, providing occlusion awareness of the dynamic environment. Our AGR-Planner utilizes this local map and employs kinodynamic A* search and gradient-based trajectory optimization to guarantee planning is ESDF-free and energy-efficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OccMamba outperforms the state-of-the-art 3D semantic occupancy network with 25.0% mIoU. End-to-end navigation experiments in dynamic scenes verify OMEGA's efficiency, achieving a 96% average planning success rate. Code and video are available at https://jmwang0117.github.io/OMEGA/.

- **Summary**: Change detection is a crucial task in remote sensing, enabling the monitoring of environmental changes, urban growth, and disaster impact. Conventional change detection techniques, such as image differencing and ratioing, often struggle with noise and fail to capture complex variations in imagery. Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly generative models like diffusion models, offer new opportunities for enhancing change detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel change detection framework that combines the strengths of Stable Diffusion models with the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to create robust and interpretable change maps. Our approach, named Diffusion Based Change Detector, is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world remote sensing datasets and compared with state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional differencing techniques and recent deep learning-based methods, particularly in scenarios with complex changes and noise.

- **Summary**: Scene text editing aims to modify texts on images while maintaining the style of newly generated text similar to the original. Given an image, a target area, and target text, the task produces an output image with the target text in the selected area, replacing the original. This task has been studied extensively, with initial success using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to balance text fidelity and style similarity. However, GAN-based methods struggled with complex backgrounds or text styles. Recent works leverage diffusion models, showing improved results, yet still face challenges, especially with non-Latin languages like CJK characters (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) that have complex glyphs, often producing inaccurate or unrecognizable characters. To address these issues, we present \emph{TextMastero} - a carefully designed multilingual scene text editing architecture based on latent diffusion models (LDMs). TextMastero introduces two key modules: a glyph conditioning module for fine-grained content control in generating accurate texts, and a latent guidance module for providing comprehensive style information to ensure similarity before and after editing. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses all known existing works in text fidelity and style similarity.

- **Summary**: For the visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) task, one of the primary challenges lies in significant cross-modality discrepancy. Existing methods struggle to conduct modality-invariant information mining. They often focus solely on mining singular dimensions like spatial or channel, and overlook the extraction of specific-modality multi-dimension information. To fully mine modality-invariant information across a wide range, we introduce the Wide-Ranging Information Mining Network (WRIM-Net), which mainly comprises a Multi-dimension Interactive Information Mining (MIIM) module and an Auxiliary-Information-based Contrastive Learning (AICL) approach. Empowered by the proposed Global Region Interaction (GRI), MIIM comprehensively mines non-local spatial and channel information through intra-dimension interaction. Moreover, Thanks to the low computational complexity design, separate MIIM can be positioned in shallow layers, enabling the network to better mine specific-modality multi-dimension information. AICL, by introducing the novel Cross-Modality Key-Instance Contrastive (CMKIC) loss, effectively guides the network in extracting modality-invariant information. We conduct extensive experiments not only on the well-known SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets but also on the latest large-scale cross-modality LLCM dataset. The results demonstrate WRIM-Net's superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Video segmentation aims at partitioning video sequences into meaningful segments based on objects or regions of interest within frames. Current video segmentation models are often derived from image segmentation techniques, which struggle to cope with small-scale or class-imbalanced video datasets. This leads to inconsistent segmentation results across frames. To address these issues, we propose a training strategy Masked Video Consistency, which enhances spatial and temporal feature aggregation. MVC introduces a training strategy that randomly masks image patches, compelling the network to predict the entire semantic segmentation, thus improving contextual information integration. Additionally, we introduce Object Masked Attention (OMA) to optimize the cross-attention mechanism by reducing the impact of irrelevant queries, thereby enhancing temporal modeling capabilities. Our approach, integrated into the latest decoupled universal video segmentation framework, achieves state-of-the-art performance across five datasets for three video segmentation tasks, demonstrating significant improvements over previous methods without increasing model parameters.

- **Summary**: Ultrawide-field fluorescein angiography (UWF-FA) facilitates diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection by providing a clear visualization of peripheral retinal lesions. However, the intravenous dye injection with potential risks hamper its application. We aim to acquire dye-free UWF-FA images from noninvasive UWF color fundus (UWF-CF) images using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and evaluate its effectiveness in DR screening. A total of 18,321 UWF-FA images of different phases were registered with corresponding UWF-CF images and fed into a generative adversarial networks (GAN)-based model for training. The quality of generated UWF-FA images was evaluated through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. The DeepDRiD dataset was used to externally assess the contribution of generated UWF-FA images to DR classification, using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) as outcome metrics. The generated early, mid, and late phase UWF-FA images achieved high authenticity, with multi-scale similarity scores ranging from 0.70 to 0.91 and qualitative visual scores ranging from 1.64 to 1.98 (1=real UWF-FA quality). In fifty randomly selected images, 56% to 76% of the generated images were difficult to distinguish from real images in the Turing test. Moreover, adding these generated UWF-FA images for DR classification significantly increased the AUROC from 0.869 to 0.904 compared to the baseline model using UWF-CF images (P < .001). The model successfully generates realistic multi-frame UWF-FA images without intravenous dye injection. The generated UWF-FA enhanced DR stratification.

- **Summary**: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection plays a key role in high-level visual understanding, facilitating a deep comprehension of human activities. Specifically, HOI detection aims to locate the humans and objects involved in interactions within images or videos and classify the specific interactions between them. The success of this task is influenced by several key factors, including the accurate localization of human and object instances, as well as the correct classification of object categories and interaction relationships. This paper systematically summarizes and discusses the recent work in image-based HOI detection. First, the mainstream datasets involved in HOI relationship detection are introduced. Furthermore, starting with two-stage methods and end-to-end one-stage detection approaches, this paper comprehensively discusses the current developments in image-based HOI detection, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of these two methods. Additionally, the advancements of zero-shot learning, weakly supervised learning, and the application of large-scale language models in HOI detection are discussed. Finally, the current challenges in HOI detection are outlined, and potential research directions and future trends are explored.

- **Summary**: Most recent 3D instance segmentation methods are open vocabulary, offering a greater flexibility than closed-vocabulary methods. Yet, they are limited to reasoning within a specific set of concepts, \ie the vocabulary, prompted by the user at test time. In essence, these models cannot reason in an open-ended fashion, i.e., answering ``List the objects in the scene.''. We introduce the first method to address 3D instance segmentation in a setting that is void of any vocabulary prior, namely a vocabulary-free setting. We leverage a large vision-language assistant and an open-vocabulary 2D instance segmenter to discover and ground semantic categories on the posed images. To form 3D instance mask, we first partition the input point cloud into dense superpoints, which are then merged into 3D instance masks. We propose a novel superpoint merging strategy via spectral clustering, accounting for both mask coherence and semantic coherence that are estimated from the 2D object instance masks. We evaluate our method using ScanNet200 and Replica, outperforming existing methods in both vocabulary-free and open-vocabulary settings. Code will be made available.

- **Summary**: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) plays a crucial role in various marine applications, but it remains challenging due to the complex underwater environment. Current learning-based approaches frequently lack explicit incorporation of prior knowledge about the physical processes involved in underwater image formation, resulting in limited optimization despite their impressive enhancement results. This paper proposes a novel deep unfolding network (DUN) for UIE that integrates color priors and inter-stage feature transformation to improve enhancement performance. The proposed DUN model combines the iterative optimization and reliability of model-based methods with the flexibility and representational power of deep learning, offering a more explainable and stable solution compared to existing learning-based UIE approaches. The proposed model consists of three key components: a Color Prior Guidance Block (CPGB) that establishes a mapping between color channels of degraded and original images, a Nonlinear Activation Gradient Descent Module (NAGDM) that simulates the underwater image degradation process, and an Inter Stage Feature Transformer (ISF-Former) that facilitates feature exchange between different network stages. By explicitly incorporating color priors and modeling the physical characteristics of underwater image formation, the proposed DUN model achieves more accurate and reliable enhancement results. Extensive experiments on multiple underwater image datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. The proposed DUN-based approach offers a promising solution for UIE, enabling more accurate and reliable scientific analysis in marine research.

- **Summary**: Voxel-based Morphometry (VBM) has emerged as a powerful approach in neuroimaging research, utilized in over 7,000 studies since the year 2000. Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data, VBM assesses variations in the local density of brain tissue and examines its associations with biological and psychometric variables. Here, we present deepmriprep, a neural network-based pipeline that performs all necessary preprocessing steps for VBM analysis of T1-weighted MR images using deep neural networks. Utilizing the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), deepmriprep is 37 times faster than CAT12, the leading VBM preprocessing toolbox. The proposed method matches CAT12 in accuracy for tissue segmentation and image registration across more than 100 datasets and shows strong correlations in VBM results. Tissue segmentation maps from deepmriprep have over 95% agreement with ground truth maps, and its non-linear registration, using supervised SYMNet, predicts smooth deformation fields comparable to CAT12. The high processing speed of deepmriprep enables rapid preprocessing of extensive datasets and thereby fosters the application of VBM analysis to large-scale neuroimaging studies and opens the door to real-time applications. Finally, deepmripreps straightforward, modular design enables researchers to easily understand, reuse, and advance the underlying methods, fostering further advancements in neuroimaging research. deepmriprep can be conveniently installed as a Python package and is publicly accessible at https://github.com/wwu-mmll/deepmriprep.

- **Summary**: The accurate measurement of the wave field and its spatiotemporal evolution is essential in many hydrodynamic experiments and engineering applications. The binocular stereo imaging technique has been widely used to measure waves. However, the optical properties of indoor water surfaces, including transparency, specular reflection, and texture absence, pose challenges for image processing and stereo reconstruction. This study proposed a novel technique that combined thermal stereography and deep learning to achieve fully noncontact wave measurements. The optical imaging properties of water in the long-wave infrared spectrum were found to be suitable for stereo matching, effectively avoiding the issues in the visible-light spectrum. After capturing wave images using thermal stereo cameras, a reconstruction strategy involving deep learning techniques was proposed to improve stereo matching performance. A generative approach was employed to synthesize a dataset with ground-truth disparity from unannotated infrared images. This dataset was then fed to a pretrained stereo neural network for fine-tuning to achieve domain adaptation. Wave flume experiments were conducted to validate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed technique. The final reconstruction results indicated great agreement and high accuracy with a mean bias of less than 2.1% compared with the measurements obtained using wave probes, suggesting that the novel technique effectively measures the spatiotemporal distribution of wave surface in hydrodynamic experiments.

- **Summary**: Moire patterns arise when two similar repetitive patterns interfere, a phenomenon frequently observed during the capture of images or videos on screens. The color, shape, and location of moire patterns may differ across video frames, posing a challenge in learning information from adjacent frames and preserving temporal consistency. Previous video demoireing methods heavily rely on well-designed alignment modules, resulting in substantial computational burdens. Recently, Mamba, an improved version of the State Space Model (SSM), has demonstrated significant potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, enabling efficient temporal modeling in video demoireing without requiring a specific alignment module. In this paper, we propose a novel alignment-free Raw video demoireing network with frequency-assisted spatio-temporal Mamba (DemMamba). The Spatial Mamba Block (SMB) and Temporal Mamba Block (TMB) are sequentially arranged to facilitate effective intra- and inter-relationship modeling in Raw videos with moire patterns. Within SMB, an Adaptive Frequency Block (AFB) is introduced to aid demoireing in the frequency domain. For TMB, a Channel Attention Block (CAB) is embedded to further enhance temporal information interactions by exploiting the inter-channel relationships among features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DemMamba surpasses state-of-the-art approaches by 1.3 dB and delivers a superior visual experience.

- **Summary**: Recently, large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP), have garnered significant attention thanks to their powerful representative capabilities. This inspires researchers in transferring the knowledge from these large pre-trained models to other task-specific models, e.g., Video Action Recognition (VAR) models, via particularly leveraging side networks to enhance the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, current transferring approaches in VAR tend to directly transfer the frozen knowledge from large pre-trained models to action recognition networks with minimal cost, instead of exploiting the temporal modeling capabilities of the action recognition models themselves. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a memory-efficient Temporal Difference Side Network (TDS-CLIP) to balance knowledge transferring and temporal modeling, avoiding backpropagation in frozen parameter models. Specifically, we introduce a Temporal Difference Adapter (TD-Adapter), which can effectively capture local temporal differences in motion features to strengthen the model's global temporal modeling capabilities. Furthermore, we designed a Side Motion Enhancement Adapter (SME-Adapter) to guide the proposed side network in efficiently learning the rich motion information in videos, thereby improving the side network's ability to capture and learn motion information. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets, including Something-Something V1\&V2, and Kinetics-400. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks have recently achieved promising performance in the vein recognition task and have shown an increasing application trend, however, they are prone to adversarial perturbation attacks by adding imperceptible perturbations to the input, resulting in making incorrect recognition. To address this issue, we propose a novel defense model named MsMemoryGAN, which aims to filter the perturbations from adversarial samples before recognition. First, we design a multi-scale autoencoder to achieve high-quality reconstruction and two memory modules to learn the detailed patterns of normal samples at different scales. Second, we investigate a learnable metric in the memory module to retrieve the most relevant memory items to reconstruct the input image. Finally, the perceptional loss is combined with the pixel loss to further enhance the quality of the reconstructed image. During the training phase, the MsMemoryGAN learns to reconstruct the input by merely using fewer prototypical elements of the normal patterns recorded in the memory. At the testing stage, given an adversarial sample, the MsMemoryGAN retrieves its most relevant normal patterns in memory for the reconstruction. Perturbations in the adversarial sample are usually not reconstructed well, resulting in purifying the input from adversarial perturbations. We have conducted extensive experiments on two public vein datasets under different adversarial attack methods to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The experimental results show that our approach removes a wide variety of adversarial perturbations, allowing vein classifiers to achieve the highest recognition accuracy.

- **Summary**: The challenge of Multimodal Deformable Image Registration (MDIR) lies in the conversion and alignment of features between images of different modalities. Generative models (GMs) cannot retain the necessary information enough from the source modality to the target one, while non-GMs struggle to align features across these two modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine MDIR framework,LLM-Morph, which is applicable to various pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve these concerns by aligning the deep features from different modal medical images. Specifically, we first utilize a CNN encoder to extract deep visual features from cross-modal image pairs, then we use the first adapter to adjust these tokens, and use LoRA in pre-trained LLMs to fine-tune their weights, both aimed at eliminating the domain gap between the pre-trained LLMs and the MDIR task. Third, for the alignment of tokens, we utilize other four adapters to transform the LLM-encoded tokens into multi-scale visual features, generating multi-scale deformation fields and facilitating the coarse-to-fine MDIR task. Extensive experiments in MR-CT Abdomen and SR-Reg Brain datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and the potential of pre-trained LLMs for MDIR task.

- **Summary**: Efficiently detecting target weld seams while ensuring sub-millimeter accuracy has always been an important challenge in autonomous welding, which has significant application in industrial practice. Previous works mostly focused on recognizing and localizing welding seams one by one, leading to inferior efficiency in modeling the workpiece. This paper proposes a novel framework capable of multiple weld seams extraction using both RGB images and 3D point clouds. The RGB image is used to obtain the region of interest by approximately localizing the weld seams, and the point cloud is used to achieve the fine-edge extraction of the weld seams within the region of interest using region growth. Our method is further accelerated by using a pre-trained deep learning model to ensure both efficiency and generalization ability. The performance of the proposed method has been comprehensively tested on various workpieces featuring both linear and curved weld seams and in physical experiment systems. The results showcase considerable potential for real-world industrial applications, emphasizing the method's efficiency and effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Gastrointestinal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related incidence and death, making it crucial to develop novel computer-aided diagnosis systems for early detection and enhanced treatment. Traditional approaches rely on the expertise of gastroenterologists to identify diseases; however, this process is subjective, and interpretation can vary even among expert clinicians. Considering recent advancements in classifying gastrointestinal anomalies and landmarks in endoscopic and video capsule endoscopy images, this study proposes a hybrid model that combines the advantages of Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to enhance classification performance. Our model utilizes DenseNet201 as a CNN branch to extract local features and integrates a Swin Transformer branch for global feature understanding, combining both to perform the classification task. For the GastroVision dataset, our proposed model demonstrates excellent performance with Precision, Recall, F1 score, Accuracy, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.8320, 0.8386, 0.8324, 0.8386, and 0.8191, respectively, showcasing its robustness against class imbalance and surpassing other CNNs as well as the Swin Transformer model. Similarly, for the Kvasir-Capsule, a large video capsule endoscopy dataset, our model outperforms all others, achieving overall Precision, Recall, F1 score, Accuracy, and MCC of 0.7007, 0.7239, 0.6900, 0.7239, and 0.3871. Moreover, we generated saliency maps to explain our model's focus areas, demonstrating its reliable decision-making process. The results underscore the potential of our hybrid CNN-Transformer model in aiding the early and accurate detection of gastrointestinal (GI) anomalies.

- **Summary**: Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) generally require many images with accurate poses for accurate novel view synthesis, which does not reflect realistic setups where views can be sparse and poses can be noisy. Previous solutions for learning NeRFs with sparse views and noisy poses only consider local geometry consistency with pairs of views. Closely following \textit{bundle adjustment} in Structure-from-Motion (SfM), we introduce TrackNeRF for more globally consistent geometry reconstruction and more accurate pose optimization. TrackNeRF introduces \textit{feature tracks}, \ie connected pixel trajectories across \textit{all} visible views that correspond to the \textit{same} 3D points. By enforcing reprojection consistency among feature tracks, TrackNeRF encourages holistic 3D consistency explicitly. Through extensive experiments, TrackNeRF sets a new benchmark in noisy and sparse view reconstruction. In particular, TrackNeRF shows significant improvements over the state-of-the-art BARF and SPARF by $\sim8$ and $\sim1$ in terms of PSNR on DTU under various sparse and noisy view setups.

- **Summary**: Most Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) methods heavily rely on mask annotations, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive to acquire. Existing weakly-supervised COD approaches exhibit significantly inferior performance compared to fully-supervised methods and struggle to simultaneously support all the existing types of camouflaged object labels, including scribbles, bounding boxes, and points. Even for Segment Anything Model (SAM), it is still problematic to handle the weakly-supervised COD and it typically encounters challenges of prompt compatibility of the scribble labels, extreme response, semantically erroneous response, and unstable feature representations, producing unsatisfactory results in camouflaged scenes. To mitigate these issues, we propose a unified COD framework in this paper, termed SAM-COD, which is capable of supporting arbitrary weakly-supervised labels. Our SAM-COD employs a prompt adapter to handle scribbles as prompts based on SAM. Meanwhile, we introduce response filter and semantic matcher modules to improve the quality of the masks obtained by SAM under COD prompts. To alleviate the negative impacts of inaccurate mask predictions, a new strategy of prompt-adaptive knowledge distillation is utilized to ensure a reliable feature representation. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we have conducted extensive empirical experiments on three mainstream COD benchmarks. The results demonstrate the superiority of our method against state-of-the-art weakly-supervised and even fully-supervised methods.

Since an initial assessment needs to be rapid and the search for lesions is done for the whole body, very little time can be allocated for the inspection of a specific anatomy. In particular, intracranial hemorrhages are still missed, especially by clinical students. In this work, we present a Deep Learning approach for highlighting such lesions to improve the diagnostic accuracy. While most works on intracranial hemorrhages perform segmentation, detection only requires bounding boxes for the localization of the bleeding. In this paper, we propose a novel Voxel-Complete IoU (VC-IoU) loss that encourages the network to learn the 3D aspect ratios of bounding boxes and leads to more precise detections. We extensively experiment on brain bleeding detection using a publicly available dataset, and validate it on a private cohort, where we achieve 0.877 AR30, 0.728 AP30, and 0.653 AR30, 0.514 AP30 respectively. These results constitute a relative +5% improvement in Average Recall for both datasets compared to other loss functions. Finally, as there is little data currently publicly available for 3D object detection and as annotation resources are limited in the clinical setting, we evaluate the cost of different annotation methods, as well as the impact of imprecise bounding boxes in the training data on the detection performance.

- **Summary**: Machine vision enhances automation, quality control, and operational efficiency in industrial applications by enabling machines to interpret and act on visual data. While traditional computer vision algorithms and approaches remain widely utilized, machine learning has become pivotal in current research activities. In particular, generative AI demonstrates promising potential by improving pattern recognition capabilities, through data augmentation, increasing image resolution, and identifying anomalies for quality control. However, the application of generative AI in machine vision is still in its early stages due to challenges in data diversity, computational requirements, and the necessity for robust validation methods. A comprehensive literature review is essential to understand the current state of generative AI in industrial machine vision, focusing on recent advancements, applications, and research trends. Thus, a literature review based on the PRISMA guidelines was conducted, analyzing over 1,200 papers on generative AI in industrial machine vision. Our findings reveal various patterns in current research, with the primary use of generative AI being data augmentation, for machine vision tasks such as classification and object detection. Furthermore, we gather a collection of application challenges together with data requirements to enable a successful application of generative AI in industrial machine vision. This overview aims to provide researchers with insights into the different areas and applications within current research, highlighting significant advancements and identifying opportunities for future work.

- **Summary**: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) demands models to expeditiously and accurately distinguish objects which conceal themselves seamlessly in the environment. Owing to the subtle differences and ambiguous boundaries, COD is not only a remarkably challenging task for models but also for human annotators, requiring huge efforts to provide pixel-wise annotations. To alleviate the heavy annotation burden, we propose to fulfill this task with the help of only one point supervision. Specifically, by swiftly clicking on each object, we first adaptively expand the original point-based annotation to a reasonable hint area. Then, to avoid partial localization around discriminative parts, we propose an attention regulator to scatter model attention to the whole object through partially masking labeled regions. Moreover, to solve the unstable feature representation of camouflaged objects under only point-based annotation, we perform unsupervised contrastive learning based on differently augmented image pairs (e.g. changing color or doing translation). On three mainstream COD benchmarks, experimental results show that our model outperforms several weakly-supervised methods by a large margin across various metrics.

- **Summary**: Object detection in computer vision traditionally involves identifying objects in images. By integrating textual descriptions, we enhance this process, providing better context and accuracy. The MDETR model significantly advances this by combining image and text data for more versatile object detection and classification. However, MDETR's complexity and high computational demands hinder its practical use. In this paper, we introduce Lightweight MDETR (LightMDETR), an optimized MDETR variant designed for improved computational efficiency while maintaining robust multimodal capabilities. Our approach involves freezing the MDETR backbone and training a sole component, the Deep Fusion Encoder (DFE), to represent image and text modalities. A learnable context vector enables the DFE to switch between these modalities. Evaluation on datasets like RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg demonstrates that LightMDETR achieves superior precision and accuracy.

- **Summary**: Low-level 3D representations, such as point clouds, meshes, NeRFs, and 3D Gaussians, are commonly used to represent 3D objects or scenes. However, humans usually perceive 3D objects or scenes at a higher level as a composition of parts or structures rather than points or voxels. Representing 3D as semantic parts can benefit further understanding and applications. We aim to solve part-aware 3D reconstruction, which parses objects or scenes into semantic parts. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid representation of superquadrics and 2D Gaussians, trying to dig 3D structural clues from multi-view image inputs. Accurate structured geometry reconstruction and high-quality rendering are achieved at the same time. We incorporate parametric superquadrics in mesh forms into 2D Gaussians by attaching Gaussian centers to faces in meshes. During the training, superquadrics parameters are iteratively optimized, and Gaussians are deformed accordingly, resulting in an efficient hybrid representation. On the one hand, this hybrid representation inherits the advantage of superquadrics to represent different shape primitives, supporting flexible part decomposition of scenes. On the other hand, 2D Gaussians are incorporated to model the complex texture and geometry details, ensuring high-quality rendering and geometry reconstruction. The reconstruction is fully unsupervised. We conduct extensive experiments on data from DTU and ShapeNet datasets, in which the method decomposes scenes into reasonable parts, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Today's advanced automotive systems are turning into intelligent Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), bringing computational intelligence to their cyber-physical context. Such systems power advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that observe a vehicle's surroundings for their functionality. However, such ADAS have clear limitations in scenarios when the direct line-of-sight to surrounding objects is occluded, like in urban areas. Imagine now automated driving (AD) systems that ideally could benefit from other vehicles' field-of-view in such occluded situations to increase traffic safety if, for example, locations about pedestrians can be shared across vehicles. Current literature suggests vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) via roadside units (RSUs) or vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication to address such issues that stream sensor or object data between vehicles. When considering the ongoing revolution in vehicle system architectures towards powerful, centralized processing units with hardware accelerators, foreseeing the onboard presence of large language models (LLMs) to improve the passengers' comfort when using voice assistants becomes a reality. We are suggesting and evaluating a concept to complement the ego vehicle's field-of-view (FOV) with another vehicle's FOV by tapping into their onboard LLM to let the machines have a dialogue about what the other vehicle ``sees''. Our results show that very recent versions of LLMs, such as GPT-4V and GPT-4o, understand a traffic situation to an impressive level of detail, and hence, they can be used even to spot traffic participants. However, better prompts are needed to improve the detection quality and future work is needed towards a standardised message interchange format between vehicles.

- **Summary**: Estimating 3D human poses from 2D images is challenging due to occlusions and projective acquisition. Learning-based approaches have been largely studied to address this challenge, both in single and multi-view setups. These solutions however fail to generalize to real-world cases due to the lack of (multi-view) 'in-the-wild' images paired with 3D poses for training. For this reason, we propose combining 2D pose estimation, for which large and rich training datasets exist, and 2D-to-3D pose lifting, using a transformer-based network that can be trained from synthetic 2D-3D pose pairs. Our experiments demonstrate decreases up to 45% in MPJPE errors compared to the 3D pose obtained by triangulating the 2D poses. The framework's source code is available at https://github.com/aghasemzadeh/OpenMPL .

- **Summary**: Lakes provide a wide range of valuable ecosystem services, such as water supply, biodiversity habitats, and carbon sequestration. However, lakes are increasingly threatened by climate change and human activities. Therefore, continuous global monitoring of lake dynamics is crucial, but remains challenging on a large scale. The recently developed Global Lakes Area Database (GLAKES) has mapped over 3.4 million lakes worldwide, but it only provides data at decadal intervals, which may be insufficient to capture rapid or short-term changes.This paper introduces an expanded lake database, GLAKES-Additional, which offers biennial delineations and area measurements for 152,567 lakes globally from 1990 to 2021. We employed the Swin-Unet model, replacing traditional convolution operations, to effectively address the challenges posed by the receptive field requirements of high spatial resolution satellite imagery. The increased biennial time resolution helps to quantitatively attribute lake area changes to climatic and hydrological drivers, such as precipitation and temperature changes.For predicting lake area changes, we used a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and an extended time series dataset for preliminary modeling. Under climate and land use scenarios, our model achieved an RMSE of 0.317 km^2 in predicting future lake area changes.

- **Summary**: Image-based biometrics can aid law enforcement in various aspects, for example in iris, fingerprint and soft-biometric recognition. A critical precondition for recognition is the availability of sufficient biometric information in images. It is visually apparent that strong JPEG compression removes such details. However, latest AI-based image compression seemingly preserves many image details even for very strong compression factors. Yet, these perceived details are not necessarily grounded in measurements, which raises the question whether these images can still be used for biometric recognition. In this work, we investigate how AI compression impacts iris, fingerprint and soft-biometric (fabrics and tattoo) images. We also investigate the recognition performance for iris and fingerprint images after AI compression. It turns out that iris recognition can be strongly affected, while fingerprint recognition is quite robust. The loss of detail is qualitatively best seen in fabrics and tattoos images. Overall, our results show that AI-compression still permits many biometric tasks, but attention to strong compression factors in sensitive tasks is advisable.

- **Summary**: Chronic wounds pose an ongoing health concern globally, largely due to the prevalence of conditions such as diabetes and leprosy's disease. The standard method of monitoring these wounds involves visual inspection by healthcare professionals, a practice that could present challenges for patients in remote areas with inadequate transportation and healthcare infrastructure. This has led to the development of algorithms designed for the analysis and follow-up of wound images, which perform image-processing tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation. However, the effectiveness of these algorithms heavily depends on the availability of comprehensive and varied wound image data, which is usually scarce. This paper introduces the CO2Wounds-V2 dataset, an extended collection of RGB wound images from leprosy patients with their corresponding semantic segmentation annotations, aiming to enhance the development and testing of image-processing algorithms in the medical field.

- **Summary**: Synthetic data is increasingly being used to address the lack of labeled images in uncommon domains for deep learning tasks. A prominent example is 2D pose estimation of animals, particularly wild species like zebras, for which collecting real-world data is complex and impractical. However, many approaches still require real images, consistency and style constraints, sophisticated animal models, and/or powerful pre-trained networks to bridge the syn-to-real gap. Moreover, they often assume that the animal can be reliably detected in images or videos, a hypothesis that often does not hold, e.g. in wildlife scenarios or aerial images. To solve this, we use synthetic data generated with a 3D photorealistic simulator to obtain the first synthetic dataset that can be used for both detection and 2D pose estimation of zebras without applying any of the aforementioned bridging strategies. Unlike previous works, we extensively train and benchmark our detection and 2D pose estimation models on multiple real-world and synthetic datasets using both pre-trained and non-pre-trained backbones. These experiments show how the models trained from scratch and only with synthetic data can consistently generalize to real-world images of zebras in both tasks. Moreover, we show it is possible to easily generalize those same models to 2D pose estimation of horses with a minimal amount of real-world images to account for the domain transfer. Code, results, trained models; and the synthetic, training, and validation data, including 104K manually labeled frames, are provided as open-source at https://zebrapose.is.tue.mpg.de/

- **Summary**: Previous work shows that humans tend to prefer large bounding boxes over small bounding boxes with the same IoU. However, we show here that commonly used object detectors predict large and small boxes equally often. In this work, we investigate how to align automatically detected object boxes with human preference and study whether this improves human quality perception. We evaluate the performance of three commonly used object detectors through a user study (N = 123). We find that humans prefer object detections that are upscaled with factors of 1.5 or 2, even if the corresponding AP is close to 0. Motivated by this result, we propose an asymmetric bounding box regression loss that encourages large over small predicted bounding boxes. Our evaluation study shows that object detectors fine-tuned with the asymmetric loss are better aligned with human preference and are preferred over fixed scaling factors. A qualitative evaluation shows that human preference might be influenced by some object characteristics, like object shape.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Text-to-Image (T2I) models have garnered significant attention due to their remarkable advancements. However, security concerns have emerged due to their potential to generate inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) images. In this paper, inspired by the observation that texts with different semantics can lead to similar human perceptions, we propose an LLM-driven perception-guided jailbreak method, termed PGJ. It is a black-box jailbreak method that requires no specific T2I model (model-free) and generates highly natural attack prompts. Specifically, we propose identifying a safe phrase that is similar in human perception yet inconsistent in text semantics with the target unsafe word and using it as a substitution. The experiments conducted on six open-source models and commercial online services with thousands of prompts have verified the effectiveness of PGJ.

- **Summary**: In an era of frequent extreme weather and global warming, obtaining precise, fine-grained near-surface weather forecasts is increasingly essential for human activities. Downscaling (DS), a crucial task in meteorological forecasting, enables the reconstruction of high-resolution meteorological states for target regions from global-scale forecast results. Previous downscaling methods, inspired by CNN and Transformer-based super-resolution models, lacked tailored designs for meteorology and encountered structural limitations. Notably, they failed to efficiently integrate topography, a crucial prior in the downscaling process. In this paper, we address these limitations by pioneering the selective state space model into the meteorological field downscaling and propose a novel model called MambaDS. This model enhances the utilization of multivariable correlations and topography information, unique challenges in the downscaling process while retaining the advantages of Mamba in long-range dependency modeling and linear computational complexity. Through extensive experiments in both China mainland and the continental United States (CONUS), we validated that our proposed MambaDS achieves state-of-the-art results in three different types of meteorological field downscaling settings. We will release the code subsequently.

- **Summary**: The forthcoming generation of radio telescope arrays promises significant advancements in sensitivity and resolution, enabling the identification and characterization of many new faint and diffuse radio sources. Conventional manual cataloging methodologies are anticipated to be insufficient to exploit the capabilities of new radio surveys. Radio interferometric images of diffuse sources present a challenge for image segmentation tasks due to noise, artifacts, and embedded radio sources. In response to these challenges, we introduce Radio U-Net, a fully convolutional neural network based on the U-Net architecture. Radio U-Net is designed to detect faint and extended sources in radio surveys, such as radio halos, relics, and cosmic web filaments. Radio U-Net was trained on synthetic radio observations built upon cosmological simulations and then tested on a sample of galaxy clusters, where the detection of cluster diffuse radio sources relied on customized data reduction and visual inspection of LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) data. The 83% of clusters exhibiting diffuse radio emission were accurately identified, and the segmentation successfully recovered the morphology of the sources even in low-quality images. In a test sample comprising 246 galaxy clusters, we achieved a 73% accuracy rate in distinguishing between clusters with and without diffuse radio emission. Our results establish the applicability of Radio U-Net to extensive radio survey datasets, probing its efficiency on cutting-edge high-performance computing systems. This approach represents an advancement in optimizing the exploitation of forthcoming large radio surveys for scientific exploration.

- **Summary**: Road traffic crashes cause millions of deaths annually and have a significant economic impact, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper presents an approach using Vision Language Models (VLMs) for road safety assessment, overcoming the limitations of traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We introduce a new task ,V-RoAst (Visual question answering for Road Assessment), with a real-world dataset. Our approach optimizes prompt engineering and evaluates advanced VLMs, including Gemini-1.5-flash and GPT-4o-mini. The models effectively examine attributes for road assessment. Using crowdsourced imagery from Mapillary, our scalable solution influentially estimates road safety levels. In addition, this approach is designed for local stakeholders who lack resources, as it does not require training data. It offers a cost-effective and automated methods for global road safety assessments, potentially saving lives and reducing economic burdens.

- **Summary**: The capability for open vocabulary perception represents a significant advancement in autonomous driving systems, facilitating the comprehension and interpretation of a wide array of textual inputs in real-time. Despite extensive research in open vocabulary tasks within 2D computer vision, the application of such methodologies to 3D environments, particularly within large-scale outdoor contexts, remains relatively underdeveloped. This paper presents a novel approach that integrates 3D point cloud data, acquired from LIDAR sensors, with textual information. The primary focus is on the utilization of textual data to directly localize and identify objects within the autonomous driving context. We introduce an efficient framework for the fusion of bird's-eye view (BEV) region features with textual features, thereby enabling the system to seamlessly adapt to novel textual inputs and enhancing the robustness of open vocabulary detection tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is rigorously evaluated through extensive experimentation on the newly introduced NuScenes-T dataset, with additional validation of its zero-shot performance on the Lyft Level 5 dataset. This research makes a substantive contribution to the advancement of autonomous driving technologies by leveraging multimodal data to enhance open vocabulary perception in 3D environments, thereby pushing the boundaries of what is achievable in autonomous navigation and perception.

- **Summary**: In current web environment, fake news spreads rapidly across online social networks, posing serious threats to society. Existing multimodal fake news detection (MFND) methods can be classified into knowledge-based and semantic-based approaches. However, these methods are overly dependent on human expertise and feedback, lacking flexibility. To address this challenge, we propose a Dynamic Analysis and Adaptive Discriminator (DAAD) approach for fake news detection. For knowledge-based methods, we introduce the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to leverage the self-reflective capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for prompt optimization, providing richer, domain-specific details and guidance to the LLMs, while enabling more flexible integration of LLM comment on news content. For semantic-based methods, we define four typical deceit patterns: emotional exaggeration, logical inconsistency, image manipulation, and semantic inconsistency, to reveal the mechanisms behind fake news creation. To detect these patterns, we carefully design four discriminators and expand them in depth and breadth, using the soft-routing mechanism to explore optimal detection models. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. The code will be available at: https://github.com/SuXinqi/DAAD.

- **Summary**: To make an employee roster, photo album, or training dataset of generative models, one needs to collect high-quality images while dismissing low-quality ones. This study addresses a new task of unsupervised detection of low-quality images. We propose a method that not only detects low-quality images with various types of degradation but also provides visual clues of them based on an observation that partial reconstruction by hierarchical variational autoencoders fails for low-quality images. The experiments show that our method outperforms several unsupervised out-of-distribution detection methods and also gives visual clues for low-quality images that help humans recognize them even in thumbnail view.

- **Summary**: Subtle semantic differences in retinal image and text data present great challenges for pre-training visual-language models. Moreover, false negative samples, i.e., image-text pairs having the same semantics but incorrectly regarded as negatives, disrupt the visual-language pre-training process and affect the model's learning ability. This work aims to develop a retinal foundation model, called ViLReF, by pre-training on a paired dataset comprising 451,956 retinal images and corresponding diagnostic text reports. In our vision-language pre-training strategy, we leverage expert knowledge to facilitate the extraction of labels and propose a novel constraint, the Weighted Similarity Coupling Loss, to adjust the speed of pushing sample pairs further apart dynamically within the feature space. Furthermore, we employ a batch expansion module with dynamic memory queues, maintained by momentum encoders, to supply extra samples and compensate for the vacancies caused by eliminating false negatives. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple datasets for downstream classification and segmentation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the powerful zero-shot and transfer learning capabilities of ViLReF, verifying the effectiveness of our pre-training strategy. Our ViLReF model is available at: https://github.com/T6Yang/ViLReF.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in generative AI, particularly Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), have revolutionized image synthesis and manipulation. However, these generative techniques raises concerns about data misappropriation and intellectual property infringement. Adversarial attacks on machine learning models have been extensively studied, and a well-established body of research has extended these techniques as a benign metric to prevent the underlying misuse of generative AI. Current approaches to safeguarding images from manipulation by LDMs are limited by their reliance on model-specific knowledge and their inability to significantly degrade semantic quality of generated images. In response to these shortcomings, we propose the Posterior Collapse Attack (PCA) based on the observation that VAEs suffer from posterior collapse during training. Our method minimizes dependence on the white-box information of target models to get rid of the implicit reliance on model-specific knowledge. By accessing merely a small amount of LDM parameters, in specific merely the VAE encoder of LDMs, our method causes a substantial semantic collapse in generation quality, particularly in perceptual consistency, and demonstrates strong transferability across various model architectures. Experimental results show that PCA achieves superior perturbation effects on image generation of LDMs with lower runtime and VRAM. Our method outperforms existing techniques, offering a more robust and generalizable solution that is helpful in alleviating the socio-technical challenges posed by the rapidly evolving landscape of generative AI.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become the de facto method of 3D representation in many vision tasks. This calls for the 3D understanding directly in this representation space. To facilitate the research in this direction, we first build a large-scale dataset of 3DGS using the commonly used ShapeNet and ModelNet datasets. Our dataset ShapeSplat consists of 65K objects from 87 unique categories, whose labels are in accordance with the respective datasets. The creation of this dataset utilized the compute equivalent of 2 GPU years on a TITAN XP GPU.   We utilize our dataset for unsupervised pretraining and supervised finetuning for classification and segmentation tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{\textit{Gaussian-MAE}}, which highlights the unique benefits of representation learning from Gaussian parameters. Through exhaustive experiments, we provide several valuable insights. In particular, we show that (1) the distribution of the optimized GS centroids significantly differs from the uniformly sampled point cloud (used for initialization) counterpart; (2) this change in distribution results in degradation in classification but improvement in segmentation tasks when using only the centroids; (3) to leverage additional Gaussian parameters, we propose Gaussian feature grouping in a normalized feature space, along with splats pooling layer, offering a tailored solution to effectively group and embed similar Gaussians, which leads to notable improvement in finetuning tasks.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Wi-Fi sensing has garnered significant attention due to its numerous benefits, such as privacy protection, low cost, and penetration ability. Extensive research has been conducted in this field, focusing on areas such as gesture recognition, people identification, and fall detection. However, many data-driven methods encounter challenges related to domain shift, where the model fails to perform well in environments different from the training data. One major factor contributing to this issue is the limited availability of Wi-Fi sensing datasets, which makes models learn excessive irrelevant information and over-fit to the training set. Unfortunately, collecting large-scale Wi-Fi sensing datasets across diverse scenarios is a challenging task. To address this problem, we propose CrossFi, a siamese network-based approach that excels in both in-domain scenario and cross-domain scenario, including few-shot, zero-shot scenarios, and even works in few-shot new-class scenario where testing set contains new categories. The core component of CrossFi is a sample-similarity calculation network called CSi-Net, which improves the structure of the siamese network by using an attention mechanism to capture similarity information, instead of simply calculating the distance or cosine similarity. Based on it, we develop an extra Weight-Net that can generate a template for each class, so that our CrossFi can work in different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our CrossFi achieves state-of-the-art performance across various scenarios. In gesture recognition task, our CrossFi achieves an accuracy of 98.17% in in-domain scenario, 91.72% in one-shot cross-domain scenario, 64.81% in zero-shot cross-domain scenario, and 84.75% in one-shot new-class scenario. To facilitate future research, we will release the code for our model upon publication.

- **Summary**: Currently, most low-light image enhancement methods only consider information from a single view, neglecting the correlation between cross-view information. Therefore, the enhancement results produced by these methods are often unsatisfactory. In this context, there have been efforts to develop methods specifically for low-light stereo image enhancement. These methods take into account the cross-view disparities and enable interaction between the left and right views, leading to improved performance. However, these methods still do not fully exploit the interaction between left and right view information. To address this issue, we propose a model called Toward Sufficient Dual-View Interaction for Low-light Stereo Image Enhancement (SDI-Net). The backbone structure of SDI-Net is two encoder-decoder pairs, which are used to learn the mapping function from low-light images to normal-light images. Among the encoders and the decoders, we design a module named Cross-View Sufficient Interaction Module (CSIM), aiming to fully exploit the correlations between the binocular views via the attention mechanism. The quantitative and visual results on public datasets validate the superiority of our method over other related methods. Ablation studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of the key elements in our model.

- **Summary**: Recently, image-to-3D approaches have significantly advanced the generation quality and speed of 3D assets based on large reconstruction models, particularly 3D Gaussian reconstruction models. Existing large 3D Gaussian models directly map 2D image to 3D Gaussian parameters, while regressing 2D image to 3D Gaussian representations is challenging without 3D priors. In this paper, we propose a large Point-to-Gaussian model, that inputs the initial point cloud produced from large 3D diffusion model conditional on 2D image to generate the Gaussian parameters, for image-to-3D generation. The point cloud provides initial 3D geometry prior for Gaussian generation, thus significantly facilitating image-to-3D Generation. Moreover, we present the \textbf{A}ttention mechanism, \textbf{P}rojection mechanism, and \textbf{P}oint feature extractor, dubbed as \textbf{APP} block, for fusing the image features with point cloud features. The qualitative and quantitative experiments extensively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on GSO and Objaverse datasets, and show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Current methods for low- and few-shot object detection have primarily focused on enhancing model performance for detecting objects. One common approach to achieve this is by combining model finetuning with data augmentation strategies. However, little attention has been given to the energy efficiency of these approaches in data-scarce regimes. This paper seeks to conduct a comprehensive empirical study that examines both model performance and energy efficiency of custom data augmentations and automated data augmentation selection strategies when combined with a lightweight object detector. The methods are evaluated in three different benchmark datasets in terms of their performance and energy consumption, and the Efficiency Factor is employed to gain insights into their effectiveness considering both performance and efficiency. Consequently, it is shown that in many cases, the performance gains of data augmentation strategies are overshadowed by their increased energy usage, necessitating the development of more energy efficient data augmentation strategies to address data scarcity.

- **Summary**: High-resolution Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in multimodal tasks to enhance accuracy by preserving detailed image information. However, these models often generate excessive visual tokens due to encoding multiple partitions of the input image. Processing these excessive visual tokens is computationally challenging, especially in resource-constrained environments with commodity GPUs. To support high-resolution images while meeting resource constraints, we propose High-Resolution Early Dropping (HiRED), a token-dropping scheme that operates within a fixed token budget before the Large Language Model (LLM) stage. HiRED can be integrated with existing high-resolution VLMs in a plug-and-play manner, as it requires no additional training while still maintaining superior accuracy. We strategically use the vision encoder's attention in the initial layers to assess the visual content of each image partition and allocate the token budget accordingly. Then, using the attention in the final layer, we select the most important visual tokens from each partition within the allocated budget, dropping the rest. Empirically, when applied to LLaVA-Next-7B on NVIDIA TESLA P40 GPU, HiRED with a 20% token budget increases token generation throughput by 4.7, reduces first-token generation latency by 15 seconds, and saves 2.3 GB of GPU memory for a single inference.

- **Summary**: The Bengali language is the 5th most spoken native and 7th most spoken language in the world, and Bengali handwritten character recognition has attracted researchers for decades. However, other languages such as English, Arabic, Turkey, and Chinese character recognition have contributed significantly to developing handwriting recognition systems. Still, little research has been done on Bengali character recognition because of the similarity of the character, curvature and other complexities. However, many researchers have used traditional machine learning and deep learning models to conduct Bengali hand-written recognition. The study employed a convolutional neural network (CNN) with ensemble transfer learning and a multichannel attention network. We generated the feature from the two branches of the CNN, including Inception Net and ResNet and then produced an ensemble feature fusion by concatenating them. After that, we applied the attention module to produce the contextual information from the ensemble features. Finally, we applied a classification module to refine the features and classification. We evaluated the proposed model using the CAMTERdb 3.1.2 data set and achieved 92\% accuracy for the raw dataset and 98.00\% for the preprocessed dataset. We believe that our contribution to the Bengali handwritten character recognition domain will be considered a great development.

- **Summary**: Accurate estimation of core (irreversibly damaged tissue) and penumbra (salvageable tissue) volumes is essential for ischemic stroke treatment decisions. Perfusion CT, the clinical standard, estimates these volumes but is affected by variations in deconvolution algorithms, implementations, and thresholds. Core tissue expands over time, with growth rates influenced by thrombus location, collateral circulation, and inherent patient-specific factors. Understanding this tissue growth is crucial for determining the need to transfer patients to comprehensive stroke centers, predicting the benefits of additional reperfusion attempts during mechanical thrombectomy, and forecasting final clinical outcomes. This work presents the ISLES'24 challenge, which addresses final post-treatment stroke infarct prediction from pre-interventional acute stroke imaging and clinical data. ISLES'24 establishes a unique 360-degree setting where all feasibly accessible clinical data are available for participants, including full CT acute stroke imaging, sub-acute follow-up MRI, and clinical tabular data. The contributions of this work are two-fold: first, we introduce a standardized benchmarking of final stroke infarct segmentation algorithms through the ISLES'24 challenge; second, we provide insights into infarct segmentation using multimodal imaging and clinical data strategies by identifying outperforming methods on a finely curated dataset. The outputs of this challenge are anticipated to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcome predictions. All ISLES'24 materials, including data, performance evaluation scripts, and leading algorithmic strategies, are available to the research community following \url{https://isles-24.grand-challenge.org/}.

- **Summary**: Ultrasound plane wave imaging is a cutting-edge technique that enables high frame-rate imaging. However, one challenge associated with high frame-rate ultrasound imaging is the high noise associated with them, hindering their wider adoption. Therefore, the development of a denoising method becomes imperative to augment the quality of plane wave images. Drawing inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), our proposed solution aims to enhance plane wave image quality. Specifically, the method considers the distinction between low-angle and high-angle compounding plane waves as noise and effectively eliminates it by adapting a DDPM to beamformed radiofrequency (RF) data. The method underwent training using only 400 simulated images. In addition, our approach employs natural image segmentation masks as intensity maps for the generated images, resulting in accurate denoising for various anatomy shapes. The proposed method was assessed across simulation, phantom, and in vivo images. The results of the evaluations indicate that our approach not only enhances image quality on simulated data but also demonstrates effectiveness on phantom and in vivo data in terms of image quality. Comparative analysis with other methods underscores the superiority of our proposed method across various evaluation metrics. The source code and trained model will be released along with the dataset at: http://code.sonography.ai

- **Summary**: A face morph is created by combining the face images usually pertaining to two distinct identities. The goal is to generate an image that can be matched with two identities thereby undermining the security of a face recognition system. To deal with this problem, several morph attack detection techniques have been developed. But these methods do not extract any information about the underlying bonafides used to create them. Demorphing addresses this limitation. However, current demorphing techniques are mostly reference-based, i.e, they need an image of one of the identities to recover the other. In this work, we treat demorphing as an ill-posed decomposition problem. We propose a novel method that is reference-free and recovers the bonafides with high accuracy. Our method decomposes the morph into several identity-preserving feature components. A merger network then weighs and combines these components to recover the bonafides. Our method is observed to reconstruct high-quality bonafides in terms of definition and fidelity. Experiments on the CASIA-WebFace, SMDD and AMSL datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces SenPa-MAE, a transformer architecture that encodes the sensor parameters of an observed multispectral signal into the image embeddings. SenPa-MAE can be pre-trained on imagery of different satellites with non-matching spectral or geometrical sensor characteristics. To incorporate sensor parameters, we propose a versatile sensor parameter encoding module as well as a data augmentation strategy for the diversification of the pre-training dataset. This enables the model to effectively differentiate between various sensors and gain an understanding of sensor parameters and the correlation to the observed signal. Given the rising number of Earth observation satellite missions and the diversity in their sensor specifications, our approach paves the way towards a sensor-independent Earth observation foundation model. This opens up possibilities such as cross-sensor training and sensor-independent inference.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as frontrunners in text-to-image generation for their impressive capabilities. Nonetheless, their fixed image resolution during training often leads to challenges in high-resolution image generation, such as semantic inaccuracies and object replication. This paper introduces MegaFusion, a novel approach that extends existing diffusion-based text-to-image generation models towards efficient higher-resolution generation without additional fine-tuning or extra adaptation. Specifically, we employ an innovative truncate and relay strategy to bridge the denoising processes across different resolutions, allowing for high-resolution image generation in a coarse-to-fine manner. Moreover, by integrating dilated convolutions and noise re-scheduling, we further adapt the model's priors for higher resolution. The versatility and efficacy of MegaFusion make it universally applicable to both latent-space and pixel-space diffusion models, along with other derivative models. Extensive experiments confirm that MegaFusion significantly boosts the capability of existing models to produce images of megapixels and various aspect ratios, while only requiring about 40% of the original computational cost.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding (OV-3D) aims to localize and classify novel objects beyond the closed object classes. However, existing approaches and benchmarks primarily focus on the open vocabulary problem within the context of object classes, which is insufficient to provide a holistic evaluation to what extent a model understands the 3D scene. In this paper, we introduce a more challenging task called Generalized Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding (GOV-3D) to explore the open vocabulary problem beyond object classes. It encompasses an open and diverse set of generalized knowledge, expressed as linguistic queries of fine-grained and object-specific attributes. To this end, we contribute a new benchmark named OpenScan, which consists of 3D object attributes across eight representative linguistic aspects, including affordance, property, material, and more. We further evaluate state-of-the-art OV-3D methods on our OpenScan benchmark, and discover that these methods struggle to comprehend the abstract vocabularies of the GOV-3D task, a challenge that cannot be addressed by simply scaling up object classes during training. We highlight the limitations of existing methodologies and explore a promising direction to overcome the identified shortcomings.

While similar in this regard, atmospheric transport modeling is subject to new challenges. Both, stable predictions for longer time horizons and mass conservation throughout need to be achieved, while IO plays a larger role compared to computational costs. In this study we explore four different deep neural networks (UNet, GraphCast, Spherical Fourier Neural Operator and SwinTransformer) which have proven as state-of-the-art in weather prediction to assess their usefulness for atmospheric tracer transport modeling. For this, we assemble the CarbonBench dataset, a systematic benchmark tailored for machine learning emulators of Eulerian atmospheric transport. Through architectural adjustments, we decouple the performance of our emulators from the distribution shift caused by a steady rise in atmospheric CO$_2$. More specifically, we center CO$_2$ input fields to zero mean and then use an explicit flux scheme and a mass fixer to assure mass balance. This design enables stable and mass conserving transport for over 6 months with all four neural network architectures. In our study, the SwinTransformer displays particularly strong emulation skill (90-day $R^2 > 0.99$), with physically plausible emulation even for forward runs of multiple years. This work paves the way forward towards high resolution forward and inverse modeling of inert trace gases with neural networks.

- **Summary**: We introduce Transfusion, a recipe for training a multi-modal model over discrete and continuous data. Transfusion combines the language modeling loss function (next token prediction) with diffusion to train a single transformer over mixed-modality sequences. We pretrain multiple Transfusion models up to 7B parameters from scratch on a mixture of text and image data, establishing scaling laws with respect to a variety of uni- and cross-modal benchmarks. Our experiments show that Transfusion scales significantly better than quantizing images and training a language model over discrete image tokens. By introducing modality-specific encoding and decoding layers, we can further improve the performance of Transfusion models, and even compress each image to just 16 patches. We further demonstrate that scaling our Transfusion recipe to 7B parameters and 2T multi-modal tokens produces a model that can generate images and text on a par with similar scale diffusion models and language models, reaping the benefits of both worlds.

- **Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks, yet current applications face challenges. While LLMs excel in general conversation scenarios, they struggle with specialized navigation tasks, yielding suboptimal performance compared to specialized VLN models. We introduce FLAME (FLAMingo-Architected Embodied Agent), a novel Multimodal LLM-based agent and architecture designed for urban VLN tasks that efficiently handles multiple observations. Our approach implements a three-phase tuning technique for effective adaptation to navigation tasks, including single perception tuning for street view description, multiple perception tuning for trajectory summarization, and end-to-end training on VLN datasets. The augmented datasets are synthesized automatically. Experimental results demonstrate FLAME's superiority over existing methods, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a 7.3% increase in task completion rate on Touchdown dataset. This work showcases the potential of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in complex navigation tasks, representing an advancement towards practical applications of MLLMs in embodied AI.

- **Summary**: We propose sorting patch representations across views as a novel self-supervised learning signal to improve pretrained representations. To this end, we introduce NeCo: Patch Neighbor Consistency, a novel training loss that enforces patch-level nearest neighbor consistency across a student and teacher model, relative to reference batches. Our method leverages a differentiable sorting method applied on top of pretrained representations, such as DINOv2-registers to bootstrap the learning signal and further improve upon them. This dense post-pretraining leads to superior performance across various models and datasets, despite requiring only 19 hours on a single GPU. We demonstrate that this method generates high-quality dense feature encoders and establish several new state-of-the-art results: +5.5% and + 6% for non-parametric in-context semantic segmentation on ADE20k and Pascal VOC, and +7.2% and +5.7% for linear segmentation evaluations on COCO-Things and -Stuff.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we delve into the concept of interpretable image enhancement, a technique that enhances image quality by adjusting filter parameters with easily understandable names such as "Exposure" and "Contrast". Unlike using predefined image editing filters, our framework utilizes learnable filters that acquire interpretable names through training. Our contribution is two-fold. Firstly, we introduce a novel filter architecture called an image-adaptive neural implicit lookup table, which uses a multilayer perceptron to implicitly define the transformation from input feature space to output color space. By incorporating image-adaptive parameters directly into the input features, we achieve highly expressive filters. Secondly, we introduce a prompt guidance loss to assign interpretable names to each filter. We evaluate visual impressions of enhancement results, such as exposure and contrast, using a vision and language model along with guiding prompts. We define a constraint to ensure that each filter affects only the targeted visual impression without influencing other attributes, which allows us to obtain the desired filter effects. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing predefined filter-based methods, thanks to the filters optimized to predict target results.
