- **Summary**: Multiplex brightfield imaging offers the advantage of simultaneously analyzing multiple biomarkers on a single slide, as opposed to single biomarker labeling on multiple consecutive slides. To accurately analyze multiple biomarkers localized at the same cellular compartment, two representative biomarker sets were selected as assay models - cMET-PDL1-EGFR and CD8-LAG3-PDL1, where all three biomarkers can co-localize on the cell membrane. One of the most crucial preliminary stages for analyzing such assay is identifying each unique chromogen on individual cells. This is a challenging problem due to the co-localization of membrane stains from all the three biomarkers. It requires advanced color unmixing for creating the equivalent singleplex images from each triplex image for each biomarker.   In this project, we developed a cycle-Generative Adversarial Network (cycle-GAN) method for unmixing the triplex images generated from the above-mentioned assays. Three different models were designed to generate the singleplex image for each of the three stains Tamra (purple), QM-Dabsyl (yellow) and Green. A notable novelty of our approach was that the input to the network were images in the optical density domain instead of conventionally used RGB images. The use of the optical density domain helped in reducing the blurriness of the synthetic singleplex images, which was often observed when the network was trained on RGB images.   The cycle-GAN models were validated on 10,800 lung, gastric and colon images for the cMET-PDL1-EGFR assay and 3600 colon images for the CD8-LAG3-PDL1 assay. Visual as well as quantified assessments demonstrated that the proposed method is effective and efficient when compared with the manual reviewing results and is readily applicable to various multiplex assays.

- **Summary**: Humans continuously perceive and process visual signals. However, current video models typically either sample key frames sparsely or divide videos into chunks and densely sample within each chunk. This approach stems from the fact that most existing video benchmarks can be addressed by analyzing key frames or aggregating information from separate chunks. We anticipate that the next generation of vision models will emulate human perception by processing visual input continuously and holistically. To facilitate the development of such models, we propose the Continuous Perception Benchmark, a video question answering task that cannot be solved by focusing solely on a few frames or by captioning small chunks and then summarizing using language models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that existing models, whether commercial or open-source, struggle with these tasks, indicating the need for new technical advancements in this direction.

- **Summary**: Combining match scores from different biometric systems via fusion is a well-established approach to improving recognition accuracy. However, missing scores can degrade performance as well as limit the possible fusion techniques that can be applied. Imputation is a promising technique in multibiometric systems for replacing missing data. In this paper, we evaluate various score imputation approaches on three multimodal biometric score datasets, viz. NIST BSSR1, BIOCOP2008, and MIT LL Trimodal, and investigate the factors which might influence the effectiveness of imputation. Our studies reveal three key observations: (1) Imputation is preferable over not imputing missing scores, even when the fusion rule does not require complete score data. (2) Balancing the classes in the training data is crucial to mitigate negative biases in the imputation technique towards the under-represented class, even if it involves dropping a substantial number of score vectors. (3) Multivariate imputation approaches seem to be beneficial when scores between modalities are correlated, while univariate approaches seem to benefit scenarios where scores between modalities are less correlated.

- **Summary**: Existing RGB-T tracking algorithms have made remarkable progress by leveraging the global interaction capability and extensive pre-trained models of the Transformer architecture. Nonetheless, these methods mainly adopt imagepair appearance matching and face challenges of the intrinsic high quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism, resulting in constrained exploitation of temporal information. Inspired by the recently emerged State Space Model Mamba, renowned for its impressive long sequence modeling capabilities and linear computational complexity, this work innovatively proposes a pure Mamba-based framework (MambaVT) to fully exploit spatio-temporal contextual modeling for robust visible-thermal tracking. Specifically, we devise the long-range cross-frame integration component to globally adapt to target appearance variations, and introduce short-term historical trajectory prompts to predict the subsequent target states based on local temporal location clues. Extensive experiments show the significant potential of vision Mamba for RGB-T tracking, with MambaVT achieving state-of-the-art performance on four mainstream benchmarks while requiring lower computational costs. We aim for this work to serve as a simple yet strong baseline, stimulating future research in this field. The code and pre-trained models will be made available.

- **Summary**: Text has become the predominant form of communication on social media, embedding a wealth of emotional nuances. Consequently, the extraction of emotional information from text is of paramount importance. Despite previous research making some progress, existing text sentiment analysis models still face challenges in integrating diverse semantic information and lack interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a quantum-inspired deep learning architecture that combines fundamental principles of quantum mechanics (QM principles) with deep learning models for text sentiment analysis. Specifically, we analyze the commonalities between text representation and QM principles to design a quantum-inspired text representation method and further develop a quantum-inspired text embedding layer. Additionally, we design a feature extraction layer based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and self-attention mechanisms (SAMs). Finally, we calculate the text density matrix using the quantum complex numbers principle and apply 2D-convolution neural networks (CNNs) for feature condensation and dimensionality reduction. Through a series of visualization, comparative, and ablation experiments, we demonstrate that our model not only shows significant advantages in accuracy and efficiency compared to previous related models but also achieves a certain level of interpretability by integrating QM principles. Our code is available at QISA.

- **Summary**: Reliable analysis of intracellular dynamic processes in time-lapse fluorescence microscopy images requires complete and accurate tracking of all small particles in all time frames of the image sequences. A fundamental first step towards this goal is particle detection. Given the small size of the particles, their detection is greatly affected by image noise. Recent studies have shown that applying image denoising as a preprocessing step indeed improves particle detection and their subsequent tracking. Deep learning based particle detection methods have shown superior results compared to traditional detection methods. However, they do not explicitly aim to remove noise from the images to facilitate detection. Thus we hypothesize that their performance could be further improved. In this paper, we propose a new deep neural network, called DENODET (denoising-detection network), which performs image denoising and particle detection simultaneously. We show that integrative denoising and detection yields more accurate detection results. Our method achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art particle detection methods on the particle tracking challenge dataset and our own real fluorescence microscopy image data.

- **Summary**: Topological data analysis (TDA) uncovers crucial properties of objects in medical imaging. Methods based on persistent homology have demonstrated their advantages in capturing topological features that traditional deep learning methods cannot detect in both radiology and pathology. However, previous research primarily focused on 2D image analysis, neglecting the comprehensive 3D context. In this paper, we propose an innovative 3D TDA approach that incorporates the concept of superpixels to transform 3D medical image features into point cloud data. By Utilizing Optimized Gaussian Coefficient, the proposed 3D TDA method, for the first time, efficiently generate holistic Persistence Images for 3D volumetric data. Our 3D TDA method exhibits superior performance on the MedMNist3D dataset when compared to other traditional methods, showcasing its potential effectiveness in modeling 3D persistent homology-based topological analysis when it comes to classification tasks.

- **Summary**: In this study, we aim to develop a domestic service robot (DSR) that, guided by open-vocabulary instructions, can carry everyday objects to the specified pieces of furniture. Few existing methods handle mobile manipulation tasks with open-vocabulary instructions in the image retrieval setting, and most do not identify both the target objects and the receptacles. We propose the Dual-Mode Multimodal Ranking model (DM2RM), which enables images of both the target objects and receptacles to be retrieved using a single model based on multimodal foundation models. We introduce a switching mechanism that leverages a mode token and phrase identification via a large language model to switch the embedding space based on the prediction target. To evaluate the DM2RM, we construct a novel dataset including real-world images collected from hundreds of building-scale environments and crowd-sourced instructions with referring expressions. The evaluation results show that the proposed DM2RM outperforms previous approaches in terms of standard metrics in image retrieval settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of the DM2RM on a standardized real-world DSR platform including fetch-and-carry actions, where it achieves a task success rate of 82% despite the zero-shot transfer setting. Demonstration videos, code, and more materials are available at https://kkrr10.github.io/dm2rm/.

- **Summary**: This article introduces a novel method for object-level relocalization of robotic systems. It determines the pose of a camera sensor by robustly associating the object detections in the current frame with 3D objects in a lightweight object-level map. Object graphs, considering semantic uncertainties, are constructed for both the incoming camera frame and the pre-built map. Objects are represented as graph nodes, and each node employs unique semantic descriptors based on our devised graph kernels. We extract a subgraph from the target map graph by identifying potential object associations for each object detection, then refine these associations and pose estimations using a RANSAC-inspired strategy. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our method achieves more accurate data association and significantly increases relocalization success rates compared to baseline methods. The implementation of our method is released at \url{https://github.com/yutongwangBIT/GOReloc}.

- **Summary**: The versatile nature of Visual Sentiment Analysis (VSA) is one reason for its rising profile. It isn't easy to efficiently manage social media data with visual information since previous research has concentrated on Sentiment Analysis (SA) of single modalities, like textual. In addition, most visual sentiment studies need to adequately classify sentiment because they are mainly focused on simply merging modal attributes without investigating their intricate relationships. This prompted the suggestion of developing a fusion of deep learning and machine learning algorithms. In this research, a deep feature-based method for multiclass classification has been used to extract deep features from modified ResNet50. Furthermore, gradient boosting algorithm has been used to classify photos containing emotional content. The approach is thoroughly evaluated on two benchmarked datasets, CrowdFlower and GAPED. Finally, cutting-edge deep learning and machine learning models were used to compare the proposed strategy. When compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method demonstrates exceptional performance on the datasets presented.

- **Summary**: Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery and is vital for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has shown superior advancements in image and video segmentation. However, SAM2 struggles with efficiency due to the high computational demands of processing high-resolution images and complex and long-range temporal dynamics in surgical videos. To address these challenges, we introduce Surgical SAM 2 (SurgSAM-2), an advanced model to utilize SAM2 with an Efficient Frame Pruning (EFP) mechanism, to facilitate real-time surgical video segmentation. The EFP mechanism dynamically manages the memory bank by selectively retaining only the most informative frames, reducing memory usage and computational cost while maintaining high segmentation accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgSAM-2 significantly improves both efficiency and segmentation accuracy compared to the vanilla SAM2. Remarkably, SurgSAM-2 achieves a 3$\times$ FPS compared with SAM2, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance after fine-tuning with lower-resolution data. These advancements establish SurgSAM-2 as a leading model for surgical video analysis, making real-time surgical video segmentation in resource-constrained environments a feasible reality.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in camera design and imaging technology have enabled the capture of high-quality images using smartphones. However, due to the limited dynamic range of digital cameras, the quality of photographs captured in environments with highly imbalanced lighting often results in poor-quality images. To address this issue, most devices capture multi-exposure frames and then use some multi-exposure fusion method to merge those frames into a final fused image. Nevertheless, most traditional and current deep learning approaches are unsuitable for real-time applications on mobile devices due to their heavy computational and memory requirements. We propose a new method for multi-exposure fusion based on an encoder-decoder deep learning architecture with efficient building blocks tailored for mobile devices. This efficient design makes our model capable of processing 4K resolution images in less than 2 seconds on mid-range smartphones. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques regarding full-reference quality measures and computational efficiency (runtime and memory usage), making it ideal for real-time applications on hardware-constrained devices.

- **Summary**: Despite the growing prevalence of black-box pre-trained models (PTMs) such as prediction API services, there remains a significant challenge in directly applying general models to real-world scenarios due to the data distribution gap. Considering a data deficiency and constrained computational resource scenario, this paper proposes a novel parameter-efficient transfer learning framework for vision recognition models in the black-box setting. Our framework incorporates two novel training techniques. First, we align the input space (i.e., image) of PTMs to the target data distribution by generating visual prompts of spatial and frequency domain. Along with the novel spatial-frequency hybrid visual prompter, we design a novel training technique based on probabilistic clusters, which can enhance class separation in the output space (i.e., prediction probabilities). In experiments, our model demonstrates superior performance in a few-shot transfer learning setting across extensive visual recognition datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, we show that the proposed method efficiently reduces computational costs for training and inference phases.

- **Summary**: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging technology provides the unique advantage of being able to collect data regardless of weather conditions and time. However, SAR images exhibit complex backscatter patterns and speckle noise, which necessitate expertise for interpretation. To deal with this challenge, research has been conducted on translating SAR images into optical-like representations to aid the interpretation of SAR data. Nevertheless, existing studies have predominantly utilized low-resolution satellite imagery datasets and have largely been based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which are known for their training instability and low fidelity. To overcome these limitations of low-resolution data usage and GAN-based approaches, this paper introduces a conditional image-to-image translation approach based on Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM). We conducted comprehensive experiments on the MSAW dataset, a paired SAR and optical images collection of 0.5m Very-High-Resolution (VHR) images. The experimental results indicate that our method surpasses both the Conditional Diffusion Model (CDM) and the GAN-based models in diverse perceptual quality metrics.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates the task of the open-ended interactive robotic manipulation on table-top scenarios. While recent Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance robots' comprehension of user instructions, their lack of visual grounding constrains their ability to physically interact with the environment. This is because the robot needs to locate the target object for manipulation within the physical workspace. To this end, we introduce an interactive robotic manipulation framework called Polaris, which integrates perception and interaction by utilizing GPT-4 alongside grounded vision models. For precise manipulation, it is essential that such grounded vision models produce detailed object pose for the target object, rather than merely identifying pixels belonging to them in the image. Consequently, we propose a novel Synthetic-to-Real (Syn2Real) pose estimation pipeline. This pipeline utilizes rendered synthetic data for training and is then transferred to real-world manipulation tasks. The real-world performance demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed pipeline and underscores its potential for extension to more general categories. Moreover, real-robot experiments have showcased the impressive performance of our framework in grasping and executing multiple manipulation tasks. This indicates its potential to generalize to scenarios beyond the tabletop. More information and video results are available here: https://star-uu-wang.github.io/Polaris/

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable success across various domains, while research in the medical field has largely focused on unimodal images. Meanwhile, current general-domain multimodal models for videos still lack the capabilities to understand and engage in conversations about surgical videos. One major contributing factor is the absence of datasets in the surgical field. In this paper, we create a new dataset, Surg-QA, consisting of 102,000 surgical video-instruction pairs, the largest of its kind so far. To build such a dataset, we propose a novel two-stage question-answer generation pipeline with LLM to learn surgical knowledge in a structured manner from the publicly available surgical lecture videos. The pipeline breaks down the generation process into two stages to significantly reduce the task complexity, allowing us to use a more affordable, locally deployed open-source LLM than the premium paid LLM services. It also mitigates the risk of LLM hallucinations during question-answer generation, thereby enhancing the overall quality of the generated data. We further train LLaVA-Surg, a novel vision-language conversational assistant capable of answering open-ended questions about surgical videos, on this Surg-QA dataset, and conduct comprehensive evaluations on zero-shot surgical video question-answering tasks. We show that LLaVA-Surg significantly outperforms all previous general-domain models, demonstrating exceptional multimodal conversational skills in answering open-ended questions about surgical videos. We will release our code, model, and the instruction-tuning dataset.

- **Summary**: With the rise of neural networks in various domains, multi-task learning (MTL) gained significant relevance. A key challenge in MTL is balancing individual task losses during neural network training to improve performance and efficiency through knowledge sharing across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel task-weighting method by building on the most prevalent approach of Uncertainty Weighting and computing analytically optimal uncertainty-based weights, normalized by a softmax function with tunable temperature. Our approach yields comparable results to the combinatorially prohibitive, brute-force approach of Scalarization while offering a more cost-effective yet high-performing alternative. We conduct an extensive benchmark on various datasets and architectures. Our method consistently outperforms six other common weighting methods. Furthermore, we report noteworthy experimental findings for the practical application of MTL. For example, larger networks diminish the influence of weighting methods, and tuning the weight decay has a low impact compared to the learning rate.

- **Summary**: Despite significant research efforts and advancements, cancer remains a leading cause of mortality. Early cancer prediction has become a crucial focus in cancer research to streamline patient care and improve treatment outcomes. Manual tumor detection by histopathologists can be time consuming, prompting the need for computerized methods to expedite treatment planning. Traditional approaches to tumor detection rely on supervised learning, necessitates a large amount of annotated data for model training. However, acquiring such extensive labeled data can be laborious and time\-intensive. This research examines the three learning environments: supervised learning (SL), semi\-supervised learning (Semi\-SL), and self\-supervised learning (Self\-SL): to predict kidney, lung, and breast cancer. Three pre\-trained deep learning models (Residual Network\-50, Visual Geometry Group\-16, and EfficientNetB0) are evaluated based on these learning settings using seven carefully curated training sets. To create the first training set (TS1), SL is applied to all annotated image samples. Five training sets (TS2\-TS6) with different ratios of labeled and unlabeled cancer images are used to evaluateSemi\-SL. Unlabeled cancer images from the final training set (TS7) are utilized for Self\-SL assessment. Among different learning environments, outcomes from the Semi\-SL setting show a strong degree of agreement with the outcomes achieved in the SL setting. The uniform pattern of observations from the pre\-trained models across all three datasets validates the methodology and techniques of the research. Based on modest number of labeled samples and minimal computing cost, our study suggests that the Semi\-SL option can be a highly viable replacement for the SL option under label annotation constraint scenarios.

- **Summary**: Knowledge-based visual question answering requires external knowledge beyond visible content to answer the question correctly. One limitation of existing methods is that they focus more on modeling the inter-modal and intra-modal correlations, which entangles complex multimodal clues by implicit embeddings and lacks interpretability and generalization ability. The key challenge to solve the above problem is to separate the information and process it separately at the functional level. By reusing each processing unit, the generalization ability of the model to deal with different data can be increased. In this paper, we propose Independent Inference Units (IIU) for fine-grained multi-modal reasoning to decompose intra-modal information by the functionally independent units. Specifically, IIU processes each semantic-specific intra-modal clue by an independent inference unit, which also collects complementary information by communication from different units. To further reduce the impact of redundant information, we propose a memory update module to maintain semantic-relevant memory along with the reasoning process gradually. In comparison with existing non-pretrained multi-modal reasoning models on standard datasets, our model achieves a new state-of-the-art, enhancing performance by 3%, and surpassing basic pretrained multi-modal models. The experimental results show that our IIU model is effective in disentangling intra-modal clues as well as reasoning units to provide explainable reasoning evidence.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel event camera simulation system fully based on physically based Monte Carlo path tracing with adaptive path sampling. The adaptive sampling performed in the proposed method is based on a statistical technique, hypothesis testing for the hypothesis whether the difference of logarithmic luminances at two distant periods is significantly larger than a predefined event threshold. To this end, our rendering system collects logarithmic luminances rather than raw luminance in contrast to the conventional rendering system imitating conventional RGB cameras. Then, based on the central limit theorem, we reasonably assume that the distribution of the population mean of logarithmic luminance can be modeled as a normal distribution, allowing us to model the distribution of the difference of logarithmic luminance as a normal distribution. Then, using Student's t-test, we can test the hypothesis and determine whether to discard the null hypothesis for event non-occurrence. When we sample a sufficiently large number of path samples to satisfy the central limit theorem and obtain a clean set of events, our method achieves significant speed up compared to a simple approach of sampling paths uniformly at every pixel. To our knowledge, we are the first to simulate the behavior of event cameras in a physically accurate manner using an adaptive sampling technique in Monte Carlo path tracing, and we believe this study will contribute to the development of computer vision applications using event cameras.

- **Summary**: In the realm of autonomous driving,accurately detecting occluded or distant objects,referred to as weak positive sample ,presents significant challenges. These challenges predominantly arise during query initialization, where an over-reliance on heatmap confidence often results in a high rate of false positives, consequently masking weaker detections and impairing system performance. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel approach, Co-Fix3D, which employs a collaborative hybrid multi-stage parallel query generation mechanism for BEV representations. Our method incorporates the Local-Global Feature Enhancement (LGE) module, which refines BEV features to more effectively highlight weak positive samples. It uniquely leverages the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for accurate noise reduction and features refinement in localized areas, and incorporates an attention mechanism to more comprehensively optimize global BEV features. Moreover, our method increases the volume of BEV queries through a multi-stage parallel processing of the LGE, significantly enhancing the probability of selecting weak positive samples. This enhancement not only improves training efficiency within the decoder framework but also boosts overall system performance. Notably, Co-Fix3D achieves superior results on the stringent nuScenes benchmark, outperforming all previous models with a 69.1% mAP and 72.9% NDS on the LiDAR-based benchmark, and 72.3% mAP and 74.1% NDS on the multi-modality benchmark, without relying on test-time augmentation or additional datasets.

- **Summary**: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) and 3D generation have recently achieved prominent improvements. However, these works mainly focus on confined categories or synthetic 3D assets, which are discouraged from generalizing to challenging in-the-wild scenes and fail to be employed with 2D synthesis directly. Moreover, these methods heavily depended on camera poses, limiting their real-world applications. To overcome these issues, we propose MVInpainter, re-formulating the 3D editing as a multi-view 2D inpainting task. Specifically, MVInpainter partially inpaints multi-view images with the reference guidance rather than intractably generating an entirely novel view from scratch, which largely simplifies the difficulty of in-the-wild NVS and leverages unmasked clues instead of explicit pose conditions. To ensure cross-view consistency, MVInpainter is enhanced by video priors from motion components and appearance guidance from concatenated reference key&value attention. Furthermore, MVInpainter incorporates slot attention to aggregate high-level optical flow features from unmasked regions to control the camera movement with pose-free training and inference. Sufficient scene-level experiments on both object-centric and forward-facing datasets verify the effectiveness of MVInpainter, including diverse tasks, such as multi-view object removal, synthesis, insertion, and replacement.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of social media platforms has significantly reduced the cost of information dissemination, yet it has also led to a proliferation of fake news, posing a threat to societal trust and credibility. Most of fake news detection research focused on integrating text and image information to represent the consistency of multiple modes in news content, while paying less attention to inconsistent information. Besides, existing methods that leveraged inconsistent information often caused one mode overshadowing another, leading to ineffective use of inconsistent clue. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive multi-modal feature fusion network (MFF-Net). Inspired by human judgment processes for determining truth and falsity in news, MFF-Net focuses on inconsistent parts when news content is generally consistent and consistent parts when it is generally inconsistent. Specifically, MFF-Net extracts semantic and global features from images and texts respectively, and learns consistency information between modes through a multiple feature fusion module. To deal with the problem of modal information being easily masked, we design a single modal feature filtering strategy to capture inconsistent information from corresponding modes separately. Finally, similarity scores are calculated based on global features with adaptive adjustments made to achieve weighted fusion of consistent and inconsistent features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MFF-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods across three public news datasets derived from real social medias.

- **Summary**: On-device Deep Neural Network (DNN) training has been recognized as crucial for privacy-preserving machine learning at the edge. However, the intensive training workload and limited onboard computing resources pose significant challenges to the availability and efficiency of model training. While existing works address these challenges through native resource management optimization, we instead leverage our observation that edge environments usually comprise a rich set of accompanying trusted edge devices with idle resources beyond a single terminal. We propose Asteroid, a distributed edge training system that breaks the resource walls across heterogeneous edge devices for efficient model training acceleration. Asteroid adopts a hybrid pipeline parallelism to orchestrate distributed training, along with a judicious parallelism planning for maximizing throughput under certain resource constraints. Furthermore, a fault-tolerant yet lightweight pipeline replay mechanism is developed to tame the device-level dynamics for training robustness and performance stability. We implement Asteroid on heterogeneous edge devices with both vision and language models, demonstrating up to 12.2x faster training than conventional parallelism methods and 2.1x faster than state-of-the-art hybrid parallelism methods through evaluations. Furthermore, Asteroid can recover training pipeline 14x faster than baseline methods while preserving comparable throughput despite unexpected device exiting and failure.

- **Summary**: Towards human-level visual understanding, visual commonsense generation has been introduced to generate commonsense inferences beyond images. However, current research on visual commonsense generation has overlooked an important human cognitive ability: generating descriptive and diverse inferences. In this work, we propose a novel visual commonsense generation framework, called DIVE, which aims to improve the descriptiveness and diversity of generated inferences. DIVE involves two methods, generic inference filtering and contrastive retrieval learning, which address the limitations of existing visual commonsense resources and training objectives. Experimental results verify that DIVE outperforms state-of-the-art models for visual commonsense generation in terms of both descriptiveness and diversity, while showing a superior quality in generating unique and novel inferences. Notably, DIVE achieves human-level descriptiveness and diversity on Visual Commonsense Graphs. Furthermore, human evaluations confirm that DIVE aligns closely with human judgments on descriptiveness and diversity\footnote{Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Park-ing-lot/DIVE.

- **Summary**: In the modern context, hand gesture recognition has emerged as a focal point. This is due to its wide range of applications, which include comprehending sign language, factories, hands-free devices, and guiding robots. Many researchers have attempted to develop more effective techniques for recognizing these hand gestures. However, there are challenges like dataset limitations, variations in hand forms, external environments, and inconsistent lighting conditions. To address these challenges, we proposed a novel three-stream hybrid model that combines RGB pixel and skeleton-based features to recognize hand gestures. In the procedure, we preprocessed the dataset, including augmentation, to make rotation, translation, and scaling independent systems. We employed a three-stream hybrid model to extract the multi-feature fusion using the power of the deep learning module. In the first stream, we extracted the initial feature using the pre-trained Imagenet module and then enhanced this feature by using a multi-layer of the GRU and LSTM modules. In the second stream, we extracted the initial feature with the pre-trained ReseNet module and enhanced it with the various combinations of the GRU and LSTM modules. In the third stream, we extracted the hand pose key points using the media pipe and then enhanced them using the stacked LSTM to produce the hierarchical feature. After that, we concatenated the three features to produce the final. Finally, we employed a classification module to produce the probabilistic map to generate predicted output. We mainly produced a powerful feature vector by taking advantage of the pixel-based deep learning feature and pos-estimation-based stacked deep learning feature, including a pre-trained model with a scratched deep learning model for unequalled gesture detection capabilities.

- **Summary**: Segmenting multiple objects (e.g., organs) in medical images often requires an understanding of their topology, which simultaneously quantifies the shape of the objects and their positions relative to each other. This understanding is important for segmentation networks to generalize better with limited training data, which is common in medical image analysis. However, many popular networks were trained to optimize only pixel-wise performance, ignoring the topological correctness of the segmentation. In this paper, we introduce a new topology-aware loss function, which we call PI-Att, that explicitly forces the network to minimize the topological dissimilarity between the ground truth and prediction maps. We quantify the topology of each map by the persistence image representation, for the first time in the context of a segmentation network loss. Besides, we propose a new mechanism to adaptively calculate the persistence image at the end of each epoch based on the network's performance. This adaptive calculation enables the network to learn topology outline in the first epochs, and then topology details towards the end of training. The effectiveness of the proposed PI-Att loss is demonstrated on two different datasets for aorta and great vessel segmentation in computed tomography images.

- **Summary**: Existing camouflaged object detection~(COD) methods depend heavily on large-scale pixel-level annotations.However, acquiring such annotations is laborious due to the inherent camouflage characteristics of the objects.Semi-supervised learning offers a promising solution to this challenge.Yet, its application in COD is hindered by significant pseudo-label noise, both pixel-level and instance-level.We introduce CamoTeacher, a novel semi-supervised COD framework, utilizing Dual-Rotation Consistency Learning~(DRCL) to effectively address these noise issues.Specifically, DRCL minimizes pseudo-label noise by leveraging rotation views' consistency in pixel-level and instance-level.First, it employs Pixel-wise Consistency Learning~(PCL) to deal with pixel-level noise by reweighting the different parts within the pseudo-label.Second, Instance-wise Consistency Learning~(ICL) is used to adjust weights for pseudo-labels, which handles instance-level noise.Extensive experiments on four COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CamoTeacher not only achieves state-of-the-art compared with semi-supervised learning methods, but also rivals established fully-supervised learning methods.Our code will be available soon.

- **Summary**: Data scarcity is a major limiting factor for applying modern machine learning techniques to clinical tasks. Although sufficient data exists for some well-studied medical tasks, there remains a long tail of clinically relevant tasks with poor data availability. Recently, numerous foundation models have demonstrated high suitability for few-shot learning (FSL) and zero-shot learning (ZSL), potentially making them more accessible to practitioners. However, it remains unclear which foundation model performs best on FSL medical image analysis tasks and what the optimal methods are for learning from limited data. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark study of ZSL and FSL using 16 pretrained foundation models on 19 diverse medical imaging datasets. Our results indicate that BiomedCLIP, a model pretrained exclusively on medical data, performs best on average for very small training set sizes, while very large CLIP models pretrained on LAION-2B perform best with slightly more training samples. However, simply fine-tuning a ResNet-18 pretrained on ImageNet performs similarly with more than five training examples per class. Our findings also highlight the need for further research on foundation models specifically tailored for medical applications and the collection of more datasets to train these models.

- **Summary**: Generative self-supervised learning demonstrates outstanding representation learning capabilities in both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, there are currently no generative pre-training methods related to selective state space models (Mamba) that can handle long-range dependencies effectively. To address this challenge, we introduce a generative self-supervised learning method for Mamba (MambaMIM) based on Selective Structure State Space Sequence Token-interpolation (S6T), a general-purpose pre-training method for arbitrary Mamba architectures. Our method, MambaMIM, incorporates a bottom-up 3D hybrid masking strategy in the encoder to maintain masking consistency across different architectures. Additionally, S6T is employed to learn causal relationships between the masked sequence in the state space. MambaMIM can be used on any single or hybrid Mamba architectures to enhance the Mamba long-range representation capability. Extensive downstream experiments reveal the feasibility and advancement of using Mamba for pre-training medical image tasks. The code is available at: https://github.com/FengheTan9/MambaMIM

- **Summary**: Current works focus on addressing the remote sensing change detection task using bi-temporal images. Although good performance can be achieved, however, seldom of they consider the motion cues which may also be vital. In this work, we revisit the widely adopted bi-temporal images-based framework and propose a novel Coarse-grained Temporal Mining Augmented (CTMA) framework. To be specific, given the bi-temporal images, we first transform them into a video using interpolation operations. Then, a set of temporal encoders is adopted to extract the motion features from the obtained video for coarse-grained changed region prediction. Subsequently, we design a novel Coarse-grained Foregrounds Augmented Spatial Encoder module to integrate both global and local information. We also introduce a motion augmented strategy that leverages motion cues as an additional output to aggregate with the spatial features for improved results. Meanwhile, we feed the input image pairs into the ResNet to get the different features and also the spatial blocks for fine-grained feature learning. More importantly, we propose a mask augmented strategy that utilizes coarse-grained changed regions, incorporating them into the decoder blocks to enhance the final changed prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework for remote sensing image change detection.

- **Summary**: Existing methods for reconstructing objects and humans from a monocular image suffer from severe mesh collisions and performance limitations for interacting occluding objects. This paper introduces a method to obtain a globally consistent 3D reconstruction of interacting objects and people from a single image. Our contributions include: 1) an optimization framework, featuring a collision loss, tailored to handle human-object and human-human interactions, ensuring spatially coherent scene reconstruction; and 2) a novel technique to robustly estimate 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) poses, specifically for heavily occluded objects, exploiting image inpainting. Notably, our proposed method operates effectively on images from real-world scenarios, without necessitating scene or object-level 3D supervision. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation against existing methods demonstrates a significant reduction in collisions in the final reconstructions of scenes with multiple interacting humans and objects and a more coherent scene reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Translating NIR to the visible spectrum is challenging due to cross-domain complexities. Current models struggle to balance a broad receptive field with computational efficiency, limiting practical use. Although the Selective Structured State Space Model, especially the improved version, Mamba, excels in generative tasks by capturing long-range dependencies with linear complexity, its default approach of converting 2D images into 1D sequences neglects local context. In this work, we propose a simple but effective backbone, dubbed ColorMamba, which first introduces Mamba into spectral translation tasks. To explore global long-range dependencies and local context for efficient spectral translation, we introduce learnable padding tokens to enhance the distinction of image boundaries and prevent potential confusion within the sequence model. Furthermore, local convolutional enhancement and agent attention are designed to improve the vanilla Mamba. Moreover, we exploit the HSV color to provide multi-scale guidance in the reconstruction process for more accurate spectral translation. Extensive experiments show that our ColorMamba achieves a 1.02 improvement in terms of PSNR compared with the state-of-the-art method.

- **Summary**: Image restoration involves recovering a high-quality clean image from its degraded version, which is a fundamental task in computer vision. Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the effectiveness of learning models capable of addressing various degradations simultaneously, i.e., the All-in-One image restoration models. However, these existing methods typically utilize the same parameters facing images with different degradation types, which causes the model to be forced to trade off between degradation types, therefore impair the total performance. To solve this problem, we propose HAIR, a Hypernetworks-based plug-in-and-play method that dynamically generated parameters for the corresponding networks based on the contents of input images. HAIR consists of 2 main components: Classifier (Cl) and Hyper Selecting Net (HSN). To be more specific, the Classifier is a simple image classification network which is used to generate a Global Information Vector (GIV) that contains the degradation information of the input image; And the HSNs can be seen as a simple Fully-connected Neural Network that receive the GIV and output parameters for the corresponding modules. Extensive experiments shows that incorporating HAIR into the architectures can significantly improve the performance of different models on image restoration tasks at a low cost, \textbf{although HAIR only generate parameters and haven't change these models' logical structures at all.} With incorporating HAIR into the popular architecture Restormer, our method obtains superior or at least comparable performance to current state-of-the-art methods on a range of image restoration tasks. \href{https://github.com/toummHus/HAIR}{\textcolor{blue}{$\underline{\textbf{Code and pre-trained checkpoints are available here.}}$}}

- **Summary**: LiDAR-based outdoor 3D object detection has received widespread attention. However, training 3D detectors from the LiDAR point cloud typically relies on expensive bounding box annotations. This paper presents OC3D, an innovative weakly supervised method requiring only coarse clicks on the bird' s eye view of the 3D point cloud. A key challenge here is the absence of complete geometric descriptions of the target objects from such simple click annotations. To address this problem, our proposed OC3D adopts a two-stage strategy. In the first stage, we initially design a novel dynamic and static classification strategy and then propose the Click2Box and Click2Mask modules to generate box-level and mask-level pseudo-labels for static and dynamic instances, respectively. In the second stage, we design a Mask2Box module, leveraging the learning capabilities of neural networks to update mask-level pseudo-labels, which contain less information, to box level pseudo-labels. Experimental results on the widely used KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our OC3D with only coarse clicks achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to weakly-supervised 3D detection methods. Combining OC3D with a missing click mining strategy, we propose a OC3D++ pipeline, which requires only 0.2% annotation cost in the KITTI dataset to achieve performance comparable to fully supervised methods.

- **Summary**: Existing codecs are designed to eliminate intrinsic redundancies to create a compact representation for compression. However, strong external priors from Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have not been explicitly explored in video compression. Herein, we introduce a unified paradigm for Cross-Modality Video Coding (CMVC), which is a pioneering approach to explore multimodality representation and video generative models in video coding. Specifically, on the encoder side, we disentangle a video into spatial content and motion components, which are subsequently transformed into distinct modalities to achieve very compact representation by leveraging MLLMs. During decoding, previously encoded components and video generation models are leveraged to create multiple encoding-decoding modes that optimize video reconstruction quality for specific decoding requirements, including Text-Text-to-Video (TT2V) mode to ensure high-quality semantic information and Image-Text-to-Video (IT2V) mode to achieve superb perceptual consistency. In addition, we propose an efficient frame interpolation model for IT2V mode via Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) tuning to guarantee perceptual quality, which allows the generated motion cues to behave smoothly. Experiments on benchmarks indicate that TT2V achieves effective semantic reconstruction, while IT2V exhibits competitive perceptual consistency. These results highlight potential directions for future research in video coding.

- **Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased exceptional ability in causal reasoning from textual information. However, will these causalities remain straightforward for Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) when only visual hints are provided? Motivated by this, we propose a novel Multimodal Causal Reasoning benchmark, namely MuCR, to challenge VLLMs to infer semantic cause-and-effect relationship when solely relying on visual cues such as action, appearance, clothing, and environment. Specifically, we introduce a prompt-driven image synthesis approach to create siamese images with embedded semantic causality and visual cues, which can effectively evaluate VLLMs' causal reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we develop tailored metrics from multiple perspectives, including image-level match, phrase-level understanding, and sentence-level explanation, to comprehensively assess VLLMs' comprehension abilities. Our extensive experiments reveal that the current state-of-the-art VLLMs are not as skilled at multimodal causal reasoning as we might have hoped. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive analysis to understand these models' shortcomings from different views and suggest directions for future research. We hope MuCR can serve as a valuable resource and foundational benchmark in multimodal causal reasoning research. The project is available at: https://github.com/Zhiyuan-Li-John/MuCR

- **Summary**: Object parts serve as crucial intermediate representations in various downstream tasks, but part-level representation learning still has not received as much attention as other vision tasks. Previous research has established that Vision Transformer can learn instance-level attention without labels, extracting high-quality instance-level representations for boosting downstream tasks. In this paper, we achieve unsupervised part-specific attention learning using a novel paradigm and further employ the part representations to improve part discovery performance. Specifically, paired images are generated from the same image with different geometric transformations, and multiple part representations are extracted from these paired images using a novel module, named PartFormer. These part representations from the paired images are then exchanged to improve geometric transformation invariance. Subsequently, the part representations are aligned with the feature map extracted by a feature map encoder, achieving high similarity with the pixel representations of the corresponding part regions and low similarity in irrelevant regions. Finally, the geometric and semantic constraints are applied to the part representations through the intermediate results in alignment for part-specific attention learning, encouraging the PartFormer to focus locally and the part representations to explicitly include the information of the corresponding parts. Moreover, the aligned part representations can further serve as a series of reliable detectors in the testing phase, predicting pixel masks for part discovery. Extensive experiments are carried out on four widely used datasets, and our results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance and robustness due to its part-specific attention.

- **Summary**: Real-world data consistently exhibits a long-tailed distribution, often spanning multiple categories. This complexity underscores the challenge of content comprehension, particularly in scenarios requiring Long-Tailed Multi-Label image Classification (LTMLC). In such contexts, imbalanced data distribution and multi-object recognition pose significant hurdles. To address this issue, we propose a novel and effective approach for LTMLC, termed Category-Prompt Refined Feature Learning (CPRFL), utilizing semantic correlations between different categories and decoupling category-specific visual representations for each category. Specifically, CPRFL initializes category-prompts from the pretrained CLIP's embeddings and decouples category-specific visual representations through interaction with visual features, thereby facilitating the establishment of semantic correlations between the head and tail classes. To mitigate the visual-semantic domain bias, we design a progressive Dual-Path Back-Propagation mechanism to refine the prompts by progressively incorporating context-related visual information into prompts. Simultaneously, the refinement process facilitates the progressive purification of the category-specific visual representations under the guidance of the refined prompts. Furthermore, taking into account the negative-positive sample imbalance, we adopt the Asymmetric Loss as our optimization objective to suppress negative samples across all classes and potentially enhance the head-to-tail recognition performance. We validate the effectiveness of our method on two LTMLC benchmarks and extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our work over baselines.

- **Summary**: In the fields of computer vision and robotics, accurate pixel-level correspondences are essential for enabling advanced tasks such as structure-from-motion and simultaneous localization and mapping. Recent correspondence pruning methods usually focus on learning local consistency through k-nearest neighbors, which makes it difficult to capture robust context for each correspondence. We propose CorrAdaptor, a novel architecture that introduces a dual-branch structure capable of adaptively adjusting local contexts through both explicit and implicit local graph learning. Specifically, the explicit branch uses KNN-based graphs tailored for initial neighborhood identification, while the implicit branch leverages a learnable matrix to softly assign neighbors and adaptively expand the local context scope, significantly enhancing the model's robustness and adaptability to complex image variations. Moreover, we design a motion injection module to integrate motion consistency into the network to suppress the impact of outliers and refine local context learning, resulting in substantial performance improvements. The experimental results on extensive correspondence-based tasks indicate that our CorrAdaptor achieves state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/TaoWangzj/CorrAdaptor.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks are proven to be vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. Recently, a specific type of data poisoning attack known as availability attacks has led to the failure of data utilization for model learning by adding imperceptible perturbations to images. Consequently, it is quite beneficial and challenging to detect poisoned samples, also known as Unlearnable Examples (UEs), from a mixed dataset. In response, we propose an Iterative Filtering approach for UEs identification. This method leverages the distinction between the inherent semantic mapping rules and shortcuts, without the need for any additional information. We verify that when training a classifier on a mixed dataset containing both UEs and clean data, the model tends to quickly adapt to the UEs compared to the clean data. Due to the accuracy gaps between training with clean/poisoned samples, we employ a model to misclassify clean samples while correctly identifying the poisoned ones. The incorporation of additional classes and iterative refinement enhances the model's ability to differentiate between clean and poisoned samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art detection approaches across various attacks, datasets, and poison ratios, significantly reducing the Half Total Error Rate (HTER) compared to existing methods.

- **Summary**: Recent research tries to extend image restoration capabilities from human perception to machine perception, thereby enhancing the performance of high-level vision tasks in degraded environments. These methods, primarily based on supervised learning, typically involve the retraining of restoration networks or high-level vision networks. However, collecting paired data in real-world scenarios and retraining large-scale models are challenge. To this end, we propose an unsupervised learning method called \textbf{Va}riational \textbf{T}ranslator (VaT), which does not require retraining existing restoration and high-level vision networks. Instead, it establishes a lightweight network that serves as an intermediate bridge between them. By variational inference, VaT approximates the joint distribution of restoration output and high-level vision input, dividing the optimization objective into preserving content and maximizing marginal likelihood associated with high-level vision tasks. By cleverly leveraging self-training paradigms, VaT achieves the above optimization objective without requiring labels. As a result, the translated images maintain a close resemblance to their original content while also demonstrating exceptional performance on high-level vision tasks. Extensive experiments in dehazing and low-light enhancement for detection and classification show the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, even significantly surpassing supervised methods in some complex real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Training a neural network is a monolithic endeavor, akin to carving knowledge into stone: once the process is completed, editing the knowledge in a network is nearly impossible, since all information is distributed across the network's weights. We here explore a simple, compelling alternative by marrying the representational power of deep neural networks with the flexibility of a database. Decomposing the task of image classification into image similarity (from a pre-trained embedding) and search (via fast nearest neighbor retrieval from a knowledge database), we build a simple and flexible visual memory that has the following key capabilities: (1.) The ability to flexibly add data across scales: from individual samples all the way to entire classes and billion-scale data; (2.) The ability to remove data through unlearning and memory pruning; (3.) An interpretable decision-mechanism on which we can intervene to control its behavior. Taken together, these capabilities comprehensively demonstrate the benefits of an explicit visual memory. We hope that it might contribute to a conversation on how knowledge should be represented in deep vision models -- beyond carving it in ``stone'' weights.

- **Summary**: People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) often experience progressively worsening gait, including changes in how they turn around, as the disease progresses. Existing clinical rating tools are not capable of capturing hour-by-hour variations of PD symptoms, as they are confined to brief assessments within clinic settings. Measuring real-world gait turning angles continuously and passively is a component step towards using gait characteristics as sensitive indicators of disease progression in PD. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to automatically quantify turning angles by extracting 3D skeletons from videos and calculating the rotation of hip and knee joints. We utilise state-of-the-art human pose estimation models, Fastpose and Strided Transformer, on a total of 1386 turning video clips from 24 subjects (12 people with PD and 12 healthy control volunteers), trimmed from a PD dataset of unscripted free-living videos in a home-like setting (Turn-REMAP). We also curate a turning video dataset, Turn-H3.6M, from the public Human3.6M human pose benchmark with 3D ground truth, to further validate our method. Previous gait research has primarily taken place in clinics or laboratories evaluating scripted gait outcomes, but this work focuses on real-world settings where complexities exist, such as baggy clothing and poor lighting. Due to difficulties in obtaining accurate ground truth data in a free-living setting, we quantise the angle into the nearest bin $45^\circ$ based on the manual labelling of expert clinicians. Our method achieves a turning calculation accuracy of 41.6%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 34.7{\deg}, and a weighted precision WPrec of 68.3% for Turn-REMAP. This is the first work to explore the use of single monocular camera data to quantify turns by PD patients in a home setting.

- **Summary**: This work addresses the challenge of quantifying originality in text-to-image (T2I) generative diffusion models, with a focus on copyright originality. We begin by evaluating T2I models' ability to innovate and generalize through controlled experiments, revealing that stable diffusion models can effectively recreate unseen elements with sufficiently diverse training data. Then, our key insight is that concepts and combinations of image elements the model is familiar with, and saw more during training, are more concisly represented in the model's latent space. We hence propose a method that leverages textual inversion to measure the originality of an image based on the number of tokens required for its reconstruction by the model. Our approach is inspired by legal definitions of originality and aims to assess whether a model can produce original content without relying on specific prompts or having the training data of the model. We demonstrate our method using both a pre-trained stable diffusion model and a synthetic dataset, showing a correlation between the number of tokens and image originality. This work contributes to the understanding of originality in generative models and has implications for copyright infringement cases.

- **Summary**: Synthesizing motion-rich and temporally consistent videos remains a challenge in artificial intelligence, especially when dealing with extended durations. Existing text-to-video (T2V) models commonly employ spatial cross-attention for text control, equivalently guiding different frame generations without frame-specific textual guidance. Thus, the model's capacity to comprehend the temporal logic conveyed in prompts and generate videos with coherent motion is restricted. To tackle this limitation, we introduce FancyVideo, an innovative video generator that improves the existing text-control mechanism with the well-designed Cross-frame Textual Guidance Module (CTGM). Specifically, CTGM incorporates the Temporal Information Injector (TII), Temporal Affinity Refiner (TAR), and Temporal Feature Booster (TFB) at the beginning, middle, and end of cross-attention, respectively, to achieve frame-specific textual guidance. Firstly, TII injects frame-specific information from latent features into text conditions, thereby obtaining cross-frame textual conditions. Then, TAR refines the correlation matrix between cross-frame textual conditions and latent features along the time dimension. Lastly, TFB boosts the temporal consistency of latent features. Extensive experiments comprising both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of FancyVideo. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art T2V generation results on the EvalCrafter benchmark and facilitates the synthesis of dynamic and consistent videos. The video show results can be available at https://fancyvideo.github.io/, and we will make our code and model weights publicly available.

- **Summary**: In this work, we make the first attempt to construct a learning-based single-point annotation paradigm for infrared small target label generation (IRSTLG). Our intuition is that label generation requires just one more point prompt than target detection: IRSTLG can be regarded as an infrared small target detection (IRSTD) task with the target location hint. Based on this insight, we introduce an energy double guided single-point prompt (EDGSP) framework, which adeptly transforms the target detection network into a refined label generation method. Specifically, the proposed EDGSP includes: 1) target energy initialization (TEI) to create a foundational outline for sufficient shape evolution of pseudo label, 2) double prompt embedding (DPE) for rapid localization of interested regions and reinforcement of individual differences to avoid label adhesion, and 3) bounding box-based matching (BBM) to eliminate false alarms. Experimental results show that pseudo labels generated by three baselines equipped with EDGSP achieve 100% object-level probability of detection (Pd) and 0% false-alarm rate (Fa) on SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1k datasets, with a pixel-level intersection over union (IoU) improvement of 13.28% over state-of-the-art label generation methods. Additionally, the downstream detection task reveals that our centroid-annotated pseudo labels surpass full labels, even with coarse single-point annotations, it still achieves 99.5% performance of full labeling.

- **Summary**: Dataset distillation or condensation aims to condense a large-scale training dataset into a much smaller synthetic one such that the training performance of distilled and original sets on neural networks are similar. Although the number of training samples can be reduced substantially, current state-of-the-art methods heavily rely on enormous soft labels to achieve satisfactory performance. As a result, the required storage can be comparable even to original datasets, especially for large-scale ones. To solve this problem, instead of storing these heavy labels, we propose a novel label-lightening framework termed HeLlO aiming at effective image-to-label projectors, with which synthetic labels can be directly generated online from synthetic images. Specifically, to construct such projectors, we leverage prior knowledge in open-source foundation models, e.g., CLIP, and introduce a LoRA-like fine-tuning strategy to mitigate the gap between pre-trained and target distributions, so that original models for soft-label generation can be distilled into a group of low-rank matrices. Moreover, an effective image optimization method is proposed to further mitigate the potential error between the original and distilled label generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that with only about 0.003% of the original storage required for a complete set of soft labels, we achieve comparable performance to current state-of-the-art dataset distillation methods on large-scale datasets. Our code will be available.

- **Summary**: Human motion prediction is crucial for human-centric multimedia understanding and interacting. Current methods typically rely on ground truth human poses as observed input, which is not practical for real-world scenarios where only raw visual sensor data is available. To implement these methods in practice, a pre-phrase of pose estimation is essential. However, such two-stage approaches often lead to performance degradation due to the accumulation of errors. Moreover, reducing raw visual data to sparse keypoint representations significantly diminishes the density of information, resulting in the loss of fine-grained features. In this paper, we propose \textit{LiDAR-HMP}, the first single-LiDAR-based 3D human motion prediction approach, which receives the raw LiDAR point cloud as input and forecasts future 3D human poses directly. Building upon our novel structure-aware body feature descriptor, LiDAR-HMP adaptively maps the observed motion manifold to future poses and effectively models the spatial-temporal correlations of human motions for further refinement of prediction results. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public benchmarks and demonstrates remarkable robustness and efficacy in real-world deployments.

- **Summary**: Deep-learning-based identity management systems, such as face authentication systems, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, existing attacks are typically designed for single-task purposes, which means they are tailored to exploit vulnerabilities unique to the individual target rather than being adaptable for multiple users or systems. This limitation makes them unsuitable for certain attack scenarios, such as morphing, universal, transferable, and counter attacks. In this paper, we propose a multi-task adversarial attack algorithm called MTADV that are adaptable for multiple users or systems. By interpreting these scenarios as multi-task attacks, MTADV is applicable to both single- and multi-task attacks, and feasible in the white- and gray-box settings. Furthermore, MTADV is effective against various face datasets, including LFW, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ, and can work with different deep learning models, such as FaceNet, InsightFace, and CurricularFace. Importantly, MTADV retains its feasibility as a single-task attack targeting a single user/system. To the best of our knowledge, MTADV is the first adversarial attack method that can target all of the aforementioned scenarios in one algorithm.

- **Summary**: The underwater 3D scene reconstruction is a challenging, yet interesting problem with applications ranging from naval robots to VR experiences. The problem was successfully tackled by fully volumetric NeRF-based methods which can model both the geometry and the medium (water). Unfortunately, these methods are slow to train and do not offer real-time rendering. More recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method offered a fast alternative to NeRFs. However, because it is an explicit method that renders only the geometry, it cannot render the medium and is therefore unsuited for underwater reconstruction. Therefore, we propose a novel approach that fuses volumetric rendering with 3DGS to handle underwater data effectively. Our method employs 3DGS for explicit geometry representation and a separate volumetric field (queried once per pixel) for capturing the scattering medium. This dual representation further allows the restoration of the scenes by removing the scattering medium. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods in rendering quality on the underwater SeaThru-NeRF dataset. Furthermore, it does so while offering real-time rendering performance, addressing the efficiency limitations of existing methods. Web: https://water-splatting.github.io

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving sensors generate an enormous amount of data. In this paper, we explore learned multimodal compression for autonomous driving, specifically targeted at 3D object detection. We focus on camera and LiDAR modalities and explore several coding approaches. One approach involves joint coding of fused modalities, while others involve coding one modality first, followed by conditional coding of the other modality. We evaluate the performance of these coding schemes on the nuScenes dataset. Our experimental results indicate that joint coding of fused modalities yields better results compared to the alternatives.

- **Summary**: Image classification usually requires connectivity and access to the cloud which is often limited in many parts of the world, including hard to reach rural areas. TinyML aims to solve this problem by hosting AI assistants on constrained devices, eliminating connectivity issues by processing data within the device itself, without internet or cloud access. This pilot study explores the use of tinyML to provide healthcare support with low spec devices in low connectivity environments, focusing on diagnosis of skin diseases and the ethical use of AI assistants in a healthcare setting. To investigate this, 10,000 images of skin lesions were used to train a model for classifying visually detectable diseases (VDDs). The model weights were then offloaded to a Raspberry Pi with a webcam attached, to be used for the classification of skin lesions without internet access. It was found that the developed prototype achieved a test accuracy of 78% and a test loss of 1.08.

- **Summary**: Image-to-Image translation in Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) has been a central focus of research, with applications spanning healthcare, remote sensing, physics, chemistry, photography, and more. Among the numerous methodologies, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with contrastive learning have been particularly successful. This study aims to demonstrate that the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) can effectively replace the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) method in generative AI, particularly in the subdomain of image-to-image translation, to achieve better generative quality. Our novel approach replaces the two-layer MLP with a two-layer KAN in the existing Contrastive Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation (CUT) model, developing the KAN-CUT model. This substitution favors the generation of more informative features in low-dimensional vector representations, which contrastive learning can utilize more effectively to produce high-quality images in the target domain. Extensive experiments, detailed in the results section, demonstrate the applicability of KAN in conjunction with contrastive learning and GANs in Generative AI, particularly for image-to-image translation. This work suggests that KAN could be a valuable component in the broader generative AI domain.

- **Summary**: Reconstruction-based methods, particularly those leveraging autoencoders, have been widely adopted to perform anomaly detection in brain MRI. While most existing works try to improve detection accuracy by proposing new model structures or algorithms, we tackle the problem through image quality assessment, an underexplored perspective in the field. We propose a fusion quality loss function that combines Structural Similarity Index Measure loss with l1 loss, offering a more comprehensive evaluation of reconstruction quality. Additionally, we introduce a data pre-processing strategy that enhances the average intensity ratio (AIR) between normal and abnormal regions, further improving the distinction of anomalies. By fusing the aforementioned two methods, we devise the image quality assessment (IQA) approach. The proposed IQA approach achieves significant improvements (>10%) in terms of Dice coefficient (DICE) and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) on the BraTS21 (T2, FLAIR) and MSULB datasets when compared with state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the importance of invoking the comprehensive image quality assessment in medical anomaly detection and provide a new perspective for future research in this field.



### Comparative Evaluation of 3D Reconstruction Methods for Object Pose Estimation

- **Summary**: Object pose estimation is essential to many industrial applications involving robotic manipulation, navigation, and augmented reality. Current generalizable object pose estimators, i.e., approaches that do not need to be trained per object, rely on accurate 3D models. Predominantly, CAD models are used, which can be hard to obtain in practice. At the same time, it is often possible to acquire images of an object. Naturally, this leads to the question whether 3D models reconstructed from images are sufficient to facilitate accurate object pose estimation. We aim to answer this question by proposing a novel benchmark for measuring the impact of 3D reconstruction quality on pose estimation accuracy. Our benchmark provides calibrated images for object reconstruction registered with the test images of the YCB-V dataset for pose evaluation under the BOP benchmark format. Detailed experiments with multiple state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction and object pose estimation approaches show that the geometry produced by modern reconstruction methods is often sufficient for accurate pose estimation. Our experiments lead to interesting observations: (1) Standard metrics for measuring 3D reconstruction quality are not necessarily indicative of pose estimation accuracy, which shows the need for dedicated benchmarks such as ours. (2) Classical, non-learning-based approaches can perform on par with modern learning-based reconstruction techniques and can even offer a better reconstruction time-pose accuracy tradeoff. (3) There is still a sizable gap between performance with reconstructed and with CAD models. To foster research on closing this gap, our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/VarunBurde/reconstruction_pose_benchmark}.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks have consistently represented the state of the art in most computer vision problems. In these scenarios, larger and more complex models have demonstrated superior performance to smaller architectures, especially when trained with plenty of representative data. With the recent adoption of Vision Transformer (ViT) based architectures and advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the total number of parameters of leading backbone architectures increased from 62M parameters in 2012 with AlexNet to 7B parameters in 2024 with AIM-7B. Consequently, deploying such deep architectures faces challenges in environments with processing and runtime constraints, particularly in embedded systems. This paper covers the main model compression techniques applied for computer vision tasks, enabling modern models to be used in embedded systems. We present the characteristics of compression subareas, compare different approaches, and discuss how to choose the best technique and expected variations when analyzing it on various embedded devices. We also share codes to assist researchers and new practitioners in overcoming initial implementation challenges for each subarea and present trends for Model Compression.

- **Summary**: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification with multiple instance learning (MIL) in digital pathology faces significant computational challenges. Current methods mostly rely on extensive self-supervised learning (SSL) for satisfactory performance, requiring long training periods and considerable computational resources. At the same time, no pre-training affects performance due to domain shifts from natural images to WSIs. We introduce \textbf{\textit{Snuffy}} architecture, a novel MIL-pooling method based on sparse transformers that mitigates performance loss with limited pre-training and enables continual few-shot pre-training as a competitive option. Our sparsity pattern is tailored for pathology and is theoretically proven to be a universal approximator with the tightest probabilistic sharp bound on the number of layers for sparse transformers, to date. We demonstrate Snuffy's effectiveness on CAMELYON16 and TCGA Lung cancer datasets, achieving superior WSI and patch-level accuracies.

- **Summary**: Accurate 3D lane detection from monocular images presents significant challenges due to depth ambiguity and imperfect ground modeling. Previous attempts to model the ground have often used a planar ground assumption with limited degrees of freedom, making them unsuitable for complex road environments with varying slopes. Our study introduces HeightLane, an innovative method that predicts a height map from monocular images by creating anchors based on a multi-slope assumption. This approach provides a detailed and accurate representation of the ground. HeightLane employs the predicted heightmap along with a deformable attention-based spatial feature transform framework to efficiently convert 2D image features into 3D bird's eye view (BEV) features, enhancing spatial understanding and lane structure recognition. Additionally, the heightmap is used for the positional encoding of BEV features, further improving their spatial accuracy. This explicit view transformation bridges the gap between front-view perceptions and spatially accurate BEV representations, significantly improving detection performance. To address the lack of the necessary ground truth (GT) height map in the original OpenLane dataset, we leverage the Waymo dataset and accumulate its LiDAR data to generate a height map for the drivable area of each scene. The GT heightmaps are used to train the heightmap extraction module from monocular images. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane validation set show that HeightLane achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of F-score, highlighting its potential in real-world applications.



### SLCA++: Unleash the Power of Sequential Fine-tuning for Continual Learning with Pre-training

- **Summary**: In recent years, continual learning with pre-training (CLPT) has received widespread interest, instead of its traditional focus of training from scratch. The use of strong pre-trained models (PTMs) can greatly facilitate knowledge transfer and alleviate catastrophic forgetting, but also suffers from progressive overfitting of pre-trained knowledge into specific downstream tasks. A majority of current efforts often keep the PTMs frozen and incorporate task-specific prompts to instruct representation learning, coupled with a prompt selection process for inference. However, due to the limited capacity of prompt parameters, this strategy demonstrates only sub-optimal performance in continual learning. In comparison, tuning all parameters of PTMs often provides the greatest potential for representation learning, making sequential fine-tuning (Seq FT) a fundamental baseline that has been overlooked in CLPT. To this end, we present an in-depth analysis of the progressive overfitting problem from the lens of Seq FT. Considering that the overly fast representation learning and the biased classification layer constitute this particular problem, we introduce the advanced Slow Learner with Classifier Alignment (SLCA++) framework to unleash the power of Seq FT, serving as a strong baseline approach for CLPT. Our approach involves a Slow Learner to selectively reduce the learning rate of backbone parameters, and a Classifier Alignment to align the disjoint classification layers in a post-hoc fashion. We further enhance the efficacy of SL with a symmetric cross-entropy loss, as well as employ a parameter-efficient strategy to implement Seq FT with SLCA++. Across a variety of continual learning scenarios on image classification benchmarks, our approach provides substantial improvements and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Visual relationship understanding has been studied separately in human-object interaction(HOI) detection, scene graph generation(SGG), and referring relationships(RR) tasks. Given the complexity and interconnectedness of these tasks, it is crucial to have a flexible framework that can effectively address these tasks in a cohesive manner. In this work, we propose FleVRS, a single model that seamlessly integrates the above three aspects in standard and promptable visual relationship segmentation, and further possesses the capability for open-vocabulary segmentation to adapt to novel scenarios. FleVRS leverages the synergy between text and image modalities, to ground various types of relationships from images and use textual features from vision-language models to visual conceptual understanding. Empirical validation across various datasets demonstrates that our framework outperforms existing models in standard, promptable, and open-vocabulary tasks, e.g., +1.9 $mAP$ on HICO-DET, +11.4 $Acc$ on VRD, +4.7 $mAP$ on unseen HICO-DET. Our FleVRS represents a significant step towards a more intuitive, comprehensive, and scalable understanding of visual relationships.

- **Summary**: Deep generative models learn continuous representations of complex data manifolds using a finite number of samples during training. For a pre-trained generative model, the common way to evaluate the quality of the manifold representation learned, is by computing global metrics like Fr\'echet Inception Distance using a large number of generated and real samples. However, generative model performance is not uniform across the learned manifold, e.g., for \textit{foundation models} like Stable Diffusion generation performance can vary significantly based on the conditioning or initial noise vector being denoised. In this paper we study the relationship between the \textit{local geometry of the learned manifold} and downstream generation. Based on the theory of continuous piecewise-linear (CPWL) generators, we use three geometric descriptors - scaling ($\psi$), rank ($\nu$), and complexity ($\delta$) - to characterize a pre-trained generative model manifold locally. We provide quantitative and qualitative evidence showing that for a given latent, the local descriptors are correlated with generation aesthetics, artifacts, uncertainty, and even memorization. Finally we demonstrate that training a \textit{reward model} on the local geometry can allow controlling the likelihood of a generated sample under the learned distribution.

- **Summary**: Assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is often challenging, in part, because it is hard to find tasks to which they have not been exposed during training. We take one step to address this challenge by turning to a new task: focusing on symbolic graphics programs, which are a popular representation for graphics content that procedurally generates visual data. LLMs have shown exciting promise towards program synthesis, but do they understand symbolic graphics programs? Unlike conventional programs, symbolic graphics programs can be translated to graphics content. Here, we characterize an LLM's understanding of symbolic programs in terms of their ability to answer questions related to the graphics content. This task is challenging as the questions are difficult to answer from the symbolic programs alone -- yet, they would be easy to answer from the corresponding graphics content as we verify through a human experiment. To understand symbolic programs, LLMs may need to possess the ability to imagine how the corresponding graphics content would look without directly accessing the rendered visual content. We use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic understanding of symbolic graphics programs. This benchmark is built via program-graphics correspondence, hence requiring minimal human efforts. We evaluate current LLMs on our benchmark to elucidate a preliminary assessment of their ability to reason about visual scenes from programs. We find that this task distinguishes existing LLMs and models considered good at reasoning perform better. Lastly, we introduce Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT) to improve this ability. Specifically, we query GPT4-o with questions and images generated by symbolic programs. Such data are then used to finetune an LLM. We also find that SIT data can improve the general instruction following ability of LLMs.
