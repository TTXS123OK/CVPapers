- **Summary**: The rise of generative models has sparked concerns about image authenticity online, highlighting the urgent need for an effective and general detector. Recent methods leveraging the frozen pre-trained CLIP-ViT model have made great progress in deepfake detection. However, these models often rely on visual-general features directly extracted by the frozen network, which contain excessive information irrelevant to the task, resulting in limited detection performance. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose an efficient Guided and Fused Frozen CLIP-ViT (GFF), which integrates two simple yet effective modules. The Deepfake-Specific Feature Guidance Module (DFGM) guides the frozen pre-trained model in extracting features specifically for deepfake detection, reducing irrelevant information while preserving its generalization capabilities. The Multi-Stage Fusion Module (FuseFormer) captures low-level and high-level information by fusing features extracted from each stage of the ViT. This dual-module approach significantly improves deepfake detection by fully leveraging CLIP-ViT's inherent advantages. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of GFF, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with optimal results in only 5 training epochs. Even when trained on only 4 classes of ProGAN, GFF achieves nearly 99% accuracy on unseen GANs and maintains an impressive 97% accuracy on unseen diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Automatic and precise medical image segmentation (MIS) is of vital importance for clinical diagnosis and analysis. Current MIS methods mainly rely on the convolutional neural network (CNN) or self-attention mechanism (Transformer) for feature modeling. However, CNN-based methods suffer from the inaccurate localization owing to the limited global dependency while Transformer-based methods always present the coarse boundary for the lack of local emphasis. Although some CNN-Transformer hybrid methods are designed to synthesize the complementary local and global information for better performance, the combination of CNN and Transformer introduces numerous parameters and increases the computation cost. To this end, this paper proposes a CNN-Transformer rectified collaborative learning (CTRCL) framework to learn stronger CNN-based and Transformer-based models for MIS tasks via the bi-directional knowledge transfer between them. Specifically, we propose a rectified logit-wise collaborative learning (RLCL) strategy which introduces the ground truth to adaptively select and rectify the wrong regions in student soft labels for accurate knowledge transfer in the logit space. We also propose a class-aware feature-wise collaborative learning (CFCL) strategy to achieve effective knowledge transfer between CNN-based and Transformer-based models in the feature space by granting their intermediate features the similar capability of category perception. Extensive experiments on three popular MIS benchmarks demonstrate that our CTRCL outperforms most state-of-the-art collaborative learning methods under different evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Indoor monocular depth estimation helps home automation, including robot navigation or AR/VR for surrounding perception. Most previous methods primarily experiment with the NYUv2 Dataset and concentrate on the overall performance in their evaluation. However, their robustness and generalization to diversely unseen types or categories for indoor spaces (spaces types) have yet to be discovered. Researchers may empirically find degraded performance in a released pretrained model on custom data or less-frequent types. This paper studies the common but easily overlooked factor-space type and realizes a model's performance variances across spaces. We present InSpaceType Dataset, a high-quality RGBD dataset for general indoor scenes, and benchmark 13 recent state-of-the-art methods on InSpaceType. Our examination shows that most of them suffer from performance imbalance between head and tailed types, and some top methods are even more severe. The work reveals and analyzes underlying bias in detail for transparency and robustness. We extend the analysis to a total of 4 datasets and discuss the best practice in synthetic data curation for training indoor monocular depth. Further, dataset ablation is conducted to find out the key factor in generalization. This work marks the first in-depth investigation of performance variances across space types and, more importantly, releases useful tools, including datasets and codes, to closely examine your pretrained depth models.

- **Summary**: Text-driven 3D scene generation has seen significant advancements recently. However, most existing methods generate single-view images using generative models and then stitch them together in 3D space. This independent generation for each view often results in spatial inconsistency and implausibility in the 3D scenes. To address this challenge, we proposed a novel text-driven 3D-consistent scene generation model: SceneDreamer360. Our proposed method leverages a text-driven panoramic image generation model as a prior for 3D scene generation and employs 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to ensure consistency across multi-view panoramic images. Specifically, SceneDreamer360 enhances the fine-tuned Panfusion generator with a three-stage panoramic enhancement, enabling the generation of high-resolution, detail-rich panoramic images. During the 3D scene construction, a novel point cloud fusion initialization method is used, producing higher quality and spatially consistent point clouds. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to other methods, SceneDreamer360 with its panoramic image generation and 3DGS can produce higher quality, spatially consistent, and visually appealing 3D scenes from any text prompt.

- **Summary**: Due to the challenges in acquiring paired Text-3D data and the inherent irregularity of 3D data structures, combined representation learning of 3D point clouds and text remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel Riemann-based Multi-scale Attention Reasoning Network (RMARN) for text-3D retrieval. Specifically, the extracted text and point cloud features are refined by their respective Adaptive Feature Refiner (AFR). Furthermore, we introduce the innovative Riemann Local Similarity (RLS) module and the Global Pooling Similarity (GPS) module. However, as 3D point cloud data and text data often possess complex geometric structures in high-dimensional space, the proposed RLS employs a novel Riemann Attention Mechanism to reflect the intrinsic geometric relationships of the data. Without explicitly defining the manifold, RMARN learns the manifold parameters to better represent the distances between text-point cloud samples. To address the challenges of lacking paired text-3D data, we have created the large-scale Text-3D Retrieval dataset T3DR-HIT, which comprises over 3,380 pairs of text and point cloud data. T3DR-HIT contains coarse-grained indoor 3D scenes and fine-grained Chinese artifact scenes, consisting of 1,380 and over 2,000 text-3D pairs, respectively. Experiments on our custom datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. Our code and proposed datasets are available at \url{https://github.com/liwrui/RMARN}.

- **Summary**: Speech-driven facial animation is important for many applications including TV, film, video games, telecommunication and AR/VR. Recently, transformers have been shown to be extremely effective for this task. However, we identify two issues with the existing transformer-based models. Firstly, they are difficult to adapt to new personalised speaking styles and secondly, they are slow to run for long sentences due to the quadratic complexity of the transformer. We propose TalkLoRA to address both of these issues. TalkLoRA uses Low-Rank Adaptation to effectively and efficiently adapt to new speaking styles, even with limited data. It does this by training an adaptor with a small number of parameters for each subject. We also utilise a chunking strategy to reduce the complexity of the underlying transformer, allowing for long sentences at inference time. TalkLoRA can be applied to any transformer-based speech-driven animation method. We perform extensive experiments to show that TalkLoRA archives state-of-the-art style adaptation and that it allows for an order-of-complexity reduction in inference times without sacrificing quality. We also investigate and provide insights into the hyperparameter selection for LoRA fine-tuning of speech-driven facial animation models.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in local Implicit Neural Representation (INR) demonstrate its exceptional capability in handling images at various resolutions. However, frequency discrepancies between high-resolution (HR) and ground-truth images, especially at larger scales, result in significant artifacts and blurring in HR images. This paper introduces Frequency Consistency for Implicit Neural Representation (FreqINR), an innovative Arbitrary-scale Super-resolution method aimed at enhancing detailed textures by ensuring spectral consistency throughout both training and inference. During training, we employ Adaptive Discrete Cosine Transform Frequency Loss (ADFL) to minimize the frequency gap between HR and ground-truth images, utilizing 2-Dimensional DCT bases and focusing dynamically on challenging frequencies. During inference, we extend the receptive field to preserve spectral coherence between low-resolution (LR) and ground-truth images, which is crucial for the model to generate high-frequency details from LR counterparts. Experimental results show that FreqINR, as a lightweight approach, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing Arbitrary-scale Super-resolution methods and offers notable improvements in computational efficiency. The code for our method will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Classification of sets of inputs (e.g., images and texts) is an active area of research within both computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). A common way to represent a set of vectors is to model them as linear subspaces. In this contribution, we present a prototype-based approach for learning on the manifold formed from such linear subspaces, the Grassmann manifold. Our proposed method learns a set of subspace prototypes capturing the representative characteristics of classes and a set of relevance factors automating the selection of the dimensionality of the subspaces. This leads to a transparent classifier model which presents the computed impact of each input vector on its decision. Through experiments on benchmark image and text datasets, we have demonstrated the efficiency of our proposed classifier, compared to the transformer-based models in terms of not only performance and explainability but also computational resource requirements.

- **Summary**: Surface electromyography (EMG) serves as a pivotal tool in hand gesture recognition and human-computer interaction, offering a non-invasive means of signal acquisition. This study presents a novel methodology for classifying hand gestures using EMG signals. To address the challenges associated with feature extraction where, we explored 23 distinct morphological, time domain and frequency domain feature extraction techniques. However, the substantial size of the features may increase the computational complexity issues that can hinder machine learning algorithm performance. We employ an efficient feature selection approach, specifically an extra tree classifier, to mitigate this. The selected potential feature fed into the various machine learning-based classification algorithms where our model achieved 97.43\% accuracy with the KNN algorithm and selected feature. By leveraging a comprehensive feature extraction and selection strategy, our methodology enhances the accuracy and usability of EMG-based hand gesture recognition systems. The higher performance accuracy proves the effectiveness of the proposed model over the existing system. \keywords{EMG signal, machine learning approach, hand gesture recognition.

- **Summary**: Interactable objects are ubiquitous in our daily lives. Recent advances in 3D generative models make it possible to automate the modeling of these objects, benefiting a range of applications from 3D printing to the creation of robot simulation environments. However, while significant progress has been made in modeling 3D shapes and appearances, modeling object physics, particularly for interactable objects, remains challenging due to the physical constraints imposed by inter-part motions. In this paper, we tackle the problem of physically plausible part completion for interactable objects, aiming to generate 3D parts that not only fit precisely into the object but also allow smooth part motions. To this end, we propose a diffusion-based part generation model that utilizes geometric conditioning through classifier-free guidance and formulates physical constraints as a set of stability and mobility losses to guide the sampling process. Additionally, we demonstrate the generation of dependent parts, paving the way toward sequential part generation for objects with complex part-whole hierarchies. Experimentally, we introduce a new metric for measuring physical plausibility based on motion success rates. Our model outperforms existing baselines over shape and physical metrics, especially those that do not adequately model physical constraints. We also demonstrate our applications in 3D printing, robot manipulation, and sequential part generation, showing our strength in realistic tasks with the demand for high physical plausibility.

- **Summary**: Recently, the Vision Transformer (ViT) model has replaced the classical Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) in various computer vision tasks due to its superior performance. Even in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification field, ViT-based methods also show promising potential. Nevertheless, ViT encounters notable difficulties in processing HSI data. Its self-attention mechanism, which exhibits quadratic complexity, escalates computational costs. Additionally, ViT's substantial demand for training samples does not align with the practical constraints posed by the expensive labeling of HSI data. To overcome these challenges, we propose a 3D relational ConvNet named 3D-RCNet, which inherits both strengths of ConvNet and ViT, resulting in high performance in HSI classification. We embed the self-attention mechanism of Transformer into the convolutional operation of ConvNet to design 3D relational convolutional operation and use it to build the final 3D-RCNet. The proposed 3D-RCNet maintains the high computational efficiency of ConvNet while enjoying the flexibility of ViT. Additionally, the proposed 3D relational convolutional operation is a plug-and-play operation, which can be inserted into previous ConvNet-based HSI classification methods seamlessly. Empirical evaluations on three representative benchmark HSI datasets show that the proposed model outperforms previous ConvNet-based and ViT-based HSI approaches.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is imperative for accurate brain tumor segmentation, offering indispensable complementary information. Nonetheless, the absence of modalities poses significant challenges in achieving precise segmentation. Recognizing the shared anatomical structures between mono-modal and multi-modal representations, it is noteworthy that mono-modal images typically exhibit limited features in specific regions and tissues. In response to this, we present Anatomical Consistency Distillation and Inconsistency Synthesis (ACDIS), a novel framework designed to transfer anatomical structures from multi-modal to mono-modal representations and synthesize modality-specific features. ACDIS consists of two main components: Anatomical Consistency Distillation (ACD) and Modality Feature Synthesis Block (MFSB). ACD incorporates the Anatomical Feature Enhancement Block (AFEB), meticulously mining anatomical information. Simultaneously, Anatomical Consistency ConsTraints (ACCT) are employed to facilitate the consistent knowledge transfer, i.e., the richness of information and the similarity in anatomical structure, ensuring precise alignment of structural features across mono-modality and multi-modality. Complementarily, MFSB produces modality-specific features to rectify anatomical inconsistencies, thereby compensating for missing information in the segmented features. Through validation on the BraTS2018 and BraTS2020 datasets, ACDIS substantiates its efficacy in the segmentation of brain tumors with missing MRI modalities.

- **Summary**: State Space Models (SSMs), especially Mamba, have shown great promise in medical image segmentation due to their ability to model long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity. However, accurate medical image segmentation requires the effective learning of both multi-scale detailed feature representations and global contextual dependencies. Although existing works have attempted to address this issue by integrating CNNs and SSMs to leverage their respective strengths, they have not designed specialized modules to effectively capture multi-scale feature representations, nor have they adequately addressed the directional sensitivity problem when applying Mamba to 2D image data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Multi-Scale Vision Mamba UNet model for medical image segmentation, termed MSVM-UNet. Specifically, by introducing multi-scale convolutions in the VSS blocks, we can more effectively capture and aggregate multi-scale feature representations from the hierarchical features of the VMamba encoder and better handle 2D visual data. Additionally, the large kernel patch expanding (LKPE) layers achieve more efficient upsampling of feature maps by simultaneously integrating spatial and channel information. Extensive experiments on the Synapse and ACDC datasets demonstrate that our approach is more effective than some state-of-the-art methods in capturing and aggregating multi-scale feature representations and modeling long-range dependencies between pixels.

- **Summary**: Handling varying computational resources is a critical issue in modern AI applications. Adaptive deep networks, featuring the dynamic employment of multiple classifier heads among different layers, have been proposed to address classification tasks under varying computing resources. Existing approaches typically utilize the last classifier supported by the available resources for inference, as they believe that the last classifier always performs better across all classes. However, our findings indicate that earlier classifier heads can outperform the last head for certain classes. Based on this observation, we introduce the Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) module, which fuses the multiple classifier heads to enhance the inference performance of adaptive deep networks. CDM incorporates an uncertainty-aware fusion method based on evidential deep learning (EDL), that utilizes the reliability (uncertainty values) from the first c-1 classifiers to improve the c-th classifier' accuracy. We also design a balance term that reduces fusion saturation and unfairness issues caused by EDL constraints to improve the fusion quality of CDM. Finally, a regularized training strategy that uses the last classifier to guide the learning process of early classifiers is proposed to further enhance the CDM module's effect, called the Guided Collaborative Decision Making (GCDM) framework. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approaches. Results on ImageNet datasets show CDM and GCDM obtain 0.4% to 2.8% accuracy improvement (under varying computing resources) on popular adaptive networks.

- **Summary**: Point cloud few-shot semantic segmentation (PC-FSS) aims to segment targets of novel categories in a given query point cloud with only a few annotated support samples. The current top-performing prototypical learning methods employ prototypes originating from support samples to direct the classification of query points. However, the inherent fragility of point-level matching and the prevalent intra-class diversity pose great challenges to this cross-instance matching paradigm, leading to erroneous background activations or incomplete target excavation. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework in the spirit of Decoupled Localization and Expansion (DLE). The proposed DLE, including a structural localization module (SLM) and a self-expansion module (SEM), enjoys several merits. First, structural information is injected into the matching process through the agent-level correlation in SLM, and the confident target region can thus be precisely located. Second, more reliable intra-object similarity is harnessed in SEM to derive the complete target, and the conservative expansion strategy is introduced to reasonably constrain the expansion. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks under different settings demonstrate that DLE outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches by large margins.

- **Summary**: Developmental dysgraphia is a neurological disorder that hinders children's writing skills. In recent years, researchers have increasingly explored machine learning methods to support the diagnosis of dysgraphia based on offline and online handwriting. In most previous studies, the two types of handwriting have been analysed separately, which does not necessarily lead to promising results. In this way, the relationship between online and offline data cannot be explored. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal machine learning approach utilizing both online and offline handwriting data. We created a new dataset by transforming an existing online handwritten dataset, generating corresponding offline handwriting images. We considered only different types of word data (simple word, pseudoword & difficult word) in our multimodal analysis. We trained SVM and XGBoost classifiers separately on online and offline features as well as implemented multimodal feature fusion and soft-voted ensemble. Furthermore, we proposed a novel ensemble with conditional feature fusion method which intelligently combines predictions from online and offline classifiers, selectively incorporating feature fusion when confidence scores fall below a threshold. Our novel approach achieves an accuracy of 88.8%, outperforming SVMs for single modalities by 12-14%, existing methods by 8-9%, and traditional multimodal approaches (soft-vote ensemble and feature fusion) by 3% and 5%, respectively. Our methodology contributes to the development of accurate and efficient dysgraphia diagnosis tools, requiring only a single instance of multimodal word/pseudoword data to determine the handwriting impairment. This work highlights the potential of multimodal learning in enhancing dysgraphia diagnosis, paving the way for accessible and practical diagnostic tools.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the challenges of designing mesh convolution neural networks for 3D mesh dense prediction. While deep learning has achieved remarkable success in image dense prediction tasks, directly applying or extending these methods to irregular graph data, such as 3D surface meshes, is nontrivial due to the non-uniform element distribution and irregular connectivity in surface meshes which make it difficult to adapt downsampling, upsampling, and convolution operations. In addition, commonly used multiresolution networks require repeated high-to-low and then low-to-high processes to boost the performance of recovering rich, high-resolution representations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a self-parameterization-based multi-resolution convolution network that extends existing image dense prediction architectures to 3D meshes. The novelty of our approach lies in two key aspects. First, we construct a multi-resolution mesh pyramid directly from the high-resolution input data and propose area-aware mesh downsampling/upsampling operations that use sequential bijective inter-surface mappings between different mesh resolutions. The inter-surface mapping redefines the mesh, rather than reshaping it, which thus avoids introducing unnecessary errors. Second, we maintain the high-resolution representation in the multi-resolution convolution network, enabling multi-scale fusions to exchange information across parallel multi-resolution subnetworks, rather than through connections of high-to-low resolution subnetworks in series. These features differentiate our approach from most existing mesh convolution networks and enable more accurate mesh dense predictions, which is confirmed in experiments.

- **Summary**: The present few-shot temporal action localization model can't handle the situation where videos contain multiple action instances. So the purpose of this paper is to achieve manifold action instances localization in a lengthy untrimmed query video using limited trimmed support videos. To address this challenging problem effectively, we proposed a novel solution involving a spatial-channel relation transformer with probability learning and cluster refinement. This method can accurately identify the start and end boundaries of actions in the query video, utilizing only a limited number of labeled videos. Our proposed method is adept at capturing both temporal and spatial contexts to effectively classify and precisely locate actions in videos, enabling a more comprehensive utilization of these crucial details. The selective cosine penalization algorithm is designed to suppress temporal boundaries that do not include action scene switches. The probability learning combined with the label generation algorithm alleviates the problem of action duration diversity and enhances the model's ability to handle fuzzy action boundaries. The interval cluster can help us get the final results with multiple instances situations in few-shot temporal action localization. Our model achieves competitive performance through meticulous experimentation utilizing the benchmark datasets ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14.

- **Summary**: 7,651 cases of Search and Rescue Missions (SAR) were reported by the United States Coast Guard in 2024, with over 1322 SAR helicopters deployed in the 6 first months alone. Through the utilizations of YOLO, we were able to run different weather conditions and lighting from our augmented dataset for training. YOLO then utilizes CNNs to apply a series of convolutions and pooling layers to the input image, where the convolution layers are able to extract the main features of the image. Through this, our YOLO model is able to learn to differentiate different objects which may considerably improve its accuracy, possibly enhancing the efficiency of SAR operations through enhanced detection accuracy. This paper aims to improve the model's accuracy of human detection in maritime SAR by evaluating a robust datasets containing various elevations and geological locations, as well as through data augmentation which simulates different weather and lighting. We observed that models trained on augmented datasets outperformed their non-augmented counterparts in which the human recall scores ranged from 0.891 to 0.911 with an improvement rate of 3.4\% on the YOLOv5l model. Results showed that these models demonstrate greater robustness to real-world conditions in varying of weather, brightness, tint, and contrast.

- **Summary**: Compared with previous 3D reconstruction methods like Nerf, recent Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting (G-3DGS) methods demonstrate impressive efficiency even in the sparse-view setting. However, the promising reconstruction performance of existing G-3DGS methods relies heavily on accurate multi-view feature matching, which is quite challenging. Especially for the scenes that have many non-overlapping areas between various views and contain numerous similar regions, the matching performance of existing methods is poor and the reconstruction precision is limited. To address this problem, we develop a strategy that utilizes a predicted depth confidence map to guide accurate local feature matching. In addition, we propose to utilize the knowledge of existing monocular depth estimation models as prior to boost the depth estimation precision in non-overlapping areas between views. Combining the proposed strategies, we present a novel G-3DGS method named TranSplat, which obtains the best performance on both the RealEstate10K and ACID benchmarks while maintaining competitive speed and presenting strong cross-dataset generalization ability. Our code, and demos will be available at: https://xingyoujun.github.io/transplat.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we leverage image complexity as a prior for refining segmentation features to achieve accurate real-time semantic segmentation. The design philosophy is based on the observation that different pixel regions within an image exhibit varying levels of complexity, with higher complexities posing a greater challenge for accurate segmentation. We thus introduce image complexity as prior guidance and propose the Image Complexity prior-guided Feature Refinement Network (ICFRNet). This network aggregates both complexity and segmentation features to produce an attention map for refining segmentation features within an Image Complexity Guided Attention (ICGA) module. We optimize the network in terms of both segmentation and image complexity prediction tasks with a combined loss function. Experimental results on the Cityscapes and CamViD datasets have shown that our ICFRNet achieves higher accuracy with a competitive efficiency for real-time segmentation.

- **Summary**: Text recognition in the wild is an important technique for digital maps and urban scene understanding, in which the natural resembling properties between glyphs is one of the major reasons that lead to wrong recognition results. To address this challenge, we introduce two extremely fine-grained visual recognition benchmark datasets that contain very challenging resembling glyphs (characters/letters) in the wild to be distinguished. Moreover, we propose a simple yet effective two-stage contrastive learning approach to the extremely fine-grained recognition task of resembling glyphs discrimination. In the first stage, we utilize supervised contrastive learning to leverage label information to warm-up the backbone network. In the second stage, we introduce CCFG-Net, a network architecture that integrates classification and contrastive learning in both Euclidean and Angular spaces, in which contrastive learning is applied in both supervised learning and pairwise discrimination manners to enhance the model's feature representation capability. Overall, our proposed approach effectively exploits the complementary strengths of contrastive learning and classification, leading to improved recognition performance on the resembling glyphs. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art fine-grained classification approaches under both Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer backbones demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: To address the zero-shot temporal action localization (ZSTAL) task, existing works develop models that are generalizable to detect and classify actions from unseen categories. They typically develop a category-agnostic action detector and combine it with the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to solve ZSTAL. However, these methods suffer from incomplete action proposals generated for \textit{unseen} categories, since they follow a frame-level prediction paradigm and require hand-crafted post-processing to generate action proposals. To address this problem, in this work, we propose a novel model named Generalizable Action Proposal generator (GAP), which can interface seamlessly with CLIP and generate action proposals in a holistic way. Our GAP is built in a query-based architecture and trained with a proposal-level objective, enabling it to estimate proposal completeness and eliminate the hand-crafted post-processing. Based on this architecture, we propose an Action-aware Discrimination loss to enhance the category-agnostic dynamic information of actions. Besides, we introduce a Static-Dynamic Rectifying module that incorporates the generalizable static information from CLIP to refine the predicted proposals, which improves proposal completeness in a generalizable manner. Our experiments show that our GAP achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging ZSTAL benchmarks, i.e., Thumos14 and ActivityNet1.3. Specifically, our model obtains significant performance improvement over previous works on the two benchmarks, i.e., +3.2% and +3.4% average mAP, respectively.

- **Summary**: Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM) is a computational imaging technique that enables high-resolution imaging over a large field of view. However, its application in the biomedical field has been limited due to the long image reconstruction time and poor noise robustness. In this paper, we propose a fast and robust FPM reconstruction method based on physical neural networks with batch update stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization strategy, capable of achieving attractive results with low single-to-noise ratio and correcting multiple system parameters simultaneously. Our method leverages a random batch optimization approach, breaks away from the fixed sequential iterative order and gives greater attention to high-frequency information. The proposed method has better convergence performance even for low signal-to-noise ratio data sets, such as low exposure time dark-field images. As a result, it can greatly increase the image recording and result reconstruction speed without any additional hardware modifications. By utilizing advanced deep learning optimizers and perform parallel computational scheme, our method enhances GPU computational efficiency, significantly reducing reconstruction costs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves near real-time digital refocusing of a 1024 x 1024 pixels region of interest on consumer-grade GPUs. This approach significantly improves temporal resolution (by reducing the exposure time of dark-field images), noise resistance, and reconstruction speed, and therefore can efficiently promote the practical application of FPM in clinical diagnostics, digital pathology, and biomedical research, etc. In addition, we believe our algorithm scheme can help researchers quickly validate and implement FPM-related ideas.

- **Summary**: Recent breakthroughs in deep learning and generative systems have significantly fostered the creation of synthetic media, as well as the local alteration of real content via the insertion of highly realistic synthetic manipulations. Local image manipulation, in particular, poses serious challenges to the integrity of digital content and societal trust. This problem is not only confined to multimedia data, but also extends to biological images included in scientific publications, like images depicting Western blots. In this work, we address the task of localizing synthetic manipulations in Western blot images. To discriminate between pristine and synthetic pixels of an analyzed image, we propose a synthetic detector that operates on small patches extracted from the image. We aggregate patch contributions to estimate a tampering heatmap, highlighting synthetic pixels out of pristine ones. Our methodology proves effective when tested over two manipulated Western blot image datasets, one altered automatically and the other manually by exploiting advanced AI-based image manipulation tools that are unknown at our training stage. We also explore the robustness of our method over an external dataset of other scientific images depicting different semantics, manipulated through unseen generation techniques.

- **Summary**: Data augmentation plays a crucial role in deep learning, enhancing the generalization and robustness of learning-based models. Standard approaches involve simple transformations like rotations and flips for generating extra data. However, these augmentations are limited by their initial dataset, lacking high-level diversity. Recently, large models such as language models and diffusion models have shown exceptional capabilities in perception and content generation. In this work, we propose a new paradigm to automatically generate 3D labeled training data by harnessing the power of pretrained large foundation models. For each target semantic class, we first generate 2D images of a single object in various structure and appearance via diffusion models and chatGPT generated text prompts. Beyond texture augmentation, we propose a method to automatically alter the shape of objects within 2D images. Subsequently, we transform these augmented images into 3D objects and construct virtual scenes by random composition. This method can automatically produce a substantial amount of 3D scene data without the need of real data, providing significant benefits in addressing few-shot learning challenges and mitigating long-tailed class imbalances. By providing a flexible augmentation approach, our work contributes to enhancing 3D data diversity and advancing model capabilities in scene understanding tasks.

- **Summary**: In autonomous driving, accurately distinguishing between static and moving objects is crucial for the autonomous driving system. When performing the motion object segmentation (MOS) task, effectively leveraging motion information from objects becomes a primary challenge in improving the recognition of moving objects. Previous methods either utilized range view (RV) or bird's eye view (BEV) residual maps to capture motion information. Unlike traditional approaches, we propose combining RV and BEV residual maps to exploit a greater potential of motion information jointly. Thus, we introduce CV-MOS, a cross-view model for moving object segmentation. Novelty, we decouple spatial-temporal information by capturing the motion from BEV and RV residual maps and generating semantic features from range images, which are used as moving object guidance for the motion branch. Our direct and unique solution maximizes the use of range images and RV and BEV residual maps, significantly enhancing the performance of LiDAR-based MOS task. Our method achieved leading IoU(\%) scores of 77.5\% and 79.2\% on the validation and test sets of the SemanticKitti dataset. In particular, CV-MOS demonstrates SOTA performance to date on various datasets. The CV-MOS implementation is available at https://github.com/SCNU-RISLAB/CV-MOS

- **Summary**: Pillar-based 3D object detection has gained traction in self-driving technology due to its speed and accuracy facilitated by the artificial densification of pillars for GPU-friendly processing. However, dense pillar processing fundamentally wastes computation since it ignores the inherent sparsity of pillars derived from scattered point cloud data. Motivated by recent embedded accelerators with native sparsity support, sparse pillar convolution methods like submanifold convolution (SubM-Conv) aimed to reduce these redundant computations by applying convolution only on active pillars but suffered considerable accuracy loss. Our research identifies that this accuracy loss is due to the restricted fine-grained spatial information flow (fSIF) of SubM-Conv in sparse pillar networks. To overcome this restriction, we propose a selectively dilated (SD-Conv) convolution that evaluates the importance of encoded pillars and selectively dilates the convolution output, enhancing the receptive field for critical pillars and improving object detection accuracy. To facilitate actual acceleration with this novel convolution approach, we designed SPADE+ as a cost-efficient augmentation to existing embedded sparse convolution accelerators. This design supports the SD-Conv without significant demands in area and SRAM size, realizing superior trade-off between the speedup and model accuracy. This strategic enhancement allows our method to achieve extreme pillar sparsity, leading to up to 18.1x computational savings and 16.2x speedup on the embedded accelerators, without compromising object detection accuracy.

- **Summary**: Previous research has established that breast cancer is a prevalent cancer type, with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) being the most common subtype. The incidence of this dangerous cancer continues to rise, making accurate and rapid diagnosis, particularly in the early stages, critically important. While modern Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems can address most cases, medical professionals still face challenges in using them in the field without powerful computing resources. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN model called BCDNet, which effectively detects IDC in histopathological images with an accuracy of up to 89.5% and reduces training time effectively.

- **Summary**: LiDAR sensors are crucial for providing high-resolution 3D point cloud data in autonomous driving systems, enabling precise environmental perception. However, real-world adverse weather conditions, such as rain, fog, and snow, introduce significant noise and interference, degrading the reliability of LiDAR data and the performance of downstream tasks like semantic segmentation. Existing datasets often suffer from limited weather diversity and small dataset sizes, which restrict their effectiveness in training models. Additionally, current deep learning denoising methods, while effective in certain scenarios, often lack interpretability, complicating the ability to understand and validate their decision-making processes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce two large-scale datasets, Weather-KITTI and Weather-NuScenes, which cover three common adverse weather conditions: rain, fog, and snow. These datasets retain the original LiDAR acquisition information and provide point-level semantic labels for rain, fog, and snow. Furthermore, we propose a novel point cloud denoising model, TripleMixer, comprising three mixer layers: the Geometry Mixer Layer, the Frequency Mixer Layer, and the Channel Mixer Layer. These layers are designed to capture geometric spatial information, extract multi-scale frequency information, and enhance the multi-channel feature information of point clouds, respectively. Experiments conducted on the WADS dataset in real-world scenarios, as well as on our proposed Weather-KITTI and Weather-NuScenes datasets, demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance. Additionally, our experiments show that integrating the denoising model into existing segmentation frameworks enhances the performance of downstream tasks.The datasets and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Grandzxw/TripleMixer.

- **Summary**: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a novel approach to function approximation, demonstrating remarkable potential in various domains. Despite their theoretical promise, the robustness of KANs under adversarial conditions has yet to be thoroughly examined. In this paper, we explore the adversarial robustness of KANs, with a particular focus on image classification tasks. We assess the performance of KANs against standard white-box adversarial attacks, comparing their resilience to that of established neural network architectures. Further, we investigate the transferability of adversarial examples between KANs and Multilayer Perceptron (MLPs), deriving critical insights into the unique vulnerabilities of KANs. Our experiments use the MNIST, FashionMNIST, and KMNIST datasets, providing a comprehensive evaluation of KANs in adversarial scenarios. This work offers the first in-depth analysis of security in KANs, laying the groundwork for future research in this emerging field.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a study on few-shot classification in the context of histopathology images. While few-shot learning has been studied for natural image classification, its application to histopathology is relatively unexplored. Given the scarcity of labeled data in medical imaging and the inherent challenges posed by diverse tissue types and data preparation techniques, this research evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods for various scenarios on histology data. We have considered four histopathology datasets for few-shot histopathology image classification and have evaluated 5-way 1-shot, 5-way 5-shot and 5-way 10-shot scenarios with a set of state-of-the-art classification techniques. The best methods have surpassed an accuracy of 70%, 80% and 85% in the cases of 5-way 1-shot, 5-way 5-shot and 5-way 10-shot cases, respectively. We found that for histology images popular meta-learning approaches is at par with standard fine-tuning and regularization methods. Our experiments underscore the challenges of working with images from different domains and underscore the significance of unbiased and focused evaluations in advancing computer vision techniques for specialized domains, such as histology images.

- **Summary**: The current standard for detecting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status in breast cancer patients relies on HER2 amplification, identified through fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or immunohistochemistry (IHC). However, hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) tumor stains are more widely available, and accurately predicting HER2 status using H\&E could reduce costs and expedite treatment selection. Deep Learning algorithms for H&E have shown effectiveness in predicting various cancer features and clinical outcomes, including moderate success in HER2 status prediction. In this work, we employed a customized weak supervision classification technique combined with MoCo-v2 contrastive learning to predict HER2 status. We trained our pipeline on 182 publicly available H&E Whole Slide Images (WSIs) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), for which annotations by the pathology team at Yale School of Medicine are publicly available. Our pipeline achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.85 across four different test folds. Additionally, we tested our model on 44 H&E slides from the TCGA-BRCA dataset, which had an HER2 score of 2+ and included corresponding HER2 status and FISH test results. These cases are considered equivocal for IHC, requiring an expensive FISH test on their IHC slides for disambiguation. Our pipeline demonstrated an AUC of 0.81 on these challenging H&E slides.

- **Summary**: Schizophrenia is a serious psychiatric disorder. Its pathogenesis is not completely clear, making it difficult to treat patients precisely. Because of the complicated non-Euclidean network structure of the human brain, learning critical information from brain networks remains difficult. To effectively capture the topological information of brain neural networks, a novel multimodal graph attention network based on sparse interaction mechanism (Multi-SIGATnet) was proposed for SZ classification was proposed for SZ classification. Firstly, structural and functional information were fused into multimodal data to obtain more comprehensive and abundant features for patients with SZ. Subsequently, a sparse interaction mechanism was proposed to effectively extract salient features and enhance the feature representation capability. By enhancing the strong connections and weakening the weak connections between feature information based on an asymmetric convolutional network, high-order interactive features were captured. Moreover, sparse learning strategies were designed to filter out redundant connections to improve model performance. Finally, local and global features were updated in accordance with the topological features and connection weight constraints of the higher-order brain network, the features being projected to the classification target space for disorder classification. The effectiveness of the model is verified on the Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) and University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) datasets, achieving 81.9\% and 75.8\% average accuracy, respectively, 4.6\% and 5.5\% higher than the graph attention network (GAT) method. Experiments showed that the Multi-SIGATnet method exhibited good performance in identifying SZ.

- **Summary**: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) offers significant advantages in reducing the potential harm to human bodies. However, reducing the X-ray dose in CT scanning often leads to severe noise and artifacts in the reconstructed images, which might adversely affect diagnosis. By utilizing the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, statistical priors could be combined with artificial priors to improve LDCT reconstruction quality. However, conventional EM-based regularization methods adopt an alternating solving strategy, i.e. full reconstruction followed by image-regularization, resulting in over-smoothing and slow convergence. In this paper, we propose to integrate TV regularization into the ``M''-step of the EM algorithm, thus achieving effective and efficient regularization. Besides, by employing the Chambolle-Pock (CP) algorithm and the ordered subset (OS) strategy, we propose the OSEM-CP algorithm for LDCT reconstruction, in which both reconstruction and regularization are conducted view-by-view. Furthermore, by unrolling OSEM-CP, we propose an end-to-end reconstruction neural network (NN), named OSEM-CPNN, with remarkable performance and efficiency that achieves high-quality reconstructions in just one full-view iteration. Experiments on different models and datasets demonstrate our methods' outstanding performance compared to traditional and state-of-the-art deep-learning methods.

- **Summary**: Volumetric segmentation is crucial for medical imaging but is often constrained by labor-intensive manual annotations and the need for scenario-specific model training. Furthermore, existing general segmentation models are inefficient due to their design and inferential approaches. Addressing this clinical demand, we introduce PropSAM, a propagation-based segmentation model that optimizes the use of 3D medical structure information. PropSAM integrates a CNN-based UNet for intra-slice processing with a Transformer-based module for inter-slice propagation, focusing on structural and semantic continuities to enhance segmentation across various modalities. Distinctively, PropSAM operates on a one-view prompt, such as a 2D bounding box or sketch mask, unlike conventional models that require two-view prompts. It has demonstrated superior performance, significantly improving the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) across 44 medical datasets and various imaging modalities, outperforming models like MedSAM and SegVol with an average DSC improvement of 18.1%. PropSAM also maintains stable predictions despite prompt deviations and varying propagation configurations, confirmed by one-way ANOVA tests with P>0.5985 and P>0.6131, respectively. Moreover, PropSAM's efficient architecture enables faster inference speeds (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P<0.001) and reduces user interaction time by 37.8% compared to two-view prompt models. Its ability to handle irregular and complex objects with robust performance further demonstrates its potential in clinical settings, facilitating more automated and reliable medical imaging analyses with minimal retraining.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation of night-time images holds significant importance in computer vision, particularly for applications like night environment perception in autonomous driving systems. However, existing methods tend to parse night-time images from a day-time perspective, leaving the inherent challenges in low-light conditions (such as compromised texture and deceiving matching errors) unexplored. To address these issues, we propose a novel end-to-end optimized approach, named NightFormer, tailored for night-time semantic segmentation, avoiding the conventional practice of forcibly fitting night-time images into day-time distributions. Specifically, we design a pixel-level texture enhancement module to acquire texture-aware features hierarchically with phase enhancement and amplified attention, and an object-level reliable matching module to realize accurate association matching via reliable attention in low-light environments. Extensive experimental results on various challenging benchmarks including NightCity, BDD and Cityscapes demonstrate that our proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art night-time semantic segmentation methods.

- **Summary**: Due to the high complexity and technical requirements of industrial production processes, surface defects will inevitably appear, which seriously affects the quality of products. Although existing lightweight detection networks are highly efficient, they are susceptible to false or missed detection of non-salient defects due to the lack of semantic information. In contrast, the diffusion model can generate higher-order semantic representations in the denoising process. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to incorporate the higher-order modelling capability of the diffusion model into the detection model, so as to better assist in the classification and localization of difficult targets. First, the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is pre-trained to extract the features of denoising process to construct as a feature repository. In particular, to avoid the potential bottleneck of memory caused by the dataloader loading high-dimensional features, a residual convolutional variational auto-encoder (ResVAE) is designed to further compress the feature repository. The image is fed into both image backbone and feature repository for feature extraction and querying respectively. The queried latent features are reconstructed and filtered to obtain high-dimensional DDPM features. A dynamic cross-fusion method is proposed to fully refine the contextual features of DDPM to optimize the detection model. Finally, we employ knowledge distillation to migrate the higher-order modelling capabilities back into the lightweight baseline model without additional efficiency cost. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results on several industrial datasets.

- **Summary**: In video lane detection, there are rich temporal contexts among successive frames, which is under-explored in existing lane detectors. In this work, we propose LaneTCA to bridge the individual video frames and explore how to effectively aggregate the temporal context. Technically, we develop an accumulative attention module and an adjacent attention module to abstract the long-term and short-term temporal context, respectively. The accumulative attention module continuously accumulates visual information during the journey of a vehicle, while the adjacent attention module propagates this lane information from the previous frame to the current frame. The two modules are meticulously designed based on the transformer architecture. Finally, these long-short context features are fused with the current frame features to predict the lane lines in the current frame. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted on two prevalent benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving several new state-of-the-art records. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/Alex-1337/LaneTCA

- **Summary**: Significant advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have enabled them to tackle complex problems involving visual-mathematical reasoning. However, their ability to identify geometric elements remains understudied. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tangram, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of LMMs on geometric element recognition. Tangram includes 1,080 diverse geometric diagrams sourced from primary and secondary school exams, competitions, and textbooks, covering from simple basic geometric shapes to complex combinations. Each diagram is associated with four questions, resulting in a total of 4,320 visual-question-answer pairs. Unlike existing benchmarks that seek higher-level cognition and reasoning, Tangram focuses on the understanding of geometric elements, requiring models to perform a "simple but interesting" counting task. Systematic evaluation of 10 prominent LMMs, such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, shows that even in the seemingly simple task, these models still face significant challenges. Notably, the overall accuracy of the top performer across all tested models is only 56.8%, marking a significant gap when compared to human performance. These findings highlight the limitations of current multimodal artificial intelligence systems in handling basic perception tasks, and will inspire the development of the next generation of expert-level multimodal foundational models. The Tangram and evaluation code will be available soon.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in image quality. However, complex scene generation remains relatively unexplored, and even the definition of `complex scene' itself remains unclear. In this paper, we address this gap by providing a precise definition of complex scenes and introducing a set of Complex Decomposition Criteria (CDC) based on this definition. Inspired by the artists painting process, we propose a training-free diffusion framework called Complex Diffusion (CxD), which divides the process into three stages: composition, painting, and retouching. Our method leverages the powerful chain-of-thought capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to decompose complex prompts based on CDC and to manage composition and layout. We then develop an attention modulation method that guides simple prompts to specific regions to complete the complex scene painting. Finally, we inject the detailed output of the LLM into a retouching model to enhance the image details, thus implementing the retouching stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous SOTA approaches, significantly improving the generation of high-quality, semantically consistent, and visually diverse images for complex scenes, even with intricate prompts.

- **Summary**: Existing datasets for tabular question answering typically focus exclusively on text within cells. However, real-world data is inherently multimodal, often blending images such as symbols, faces, icons, patterns, and charts with textual content in tables. With the evolution of AI models capable of multimodal reasoning, it is pertinent to assess their efficacy in handling such structured data. This study investigates whether current AI models can perform knowledge-aware reasoning on multimodal structured data. We explore their ability to reason on tables that integrate both images and text, introducing MMTabQA, a new dataset designed for this purpose. Our experiments highlight substantial challenges for current AI models in effectively integrating and interpreting multiple text and image inputs, understanding visual context, and comparing visual content across images. These findings establish our dataset as a robust benchmark for advancing AI's comprehension and capabilities in analyzing multimodal structured data.

- **Summary**: Current strategies for solving image-based inverse problems apply latent diffusion models to perform posterior sampling.However, almost all approaches make no explicit attempt to explore the solution space, instead drawing only a single sample from a Gaussian distribution from which to generate their solution. In this paper, we introduce a particle-filtering-based framework for a nonlinear exploration of the solution space in the initial stages of reverse SDE methods. Our proposed particle-filtering-based latent diffusion (PFLD) method and proposed problem formulation and framework can be applied to any diffusion-based solution for linear or nonlinear inverse problems. Our experimental results show that PFLD outperforms the SoTA solver PSLD on the FFHQ-1K and ImageNet-1K datasets on inverse problem tasks of super resolution, Gaussian debluring and inpainting.

- **Summary**: Visual tracking has seen remarkable advancements, largely driven by the availability of large-scale training datasets that have enabled the development of highly accurate and robust algorithms. While significant progress has been made in tracking general objects, research on more challenging scenarios, such as tracking camouflaged objects, remains limited. Camouflaged objects, which blend seamlessly with their surroundings or other objects, present unique challenges for detection and tracking in complex environments. This challenge is particularly critical in applications such as military, security, agriculture, and marine monitoring, where precise tracking of camouflaged objects is essential. To address this gap, we introduce the Camouflaged Object Tracking Dataset (COTD), a specialized benchmark designed specifically for evaluating camouflaged object tracking methods. The COTD dataset comprises 200 sequences and approximately 80,000 frames, each annotated with detailed bounding boxes. Our evaluation of 20 existing tracking algorithms reveals significant deficiencies in their performance with camouflaged objects. To address these issues, we propose a novel tracking framework, HiPTrack-MLS, which demonstrates promising results in improving tracking performance for camouflaged objects. COTD and code are avialable at https://github.com/openat25/HIPTrack-MLS.

- **Summary**: Data-driven approaches for autonomous driving (AD) have been widely adopted in the past decade but are confronted with dataset bias and uninterpretability. Inspired by the knowledge-driven nature of human driving, recent approaches explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) to improve understanding and decision-making in traffic scenarios. They find that the pretrain-finetune paradigm of LLMs on downstream data with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning process can enhance explainability and scene understanding. However, such a popular strategy proves to suffer from the notorious problems of misalignment between the crafted CoTs against the consequent decision-making, which remains untouched by previous LLM-based AD methods. To address this problem, we motivate an end-to-end decision-making model based on multimodality-augmented LLM, which simultaneously executes CoT reasoning and carries out planning results. Furthermore, we propose a reasoning-decision alignment constraint between the paired CoTs and planning results, imposing the correspondence between reasoning and decision-making. Moreover, we redesign the CoTs to enable the model to comprehend complex scenarios and enhance decision-making performance. We dub our proposed large language planners with reasoning-decision alignment as RDA-Driver. Experimental evaluations on the nuScenes and DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our RDA-Driver in enhancing the performance of end-to-end AD systems. Specifically, our RDA-Driver achieves state-of-the-art planning performance on the nuScenes dataset with 0.80 L2 error and 0.32 collision rate, and also achieves leading results on challenging DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks with 0.82 L2 error and 0.38 collision rate.

- **Summary**: Recently, Text-to-Image(T2I) models have achieved remarkable success in image generation and editing, yet these models still have many potential issues, particularly in generating inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work(NSFW) content. Strengthening attacks and uncovering such vulnerabilities can advance the development of reliable and practical T2I models. Most of the previous works treat T2I models as white-box systems, using gradient optimization to generate adversarial prompts. However, accessing the model's gradient is often impossible in real-world scenarios. Moreover, existing defense methods, those using gradient masking, are designed to prevent attackers from obtaining accurate gradient information. While some black-box jailbreak attacks have been explored, these typically rely on simply replacing sensitive words, leading to suboptimal attack performance. To address this issue, we introduce a two-stage query-based black-box attack method utilizing random search. In the first stage, we establish a preliminary prompt by maximizing the semantic similarity between the adversarial and target harmful prompts. In the second stage, we use this initial prompt to refine our approach, creating a detailed adversarial prompt aimed at jailbreaking and maximizing the similarity in image features between the images generated from this prompt and those produced by the target harmful prompt. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in attacking the latest prompt checkers, post-hoc image checkers, securely trained T2I models, and online commercial models.

- **Summary**: Currently, large vision-language models have gained promising progress on many downstream tasks. However, they still suffer many challenges in fine-grained visual understanding tasks, such as object attribute comprehension. Besides, there have been growing efforts on the evaluations of large vision-language models, but lack of in-depth study of attribute comprehension and the visual language fine-tuning process. In this paper, we propose to evaluate the attribute comprehension ability of large vision-language models from two perspectives: attribute recognition and attribute hierarchy understanding. We evaluate three vision-language interactions, including visual question answering, image-text matching, and image-text cosine similarity. Furthermore, we explore the factors affecting attribute comprehension during fine-tuning. Through a series of quantitative and qualitative experiments, we introduce three main findings: (1) Large vision-language models possess good attribute recognition ability, but their hierarchical understanding ability is relatively limited. (2) Compared to ITC, ITM exhibits superior capability in capturing finer details, making it more suitable for attribute understanding tasks. (3) The attribute information in the captions used for fine-tuning plays a crucial role in attribute understanding. We hope this work can help guide future progress in fine-grained visual understanding of large vision-language models.

- **Summary**: 3D point clouds are essential for perceiving outdoor scenes, especially within the realm of autonomous driving. Recent advances in 3D LiDAR Object Detection focus primarily on the spatial positioning and distribution of points to ensure accurate detection. However, despite their robust performance in variable conditions, these methods are hindered by their sole reliance on coordinates and point intensity, resulting in inadequate isometric invariance and suboptimal detection outcomes. To tackle this challenge, our work introduces Transformation-Invariant Local (TraIL) features and the associated TraIL-Det architecture. Our TraIL features exhibit rigid transformation invariance and effectively adapt to variations in point density, with a design focus on capturing the localized geometry of neighboring structures. They utilize the inherent isotropic radiation of LiDAR to enhance local representation, improve computational efficiency, and boost detection performance. To effectively process the geometric relations among points within each proposal, we propose a Multi-head self-Attention Encoder (MAE) with asymmetric geometric features to encode high-dimensional TraIL features into manageable representations. Our method outperforms contemporary self-supervised 3D object detection approaches in terms of mAP on KITTI (67.8, 20% label, moderate) and Waymo (68.9, 20% label, moderate) datasets under various label ratios (20%, 50%, and 100%).

- **Summary**: Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) where generated responses fail to accurately reflect the given image pose a significant challenge to their reliability. To address this, we introduce ConVis, a novel training-free contrastive decoding method. ConVis leverages a text-to-image (T2I) generation model to semantically reconstruct the given image from hallucinated captions. By comparing the contrasting probability distributions produced by the original and reconstructed images, ConVis enables MLLMs to capture visual contrastive signals that penalize hallucination generation. Notably, this method operates purely within the decoding process, eliminating the need for additional data or model updates. Our extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks demonstrate that ConVis effectively reduces hallucinations across various MLLMs, highlighting its potential to enhance model reliability.

- **Summary**: This research explores the development of multimodal vision-language models for image retrieval in low-resource languages, specifically Azerbaijani. Existing vision-language models primarily support high-resource languages, and fine-tuning them remains computationally demanding. To address challenges in vision-language retrieval for low-resource languages, we integrated the CLIP model architecture and employed several techniques to balance computational efficiency with performance. These techniques include synthetic data generation through machine translation, image augmentation, and further training the attention mechanisms of transformer-based models with domain-specific data. We integrated Multilingual BERT as a text encoder with image encoders like ResNet50, EfficientNet0, Vision Transformer (ViT), and Tiny Swin Transformer. Our study found that models like EfficientNet0 and Tiny Swin Transformer perform best on the datasets they were trained on, such as COCO, Flickr30k, and Flickr8k. Augmentation techniques boosted EfficientNet0 MAP on Flickr30k from 0.84 to 0.87 and ResNet50 MAP on MSCOCO from 0.70 to 0.80, contributing to a new state of the art in vision-language retrieval. We share our configurations and results to support further research. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/aliasgerovs/azclip.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce Splatt3R, a pose-free, feed-forward method for in-the-wild 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis from stereo pairs. Given uncalibrated natural images, Splatt3R can predict 3D Gaussian Splats without requiring any camera parameters or depth information. For generalizability, we start from a 'foundation' 3D geometry reconstruction method, MASt3R, and extend it to be a full 3D structure and appearance reconstructor. Specifically, unlike the original MASt3R which reconstructs only 3D point clouds, we predict the additional Gaussian attributes required to construct a Gaussian primitive for each point. Hence, unlike other novel view synthesis methods, Splatt3R is first trained by optimizing the 3D point cloud's geometry loss, and then a novel view synthesis objective. By doing this, we avoid the local minima present in training 3D Gaussian Splats from stereo views. We also propose a novel loss masking strategy that we empirically find is critical for strong performance on extrapolated viewpoints. We train Splatt3R on the ScanNet++ dataset and demonstrate excellent generalisation to uncalibrated, in-the-wild images. Splatt3R can reconstruct scenes at 4FPS at 512 x 512 resolution, and the resultant splats can be rendered in real-time.

- **Summary**: Existing portrait relighting methods struggle with precise control over facial shadows, particularly when faced with challenges such as handling hard shadows from directional light sources or adjusting shadows while remaining in harmony with existing lighting conditions. In many situations, completely altering input lighting is undesirable for portrait retouching applications: one may want to preserve some authenticity in the captured environment. Existing shadow editing methods typically restrict their application to just the facial region and often offer limited lighting control options, such as shadow softening or rotation. In this paper, we introduce COMPOSE: a novel shadow editing pipeline for human portraits, offering precise control over shadow attributes such as shape, intensity, and position, all while preserving the original environmental illumination of the portrait. This level of disentanglement and controllability is obtained thanks to a novel decomposition of the environment map representation into ambient light and an editable gaussian dominant light source. COMPOSE is a four-stage pipeline that consists of light estimation and editing, light diffusion, shadow synthesis, and finally shadow editing. We define facial shadows as the result of a dominant light source, encoded using our novel gaussian environment map representation. Utilizing an OLAT dataset, we have trained models to: (1) predict this light source representation from images, and (2) generate realistic shadows using this representation. We also demonstrate comprehensive and intuitive shadow editing with our pipeline. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we have demonstrated the robust capability of our system in shadow editing.

- **Summary**: Quantization is one of the most popular techniques for reducing computation time and shrinking model size. However, ensuring the accuracy of quantized models typically involves calibration using training data, which may be inaccessible due to privacy concerns. In such cases, zero-shot quantization, a technique that relies on pretrained models and statistical information without the need for specific training data, becomes valuable. Exploring zero-shot quantization in the infrared domain is important due to the prevalence of infrared imaging in sensitive fields like medical and security applications. In this work, we demonstrate how to apply zero-shot quantization to an object detection model retrained with thermal imagery. We use batch normalization statistics of the model to distill data for calibration. RGB image-trained models and thermal image-trained models are compared in the context of zero-shot quantization. Our investigation focuses on the contributions of mean and standard deviation statistics to zero-shot quantization performance. Additionally, we compare zero-shot quantization with post-training quantization on a thermal dataset. We demonstrated that zero-shot quantization successfully generates data that represents the training dataset for the quantization of object detection models. Our results indicate that our zero-shot quantization framework is effective in the absence of training data and is well-suited for the infrared domain.

- **Summary**: The difficulty of monitoring biodiversity at fine scales and over large areas limits ecological knowledge and conservation efforts. To fill this gap, Species Distribution Models (SDMs) predict species across space from spatially explicit features. Yet, they face the challenge of integrating the rich but heterogeneous data made available over the past decade, notably millions of opportunistic species observations and standardized surveys, as well as multi-modal remote sensing data. In light of that, we have designed and developed a new European-scale dataset for SDMs at high spatial resolution (10-50 m), including more than 10k species (i.e., most of the European flora). The dataset comprises 5M heterogeneous Presence-Only records and 90k exhaustive Presence-Absence survey records, all accompanied by diverse environmental rasters (e.g., elevation, human footprint, and soil) that are traditionally used in SDMs. In addition, it provides Sentinel-2 RGB and NIR satellite images with 10 m resolution, a 20-year time-series of climatic variables, and satellite time-series from the Landsat program. In addition to the data, we provide an openly accessible SDM benchmark (hosted on Kaggle), which has already attracted an active community and a set of strong baselines for single predictor/modality and multimodal approaches. All resources, e.g., the dataset, pre-trained models, and baseline methods (in the form of notebooks), are available on Kaggle, allowing one to start with our dataset literally with two mouse clicks.

- **Summary**: Open vocabulary 3D object detection (OV3D) allows precise and extensible object recognition crucial for adapting to diverse environments encountered in assistive robotics. This paper presents OpenNav, a zero-shot 3D object detection pipeline based on RGB-D images for smart wheelchairs. Our pipeline integrates an open-vocabulary 2D object detector with a mask generator for semantic segmentation, followed by depth isolation and point cloud construction to create 3D bounding boxes. The smart wheelchair exploits these 3D bounding boxes to identify potential targets and navigate safely. We demonstrate OpenNav's performance through experiments on the Replica dataset and we report preliminary results with a real wheelchair. OpenNav improves state-of-the-art significantly on the Replica dataset at mAP25 (+9pts) and mAP50 (+5pts) with marginal improvement at mAP.

### Personalized Topology-Informed 12-Lead ECG Electrode Localization from Incomplete Cardiac MRIs for Efficient Cardiac Digital Twins

- **Summary**: Cardiac digital twins (CDTs) offer personalized \textit{in-silico} cardiac representations for the inference of multi-scale properties tied to cardiac mechanisms. The creation of CDTs requires precise information about the electrode position on the torso, especially for the personalized electrocardiogram (ECG) calibration. However, current studies commonly rely on additional acquisition of torso imaging and manual/semi-automatic methods for ECG electrode localization. In this study, we propose a novel and efficient topology-informed model to fully automatically extract personalized ECG electrode locations from 2D clinically standard cardiac MRIs. Specifically, we obtain the sparse torso contours from the cardiac MRIs and then localize the electrodes from the contours. Cardiac MRIs aim at imaging of the heart instead of the torso, leading to incomplete torso geometry within the imaging. To tackle the missing topology, we incorporate the electrodes as a subset of the keypoints, which can be explicitly aligned with the 3D torso topology. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the time-consuming conventional method in terms of accuracy (Euclidean distance: $1.24 \pm 0.293$ cm vs. $1.48 \pm 0.362$ cm) and efficiency ($2$~s vs. $30$-$35$~min). We further demonstrate the effectiveness of using the detected electrodes for \textit{in-silico} ECG simulation, highlighting their potential for creating accurate and efficient CDT models. The code will be released publicly after the manuscript is accepted for publication.

- **Summary**: Tracking human object interaction from videos is important to understand human behavior from the rapidly growing stream of video data. Previous video-based methods require predefined object templates while single-image-based methods are template-free but lack temporal consistency. In this paper, we present a method to track human object interaction without any object shape templates. We decompose the 4D tracking problem into per-frame pose tracking and canonical shape optimization. We first apply a single-view reconstruction method to obtain temporally-inconsistent per-frame interaction reconstructions. Then, for the human, we propose an efficient autoencoder to predict SMPL vertices directly from the per-frame reconstructions, introducing temporally consistent correspondence. For the object, we introduce a pose estimator that leverages temporal information to predict smooth object rotations under occlusions. To train our model, we propose a method to generate synthetic interaction videos and synthesize in total 10 hour videos of 8.5k sequences with full 3D ground truth. Experiments on BEHAVE and InterCap show that our method significantly outperforms previous template-based video tracking and single-frame reconstruction methods. Our proposed synthetic video dataset also allows training video-based methods that generalize to real-world videos. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.



### Shifted Window Fourier Transform And Retention For Image Captioning

- **Summary**: Image Captioning is an important Language and Vision task that finds application in a variety of contexts, ranging from healthcare to autonomous vehicles. As many real-world applications rely on devices with limited resources, much effort in the field was put into the development of lighter and faster models. However, much of the current optimizations focus on the Transformer architecture in contrast to the existence of more efficient methods. In this work, we introduce SwiFTeR, an architecture almost entirely based on Fourier Transform and Retention, to tackle the main efficiency bottlenecks of current light image captioning models, being the visual backbone's onerosity, and the decoder's quadratic cost. SwiFTeR is made of only 20M parameters, and requires 3.1 GFLOPs for a single forward pass. Additionally, it showcases superior scalability to the caption length and its small memory requirements enable more images to be processed in parallel, compared to the traditional transformer-based architectures. For instance, it can generate 400 captions in one second. Although, for the time being, the caption quality is lower (110.2 CIDEr-D), most of the decrease is not attributed to the architecture but rather an incomplete training practice which currently leaves much room for improvements. Overall, SwiFTeR points toward a promising direction to new efficient architectural design. The implementation code will be released in the future.
