- **Summary**: Numerous image processing techniques (IPTs) have been employed to detect crack defects, offering an alternative to human-conducted onsite inspections. These IPTs manipulate images to extract defect features, particularly cracks in surfaces produced through Additive Manufacturing (AM). This article presents a vision-based approach that utilizes deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for crack detection in AM surfaces. Traditional image processing techniques face challenges with diverse real-world scenarios and varying crack types. To overcome these challenges, our proposed method leverages CNNs, eliminating the need for extensive feature extraction. Annotation for CNN training is facilitated by LabelImg without the requirement for additional IPTs. The trained CNN, enhanced by OpenCV preprocessing techniques, achieves an outstanding 99.54% accuracy on a dataset of 14,982 annotated images with resolutions of 1536 x 1103 pixels. Evaluation metrics exceeding 96% precision, 98% recall, and a 97% F1-score highlight the precision and effectiveness of the entire process.

- **Summary**: With the increasing growth of industrialization, more and more industries are relying on machine automation for production. However, defect detection in large-scale production machinery is becoming increasingly important. Due to their large size and height, it is often challenging for professionals to conduct defect inspections on such large machinery. For example, the inspection of aging and misalignment of components on tall machinery like towers requires companies to assign dedicated personnel. Employees need to climb the towers and either visually inspect or take photos to detect safety hazards in these large machines. Direct visual inspection is limited by its low level of automation, lack of precision, and safety concerns associated with personnel climbing the towers. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a system based on neural network modeling (NeRF) of 3D twin models. By comparing two digital models, this system enables defect detection at the 3D interface of an object.

- **Summary**: The use of multiple modalities (e.g., face and fingerprint) or multiple algorithms (e.g., three face comparators) has shown to improve the recognition accuracy of an operational biometric system. Over time a biometric system may evolve to add new modalities, retire old modalities, or be merged with other biometric systems. This can lead to scenarios where there are missing scores corresponding to the input probe set. Previous work on this topic has focused on either the verification or identification tasks, but not both. Further, the proportion of missing data considered has been less than 50%. In this work, we study the impact of missing score data for both the verification and identification tasks. We show that the application of various score imputation methods along with simple sum fusion can improve recognition accuracy, even when the proportion of missing scores increases to 90%. Experiments show that fusion after score imputation outperforms fusion with no imputation. Specifically, iterative imputation with K nearest neighbors consistently surpasses other imputation methods in both the verification and identification tasks, regardless of the amount of scores missing, and provides imputed values that are consistent with the ground truth complete dataset.

- **Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as an excellent solution for performing deep learning on different data owners without exchanging raw data. However, statistical heterogeneity in FL presents a key challenge, leading to a phenomenon of skewness in local model parameter distributions that researchers have largely overlooked. In this work, we propose the concept of parameter skew to describe the phenomenon that can substantially affect the accuracy of global model parameter estimation. Additionally, we introduce FedSA, an aggregation strategy to obtain a high-quality global model, to address the implication from parameter skew. Specifically, we categorize parameters into high-dispersion and low-dispersion groups based on the coefficient of variation. For high-dispersion parameters, Micro-Classes (MIC) and Macro-Classes (MAC) represent the dispersion at the micro and macro levels, respectively, forming the foundation of FedSA. To evaluate the effectiveness of FedSA, we conduct extensive experiments with different FL algorithms on three computer vision datasets. FedSA outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines by about 4.7% in test accuracy.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which efficiently addresses the limitation of acquiring dense annotations, is essential for 3D scene understanding. Most methods leverage the teacher model to generate pseudo labels, and then guide the learning of the student model on unlabeled scenes. However, they focus only on points with pseudo labels while directly overlooking points without pseudo labels, namely intra-scene inconsistency, leading to semantic ambiguity. Moreover, inter-scene correlation between labeled and unlabeled scenes contribute to transferring rich annotation information, yet this has not been explored for the semi-supervised tasks. To address these two problems, we propose to explore scene coherence for semi-supervised 3D semantic segmentation, dubbed CoScene. Inspired by the unstructured and unordered nature of the point clouds, our CoScene adopts the straightforward point erasure strategy to ensure the intra-scene consistency. Moreover, patch-based data augmentation is proposed to enhance the inter-scene information transfer between labeled and unlabeled scenes at both scene and instance levels. Extensive experimental results on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes show that our approach outperforms existing methods.

- **Summary**: Multimodal emotion recognition is a task of great concern. However, traditional data sets are based on fixed labels, resulting in models that often focus on main emotions and ignore detailed emotional changes in complex scenes. This report introduces the solution of using MLLMs technology to generate open-vocabulary emotion labels from a video. The solution includes the use of framework, data generation and processing, training methods, results generation and multi-model co-judgment. In the MER-OV (Open-Word Emotion Recognition) of the MER2024 challenge, our method achieved significant advantages, leading to its superior capabilities in complex emotion computation.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have been widely utilized for image restoration. However, previous blind image restoration methods still need to assume the type of degradation model while leaving the parameters to be optimized, limiting their real-world applications. Therefore, we aim to tame generative diffusion prior for universal blind image restoration dubbed BIR-D, which utilizes an optimizable convolutional kernel to simulate the degradation model and dynamically update the parameters of the kernel in the diffusion steps, enabling it to achieve blind image restoration results even in various complex situations. Besides, based on mathematical reasoning, we have provided an empirical formula for the chosen of adaptive guidance scale, eliminating the need for a grid search for the optimal parameter. Experimentally, Our BIR-D has demonstrated superior practicality and versatility than off-the-shelf unsupervised methods across various tasks both on real-world and synthetic datasets, qualitatively and quantitatively. BIR-D is able to fulfill multi-guidance blind image restoration. Moreover, BIR-D can also restore images that undergo multiple and complicated degradations, demonstrating the practical applications.

- **Summary**: In the field of medical image segmentation, models based on both CNN and Transformer have been thoroughly investigated. However, CNNs have limited modeling capabilities for long-range dependencies, making it challenging to exploit the semantic information within images fully. On the other hand, the quadratic computational complexity poses a challenge for Transformers. State Space Models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have been recognized as a promising method. They not only demonstrate superior performance in modeling long-range interactions, but also preserve a linear computational complexity. The hybrid mechanism of SSM (State Space Model) and Transformer, after meticulous design, can enhance its capability for efficient modeling of visual features. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that integrating the self-attention mechanism into the hybrid part behind the layers of Mamba's architecture can greatly improve the modeling capacity to capture long-range spatial dependencies. In this paper, leveraging the hybrid mechanism of SSM, we propose a U-shape architecture model for medical image segmentation, named Hybird Transformer vision Mamba UNet (HTM-UNet). We conduct comprehensive experiments on the ISIC17, ISIC18, CVC-300, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir, CVC-ColonDB, ETIS-Larib PolypDB public datasets and ZD-LCI-GIM private dataset. The results indicate that HTM-UNet exhibits competitive performance in medical image segmentation tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/simzhangbest/HMT-Unet.

- **Summary**: Few-shot classification (FSC) is a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision that involves recognizing novel classes from limited data. While previous methods have focused on enhancing visual features or incorporating additional modalities, Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) offer a promising alternative due to their rich knowledge and strong visual perception. However, LVLMs risk learning specific response formats rather than effectively extracting useful information from support data in FSC tasks. In this paper, we investigate LVLMs' performance in FSC and identify key issues such as insufficient learning and the presence of severe positional biases. To tackle the above challenges, we adopt the meta-learning strategy to teach models "learn to learn". By constructing a rich set of meta-tasks for instruction fine-tuning, LVLMs enhance the ability to extract information from few-shot support data for classification. Additionally, we further boost LVLM's few-shot learning capabilities through label augmentation and candidate selection in the fine-tuning and inference stage, respectively. Label augmentation is implemented via a character perturbation strategy to ensure the model focuses on support information. Candidate selection leverages attribute descriptions to filter out unreliable candidates and simplify the task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on both general and fine-grained datasets. Furthermore, our candidate selection strategy has been proven beneficial for training-free LVLMs.

- **Summary**: The fashion domain encompasses a variety of real-world multimodal tasks, including multimodal retrieval and multimodal generation. The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence generated content, particularly in technologies like large language models for text generation and diffusion models for visual generation, have sparked widespread research interest in applying these multimodal models in the fashion domain. However, tasks involving embeddings, such as image-to-text or text-to-image retrieval, have been largely overlooked from this perspective due to the diverse nature of the multimodal fashion domain. And current research on multi-task single models lack focus on image generation. In this work, we present UniFashion, a unified framework that simultaneously tackles the challenges of multimodal generation and retrieval tasks within the fashion domain, integrating image generation with retrieval tasks and text generation tasks. UniFashion unifies embedding and generative tasks by integrating a diffusion model and LLM, enabling controllable and high-fidelity generation. Our model significantly outperforms previous single-task state-of-the-art models across diverse fashion tasks, and can be readily adapted to manage complex vision-language tasks. This work demonstrates the potential learning synergy between multimodal generation and retrieval, offering a promising direction for future research in the fashion domain.

- **Summary**: This study explores the potential of Modern Hopfield Networks (MHN) in improving the ability of computer vision models to handle out-of-distribution data. While current computer vision models can generalize to unseen samples from the same distribution, they are susceptible to minor perturbations such as blurring, which limits their effectiveness in real-world applications. We suggest integrating MHN into the baseline models to enhance their robustness. This integration can be implemented during the test time for any model and combined with any adversarial defense method. Our research shows that the proposed integration consistently improves model performance on the MNIST-C dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art increase of 13.84% in average corruption accuracy, a 57.49% decrease in mean Corruption Error (mCE), and a 60.61% decrease in relative mCE compared to the baseline model. Additionally, we investigate the capability of MHN to converge to the original non-corrupted data. Notably, our method does not require test-time adaptation or augmentation with corruptions, underscoring its practical viability for real-world deployment.

- **Summary**: Visual geo-localization demands in-depth knowledge and advanced reasoning skills to associate images with real-world geographic locations precisely. In general, traditional methods based on data-matching are hindered by the impracticality of storing adequate visual records of global landmarks. Recently, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated the capability of geo-localization through Visual Question Answering (VQA), enabling a solution that does not require external geo-tagged image records. However, the performance of a single LVLM is still limited by its intrinsic knowledge and reasoning capabilities. Along this line, in this paper, we introduce a novel visual geo-localization framework called \name\ that integrates the inherent knowledge of multiple LVLM agents via inter-agent communication to achieve effective geo-localization of images. Furthermore, our framework employs a dynamic learning strategy to optimize the communication patterns among agents, reducing unnecessary discussions among agents and improving the efficiency of the framework. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we construct GeoGlobe, a novel dataset for visual geo-localization tasks. Extensive testing on the dataset demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In this work, we discuss evaluating video foundation models in a fair and robust manner. Unlike language or image foundation models, many video foundation models are evaluated with differing parameters (such as sampling rate, number of frames, pretraining steps, etc.), making fair and robust comparisons challenging. Therefore, we present a carefully designed evaluation framework for measuring two core capabilities of video comprehension: appearance and motion understanding. Our findings reveal that existing video foundation models, whether text-supervised like UMT or InternVideo2, or self-supervised like V-JEPA, exhibit limitations in at least one of these capabilities. As an alternative, we introduce TWLV-I, a new video foundation model that constructs robust visual representations for both motion- and appearance-based videos. Based on the average top-1 accuracy of linear probing on five action recognition benchmarks, pretrained only on publicly accessible datasets, our model shows a 4.6%p improvement compared to V-JEPA (ViT-L) and a 7.7%p improvement compared to UMT (ViT-L). Even when compared to much larger models, our model demonstrates a 7.2%p improvement compared to DFN (ViT-H), a 2.7%p improvement compared to V-JEPA~(ViT-H) and a 2.8%p improvement compared to InternVideo2 (ViT-g). We provide embedding vectors obtained by TWLV-I from videos of several commonly used video benchmarks, along with evaluation source code that can directly utilize these embeddings. The code is available on "https://github.com/twelvelabs-io/video-embeddings-evaluation-framework".

- **Summary**: Ultrahigh field (UHF) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides a higher signal-to-noise ratio and, thereby, higher spatial resolution. However, UHF MRI introduces challenges such as transmit radiofrequency (RF) field (B1+) inhomogeneities, leading to uneven flip angles and image intensity anomalies. These issues can significantly degrade imaging quality and its medical applications. This study addresses B1+ field homogeneity through a novel deep learning-based strategy. Traditional methods like Magnitude Least Squares (MLS) optimization have been effective but are time-consuming and dependent on the patient's presence. Recent machine learning approaches, such as RF Shim Prediction by Iteratively Projected Ridge Regression and deep learning frameworks, have shown promise but face limitations like extensive training times and oversimplified architectures. We propose a two-step deep learning strategy. First, we obtain the desired reference RF shimming weights from multi-channel B1+ fields using random-initialized Adaptive Moment Estimation. Then, we employ Residual Networks (ResNets) to train a model that maps B1+ fields to target RF shimming outputs. Our approach does not rely on pre-calculated reference optimizations for the testing process and efficiently learns residual functions. Comparative studies with traditional MLS optimization demonstrate our method's advantages in terms of speed and accuracy. The proposed strategy achieves a faster and more efficient RF shimming design, significantly improving imaging quality at UHF. This advancement holds potential for broader applications in medical imaging and diagnostics.

- **Summary**: One of the major challenges of the twenty-first century is climate change, evidenced by rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and increased storm frequency. Accurate temperature forecasting is vital for understanding and mitigating these impacts. Traditional data-driven models often use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) but face limitations in parallelization, especially with longer sequences. To address this, we introduce a novel approach based on the FocalNet Transformer architecture. Our Focal modulation Attention Encoder (FATE) framework operates in a multi-tensor format, utilizing tensorized modulation to capture spatial and temporal nuances in meteorological data. Comparative evaluations against existing transformer encoders, 3D CNNs, LSTM, and ConvLSTM models show that FATE excels at identifying complex patterns in temperature data. Additionally, we present a new labeled dataset, the Climate Change Parameter dataset (CCPD), containing 40 years of data from Jammu and Kashmir on seven climate-related parameters. Experiments with real-world temperature datasets from the USA, Canada, and Europe show accuracy improvements of 12\%, 23\%, and 28\%, respectively, over current state-of-the-art models. Our CCPD dataset also achieved a 24\% improvement in accuracy. To support reproducible research, we have released the source code and pre-trained FATE model at \href{https://github.com/Tajamul21/FATE}{https://github.com/Tajamul21/FATE}.

- **Summary**: Mercari is the largest C2C e-commerce marketplace in Japan, having more than 20 million active monthly users. Search being the fundamental way to discover desired items, we have always had a substantial amount of data with implicit feedback. Although we actively take advantage of that to provide the best service for our users, the correlation of implicit feedback for such tasks as image quality assessment is not trivial. Many traditional lines of research in Machine Learning (ML) are similarly motivated by the insatiable appetite of Deep Learning (DL) models for well-labelled training data. Weak supervision is about leveraging higher-level and/or noisier supervision over unlabeled data. Large Language Models (LLMs) are being actively studied and used for data labelling tasks. We present how we leverage a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to enable LLM to produce image aesthetics labels that correlate well with human behavior in e-commerce settings. Leveraging LLMs is more cost-effective compared to explicit human judgment, while significantly improving the explainability of deep image quality evaluation which is highly important for customer journey optimization at Mercari. We propose a cost-efficient LLM-driven approach for assessing and predicting image quality in e-commerce settings, which is very convenient for proof-of-concept testing. We show that our LLM-produced labels correlate with user behavior on Mercari. Finally, we show our results from an online experimentation, where we achieved a significant growth in sales on the web platform.

- **Summary**: This paper aims to generate physically-layered 3D humans from text prompts. Existing methods either generate 3D clothed humans as a whole or support only tight and simple clothing generation, which limits their applications to virtual try-on and part-level editing. To achieve physically-layered 3D human generation with reusable and complex clothing, we propose a novel layer-wise dressed human representation based on a physically-decoupled diffusion model. Specifically, to achieve layer-wise clothing generation, we propose a dual-representation decoupling framework for generating clothing decoupled from the human body, in conjunction with an innovative multi-layer fusion volume rendering method. To match the clothing with different body shapes, we propose an SMPL-driven implicit field deformation network that enables the free transfer and reuse of clothing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art layered 3D human generation with complex clothing but also supports virtual try-on and layered human animation.

- **Summary**: Quality assessment algorithms measure the quality of a captured biometric sample. Since the sample quality strongly affects the recognition performance of a biometric system, it is essential to only process samples of sufficient quality and discard samples of low-quality. Even though quality assessment algorithms are not intended to yield very different quality scores across demographic groups, quality score discrepancies are possible, resulting in different discard ratios. To ensure that quality assessment algorithms do not take demographic characteristics into account when assessing sample quality and consequently to ensure that the quality algorithms perform equally for all individuals, it is crucial to develop a fairness measure. In this work we propose and compare multiple fairness measures for evaluating quality components across demographic groups. Proposed measures, could be used as potential candidates for an upcoming standard in this important field.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal Large Language Models have recently experienced rapid developments and excel in various multi-modal tasks. However, they still struggle with mathematical geometric problem solving, which requires exceptional visual perception proficiency. Existing MLLMs mostly optimize the LLM backbone to acquire geometric reasoning capabilities, while rarely emphasizing improvements in visual comprehension. In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of MLLMs when facing geometric diagrams. Our findings reveal that current MLLMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric perception and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose EAGLE, a novel two-stage end-to-end visual enhancement MLLM framework designed to ElevAte Geometric reasoning through LLM-Empowered visual instruction tuning. Specifically, in the preliminary stage, we feed geometric image-caption pairs into our MLLM that contains a fully fine-tuning CLIP ViT and a frozen LLM, aiming to endow our model with basic geometric knowledge. In the subsequent advanced stage, we incorporate LoRA modules into the vision encoder and unfreeze the LLM backbone. This enables the model to leverage the inherent CoT rationales within question-answer pairs, guiding the MLLM to focus on nuanced visual cues and enhancing its overall perceptual capacity. Moreover, we optimize the cross-modal projector in both stages to foster adaptive visual-linguistic alignments. After the two-stage visual enhancement, we develop the geometry expert model EAGLE-7B. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. For example, on the GeoQA benchmark, EAGLE-7B not only surpasses the exemplary G-LLaVA 7B model by 2.9%, but also marginally outperforms the larger G-LLaVA 13B model. On the MathVista benchmark, EAGLE-7B achieves remarkable 3.8% improvements compared with the proprietary model GPT-4V.

- **Summary**: Prototypical parts networks, such as ProtoPNet, became popular due to their potential to produce more genuine explanations than post-hoc methods. However, for a long time, this potential has been strictly theoretical, and no systematic studies have existed to support it. That changed recently with the introduction of the FunnyBirds benchmark, which includes metrics for evaluating different aspects of explanations.   However, this benchmark employs attribution maps visualization for all explanation techniques except for the ProtoPNet, for which the bounding boxes are used. This choice significantly influences the metric scores and questions the conclusions stated in FunnyBirds publication.   In this study, we comprehensively compare metric scores obtained for two types of ProtoPNet visualizations: bounding boxes and similarity maps. Our analysis indicates that employing similarity maps aligns better with the essence of ProtoPNet, as evidenced by different metric scores obtained from FunnyBirds. Therefore, we advocate using similarity maps as a visualization technique for prototypical parts networks in explainability evaluation benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Propagation-based video inpainting using optical flow at the pixel or feature level has recently garnered significant attention. However, it has limitations such as the inaccuracy of optical flow prediction and the propagation of noise over time. These issues result in non-uniform noise and time consistency problems throughout the video, which are particularly pronounced when the removed area is large and involves substantial movement. To address these issues, we propose a novel First Frame Filling Video Diffusion Inpainting model (FFF-VDI). We design FFF-VDI inspired by the capabilities of pre-trained image-to-video diffusion models that can transform the first frame image into a highly natural video. To apply this to the video inpainting task, we propagate the noise latent information of future frames to fill the masked areas of the first frame's noise latent code. Next, we fine-tune the pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model to generate the inpainted video. The proposed model addresses the limitations of existing methods that rely on optical flow quality, producing much more natural and temporally consistent videos. This proposed approach is the first to effectively integrate image-to-video diffusion models into video inpainting tasks. Through various comparative experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model can robustly handle diverse inpainting types with high quality.

- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for compressing models in object detection tasks. Due to limited computational capability, UAV-based object detection (UAV-OD) widely adopt the KD technique to obtain lightweight detectors. Existing methods often overlook the significant differences in feature space caused by the large gap in scale between the teacher and student models. This limitation hampers the efficiency of knowledge transfer during the distillation process. Furthermore, the complex backgrounds in UAV images make it challenging for the student model to efficiently learn the object features. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge distillation framework for UAV-OD. Specifically, a progressive distillation approach is designed to alleviate the feature gap between teacher and student models. Then a new feature alignment method is provided to extract object-related features for enhancing student model's knowledge reception efficiency. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance in two UAV-OD datasets.

- **Summary**: Multi-View Diffusion Models (MVDMs) enable remarkable improvements in the field of 3D geometric reconstruction, but the issue regarding intellectual property has received increasing attention due to unauthorized imitation. Recently, some works have utilized adversarial attacks to protect copyright. However, all these works focus on single-image generation tasks which only need to consider the inner feature of images. Previous methods are inefficient in attacking MVDMs because they lack the consideration of disrupting the geometric and visual consistency among the generated multi-view images. This paper is the first to address the intellectual property infringement issue arising from MVDMs. Accordingly, we propose a novel latent feature and attention dual erasure attack to disrupt the distribution of latent feature and the consistency across the generated images from multi-view and multi-domain simultaneously. The experiments conducted on SOTA MVDMs indicate that our approach achieves superior performances in terms of attack effectiveness, transferability, and robustness against defense methods. Therefore, this paper provides an efficient solution to protect 3D assets from MVDMs-based 3D geometry reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Modern consumer cameras commonly employ the rolling shutter (RS) imaging mechanism, via which images are captured by scanning scenes row-by-row, resulting in RS distortion for dynamic scenes. To correct RS distortion, existing methods adopt a fully supervised learning manner that requires high framerate global shutter (GS) images as ground-truth for supervision. In this paper, we propose an enhanced Self-supervised learning framework for Dual reversed RS distortion Correction (SelfDRSC++). Firstly, we introduce a lightweight DRSC network that incorporates a bidirectional correlation matching block to refine the joint optimization of optical flows and corrected RS features, thereby improving correction performance while reducing network parameters. Subsequently, to effectively train the DRSC network, we propose a self-supervised learning strategy that ensures cycle consistency between input and reconstructed dual reversed RS images. The RS reconstruction in SelfDRSC++ can be interestingly formulated as a specialized instance of video frame interpolation, where each row in reconstructed RS images is interpolated from predicted GS images by utilizing RS distortion time maps. By achieving superior performance while simplifying the training process, SelfDRSC++ enables feasible one-stage self-supervised training. Additionally, besides start and end RS scanning time, SelfDRSC++ allows supervision of GS images at arbitrary intermediate scanning times, thus enabling the learned DRSC network to generate high framerate GS videos. The code and trained models are available at \url{https://github.com/shangwei5/SelfDRSC_plusplus}.

- **Summary**: Recent single-view 3D generative methods have made significant advancements by leveraging knowledge distilled from extensive 3D object datasets. However, challenges persist in the synthesis of 3D scenes from a single view, primarily due to the complexity of real-world environments and the limited availability of high-quality prior resources. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Pano2Room, designed to automatically reconstruct high-quality 3D indoor scenes from a single panoramic image. These panoramic images can be easily generated using a panoramic RGBD inpainter from captures at a single location with any camera. The key idea is to initially construct a preliminary mesh from the input panorama, and iteratively refine this mesh using a panoramic RGBD inpainter while collecting photo-realistic 3D-consistent pseudo novel views. Finally, the refined mesh is converted into a 3D Gaussian Splatting field and trained with the collected pseudo novel views. This pipeline enables the reconstruction of real-world 3D scenes, even in the presence of large occlusions, and facilitates the synthesis of photo-realistic novel views with detailed geometry. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments have been conducted to validate the superiority of our method in single-panorama indoor novel synthesis compared to the state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Facial expression recognition (FER) is an important research topic in emotional artificial intelligence. In recent decades, researchers have made remarkable progress. However, current FER paradigms face challenges in generalization, lack semantic information aligned with natural language, and struggle to process both images and videos within a unified framework, making their application in multimodal emotion understanding and human-computer interaction difficult. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved success, offering advantages in addressing these issues and potentially overcoming the limitations of current FER paradigms. However, directly applying pre-trained MLLMs to FER still faces several challenges. Our zero-shot evaluations of existing open-source MLLMs on FER indicate a significant performance gap compared to GPT-4V and current supervised state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In this paper, we aim to enhance MLLMs' capabilities in understanding facial expressions. We first generate instruction data for five FER datasets with Gemini. We then propose a novel MLLM, named EMO-LLaMA, which incorporates facial priors from a pretrained facial analysis network to enhance human facial information. Specifically, we design a Face Info Mining module to extract both global and local facial information. Additionally, we utilize a handcrafted prompt to introduce age-gender-race attributes, considering the emotional differences across different human groups. Extensive experiments show that EMO-LLaMA achieves SOTA-comparable or competitive results across both static and dynamic FER datasets. The instruction dataset and code are available at https://github.com/xxtars/EMO-LLaMA.

- **Summary**: Current text-video retrieval methods mainly rely on cross-modal matching between queries and videos to calculate their similarity scores, which are then sorted to obtain retrieval results. This method considers the matching between each candidate video and the query, but it incurs a significant time cost and will increase notably with the increase of candidates. Generative models are common in natural language processing and computer vision, and have been successfully applied in document retrieval, but their application in multimodal retrieval remains unexplored. To enhance retrieval efficiency, in this paper, we introduce a model-based video indexer named T2VIndexer, which is a sequence-to-sequence generative model directly generating video identifiers and retrieving candidate videos with constant time complexity. T2VIndexer aims to reduce retrieval time while maintaining high accuracy. To achieve this goal, we propose video identifier encoding and query-identifier augmentation approaches to represent videos as short sequences while preserving their semantic information. Our method consistently enhances the retrieval efficiency of current state-of-the-art models on four standard datasets. It enables baselines with only 30\%-50\% of the original retrieval time to achieve better retrieval performance on MSR-VTT (+1.0%), MSVD (+1.8%), ActivityNet (+1.5%), and DiDeMo (+0.2%).

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have led to the development of several Large Weather Models (LWMs) that rival state-of-the-art (SOTA) numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. Up to now, these models still rely on traditional NWP-generated analysis fields as input and are far from being an autonomous system. While researchers are exploring data-driven data assimilation (DA) models to generate accurate initial fields for LWMs, the lack of a standard benchmark impedes the fair evaluation among different data-driven DA algorithms. Here, we introduce DABench, a benchmark dataset utilizing ERA5 data as ground truth to guide the development of end-to-end data-driven weather prediction systems. DABench contributes four standard features: (1) sparse and noisy simulated observations under the guidance of the observing system simulation experiment method; (2) a skillful pre-trained weather prediction model to generate background fields while fairly evaluating the impact of assimilation outcomes on predictions; (3) standardized evaluation metrics for model comparison; (4) a strong baseline called the DA Transformer (DaT). DaT integrates the four-dimensional variational DA prior knowledge into the Transformer model and outperforms the SOTA in physical state reconstruction, named 4DVarNet. Furthermore, we exemplify the development of an end-to-end data-driven weather prediction system by integrating DaT with the prediction model. Researchers can leverage DABench to develop their models and compare performance against established baselines, which will benefit the future advancements of data-driven weather prediction systems. The code is available on this Github repository and the dataset is available at the Baidu Drive.

- **Summary**: Computer vision (CV) datasets often exhibit biases that are perpetuated by deep learning models. While recent efforts aim to mitigate these biases and foster fair representations, they fail in complex real-world scenarios. In particular, existing methods excel in controlled experiments involving benchmarks with single-attribute injected biases, but struggle with multi-attribute biases being present in well-established CV datasets. Here, we introduce BAdd, a simple yet effective method that allows for learning fair representations invariant to the attributes introducing bias by incorporating features representing these attributes into the backbone. BAdd is evaluated on seven benchmarks and exhibits competitive performance, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on both single- and multi-attribute benchmarks. Notably, BAdd achieves +27.5% and +5.5% absolute accuracy improvements on the challenging multi-attribute benchmarks, FB-Biased-MNIST and CelebA, respectively.

- **Summary**: We introduce GaussianOcc, a systematic method that investigates the two usages of Gaussian splatting for fully self-supervised and efficient 3D occupancy estimation in surround views. First, traditional methods for self-supervised 3D occupancy estimation still require ground truth 6D poses from sensors during training. To address this limitation, we propose Gaussian Splatting for Projection (GSP) module to provide accurate scale information for fully self-supervised training from adjacent view projection. Additionally, existing methods rely on volume rendering for final 3D voxel representation learning using 2D signals (depth maps, semantic maps), which is both time-consuming and less effective. We propose Gaussian Splatting from Voxel space (GSV) to leverage the fast rendering properties of Gaussian splatting. As a result, the proposed GaussianOcc method enables fully self-supervised (no ground truth pose) 3D occupancy estimation in competitive performance with low computational cost (2.7 times faster in training and 5 times faster in rendering).

- **Summary**: In recent years, there have been significant advancements in computer vision which have led to the widespread deployment of image recognition and generation systems in socially relevant applications, from hiring to security screening. However, the prevalence of biases within these systems has raised significant ethical and social concerns. The most extensively studied biases in this context are related to gender, race and age. Yet, other biases are equally pervasive and harmful, such as lookism, i.e., the preferential treatment of individuals based on their physical appearance. Lookism remains under-explored in computer vision but can have profound implications not only by perpetuating harmful societal stereotypes but also by undermining the fairness and inclusivity of AI technologies. Thus, this paper advocates for the systematic study of lookism as a critical bias in computer vision models. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify three areas of intersection between lookism and computer vision. We illustrate them by means of examples and a user study. We call for an interdisciplinary approach to address lookism, urging researchers, developers, and policymakers to prioritize the development of equitable computer vision systems that respect and reflect the diversity of human appearances.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the field of visual tracking has made significant progress with the application of large-scale training datasets. These datasets have supported the development of sophisticated algorithms, enhancing the accuracy and stability of visual object tracking. However, most research has primarily focused on favorable illumination circumstances, neglecting the challenges of tracking in low-ligh environments. In low-light scenes, lighting may change dramatically, targets may lack distinct texture features, and in some scenarios, targets may not be directly observable. These factors can lead to a severe decline in tracking performance. To address this issue, we introduce LLOT, a benchmark specifically designed for Low-Light Object Tracking. LLOT comprises 269 challenging sequences with a total of over 132K frames, each carefully annotated with bounding boxes. This specially designed dataset aims to promote innovation and advancement in object tracking techniques for low-light conditions, addressing challenges not adequately covered by existing benchmarks. To assess the performance of existing methods on LLOT, we conducted extensive tests on 39 state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. The results highlight a considerable gap in low-light tracking performance. In response, we propose H-DCPT, a novel tracker that incorporates historical and darkness clue prompts to set a stronger baseline. H-DCPT outperformed all 39 evaluated methods in our experiments, demonstrating significant improvements. We hope that our benchmark and H-DCPT will stimulate the development of novel and accurate methods for tracking objects in low-light conditions. The LLOT and code are available at https://github.com/OpenCodeGithub/H-DCPT.

- **Summary**: Occupancy prediction has attracted intensive attention and shown great superiority in the development of autonomous driving systems. The fine-grained environmental representation brought by occupancy prediction in terms of both geometry and semantic information has facilitated the general perception and safe planning under open scenarios. However, it also brings high computation costs and heavy parameters in existing works that utilize voxel-based 3d dense representation and Transformer-based quadratic attention. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Mamba-based occupancy prediction method (MambaOcc) adopting BEV features to ease the burden of 3D scenario representation, and linear Mamba-style attention to achieve efficient long-range perception. Besides, to address the sensitivity of Mamba to sequence order, we propose a local adaptive reordering (LAR) mechanism with deformable convolution and design a hybrid BEV encoder comprised of convolution layers and Mamba. Extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MambaOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. For example, compared to FlashOcc, MambaOcc delivers superior results while reducing the number of parameters by 42\% and computational costs by 39\%.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing 3D from a single view image is a long-standing challenge. One of the popular approaches to tackle this problem is learning-based methods, but dealing with the test cases unfamiliar with training data (Out-of-distribution; OoD) introduces an additional challenge. To adapt for unseen samples in test time, we propose MeTTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) exploiting generative prior. We design joint optimization of 3D geometry, appearance, and pose to handle OoD cases with only a single view image. However, the alignment between the reference image and the 3D shape via the estimated viewpoint could be erroneous, which leads to ambiguity. To address this ambiguity, we carefully design learnable virtual cameras and their self-calibration. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MeTTA effectively deals with OoD scenarios at failure cases of existing learning-based 3D reconstruction models and enables obtaining a realistic appearance with physically based rendering (PBR) textures.

- **Summary**: Recent years have seen substantial progress in diffusion-based controllable video generation. However, achieving precise control in complex scenarios, including fine-grained object parts, sophisticated motion trajectories, and coherent background movement, remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce TrackGo, a novel approach that leverages free-form masks and arrows for conditional video generation. This method offers users with a flexible and precise mechanism for manipulating video content. We also propose the TrackAdapter for control implementation, an efficient and lightweight adapter designed to be seamlessly integrated into the temporal self-attention layers of a pretrained video generation model. This design leverages our observation that the attention map of these layers can accurately activate regions corresponding to motion in videos. Our experimental results demonstrate that our new approach, enhanced by the TrackAdapter, achieves state-of-the-art performance on key metrics such as FVD, FID, and ObjMC scores.

- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation is widely applied in various fundamental vision models to enhance the performance of compact models. Existing knowledge distillation methods focus on designing different distillation targets to acquire knowledge from teacher models. However, these methods often overlook the efficient utilization of distilled information, crudely coupling different types of information, making it difficult to explain how the knowledge from the teacher network aids the student network in learning. This paper proposes a novel knowledge distillation framework, Local Attention Knowledge Distillation (LAKD), which more efficiently utilizes the distilled information from teacher networks, achieving higher interpretability and competitive performance. The framework establishes an independent interactive training mechanism through a separation-decoupling mechanism and non-directional activation mapping. LAKD decouples the teacher's features and facilitates progressive interaction training from simple to complex. Specifically, the student network is divided into local modules with independent gradients to decouple the knowledge transferred from the teacher. The non-directional activation mapping helps the student network integrate knowledge from different local modules by learning coarse-grained feature knowledge. We conducted experiments on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, and the results show that our LAKD method significantly outperforms existing methods, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance across different datasets.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based methods have shown remarkable performance in single JPEG artifacts removal task. However, existing methods tend to degrade on double JPEG images, which are prevalent in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Offset-Aware Partition Transformer for double JPEG artifacts removal, termed as OAPT. We conduct an analysis of double JPEG compression that results in up to four patterns within each 8x8 block and design our model to cluster the similar patterns to remedy the difficulty of restoration. Our OAPT consists of two components: compression offset predictor and image reconstructor. Specifically, the predictor estimates pixel offsets between the first and second compression, which are then utilized to divide different patterns. The reconstructor is mainly based on several Hybrid Partition Attention Blocks (HPAB), combining vanilla window-based self-attention and sparse attention for clustered pattern features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OAPT outperforms the state-of-the-art method by more than 0.16dB in double JPEG image restoration task. Moreover, without increasing any computation cost, the pattern clustering module in HPAB can serve as a plugin to enhance other transformer-based image restoration methods. The code will be available at https://github.com/QMoQ/OAPT.git .

- **Summary**: Text-driven video editing has recently experienced rapid development. Despite this, evaluating edited videos remains a considerable challenge. Current metrics tend to fail to align with human perceptions, and effective quantitative metrics for video editing are still notably absent. To address this, we introduce E-Bench, a benchmark suite tailored to the assessment of text-driven video editing. This suite includes E-Bench DB, a video quality assessment (VQA) database for video editing. E-Bench DB encompasses a diverse set of source videos featuring various motions and subjects, along with multiple distinct editing prompts, editing results from 8 different models, and the corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) from 24 human annotators. Based on E-Bench DB, we further propose E-Bench QA, a quantitative human-aligned measurement for the text-driven video editing task. In addition to the aesthetic, distortion, and other visual quality indicators that traditional VQA methods emphasize, E-Bench QA focuses on the text-video alignment and the relevance modeling between source and edited videos. It proposes a new assessment network for video editing that attains superior performance in alignment with human preferences. To the best of our knowledge, E-Bench introduces the first quality assessment dataset for video editing and an effective subjective-aligned quantitative metric for this domain. All data and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/littlespray/E-Bench.

- **Summary**: This study explores the concept of cross-disease transferability (XDT) in medical imaging, focusing on the potential of binary classifiers trained on one disease to perform zero-shot classification on another disease affecting the same organ. Utilizing chest X-rays (CXR) as the primary modality, we investigate whether a model trained on one pulmonary disease can make predictions about another novel pulmonary disease, a scenario with significant implications for medical settings with limited data on emerging diseases. The XDT framework leverages the embedding space of a vision encoder, which, through kernel transformation, aids in distinguishing between diseased and non-diseased classes in the latent space. This capability is especially beneficial in resource-limited environments or in regions with low prevalence of certain diseases, where conventional diagnostic practices may fail. However, the XDT framework is currently limited to binary classification, determining only the presence or absence of a disease rather than differentiating among multiple diseases. This limitation underscores the supplementary role of XDT to traditional diagnostic tests in clinical settings. Furthermore, results show that XDT-CXR as a framework is able to make better predictions compared to other zero-shot learning (ZSL) baselines.

- **Summary**: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become a standard paradigm for weakly supervised classification of whole slide images (WSI). However, this paradigm relies on the use of a large number of labelled WSIs for training. The lack of training data and the presence of rare diseases present significant challenges for these methods. Prompt tuning combined with the pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) is an effective solution to the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI classification (FSWC) tasks. Nevertheless, applying prompt tuning methods designed for natural images to WSIs presents three significant challenges: 1) These methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge from the VLM's text modality; 2) They overlook the essential multi-scale and contextual information in WSIs, leading to suboptimal results; and 3) They lack exploration of instance aggregation methods. To address these problems, we propose a Multi-Scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning (MSCPT) method for FSWC tasks. Specifically, MSCPT employs the frozen large language model to generate pathological visual language prior knowledge at multi-scale, guiding hierarchical prompt tuning. Additionally, we design a graph prompt tuning module to learn essential contextual information within WSI, and finally, a non-parametric cross-guided instance aggregation module has been introduced to get the WSI-level features. Based on two VLMs, extensive experiments and visualizations on three datasets demonstrated the powerful performance of our MSCPT.

- **Summary**: The creation of increasingly vivid 3D virtual digital humans has become a hot topic in recent years. Currently, most speech-driven work focuses on training models to learn the relationship between phonemes and visemes to achieve more realistic lips. However, they fail to capture the correlations between emotions and facial expressions effectively. To solve this problem, we propose a new model, termed EmoFace. EmoFace employs a novel Mesh Attention mechanism, which helps to learn potential feature dependencies between mesh vertices in time and space. We also adopt, for the first time to our knowledge, an effective self-growing training scheme that combines teacher-forcing and scheduled sampling in a 3D face animation task. Additionally, since EmoFace is an autoregressive model, there is no requirement that the first frame of the training data must be a silent frame, which greatly reduces the data limitations and contributes to solve the current dilemma of insufficient datasets. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on our proposed high-quality reconstructed 3D emotional facial animation dataset, 3D-RAVDESS ($5.0343\times 10^{-5}$mm for LVE and $1.0196\times 10^{-5}$mm for EVE), and publicly available dataset VOCASET ($2.8669\times 10^{-5}$mm for LVE and $0.4664\times 10^{-5}$mm for EVE), demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Reducing speckle fluctuations in multi-channel SAR images is essential in many applications of SAR imaging such as polarimetric classification or interferometric height estimation. While single-channel despeckling has widely benefited from the application of deep learning techniques, extensions to multi-channel SAR images are much more challenging.This paper introduces MuChaPro, a generic framework that exploits existing single-channel despeckling methods. The key idea is to generate numerous single-channel projections, restore these projections, and recombine them into the final multi-channel estimate. This simple approach is shown to be effective in polarimetric and/or interferometric modalities. A special appeal of MuChaPro is the possibility to apply a self-supervised training strategy to learn sensor-specific networks for single-channel despeckling.

- **Summary**: The advent of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) marks a significant milestone for interactive segmentation using generalist models. As a late fusion model, SAM extracts image embeddings once and merges them with prompts in later interactions. This strategy limits the models ability to extract detailed information from the prompted target zone. Current specialist models utilize the early fusion strategy that encodes the combination of images and prompts to target the prompted objects, yet repetitive complex computations on the images result in high latency. The key to these issues is efficiently synergizing the images and prompts. We propose SAM-REF, a two-stage refinement framework that fully integrates images and prompts globally and locally while maintaining the accuracy of early fusion and the efficiency of late fusion. The first-stage GlobalDiff Refiner is a lightweight early fusion network that combines the whole image and prompts, focusing on capturing detailed information for the entire object. The second-stage PatchDiff Refiner locates the object detail window according to the mask and prompts, then refines the local details of the object. Experimentally, we demonstrated the high effectiveness and efficiency of our method in tackling complex cases with multiple interactions. Our SAM-REF model outperforms the current state-of-the-art method in most metrics on segmentation quality without compromising efficiency.

- **Summary**: Embodied learning for object-centric robotic manipulation is a rapidly developing and challenging area in embodied AI. It is crucial for advancing next-generation intelligent robots and has garnered significant interest recently. Unlike data-driven machine learning methods, embodied learning focuses on robot learning through physical interaction with the environment and perceptual feedback, making it especially suitable for robotic manipulation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the latest advancements in this field and categorize the existing work into three main branches: 1) Embodied perceptual learning, which aims to predict object pose and affordance through various data representations; 2) Embodied policy learning, which focuses on generating optimal robotic decisions using methods such as reinforcement learning and imitation learning; 3) Embodied task-oriented learning, designed to optimize the robot's performance based on the characteristics of different tasks in object grasping and manipulation. In addition, we offer an overview and discussion of public datasets, evaluation metrics, representative applications, current challenges, and potential future research directions.

- **Summary**: Reconstruction under adverse rainy conditions poses significant challenges due to reduced visibility and the distortion of visual perception. These conditions can severely impair the quality of geometric maps, which is essential for applications ranging from autonomous planning to environmental monitoring. In response to these challenges, this study introduces the novel task of 3D Reconstruction in Rainy Environments (3DRRE), specifically designed to address the complexities of reconstructing 3D scenes under rainy conditions. To benchmark this task, we construct the HydroViews dataset that comprises a diverse collection of both synthesized and real-world scene images characterized by various intensities of rain streaks and raindrops. Furthermore, we propose DeRainGS, the first 3DGS method tailored for reconstruction in adverse rainy environments. Extensive experiments across a wide range of rain scenarios demonstrate that our method delivers state-of-the-art performance, remarkably outperforming existing occlusion-free methods.

- **Summary**: Synthetic images disseminated online significantly differ from those used during the training and evaluation of the state-of-the-art detectors. In this work, we analyze the performance of synthetic image detectors as deceptive synthetic images evolve throughout their online lifespan. Our study reveals that, despite advancements in the field, current state-of-the-art detectors struggle to distinguish between synthetic and real images in the wild. Moreover, we show that the time elapsed since the initial online appearance of a synthetic image negatively affects the performance of most detectors. Ultimately, by employing a retrieval-assisted detection approach, we demonstrate the feasibility to maintain initial detection performance throughout the whole online lifespan of an image and enhance the average detection efficacy across several state-of-the-art detectors by 6.7% and 7.8% for balanced accuracy and AUC metrics, respectively.

- **Summary**: The semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images plays a crucial role in downstream applications such as urban planning and disaster assessment. However, existing Transformer-based methods suffer from the constraint between accuracy and efficiency. To overcome this dilemma, we propose UNetMamba, a novel Mamba-based semantic segmentation model. It incorporates a Mamba Segmentation Decoder (MSD) that can efficiently decode the complex information within high-resolution images, and a Local Supervision Module (LSM), which is train-only but can significantly enhance the perception of local contents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UNet-Mamba outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with the mIoU increased by 0.87% on LoveDA and 0.36% on ISPRS Vaihingen, while achieving high efficiency through light weight, low memory footprint and low computational cost.

- **Summary**: Fashion image editing aims to modify a person's appearance based on a given instruction. Existing methods require auxiliary tools like segmenters and keypoint extractors, lacking a flexible and unified framework. Moreover, these methods are limited in the variety of clothing types they can handle, as most datasets focus on people in clean backgrounds and only include generic garments such as tops, pants, and dresses. These limitations restrict their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we first extend an existing dataset for human generation to include a wider range of apparel and more complex backgrounds. This extended dataset features people wearing diverse items such as tops, pants, dresses, skirts, headwear, scarves, shoes, socks, and bags. Additionally, we propose AnyDesign, a diffusion-based method that enables mask-free editing on versatile areas. Users can simply input a human image along with a corresponding prompt in either text or image format. Our approach incorporates Fashion DiT, equipped with a Fashion-Guidance Attention (FGA) module designed to fuse explicit apparel types and CLIP-encoded apparel features. Both Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method delivers high-quality fashion editing and outperforms contemporary text-guided fashion editing methods.

- **Summary**: Learning meaningful local and global information remains a challenge in point cloud segmentation tasks. When utilizing local information, prior studies indiscriminately aggregates neighbor information from different classes to update query points, potentially compromising the distinctive feature of query points. In parallel, inaccurate modeling of long-distance contextual dependencies when utilizing global information can also impact model performance. To address these issues, we propose GSTran, a novel transformer network tailored for the segmentation task. The proposed network mainly consists of two principal components: a local geometric transformer and a global semantic transformer. In the local geometric transformer module, we explicitly calculate the geometric disparity within the local region. This enables amplifying the affinity with geometrically similar neighbor points while suppressing the association with other neighbors. In the global semantic transformer module, we design a multi-head voting strategy. This strategy evaluates semantic similarity across the entire spatial range, facilitating the precise capture of contextual dependencies. Experiments on ShapeNetPart and S3DIS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing its superiority over other algorithms. The code is available at https://github.com/LAB123-tech/GSTran.

- **Summary**: Accurate prediction of 3D semantic occupancy from 2D visual images is vital in enabling autonomous agents to comprehend their surroundings for planning and navigation. State-of-the-art methods typically employ fully supervised approaches, necessitating a huge labeled dataset acquired through expensive LiDAR sensors and meticulous voxel-wise labeling by human annotators. The resource-intensive nature of this annotating process significantly hampers the application and scalability of these methods. We introduce a novel semi-supervised framework to alleviate the dependency on densely annotated data. Our approach leverages 2D foundation models to generate essential 3D scene geometric and semantic cues, facilitating a more efficient training process. Our framework exhibits notable properties: (1) Generalizability, applicable to various 3D semantic scene completion approaches, including 2D-3D lifting and 3D-2D transformer methods. (2) Effectiveness, as demonstrated through experiments on SemanticKITTI and NYUv2, wherein our method achieves up to 85% of the fully-supervised performance using only 10% labeled data. This approach not only reduces the cost and labor associated with data annotation but also demonstrates the potential for broader adoption in camera-based systems for 3D semantic occupancy prediction.

- **Summary**: This study introduces the Iterative Refinement Process (IRP), a robust anomaly detection methodology designed for high-stakes industrial quality control. The IRP enhances defect detection accuracy through a cyclic data refinement strategy, iteratively removing misleading data points to improve model performance and robustness. We validate the IRP's effectiveness using two benchmark datasets, Kolektor SDD2 (KSDD2) and MVTec AD, covering a wide range of industrial products and defect types. Our experimental results demonstrate that the IRP consistently outperforms traditional anomaly detection models, particularly in environments with high noise levels. This study highlights the IRP's potential to significantly enhance anomaly detection processes in industrial settings, effectively managing the challenges of sparse and noisy data.

- **Summary**: With the advancement of generative models, the synthesis of different sensory elements such as music, visuals, and speech has achieved significant realism. However, the approach to generate multi-sensory outputs has not been fully explored, limiting the application on high-value scenarios such as of directing a film. Developing a movie director agent faces two major challenges: (1) Lack of parallelism and online scheduling with production steps: In the production of multi-sensory films, there are complex dependencies between different sensory elements, and the production time for each element varies. (2) Diverse needs and clear communication demands with users: Users often cannot clearly express their needs until they see a draft, which requires human-computer interaction and iteration to continually adjust and optimize the film content based on user feedback. To address these issues, we introduce AutoDirector, an interactive multi-sensory composition framework that supports long shots, special effects, music scoring, dubbing, and lip-syncing. This framework improves the efficiency of multi-sensory film production through automatic scheduling and supports the modification and improvement of interactive tasks to meet user needs. AutoDirector not only expands the application scope of human-machine collaboration but also demonstrates the potential of AI in collaborating with humans in the role of a film director to complete multi-sensory films.

- **Summary**: Point cloud analysis has achieved significant development and is well-performed in multiple downstream tasks like point cloud classification and segmentation, etc. Being conscious of the simplicity of the position encoding structure in Transformer-based architectures, we attach importance to the position encoding as a high-dimensional part and the patch encoder to offer multi-scale information. Together with the sequential Transformer, the whole module with position encoding comprehensively constructs a multi-scale feature abstraction module that considers both the local parts from the patch and the global parts from center points as position encoding. With only a few parameters, the position embedding module fits the setting of PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) tasks pretty well. Thus we unfreeze these parameters as a fine-tuning part. At the same time, we review the existing prompt and adapter tuning methods, proposing a fresh way of prompts and synthesizing them with adapters as dynamic adjustments. Our Proposed method of PEFT tasks, namely PPT, with only 1.05% of parameters for training, gets state-of-the-art results in several mainstream datasets, such as 95.01% accuracy in the ScanObjectNN OBJ_BG dataset. Codes will be released at https://github.com/zsc000722/PPT.

- **Summary**: The evaluation of cell tracking results steers the development of tracking methods, significantly impacting biomedical research. This is quantitatively achieved by means of evaluation metrics. Unfortunately, current metrics favor local correctness and weakly reward global coherence, impeding high-level biological analysis. To also foster global coherence, we propose the CHOTA metric (Cell-specific Higher Order Tracking Accuracy) which unifies the evaluation of all relevant aspects of cell tracking: cell detections and local associations, global coherence, and lineage tracking. We achieve this by introducing a new definition of the term 'trajectory' that includes the entire cell lineage and by including this into the well-established HOTA metric from general multiple object tracking. Furthermore, we provide a detailed survey of contemporary cell tracking metrics to compare our novel CHOTA metric and to show its advantages. All metrics are extensively evaluated on state-of-the-art real-data cell tracking results and synthetic results that simulate specific tracking errors. We show that CHOTA is sensitive to all tracking errors and gives a good indication of the biologically relevant capability of a method to reconstruct the full lineage of cells. It introduces a robust and comprehensive alternative to the currently used metrics in cell tracking. Python code is available at https://github.com/CellTrackingChallenge/py-ctcmetrics .

- **Summary**: Reconstructing cardiac electrical activity from body surface electric potential measurements results in the severely ill-posed inverse problem in electrocardiography. Many different regularization approaches have been proposed to improve numerical results and provide unique results. This work presents a novel approach for reconstructing the epicardial potential from body surface potential maps based on a space-time total variation-type regularization using finite elements, where a first-order primal-dual algorithm solves the underlying convex optimization problem. In several numerical experiments, the superior performance of this method and the benefit of space-time regularization for the reconstruction of epicardial potential on two-dimensional torso data and a three-dimensional rabbit heart compared to state-of-the-art methods are demonstrated.

- **Summary**: Rescue robotics sets high requirements to perception algorithms due to the unstructured and potentially vision-denied environments. Pivoting Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave radars are an emerging sensing modality for SLAM in this kind of environment. However, the complex noise characteristics of radar SLAM makes, particularly indoor, applications computationally demanding and slow. In this work, we introduce a novel radar SLAM framework, RaNDT SLAM, that operates fast and generates accurate robot trajectories. The method is based on the Normal Distributions Transform augmented by radar intensity measures. Motion estimation is based on fusion of motion model, IMU data, and registration of the intensity-augmented Normal Distributions Transform. We evaluate RaNDT SLAM in a new benchmark dataset and the Oxford Radar RobotCar dataset. The new dataset contains indoor and outdoor environments besides multiple sensing modalities (LiDAR, radar, and IMU).

- **Summary**: Vehicle information recognition is crucial in various practical domains, particularly in criminal investigations. Vehicle Color Recognition (VCR) has garnered significant research interest because color is a visually distinguishable attribute of vehicles and is less affected by partial occlusion and changes in viewpoint. Despite the success of existing methods for this task, the relatively low complexity of the datasets used in the literature has been largely overlooked. This research addresses this gap by compiling a new dataset representing a more challenging VCR scenario. The images - sourced from six license plate recognition datasets - are categorized into eleven colors, and their annotations were validated using official vehicle registration information. We evaluate the performance of four deep learning models on a widely adopted dataset and our proposed dataset to establish a benchmark. The results demonstrate that our dataset poses greater difficulty for the tested models and highlights scenarios that require further exploration in VCR. Remarkably, nighttime scenes account for a significant portion of the errors made by the best-performing model. This research provides a foundation for future studies on VCR, while also offering valuable insights for the field of fine-grained vehicle classification.

- **Summary**: Automatic Video Dubbing (AVD) aims to take the given script and generate speech that aligns with lip motion and prosody expressiveness. Current AVD models mainly utilize visual information of the current sentence to enhance the prosody of synthesized speech. However, it is crucial to consider whether the prosody of the generated dubbing aligns with the multimodal context, as the dubbing will be combined with the original context in the final video. This aspect has been overlooked in previous studies. To address this issue, we propose a Multimodal Context-aware video Dubbing model, termed \textbf{MCDubber}, to convert the modeling object from a single sentence to a longer sequence with context information to ensure the consistency of the global context prosody. MCDubber comprises three main components: (1) A context duration aligner aims to learn the context-aware alignment between the text and lip frames; (2) A context prosody predictor seeks to read the global context visual sequence and predict the context-aware global energy and pitch; (3) A context acoustic decoder ultimately predicts the global context mel-spectrogram with the assistance of adjacent ground-truth mel-spectrograms of the target sentence. Through this process, MCDubber fully considers the influence of multimodal context on the prosody expressiveness of the current sentence when dubbing. The extracted mel-spectrogram belonging to the target sentence from the output context mel-spectrograms is the final required dubbing audio. Extensive experiments on the Chem benchmark dataset demonstrate that our MCDubber significantly improves dubbing expressiveness compared to all advanced baselines. The code and demos are available at https://github.com/XiaoYuanJun-zy/MCDubber.

- **Summary**: Computer vision has advanced research methodologies, enhancing system services across various fields. It is a core component in traffic monitoring systems for improving road safety; however, these monitoring systems don't preserve the privacy of pedestrians who appear in the videos, potentially revealing their identities. Addressing this issue, our paper introduces Video-to-Text Pedestrian Monitoring (VTPM), which monitors pedestrian movements at intersections and generates real-time textual reports, including traffic signal and weather information. VTPM uses computer vision models for pedestrian detection and tracking, achieving a latency of 0.05 seconds per video frame. Additionally, it detects crossing violations with 90.2% accuracy by incorporating traffic signal data. The proposed framework is equipped with Phi-3 mini-4k to generate real-time textual reports of pedestrian activity while stating safety concerns like crossing violations, conflicts, and the impact of weather on their behavior with latency of 0.33 seconds. To enhance comprehensive analysis of the generated textual reports, Phi-3 medium is fine-tuned for historical analysis of these generated textual reports. This fine-tuning enables more reliable analysis about the pedestrian safety at intersections, effectively detecting patterns and safety critical events. The proposed VTPM offers a more efficient alternative to video footage by using textual reports reducing memory usage, saving up to 253 million percent, eliminating privacy issues, and enabling comprehensive interactive historical analysis.

- **Summary**: Visual State Space Model (VSS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in various computer vision tasks. However, in the process of development, backdoor attacks have brought severe challenges to security. Such attacks cause an infected model to predict target labels when a specific trigger is activated, while the model behaves normally on benign samples. In this paper, we conduct systematic experiments to comprehend on robustness of VSS through the lens of backdoor attacks, specifically how the state space model (SSM) mechanism affects robustness. We first investigate the vulnerability of VSS to different backdoor triggers and reveal that the SSM mechanism, which captures contextual information within patches, makes the VSS model more susceptible to backdoor triggers compared to models without SSM. Furthermore, we analyze the sensitivity of the VSS model to patch processing techniques and discover that these triggers are effectively disrupted. Based on these observations, we consider an effective backdoor for the VSS model that recurs in each patch to resist patch perturbations. Extensive experiments across three datasets and various backdoor attacks reveal that the VSS model performs comparably to Transformers (ViTs) but is less robust than the Gated CNNs, which comprise only stacked Gated CNN blocks without SSM.

- **Summary**: We propose LiFCal, a novel geometric online calibration pipeline for MLA-based light field cameras. LiFCal accurately determines model parameters from a moving camera sequence without precise calibration targets, integrating arbitrary metric scaling constraints. It optimizes intrinsic parameters of the light field camera model, the 3D coordinates of a sparse set of scene points and camera poses in a single bundle adjustment defined directly on micro image points.   We show that LiFCal can reliably and repeatably calibrate a focused plenoptic camera using different input sequences, providing intrinsic camera parameters extremely close to state-of-the-art methods, while offering two main advantages: it can be applied in a target-free scene, and it is implemented online in a complete and continuous pipeline.   Furthermore, we demonstrate the quality of the obtained camera parameters in downstream tasks like depth estimation and SLAM.   Webpage: https://lifcal.github.io/

- **Summary**: Long-term Action Quality Assessment (AQA) evaluates the execution of activities in videos. However, the length presents challenges in fine-grained interpretability, with current AQA methods typically producing a single score by averaging clip features, lacking detailed semantic meanings of individual clips. Long-term videos pose additional difficulty due to the complexity and diversity of actions, exacerbating interpretability challenges. While query-based transformer networks offer promising long-term modeling capabilities, their interpretability in AQA remains unsatisfactory due to a phenomenon we term Temporal Skipping, where the model skips self-attention layers to prevent output degradation. To address this, we propose an attention loss function and a query initialization method to enhance performance and interpretability. Additionally, we introduce a weight-score regression module designed to approximate the scoring patterns observed in human judgments and replace conventional single-score regression, improving the rationality of interpretability. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on three real-world, long-term AQA benchmarks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/dx199771/Interpretability-AQA

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting has shown impressive novel view synthesis results; nonetheless, it is vulnerable to dynamic objects polluting the input data of an otherwise static scene, so called distractors. Distractors have severe impact on the rendering quality as they get represented as view-dependent effects or result in floating artifacts. Our goal is to identify and ignore such distractors during the 3D Gaussian optimization to obtain a clean reconstruction. To this end, we take a self-supervised approach that looks at the image residuals during the optimization to determine areas that have likely been falsified by a distractor. In addition, we leverage a pretrained segmentation network to provide object awareness, enabling more accurate exclusion of distractors. This way, we obtain segmentation masks of distractors to effectively ignore them in the loss formulation. We demonstrate that our approach is robust to various distractors and strongly improves rendering quality on distractor-polluted scenes, improving PSNR by 1.86dB compared to 3D Gaussian Splatting.

- **Summary**: Assembly state recognition facilitates the execution of assembly procedures, offering feedback to enhance efficiency and minimize errors. However, recognizing assembly states poses challenges in scalability, since parts are frequently updated, and the robustness to execution errors remains underexplored. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an approach based on representation learning and the novel intermediate-state informed loss function modification (ISIL). ISIL leverages unlabeled transitions between states and demonstrates significant improvements in clustering and classification performance for all tested architectures and losses. Despite being trained exclusively on images without execution errors, thorough analysis on error states demonstrates that our approach accurately distinguishes between correct states and states with various types of execution errors. The integration of the proposed algorithm can offer meaningful assistance to workers and mitigate unexpected losses due to procedural mishaps in industrial settings.

- **Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) in Deep Learning (DL)-automated medical image segmentation helps preserving privacy by enabling collaborative model training without sharing patient data. However, FL faces challenges with data heterogeneity among institutions, leading to suboptimal global models. Integrating Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) in FL can enhance robustness by separating data into distinct representations. Existing DRL methods assume heterogeneity lies solely in style features, overlooking content-based variability like lesion size and shape. We propose FedGS, a novel FL aggregation method, to improve segmentation performance on small, under-represented targets while maintaining overall efficacy. FedGS demonstrates superior performance over FedAvg, particularly for small lesions, across PolypGen and LiTS datasets.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality images given a text prompt. However, ensuring the prompt-image alignment remains a considerable challenge, i.e., generating images that faithfully align with the prompt's semantics. Recent works attempt to improve the faithfulness by optimizing the latent code, which potentially could cause the latent code to go out-of-distribution and thus produce unrealistic images. In this paper, we propose FRAP, a simple, yet effective approach based on adaptively adjusting the per-token prompt weights to improve prompt-image alignment and authenticity of the generated images. We design an online algorithm to adaptively update each token's weight coefficient, which is achieved by minimizing a unified objective function that encourages object presence and the binding of object-modifier pairs. Through extensive evaluations, we show FRAP generates images with significantly higher prompt-image alignment to prompts from complex datasets, while having a lower average latency compared to recent latent code optimization methods, e.g., 4 seconds faster than D&B on the COCO-Subject dataset. Furthermore, through visual comparisons and evaluation on the CLIP-IQA-Real metric, we show that FRAP not only improves prompt-image alignment but also generates more authentic images with realistic appearances. We also explore combining FRAP with prompt rewriting LLM to recover their degraded prompt-image alignment, where we observe improvements in both prompt-image alignment and image quality.

- **Summary**: Adding color to black-and-white speaker videos automatically is a highly desirable technique. It is an artistic process that requires interactivity with humans for the best results. Many existing automatic video colorization systems provide little opportunity for the user to guide the colorization process. In this work, we introduce a novel automatic speaker video colorization system which provides controllability to the user while also maintaining high colorization quality relative to state-of-the-art techniques. We name this system ControlCol. ControlCol performs 3.5% better than the previous state-of-the-art DeOldify on the Grid and Lombard Grid datasets when PSNR, SSIM, FID and FVD are used as metrics. This result is also supported by our human evaluation, where in a head-to-head comparison, ControlCol is preferred 90% of the time to DeOldify. Example videos can be seen in the supplementary material.

By establishing correlations between variance in weight patterns and overall network performance, we investigate the varying (optimal and suboptimal) performances of various deep-learning models. Our empirical analysis extends across widely recognized datasets such as MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, and various deep learning models such as deep neural networks (DNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and vision transformer (ViT), enabling us to pinpoint characteristics of learnable parameters that correlate with successful networks. Through extensive experiments on the diverse architectures of deep learning models, we shed light on the critical factors that influence the functionality and efficiency of DNNs. Our findings reveal that successful networks, irrespective of datasets or models, are invariably similar to other successful networks in their converged weights statistics and distribution, while poor-performing networks vary in their weights. In addition, our research shows that the learnable parameters of widely varied deep learning models such as DNN, CNN, and ViT exhibit similar learning characteristics.

- **Summary**: We address a persistent challenge in text-to-image models: accurately generating a specified number of objects. Current models, which learn from image-text pairs, inherently struggle with counting, as training data cannot depict every possible number of objects for any given object. To solve this, we propose optimizing the generated image based on a counting loss derived from a counting model that aggregates an object\'s potential. Employing an out-of-the-box counting model is challenging for two reasons: first, the model requires a scaling hyperparameter for the potential aggregation that varies depending on the viewpoint of the objects, and second, classifier guidance techniques require modified models that operate on noisy intermediate diffusion steps. To address these challenges, we propose an iterated online training mode that improves the accuracy of inferred images while altering the text conditioning embedding and dynamically adjusting hyperparameters. Our method offers three key advantages: (i) it can consider non-derivable counting techniques based on detection models, (ii) it is a zero-shot plug-and-play solution facilitating rapid changes to the counting techniques and image generation methods, and (iii) the optimized counting token can be reused to generate accurate images without additional optimization. We evaluate the generation of various objects and show significant improvements in accuracy. The project page is available at https://ozzafar.github.io/count_token.

- **Summary**: Cross-modal medical image segmentation presents a significant challenge, as different imaging modalities produce images with varying resolutions, contrasts, and appearances of anatomical structures. We introduce compositionality as an inductive bias in a cross-modal segmentation network to improve segmentation performance and interpretability while reducing complexity. The proposed network is an end-to-end cross-modal segmentation framework that enforces compositionality on the learned representations using learnable von Mises-Fisher kernels. These kernels facilitate content-style disentanglement in the learned representations, resulting in compositional content representations that are inherently interpretable and effectively disentangle different anatomical structures. The experimental results demonstrate enhanced segmentation performance and reduced computational costs on multiple medical datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate the interpretability of the learned compositional features. Code and checkpoints will be publicly available at: https://github.com/Trustworthy-AI-UU-NKI/Cross-Modal-Segmentation.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant performance boost in various application domains. However, adopting them to deal with several sequentially encountered tasks has been challenging because finetuning a VLM on a task normally leads to reducing its generalization power and the capacity of learning new tasks as well as causing catastrophic forgetting on previously learned tasks. Enabling using VLMs in multimodal continual learning (CL) settings can help to address such scenarios. To improve generalization capacity and prevent catastrophic forgetting, we propose a novel prompt-based CL method for VLMs, namely $\textbf{Clu}$ster-based $\textbf{Mo}$dality Fusion Prompt (\textbf{CluMo}). We design a novel \textbf{Key-Key-Prompt} pair, where each prompt is associated with a visual prompt key and a textual prompt key. We adopt a two-stage training strategy. During the first stage, the single-modal keys are trained via $K$-means clustering algorithm to help select the best semantically matched prompt. During the second stage, the prompt keys are frozen, the selected prompt is attached to the input for training the VLM in the CL scenario. Experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance.

- **Summary**: This study proposes a novel approach to extract stylistic features of Jiehua: the utilization of the Fine-tuned Stable Diffusion Model with ControlNet (FSDMC) to refine depiction techniques from artists' Jiehua. The training data for FSDMC is based on the opensource Jiehua artist's work collected from the Internet, which were subsequently manually constructed in the format of (Original Image, Canny Edge Features, Text Prompt). By employing the optimal hyperparameters identified in this paper, it was observed FSDMC outperforms CycleGAN, another mainstream style transfer model. FSDMC achieves FID of 3.27 on the dataset and also surpasses CycleGAN in terms of expert evaluation. This not only demonstrates the model's high effectiveness in extracting Jiehua's style features, but also preserves the original pre-trained semantic information. The findings of this study suggest that the application of FSDMC with appropriate hyperparameters can enhance the efficacy of the Stable Diffusion Model in the field of traditional art style migration tasks, particularly within the context of Jiehua.

- **Summary**: Open-Vocab 3D Instance Segmentation methods (OV-3DIS) have recently demonstrated their ability to generalize to unseen objects. However, these methods still depend on predefined class names during testing, restricting the autonomy of agents. To mitigate this constraint, we propose a novel problem termed Open-Ended 3D Instance Segmentation (OE-3DIS), which eliminates the necessity for predefined class names during testing. Moreover, we contribute a comprehensive set of strong baselines, derived from OV-3DIS approaches and leveraging 2D Multimodal Large Language Models. To assess the performance of our OE-3DIS system, we introduce a novel Open-Ended score, evaluating both the semantic and geometric quality of predicted masks and their associated class names, alongside the standard AP score. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements over the baselines on the ScanNet200 and ScanNet++ datasets. Remarkably, our method surpasses the performance of Open3DIS, the current state-of-the-art method in OV-3DIS, even in the absence of ground-truth object class names.

- **Summary**: Geometric understanding is crucial for navigating and interacting with our environment. While large Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, deploying them in real-world scenarios necessitates a comparable geometric understanding in visual perception. In this work, we focus on the geometric comprehension of these models; specifically targeting the depths and heights of objects within a scene. Our observations reveal that, although VLMs excel in basic geometric properties perception such as shape and size, they encounter significant challenges in reasoning about the depth and height of objects. To address this, we introduce a suite of benchmark datasets encompassing Synthetic 2D, Synthetic 3D, and Real-World scenarios to rigorously evaluate these aspects. We benchmark 17 state-of-the-art VLMs using these datasets and find that they consistently struggle with both depth and height perception. Our key insights include detailed analyses of the shortcomings in depth and height reasoning capabilities of VLMs and the inherent bias present in these models. This study aims to pave the way for the development of VLMs with enhanced geometric understanding, crucial for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: We present MambaCSR, a simple but effective framework based on Mamba for the challenging compressed image super-resolution (CSR) task. Particularly, the scanning strategies of Mamba are crucial for effective contextual knowledge modeling in the restoration process despite it relying on selective state space modeling for all tokens. In this work, we propose an efficient dual-interleaved scanning paradigm (DIS) for CSR, which is composed of two scanning strategies: (i) hierarchical interleaved scanning is designed to comprehensively capture and utilize the most potential contextual information within an image by simultaneously taking advantage of the local window-based and sequential scanning methods; (ii) horizontal-to-vertical interleaved scanning is proposed to reduce the computational cost by leaving the redundancy between the scanning of different directions. To overcome the non-uniform compression artifacts, we also propose position-aligned cross-scale scanning to model multi-scale contextual information. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks have shown the great performance of our MambaCSR in the compressed image super-resolution task. The code will be soon available in~\textcolor{magenta}{\url{https://github.com/renyulin-f/MambaCSR}}.

- **Summary**: Introducing Group Equivariant Convolution (GConv) empowers models to explore symmetries hidden in visual data, improving their performance. However, in real-world scenarios, objects or scenes often exhibit perturbations of a symmetric system, specifically a deviation from a symmetric architecture, which can be characterized by a non-trivial action of a symmetry group, known as Symmetry-Breaking. Traditional GConv methods are limited by the strict operation rules in the group space, only ensuring features remain strictly equivariant under limited group transformations, making it difficult to adapt to Symmetry-Breaking or non-rigid transformations. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel Relaxed Rotation GConv (R2GConv) with our defined Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant group $\mathbf{R}_4$. Furthermore, we propose a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant Network (R2Net) as the backbone and further develop the Symmetry-Breaking Object Detector (SBDet) for 2D object detection built upon it. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed R2GConv in natural image classification tasks, and SBDet achieves excellent performance in object detection tasks with improved generalization capabilities and robustness.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel loss function aimed at optimizing the binary flare prediction problem by embedding the intrinsic ordinal flare characteristics into the binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss function. This modification is intended to provide the model with better guidance based on the ordinal characteristics of the data and improve the overall performance of the models. For our experiments, we employ a ResNet34-based model with transfer learning to predict $\geq$M-class flares by utilizing the shape-based features of magnetograms of active region (AR) patches spanning from $-$90$^{\circ}$ to $+$90$^{\circ}$ of solar longitude as our input data. We use a composite skill score (CSS) as our evaluation metric, which is calculated as the geometric mean of the True Skill Score (TSS) and the Heidke Skill Score (HSS) to rank and compare our models' performance. The primary contributions of this work are as follows: (i) We introduce a novel approach to encode ordinality into a binary loss function showing an application to solar flare prediction, (ii) We enhance solar flare forecasting by enabling flare predictions for each AR across the entire solar disk, without any longitudinal restrictions, and evaluate and compare performance. (iii) Our candidate model, optimized with the proposed loss function, shows an improvement of $\sim$7%, $\sim$4%, and $\sim$3% for AR patches within $\pm$30$^\circ$, $\pm$60$^\circ$, and $\pm$90$^\circ$ of solar longitude, respectively in terms of CSS, when compared with standard BCE. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to issue flare forecasts for ARs in near-limb regions (regions between $\pm$60$^{\circ}$ to $\pm$90$^{\circ}$) with a CSS=0.34 (TSS=0.50 and HSS=0.23), expanding the scope of AR-based models for solar flare prediction. This advances the reliability of solar flare forecasts, leading to more effective prediction capabilities.

- **Summary**: Video Shadow Detection (VSD) aims to detect the shadow masks with frame sequence. Existing works suffer from inefficient temporal learning. Moreover, few works address the VSD problem by considering the characteristic (i.e., boundary) of shadow. Motivated by this, we propose a Timeline and Boundary Guided Diffusion (TBGDiff) network for VSD where we take account of the past-future temporal guidance and boundary information jointly. In detail, we design a Dual Scale Aggregation (DSA) module for better temporal understanding by rethinking the affinity of the long-term and short-term frames for the clipped video. Next, we introduce Shadow Boundary Aware Attention (SBAA) to utilize the edge contexts for capturing the characteristics of shadows. Moreover, we are the first to introduce the Diffusion model for VSD in which we explore a Space-Time Encoded Embedding (STEE) to inject the temporal guidance for Diffusion to conduct shadow detection. Benefiting from these designs, our model can not only capture the temporal information but also the shadow property. Extensive experiments show that the performance of our approach overtakes the state-of-the-art methods, verifying the effectiveness of our components. We release the codes, weights, and results at \url{https://github.com/haipengzhou856/TBGDiff}.

- **Summary**: Domain-generalized nuclei segmentation refers to the generalizability of models to unseen domains based on knowledge learned from source domains and is challenged by various image conditions, cell types, and stain strategies. Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has made great success in universal image segmentation by interactive prompt modes (e.g., point and box). Despite its strengths, the original SAM presents limited adaptation to medical images. Moreover, SAM requires providing manual bounding box prompts for each object to produce satisfactory segmentation masks, so it is laborious in nuclei segmentation scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-generalizable framework for nuclei image segmentation, abbreviated to NuSegDG. Specifically, we first devise a Heterogeneous Space Adapter (HS-Adapter) to learn multi-dimensional feature representations of different nuclei domains by injecting a small number of trainable parameters into the image encoder of SAM. To alleviate the labor-intensive requirement of manual prompts, we introduce a Gaussian-Kernel Prompt Encoder (GKP-Encoder) to generate density maps driven by a single point, which guides segmentation predictions by mixing position prompts and semantic prompts. Furthermore, we present a Two-Stage Mask Decoder (TSM-Decoder) to effectively convert semantic masks to instance maps without the manual demand for morphological shape refinement. Based on our experimental evaluations, the proposed NuSegDG demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in nuclei instance segmentation, exhibiting superior domain generalization capabilities.

- **Summary**: Current video generation models excel at creating short, realistic clips, but struggle with longer, multi-scene videos. We introduce \texttt{DreamFactory}, an LLM-based framework that tackles this challenge. \texttt{DreamFactory} leverages multi-agent collaboration principles and a Key Frames Iteration Design Method to ensure consistency and style across long videos. It utilizes Chain of Thought (COT) to address uncertainties inherent in large language models. \texttt{DreamFactory} generates long, stylistically coherent, and complex videos. Evaluating these long-form videos presents a challenge. We propose novel metrics such as Cross-Scene Face Distance Score and Cross-Scene Style Consistency Score. To further research in this area, we contribute the Multi-Scene Videos Dataset containing over 150 human-rated videos.

- **Summary**: In the realm of multimodal research, numerous studies leverage substantial image-text pairs to conduct modal alignment learning, transforming Large Language Models (LLMs) into Multimodal LLMs and excelling in a variety of visual-language tasks. The prevailing methodologies primarily fall into two categories: self-attention-based and cross-attention-based methods. While self-attention-based methods offer superior data efficiency due to their simple MLP architecture, they often suffer from lower computational efficiency due to concatenating visual and textual tokens as input for LLM. Conversely, cross-attention-based methods, although less data-efficient due to additional learnable parameters, exhibit higher computational efficiency by avoiding long sequence input for LLM. To address these trade-offs, we introduce the Data-Efficient and Compute-Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model (EE-MLLM). Without introducing additional modules or learnable parameters, EE-MLLM achieves both data and compute efficiency. Specifically, we modify the original self-attention mechanism in MLLM to a composite attention mechanism. This mechanism has two key characteristics: 1) Eliminating the computational overhead of self-attention within visual tokens to achieve compute efficiency, and 2) Reusing the weights on each layer of LLM to facilitate effective modality alignment between vision and language for data efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of EE-MLLM across a range of benchmarks, including general-purpose datasets like MMBench and SeedBench, as well as fine-grained tasks such as TextVQA and DocVQA.

- **Summary**: Traditional visual storytelling is complex, requiring specialized knowledge and substantial resources, yet often constrained by human creativity and creation precision. While Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance visual storytelling, current approaches often limit themselves to 2D visuals or oversimplify stories through motion synthesis and behavioral simulation, failing to create comprehensive, multi-dimensional narratives. To this end, we present Story3D-Agent, a pioneering approach that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to transform provided narratives into 3D-rendered visualizations. By integrating procedural modeling, our approach enables precise control over multi-character actions and motions, as well as diverse decorative elements, ensuring the long-range and dynamic 3D representation. Furthermore, our method supports narrative extension through logical reasoning, ensuring that generated content remains consistent with existing conditions. We have thoroughly evaluated our Story3D-Agent to validate its effectiveness, offering a basic framework to advance 3D story representation.

- **Summary**: Learning from demonstrations has shown to be an effective approach to robotic manipulation, especially with the recently collected large-scale robot data with teleoperation systems. Building an efficient teleoperation system across diverse robot platforms has become more crucial than ever. However, there is a notable lack of cost-effective and user-friendly teleoperation systems for different end-effectors, e.g., anthropomorphic robot hands and grippers, that can operate across multiple platforms. To address this issue, we develop ACE, a cross-platform visual-exoskeleton system for low-cost dexterous teleoperation. Our system utilizes a hand-facing camera to capture 3D hand poses and an exoskeleton mounted on a portable base, enabling accurate real-time capture of both finger and wrist poses. Compared to previous systems, which often require hardware customization according to different robots, our single system can generalize to humanoid hands, arm-hands, arm-gripper, and quadruped-gripper systems with high-precision teleoperation. This enables imitation learning for complex manipulation tasks on diverse platforms.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Models have emerged as powerful generative models for high-quality image synthesis, with many subsequent image editing techniques based on them. However, the ease of text-based image editing introduces significant risks, such as malicious editing for scams or intellectual property infringement. Previous works have attempted to safeguard images from diffusion-based editing by adding imperceptible perturbations. These methods are costly and specifically target prevalent Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), while Pixel-domain Diffusion Models (PDMs) remain largely unexplored and robust against such attacks. Our work addresses this gap by proposing a novel attacking framework with a feature representation attack loss that exploits vulnerabilities in denoising UNets and a latent optimization strategy to enhance the naturalness of protected images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in attacking dominant PDM-based editing methods (e.g., SDEdit) while maintaining reasonable protection fidelity and robustness against common defense methods. Additionally, our framework is extensible to LDMs, achieving comparable performance to existing approaches.

- **Summary**: Embodied tasks require the agent to fully understand 3D scenes simultaneously with its exploration, so an online, real-time, fine-grained and highly-generalized 3D perception model is desperately needed. Since high-quality 3D data is limited, directly training such a model in 3D is almost infeasible. Meanwhile, vision foundation models (VFM) has revolutionized the field of 2D computer vision with superior performance, which makes the use of VFM to assist embodied 3D perception a promising direction. However, most existing VFM-assisted 3D perception methods are either offline or too slow that cannot be applied in practical embodied tasks. In this paper, we aim to leverage Segment Anything Model (SAM) for real-time 3D instance segmentation in an online setting. This is a challenging problem since future frames are not available in the input streaming RGB-D video, and an instance may be observed in several frames so object matching between frames is required. To address these challenges, we first propose a geometric-aware query lifting module to represent the 2D masks generated by SAM by 3D-aware queries, which is then iteratively refined by a dual-level query decoder. In this way, the 2D masks are transferred to fine-grained shapes on 3D point clouds. Benefit from the query representation for 3D masks, we can compute the similarity matrix between the 3D masks from different views by efficient matrix operation, which enables real-time inference. Experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, SceneNN and 3RScan show our method achieves leading performance even compared with offline methods. Our method also demonstrates great generalization ability in several zero-shot dataset transferring experiments and show great potential in open-vocabulary and data-efficient setting. Code and demo are available at https://xuxw98.github.io/ESAM/, with only one RTX 3090 GPU required for training and evaluation.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable perceptual and reasoning abilities, typically comprising a Vision Encoder, an Adapter, and a Large Language Model (LLM). The adapter serves as the critical bridge between the visual and language components. However, training adapters with image-level supervision often results in significant misalignment, undermining the LLMs' capabilities and limiting the potential of Multimodal LLMs. To address this, we introduce Supervised Embedding Alignment (SEA), a token-level alignment method that leverages vision-language pre-trained models, such as CLIP, to align visual tokens with the LLM's embedding space through contrastive learning. This approach ensures a more coherent integration of visual and language representations, enhancing the performance and interpretability of multimodal LLMs while preserving their inherent capabilities. Extensive experiments show that SEA effectively improves MLLMs, particularly for smaller models, without adding extra data or inference computation. SEA also lays the groundwork for developing more general and adaptable solutions to enhance multimodal systems.

- **Summary**: We introduce Synthetic Playground (SynPlay), a new synthetic human dataset that aims to bring out the diversity of human appearance in the real world. We focus on two factors to achieve a level of diversity that has not yet been seen in previous works: i) realistic human motions and poses and ii) multiple camera viewpoints towards human instances. We first use a game engine and its library-provided elementary motions to create games where virtual players can take less-constrained and natural movements while following the game rules (i.e., rule-guided motion design as opposed to detail-guided design). We then augment the elementary motions with real human motions captured with a motion capture device. To render various human appearances in the games from multiple viewpoints, we use seven virtual cameras encompassing the ground and aerial views, capturing abundant aerial-vs-ground and dynamic-vs-static attributes of the scene. Through extensive and carefully-designed experiments, we show that using SynPlay in model training leads to enhanced accuracy over existing synthetic datasets for human detection and segmentation. The benefit of SynPlay becomes even greater for tasks in the data-scarce regime, such as few-shot and cross-domain learning tasks. These results clearly demonstrate that SynPlay can be used as an essential dataset with rich attributes of complex human appearances and poses suitable for model pretraining. SynPlay dataset comprising over 73k images and 6.5M human instances, is available for download at https://synplaydataset.github.io/.

- **Summary**: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have exhibited proficiencies across many visual tasks. Although numerous well-known benchmarks exist to evaluate model performance, they increasingly have insufficient headroom. As such, there is a pressing need for a new generation of benchmarks challenging enough for the next generation of LMMs. One area that LMMs show potential is graph analysis, specifically, the tasks an analyst might typically perform when interpreting figures such as estimating the mean, intercepts or correlations of functions and data series. In this work, we introduce GRAB, a graph analysis benchmark, fit for current and future frontier LMMs. Our benchmark is entirely synthetic, ensuring high-quality, noise-free questions. GRAB is comprised of 2170 questions, covering four tasks and 23 graph properties. We evaluate 20 LMMs on GRAB, finding it to be a challenging benchmark, with the highest performing model attaining a score of just 21.7%. Finally, we conduct various ablations to investigate where the models succeed and struggle. We release GRAB to encourage progress in this important, growing domain.
