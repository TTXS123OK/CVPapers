- **Summary**: Domain adaptation is an active area of research driven by the growing demand for robust machine learning models that perform well on real-world data. Adversarial learning for deep neural networks (DNNs) has emerged as a promising approach to improving generalization ability, particularly for image classification. In this paper, we implement a specific adversarial learning technique known as Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA) and replicate digit classification experiments from the original ADDA paper. We extend their findings by examining a broader range of domain shifts and provide a detailed analysis of in-domain classification accuracy post-ADDA. Our results demonstrate that ADDA significantly improves accuracy across certain domain shifts with minimal impact on in-domain performance. Furthermore, we provide qualitative analysis and propose potential explanations for ADDA's limitations in less successful domain shifts. Code is at https://github.com/eugenechoi2004/COS429_FINAL .

- **Summary**: This study is based on the ICASSP 2025 Signal Processing Grand Challenge's Accelerometer-Based Person-in-Bed Detection Challenge, which aims to determine bed occupancy using accelerometer signals. The task is divided into two tracks: "in bed" and "not in bed" segmented detection, and streaming detection, facing challenges such as individual differences, posture variations, and external disturbances. We propose a spectral-temporal fusion-based feature representation method with mixup data augmentation, and adopt Intersection over Union (IoU) loss to optimize detection accuracy. In the two tracks, our method achieved outstanding results of 100.00% and 95.55% in detection scores, securing first place and third place, respectively.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown satisfactory effects in many autonomous driving tasks. In this paper, MLLMs are utilized to solve joint semantic scene understanding and risk localization tasks, while only relying on front-view images. In the proposed MLLM-SUL framework, a dual-branch visual encoder is first designed to extract features from two resolutions, and rich visual information is conducive to the language model describing risk objects of different sizes accurately. Then for the language generation, LLaMA model is fine-tuned to predict scene descriptions, containing the type of driving scenario, actions of risk objects, and driving intentions and suggestions of ego-vehicle. Ultimately, a transformer-based network incorporating a regression token is trained to locate the risk objects. Extensive experiments on the existing DRAMA-ROLISP dataset and the extended DRAMA-SRIS dataset demonstrate that our method is efficient, surpassing many state-of-the-art image-based and video-based methods. Specifically, our method achieves 80.1% BLEU-1 score and 298.5% CIDEr score in the scene understanding task, and 59.6% accuracy in the localization task.

- **Summary**: Image matching for both cross-view and cross-modality plays a critical role in multimodal perception. In practice, the modality gap caused by different imaging systems/styles poses great challenges to the matching task. Existing works try to extract invariant features for specific modalities and train on limited datasets, showing poor generalization. In this paper, we present MINIMA, a unified image matching framework for multiple cross-modal cases. Without pursuing fancy modules, our MINIMA aims to enhance universal performance from the perspective of data scaling up. For such purpose, we propose a simple yet effective data engine that can freely produce a large dataset containing multiple modalities, rich scenarios, and accurate matching labels. Specifically, we scale up the modalities from cheap but rich RGB-only matching data, by means of generative models. Under this setting, the matching labels and rich diversity of the RGB dataset are well inherited by the generated multimodal data. Benefiting from this, we construct MD-syn, a new comprehensive dataset that fills the data gap for general multimodal image matching. With MD-syn, we can directly train any advanced matching pipeline on randomly selected modality pairs to obtain cross-modal ability. Extensive experiments on in-domain and zero-shot matching tasks, including $19$ cross-modal cases, demonstrate that our MINIMA can significantly outperform the baselines and even surpass modality-specific methods.

- **Summary**: Consistency Models (CMs) have significantly accelerated the sampling process in diffusion models, yielding impressive results in synthesizing high-resolution images. To explore and extend these advancements to point-cloud-based 3D shape generation, we propose a novel Multi-scale Latent Point Consistency Model (MLPCM). Our MLPCM follows a latent diffusion framework and introduces hierarchical levels of latent representations, ranging from point-level to super-point levels, each corresponding to a different spatial resolution. We design a multi-scale latent integration module along with 3D spatial attention to effectively denoise the point-level latent representations conditioned on those from multiple super-point levels. Additionally, we propose a latent consistency model, learned through consistency distillation, that compresses the prior into a one-step generator. This significantly improves sampling efficiency while preserving the performance of the original teacher model. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks ShapeNet and ShapeNet-Vol demonstrate that MLPCM achieves a 100x speedup in the generation process, while surpassing state-of-the-art diffusion models in terms of both shape quality and diversity.

- **Summary**: Deep hashing has been widely used for large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search due to its storage and search efficiency. However, existing deep hashing methods predominantly rely on abundant training data, leaving the more challenging scenario of low-resource adaptation for deep hashing relatively underexplored. This setting involves adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks with only an extremely small number of training samples available. Our preliminary benchmarks reveal that current methods suffer significant performance degradation due to the distribution shift caused by limited training samples. To address these challenges, we introduce Class-Calibration LoRA (CLoRA), a novel plug-and-play approach that dynamically constructs low-rank adaptation matrices by leveraging class-level textual knowledge embeddings. CLoRA effectively incorporates prior class knowledge as anchors, enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning while maintaining the original data distribution. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Guided Discrete Optimization (KIDDO), a framework to utilize class knowledge to compensate for the scarcity of visual information and enhance the discriminability of hash codes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method, Knowledge- Anchored Low-Resource Adaptation Hashing (KALAHash), significantly boosts retrieval performance and achieves a 4x data efficiency in low-resource scenarios.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised temporal action localization (WS-TAL) is a task of targeting at localizing complete action instances and categorizing them with video-level labels. Action-background ambiguity, primarily caused by background noise resulting from aggregation and intra-action variation, is a significant challenge for existing WS-TAL methods. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid multi-head attention (HMHA) module and generalized uncertainty-based evidential fusion (GUEF) module to address the problem. The proposed HMHA effectively enhances RGB and optical flow features by filtering redundant information and adjusting their feature distribution to better align with the WS-TAL task. Additionally, the proposed GUEF adaptively eliminates the interference of background noise by fusing snippet-level evidences to refine uncertainty measurement and select superior foreground feature information, which enables the model to concentrate on integral action instances to achieve better action localization and classification performance. Experimental results conducted on the THUMOS14 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a method for long-term action anticipation (LTA), the task of predicting action labels and their duration in a video given the observation of an initial untrimmed video interval. We build on an encoder-decoder architecture with parallel decoding and make two key contributions. First, we introduce a bi-directional action context regularizer module on the top of the decoder that ensures temporal context coherence in temporally adjacent segments. Second, we learn from classified segments a transition matrix that models the probability of transitioning from one action to another and the sequence is optimized globally over the full prediction interval. In addition, we use a specialized encoder for the task of action segmentation to increase the quality of the predictions in the observation interval at inference time, leading to a better understanding of the past. We validate our methods on four benchmark datasets for LTA, the EpicKitchen-55, EGTEA+, 50Salads and Breakfast demonstrating superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods, including probabilistic models and also those based on Large Language Models, that assume trimmed video as input. The code will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Capturing feature information effectively is of great importance in the field of computer vision. With the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), concepts like residual connection and multiple scales promote continual performance gains in diverse deep learning vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN architecture that it consists of residual feature-reutilization inceptions (ResFRI) or split-residual feature-reutilization inceptions (Split-ResFRI). And it is composed of four convolutional combinations of different structures connected by specially designed information interaction passages, which are utilized to extract multi-scale feature information and effectively increase the receptive field of the model. Moreover, according to the network structure designed above, Split-ResFRI can adjust the segmentation ratio of the input information, thereby reducing the number of parameters and guaranteeing the model performance. Specifically, in experiments based on popular vision datasets, such as CIFAR10 ($97.94$\%), CIFAR100 ($85.91$\%) and Tiny Imagenet ($70.54$\%), we obtain state-of-the-art results compared with other modern models under the premise that the model size is approximate and no additional data is used.

- **Summary**: The evolution of colour vision is captivating, as it reveals the adaptive strategies of extinct species while simultaneously inspiring innovations in modern imaging technology. In this study, we present a simplified model of visual transduction in the retina, introducing a novel opsin layer. We quantify evolutionary pressures by measuring machine vision recognition accuracy on colour images shaped by specific opsins. Building on this, we develop an evolutionary conservation optimisation algorithm to reconstruct the spectral sensitivity of opsins, enabling mutation-driven adaptations to to more effectively spot fruits or predators. This model condenses millions of years of evolution within seconds on GPU, providing an experimental framework to test long-standing hypotheses in evolutionary biology , such as vision of early mammals, primate trichromacy from gene duplication, retention of colour blindness, blue-shift of fish rod and multiple rod opsins with bioluminescence. Moreover, the model enables speculative explorations of hypothetical species, such as organisms with eyes adapted to the conditions on Mars. Our findings suggest a minimalist yet effective approach to task-specific camera filter design, optimising the spectral response function to meet application-driven demands. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Generative AI has transformed the animation industry. Several models have been developed for image-to-image translation, particularly focusing on converting real-world images into anime through unpaired translation. Scenimefy, a notable approach utilizing contrastive learning, achieves high fidelity anime scene translation by addressing limited paired data through semi-supervised training. However, it faces limitations due to its reliance on paired data from a fine-tuned StyleGAN in the anime domain, often producing low-quality datasets. Additionally, Scenimefy's high parameter architecture presents opportunities for computational optimization. This research introduces NijiGAN, a novel model incorporating Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NeuralODEs), which offer unique advantages in continuous transformation modeling compared to traditional residual networks. NijiGAN successfully transforms real-world scenes into high fidelity anime visuals using half of Scenimefy's parameters. It employs pseudo-paired data generated through Scenimefy for supervised training, eliminating dependence on low-quality paired data and improving the training process. Our comprehensive evaluation includes ablation studies, qualitative, and quantitative analysis comparing NijiGAN to similar models. The testing results demonstrate that NijiGAN produces higher-quality images compared to AnimeGAN, as evidenced by a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 2.192, it surpasses AnimeGAN's MOS of 2.160. Furthermore, our model achieved a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score of 58.71, outperforming Scenimefy's FID score of 60.32. These results demonstrate that NijiGAN achieves competitive performance against existing state-of-the-arts, especially Scenimefy as the baseline model.

- **Summary**: Instance features in images exhibit spurious correlations with background features, affecting the training process of deep neural classifiers. This leads to insufficient attention to instance features by the classifier, resulting in erroneous classification outcomes. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation method called Spurious Correlations Guided Synthesis (SCGS) that mitigates spurious correlations through image generation model. This approach does not require expensive spurious attribute (group) labels for the training data and can be widely applied to other debiasing methods. Specifically, SCGS first identifies the incorrect attention regions of a pre-trained classifier on the training images, and then uses an image generation model to generate new training data based on these incorrect attended regions. SCGS increases the diversity and scale of the dataset to reduce the impact of spurious correlations on classifiers. Changes in the classifier's attention regions and experimental results on three different domain datasets demonstrate that this method is effective in reducing the classifier's reliance on spurious correlations.

- **Summary**: Vision-centric autonomous driving systems require diverse data for robust training and evaluation, which can be augmented by manipulating object positions and appearances within existing scene captures. While recent advancements in diffusion models have shown promise in video editing, their application to object manipulation in driving scenarios remains challenging due to imprecise positional control and difficulties in preserving high-fidelity object appearances. To address these challenges in position and appearance control, we introduce DriveEditor, a diffusion-based framework for object editing in driving videos. DriveEditor offers a unified framework for comprehensive object editing operations, including repositioning, replacement, deletion, and insertion. These diverse manipulations are all achieved through a shared set of varying inputs, processed by identical position control and appearance maintenance modules. The position control module projects the given 3D bounding box while preserving depth information and hierarchically injects it into the diffusion process, enabling precise control over object position and orientation. The appearance maintenance module preserves consistent attributes with a single reference image by employing a three-tiered approach: low-level detail preservation, high-level semantic maintenance, and the integration of 3D priors from a novel view synthesis model. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate DriveEditor's exceptional fidelity and controllability in generating diverse driving scene edits, as well as its remarkable ability to facilitate downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: We address the challenge of single-image de-raining, a task that involves recovering rain-free background information from a single rain image. While recent advancements have utilized real-world time-lapse data for training, enabling the estimation of consistent backgrounds and realistic rain streaks, these methods often suffer from computational and memory consumption, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel solution: the Rain Streak Prototype Unit (RsPU). The RsPU efficiently encodes rain streak-relevant features as real-time prototypes derived from time-lapse data, eliminating the need for excessive memory resources. Our de-raining network combines encoder-decoder networks with the RsPU, allowing us to learn and encapsulate diverse rain streak-relevant features as concise prototypes, employing an attention-based approach. To ensure the effectiveness of our approach, we propose a feature prototype loss encompassing cohesion and divergence components. This loss function captures both the compactness and diversity aspects of the prototypical rain streak features within the RsPU. Our method evaluates various de-raining benchmarks, accompanied by comprehensive ablation studies. We show that it can achieve competitive results in various rain images compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Objective: To develop a novel deep learning framework for the automated segmentation of colonic polyps in colonoscopy images, overcoming the limitations of current approaches in preserving precise polyp boundaries, incorporating multi-scale features, and modeling spatial dependencies that accurately reflect the intricate and diverse morphology of polyps. Methods: To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multiscale Network with Spatial-enhanced Attention (MNet-SAt) for polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images. This framework incorporates four key modules: Edge-Guided Feature Enrichment (EGFE) preserves edge information for improved boundary quality; Multi-Scale Feature Aggregator (MSFA) extracts and aggregates multi-scale features across channel spatial dimensions, focusing on salient regions; Spatial-Enhanced Attention (SEAt) captures spatial-aware global dependencies within the multi-scale aggregated features, emphasizing the region of interest; and Channel-Enhanced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (CE-ASPP) resamples and recalibrates attentive features across scales. Results: We evaluated MNet-SAt on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets, achieving Dice Similarity Coefficients of 96.61% and 98.60%, respectively. Conclusion: Both quantitative (DSC) and qualitative assessments highlight MNet-SAt's superior performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods. Significance: MNet-SAt's high accuracy in polyp segmentation holds promise for improving clinical workflows in early polyp detection and more effective treatment, contributing to reduced colorectal cancer mortality rates.

- **Summary**: Helmet detection is crucial for advancing protection levels in public road traffic dynamics. This problem statement translates to an object detection task. Therefore, this paper compares recent You Only Look Once (YOLO) models in the context of helmet detection in terms of reliability and computational load. Specifically, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and the newly released YOLOv11 have been used. Besides, a modified architectural pipeline that remarkably improves the overall performance has been proposed in this manuscript. This hybridized YOLO model (h-YOLO) has been pitted against the independent models for analysis that proves h-YOLO is preferable for helmet detection over plain YOLO models. The models were tested using a range of standard object detection benchmarks such as recall, precision, and mAP (Mean Average Precision). In addition, training and testing times were recorded to provide the overall scope of the models in a real-time detection scenario.

- **Summary**: In everyday life, photographs taken with a camera often suffer from motion blur due to hand vibrations or sudden movements. This phenomenon can significantly detract from the quality of the images captured, making it an interesting challenge to develop a deep learning model that utilizes the principles of adversarial networks to restore clarity to these blurred pixels. In this project, we will focus on leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to effectively deblur images affected by motion blur. A GAN-based Tensorflow model is defined, training and evaluating by GoPro dataset which comprises paired street view images featuring both clear and blurred versions. This adversarial training process between Discriminator and Generator helps to produce increasingly realistic images over time. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) are the two evaluation metrics used to provide quantitative measures of image quality, allowing us to evaluate the effectiveness of the deblurring process. Mean PSNR in 29.1644 and mean SSIM in 0.7459 with average 4.6921 seconds deblurring time are achieved in this project. The blurry pixels are sharper in the output of GAN model shows a good image restoration effect in real world applications.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we explore the potential of Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) technique for recovering the underlying 3D scene structure from a single temporal compressed image. SCI is a cost-effective method that enables the recording of high-dimensional data, such as hyperspectral or temporal information, into a single image using low-cost 2D imaging sensors. To achieve this, a series of specially designed 2D masks are usually employed, reducing storage and transmission requirements and offering potential privacy protection. Inspired by this, we take one step further to recover the encoded 3D scene information leveraging powerful 3D scene representation capabilities of neural radiance fields (NeRF). Specifically, we propose SCINeRF, in which we formulate the physical imaging process of SCI as part of the training of NeRF, allowing us to exploit its impressive performance in capturing complex scene structures. In addition, we further integrate the popular 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework and propose SCISplat to improve 3D scene reconstruction quality and training/rendering speed by explicitly optimizing point clouds into 3D Gaussian representations. To assess the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive evaluations using both synthetic data and real data captured by our SCI system. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in terms of image reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Moreover, our method also exhibits the ability to render high frame-rate multi-view consistent images in real time by leveraging SCI and the rendering capabilities of 3DGS.

- **Summary**: Brain decoding aims to reconstruct original stimuli from fMRI signals, providing insights into interpreting mental content. Current approaches rely heavily on subject-specific models due to the complex brain processing mechanisms and the variations in fMRI signals across individuals. Therefore, these methods greatly limit the generalization of models and fail to capture cross-subject commonalities. To address this, we present UniBrain, a unified brain decoding model that requires no subject-specific parameters. Our approach includes a group-based extractor to handle variable fMRI signal lengths, a mutual assistance embedder to capture cross-subject commonalities, and a bilevel feature alignment scheme for extracting subject-invariant features. We validate our UniBrain on the brain decoding benchmark, achieving comparable performance to current state-of-the-art subject-specific models with extremely fewer parameters. We also propose a generalization benchmark to encourage the community to emphasize cross-subject commonalities for more general brain decoding.

- **Summary**: Live animation has gained immense popularity for enhancing online engagement, yet achieving high-quality, real-time, and stable animation with diffusion models remains challenging, especially on consumer-grade GPUs. Existing methods struggle with generating long, consistent video streams efficiently, often being limited by latency issues and degraded visual quality over extended periods. In this paper, we introduce RAIN, a pipeline solution capable of animating infinite video streams in real-time with low latency using a single RTX 4090 GPU. The core idea of RAIN is to efficiently compute frame-token attention across different noise levels and long time-intervals while simultaneously denoising a significantly larger number of frame-tokens than previous stream-based methods. This design allows RAIN to generate video frames with much shorter latency and faster speed, while maintaining long-range attention over extended video streams, resulting in enhanced continuity and consistency. Consequently, a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned with RAIN in just a few epochs can produce video streams in real-time and low latency without much compromise in quality or consistency, up to infinite long. Despite its advanced capabilities, the RAIN only introduces a few additional 1D attention blocks, imposing minimal additional burden. Experiments in benchmark datasets and generating super-long videos demonstrating that RAIN can animate characters in real-time with much better quality, accuracy, and consistency than competitors while costing less latency. All code and models will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Multi-label classification is a challenging task in pattern recognition. Many deep learning methods have been proposed and largely enhanced classification performance. However, most of the existing sophisticated methods ignore context in the models' learning process. Since context may provide additional cues to the learned models, it may significantly boost classification performances. In this work, we make full use of context information (namely geometrical structure of images) in order to learn better context-aware similarities (a.k.a. kernels) between images. We reformulate context-aware kernel design as a feed-forward network that outputs explicit kernel mapping features. Our obtained context-aware kernel network further leverages multiple orders of patch neighbors within different distances, resulting into a more discriminating Deep Multi-order Context-aware Kernel Network (DMCKN) for multi-label classification. We evaluate the proposed method on the challenging Corel5K and NUS-WIDE benchmarks, and empirical results show that our method obtains competitive performances against the related state-of-the-art, and both quantitative and qualitative performances corroborate its effectiveness and superiority for multi-label image classification.

- **Summary**: Recently, deep learning based methods have revolutionized remote sensing image segmentation. However, these methods usually rely on a pre-defined semantic class set, thus needing additional image annotation and model training when adapting to new classes. More importantly, they are unable to segment arbitrary semantic classes. In this work, we introduce Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation (OVRSISS), which aims to segment arbitrary semantic classes in remote sensing images. To address the lack of OVRSISS datasets, we develop LandDiscover50K, a comprehensive dataset of 51,846 images covering 40 diverse semantic classes. In addition, we propose a novel framework named GSNet that integrates domain priors from special remote sensing models and versatile capabilities of general vision-language models. Technically, GSNet consists of a Dual-Stream Image Encoder (DSIE), a Query-Guided Feature Fusion (QGFF), and a Residual Information Preservation Decoder (RIPD). DSIE first captures comprehensive features from both special models and general models in dual streams. Then, with the guidance of variable vocabularies, QGFF integrates specialist and generalist features, enabling them to complement each other. Finally, RIPD is proposed to aggregate multi-source features for more accurate mask predictions. Experiments show that our method outperforms other methods by a large margin, and our proposed LandDiscover50K improves the performance of OVRSISS methods. The proposed dataset and method will be made publicly available at https://github.com/yecy749/GSNet.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in scene text spotting have focused on end-to-end methodologies that heavily rely on precise location annotations, which are often costly and labor-intensive to procure. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach that leverages only transcription annotations for training text spotting models, substantially reducing the dependency on elaborate annotation processes. Our methodology employs a query-based paradigm that facilitates the learning of implicit location features through the interaction between text queries and image embeddings. These features are later refined during the text recognition phase using an attention activation map. Addressing the challenges associated with training a weakly-supervised model from scratch, we implement a circular curriculum learning strategy to enhance model convergence. Additionally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine cross-attention localization mechanism for more accurate text instance localization. Notably, our framework supports audio-based annotation, which significantly diminishes annotation time and provides an inclusive alternative for individuals with disabilities. Our approach achieves competitive performance against existing benchmarks, demonstrating that high accuracy in text spotting can be attained without extensive location annotations.

- **Summary**: Recent successes in autoregressive (AR) generation models, such as the GPT series in natural language processing, have motivated efforts to replicate this success in visual tasks. Some works attempt to extend this approach to autonomous driving by building video-based world models capable of generating realistic future video sequences and predicting ego states. However, prior works tend to produce unsatisfactory results, as the classic GPT framework is designed to handle 1D contextual information, such as text, and lacks the inherent ability to model the spatial and temporal dynamics essential for video generation. In this paper, we present DrivingWorld, a GPT-style world model for autonomous driving, featuring several spatial-temporal fusion mechanisms. This design enables effective modeling of both spatial and temporal dynamics, facilitating high-fidelity, long-duration video generation. Specifically, we propose a next-state prediction strategy to model temporal coherence between consecutive frames and apply a next-token prediction strategy to capture spatial information within each frame. To further enhance generalization ability, we propose a novel masking strategy and reweighting strategy for token prediction to mitigate long-term drifting issues and enable precise control. Our work demonstrates the ability to produce high-fidelity and consistent video clips of over 40 seconds in duration, which is over 2 times longer than state-of-the-art driving world models. Experiments show that, in contrast to prior works, our method achieves superior visual quality and significantly more accurate controllable future video generation.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled a variety of real-world applications. The large parameter size of VLMs brings large memory and computation overhead which poses significant challenges for deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective technique to reduce the memory and computation overhead. Existing PTQ methods mainly focus on large language models (LLMs), without considering the differences across other modalities. In this paper, we discover that there is a significant difference in sensitivity between language and vision tokens in large VLMs. Therefore, treating tokens from different modalities equally, as in existing PTQ methods, may over-emphasize the insensitive modalities, leading to significant accuracy loss. To deal with the above issue, we propose a simple yet effective method, Modality-Balanced Quantization (MBQ), for large VLMs. Specifically, MBQ incorporates the different sensitivities across modalities during the calibration process to minimize the reconstruction loss for better quantization parameters. Extensive experiments show that MBQ can significantly improve task accuracy by up to 4.4% and 11.6% under W3 and W4A8 quantization for 7B to 70B VLMs, compared to SOTA baselines. Additionally, we implement a W3 GPU kernel that fuses the dequantization and GEMV operators, achieving a 1.4x speedup on LLaVA-onevision-7B on the RTX 4090.

- **Summary**: Photo-realistic scene reconstruction from sparse-view, uncalibrated images is highly required in practice. Although some successes have been made, existing methods are either Sparse-View but require accurate camera parameters (i.e., intrinsic and extrinsic), or SfM-free but need densely captured images. To combine the advantages of both methods while addressing their respective weaknesses, we propose Dust to Tower (D2T), an accurate and efficient coarse-to-fine framework to optimize 3DGS and image poses simultaneously from sparse and uncalibrated images. Our key idea is to first construct a coarse model efficiently and subsequently refine it using warped and inpainted images at novel viewpoints. To do this, we first introduce a Coarse Construction Module (CCM) which exploits a fast Multi-View Stereo model to initialize a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and recover initial camera poses. To refine the 3D model at novel viewpoints, we propose a Confidence Aware Depth Alignment (CADA) module to refine the coarse depth maps by aligning their confident parts with estimated depths by a Mono-depth model. Then, a Warped Image-Guided Inpainting (WIGI) module is proposed to warp the training images to novel viewpoints by the refined depth maps, and inpainting is applied to fulfill the ``holes" in the warped images caused by view-direction changes, providing high-quality supervision to further optimize the 3D model and the camera poses. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the validity of D2T and its design choices, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both tasks of novel view synthesis and pose estimation while keeping high efficiency. Codes will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: The interpretability of deep neural networks is crucial for understanding model decisions in various applications, including computer vision. AttEXplore++, an advanced framework built upon AttEXplore, enhances attribution by incorporating transferable adversarial attack methods such as MIG and GRA, significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of model explanations. We conduct extensive experiments on five models, including CNNs (Inception-v3, ResNet-50, VGG16) and vision transformers (MaxViT-T, ViT-B/16), using the ImageNet dataset. Our method achieves an average performance improvement of 7.57\% over AttEXplore and 32.62\% compared to other state-of-the-art interpretability algorithms. Using insertion and deletion scores as evaluation metrics, we show that adversarial transferability plays a vital role in enhancing attribution results. Furthermore, we explore the impact of randomness, perturbation rate, noise amplitude, and diversity probability on attribution performance, demonstrating that AttEXplore++ provides more stable and reliable explanations across various models.

- **Summary**: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, a prevalent training technique involves utilizing Vision Language Models (VLMs) for image re-captioning. Even though VLMs are known to exhibit hallucination, generating descriptive content that deviates from the visual reality, the ramifications of such caption hallucinations on T2I generation performance remain under-explored. Through our empirical investigation, we first establish a comprehensive dataset comprising VLM-generated captions, and then systematically analyze how caption hallucination influences generation outcomes. Our findings reveal that (1) the disparities in caption quality persistently impact model outputs during fine-tuning. (2) VLMs confidence scores serve as reliable indicators for detecting and characterizing noise-related patterns in the data distribution. (3) even subtle variations in caption fidelity have significant effects on the quality of learned representations. These findings collectively emphasize the profound impact of caption quality on model performance and highlight the need for more sophisticated robust training algorithm in T2I. In response to these observations, we propose a approach leveraging VLM confidence score to mitigate caption noise, thereby enhancing the robustness of T2I models against hallucination in caption.

- **Summary**: Recent research in subject-driven generation increasingly emphasizes the importance of selective subject features. Nevertheless, accurately selecting the content in a given reference image still poses challenges, especially when selecting the similar subjects in an image (e.g., two different dogs). Some methods attempt to use text prompts or pixel masks to isolate specific elements. However, text prompts often fall short in precisely describing specific content, and pixel masks are often expensive. To address this, we introduce P3S-Diffusion, a novel architecture designed for context-selected subject-driven generation via point supervision. P3S-Diffusion leverages minimal cost label (e.g., points) to generate subject-driven images. During fine-tuning, it can generate an expanded base mask from these points, obviating the need for additional segmentation models. The mask is employed for inpainting and aligning with subject representation. The P3S-Diffusion preserves fine features of the subjects through Multi-layers Condition Injection. Enhanced by the Attention Consistency Loss for improved training, extensive experiments demonstrate its excellent feature preservation and image generation capabilities.

- **Summary**: Style transfer aims to generate a new image preserving the content but with the artistic representation of the style source. Most of the existing methods are based on Transformers or diffusion models, however, they suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high inference time. RWKV, as an emerging deep sequence models, has shown immense potential for long-context sequence modeling in NLP tasks. In this work, we present a novel framework StyleRWKV, to achieve high-quality style transfer with limited memory usage and linear time complexity. Specifically, we propose a Recurrent WKV (Re-WKV) attention mechanism, which incorporates bidirectional attention to establish a global receptive field. Additionally, we develop a Deformable Shifting (Deform-Shifting) layer that introduces learnable offsets to the sampling grid of the convolution kernel, allowing tokens to shift flexibly and adaptively from the region of interest, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture local dependencies. Finally, we propose a Skip Scanning (S-Scanning) method that effectively establishes global contextual dependencies. Extensive experiments with analysis including qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of stylization quality, model complexity, and inference efficiency.

- **Summary**: Air-writing is a challenging task that combines the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, offering an intuitive and natural approach for human-computer interaction. However, current air-writing solutions face two primary challenges: (1) their dependency on complex sensors (e.g., Radar, EEGs and others) for capturing precise handwritten trajectories, and (2) the absence of a video-based air-writing dataset that covers a comprehensive vocabulary range. These limitations impede their practicality in various real-world scenarios, including the use on devices like iPhones and laptops. To tackle these challenges, we present the groundbreaking air-writing Chinese character video dataset (AWCV-100K-UCAS2024), serving as a pioneering benchmark for video-based air-writing. This dataset captures handwritten trajectories in various real-world scenarios using commonly accessible RGB cameras, eliminating the need for complex sensors. AWCV-100K-UCAS2024 includes 8.8 million video frames, encompassing the complete set of 3,755 characters from the GB2312-80 level-1 set (GB1). Furthermore, we introduce our baseline approach, the video-based character recognizer (VCRec). VCRec adeptly extracts fingertip features from sparse visual cues and employs a spatio-temporal sequence module for analysis. Experimental results showcase the superior performance of VCRec compared to existing models in recognizing air-written characters, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This breakthrough paves the way for enhanced human-computer interaction in real-world contexts. Moreover, our approach leverages affordable RGB cameras, enabling its applicability in a diverse range of scenarios. The code and data examples will be made public at https://github.com/wmeiqi/AWCV.

- **Summary**: Spatio-temporal Human-Object Interaction (ST-HOI) understanding aims at detecting HOIs from videos, which is crucial for activity understanding. However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos. Our method demonstrates significant superiority in extensive experiments compared to current baselines. Data and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/DirtyHarryLYL/HAKE-AVA.

- **Summary**: Deep generative models are proficient in generating realistic data but struggle with producing rare samples in low density regions due to their scarcity of training datasets and the mode collapse problem. While recent methods aim to improve the fidelity of generated samples, they often reduce diversity and coverage by ignoring rare and novel samples. This study proposes a novel approach for generating diverse rare samples from high-resolution image datasets with pretrained GANs. Our method employs gradient-based optimization of latent vectors within a multi-objective framework and utilizes normalizing flows for density estimation on the feature space. This enables the generation of diverse rare images, with controllable parameters for rarity, diversity, and similarity to a reference image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively across various datasets and GANs without retraining or fine-tuning the pretrained GANs.

- **Summary**: Human beings can leverage knowledge from relative tasks to improve learning on a primary task. Similarly, multi-task learning methods suggest using auxiliary tasks to enhance a neural network's performance on a specific primary task. However, previous methods often select auxiliary tasks carefully but treat them as secondary during training. The weights assigned to auxiliary losses are typically smaller than the primary loss weight, leading to insufficient training on auxiliary tasks and ultimately failing to support the main task effectively. To address this issue, we propose an uncertainty-based impartial learning method that ensures balanced training across all tasks. Additionally, we consider both gradients and uncertainty information during backpropagation to further improve performance on the primary task. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, our weighting strategy is effective and robust in enhancing the performance of the primary task regardless the noise auxiliary tasks' pseudo labels.

- **Summary**: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) with references plays an important role in optimizing and evaluating computer vision tasks. Traditional methods assume that all pixels of the reference and test images are fully aligned. Such Aligned-Reference IQA (AR-IQA) approaches fail to address many real-world problems with various geometric deformations between the two images. Although significant effort has been made to attack Geometrically-Disparate-Reference IQA (GDR-IQA) problem, it has been addressed in a task-dependent fashion, for example, by dedicated designs for image super-resolution and retargeting, or by assuming the geometric distortions to be small that can be countered by translation-robust filters or by explicit image registrations. Here we rethink this problem and propose a unified, non-training-based Deep Structural Similarity (DeepSSIM) approach to address the above problems in a single framework, which assesses structural similarity of deep features in a simple but efficient way and uses an attention calibration strategy to alleviate attention deviation. The proposed method, without application-specific design, achieves state-of-the-art performance on AR-IQA datasets and meanwhile shows strong robustness to various GDR-IQA test cases. Interestingly, our test also shows the effectiveness of DeepSSIM as an optimization tool for training image super-resolution, enhancement and restoration, implying an even wider generalizability. \footnote{Source code will be made public after the review is completed.

- **Summary**: Audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) aims to recognize audio and visual event labels with precise temporal boundaries, which is quite challenging since audio or visual modality might include only one event label with only the overall video labels available. Existing label denoising models often treat the denoising process as a separate preprocessing step, leading to a disconnect between label denoising and AVVP tasks. To bridge this gap, we present a novel joint reinforcement learning-based label denoising approach (RLLD). This approach enables simultaneous training of both label denoising and video parsing models through a joint optimization strategy. We introduce a novel AVVP-validation and soft inter-reward feedback mechanism that directly guides the learning of label denoising policy. Extensive experiments on AVVP tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to label denoising techniques. Furthermore, by incorporating our label denoising method into other AVVP models, we find that it can further enhance parsing results.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel framework for scene decomposition and static background reconstruction from everyday videos. By integrating the trained motion masks and modeling the static scene as Gaussian splats with dynamics-aware optimization, our method achieves more accurate background reconstruction results than previous works. Our proposed method is termed DAS3R, an abbreviation for Dynamics-Aware Gaussian Splatting for Static Scene Reconstruction. Compared to existing methods, DAS3R is more robust in complex motion scenarios, capable of handling videos where dynamic objects occupy a significant portion of the scene, and does not require camera pose inputs or point cloud data from SLAM-based methods. We compared DAS3R against recent distractor-free approaches on the DAVIS and Sintel datasets; DAS3R demonstrates enhanced performance and robustness with a margin of more than 2 dB in PSNR.

- **Summary**: Fine-grained image classification, which is a challenging task in computer vision, requires precise differentiation among visually similar object categories. In this paper, we propose 1) a novel module called Residual Relationship Attention (RRA) that leverages the relationships between images within each training batch to effectively integrate visual feature vectors of batch images and 2) a novel technique called Relationship Position Encoding (RPE), which encodes the positions of relationships between original images in a batch and effectively preserves the relationship information between images within the batch. Additionally, we design a novel framework, namely Relationship Batch Integration (RBI), which utilizes RRA in conjunction with RPE, allowing the discernment of vital visual features that may remain elusive when examining a singular image representative of a particular class. Through extensive experiments, our proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in the accuracy of different fine-grained classifiers, with an average increase of $(+2.78\%)$ and $(+3.83\%)$ on the CUB200-2011 and Stanford Dog datasets, respectively, while achieving a state-of-the-art results $(95.79\%)$ on the Stanford Dog dataset. Despite not achieving the same level of improvement as in fine-grained image classification, our method still demonstrates its prowess in leveraging general image classification by attaining a state-of-the-art result of $(93.71\%)$ on the Tiny-Imagenet dataset. Furthermore, our method serves as a plug-in refinement module and can be easily integrated into different networks.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated the advantage of global modeling capabilities, prompting widespread integration of large-kernel convolutions for enlarging the effective receptive field (ERF). However, the quadratic scaling of parameter count and computational complexity (FLOPs) with respect to kernel size poses significant efficiency and optimization challenges. This paper introduces RecConv, a recursive decomposition strategy that efficiently constructs multi-frequency representations using small-kernel convolutions. RecConv establishes a linear relationship between parameter growth and decomposing levels which determines the effective kernel size $k\times 2^\ell$ for a base kernel $k$ and $\ell$ levels of decomposition, while maintaining constant FLOPs regardless of the ERF expansion. Specifically, RecConv achieves a parameter expansion of only $\ell+2$ times and a maximum FLOPs increase of $5/3$ times, compared to the exponential growth ($4^\ell$) of standard and depthwise convolutions. RecNeXt-M3 outperforms RepViT-M1.1 by 1.9 $AP^{box}$ on COCO with similar FLOPs. This innovation provides a promising avenue towards designing efficient and compact networks across various modalities. Codes and models can be found at \url{https://github.com/suous/RecNeXt}.

- **Summary**: In text-to-image (T2I) generation applications, negative embeddings have proven to be a simple yet effective approach for enhancing generation quality. Typically, these negative embeddings are derived from user-defined negative prompts, which, while being functional, are not necessarily optimal. In this paper, we introduce ReNeg, an end-to-end method designed to learn improved Negative embeddings guided by a Reward model. We employ a reward feedback learning framework and integrate classifier-free guidance (CFG) into the training process, which was previously utilized only during inference, thus enabling the effective learning of negative embeddings. We also propose two strategies for learning both global and per-sample negative embeddings. Extensive experiments show that the learned negative embedding significantly outperforms null-text and handcrafted counterparts, achieving substantial improvements in human preference alignment. Additionally, the negative embedding learned within the same text embedding space exhibits strong generalization capabilities. For example, using the same CLIP text encoder, the negative embedding learned on SD1.5 can be seamlessly transferred to text-to-image or even text-to-video models such as ControlNet, ZeroScope, and VideoCrafter2, resulting in consistent performance improvements across the board.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot customized video generation has gained significant attention due to its substantial application potential. Existing methods rely on additional models to extract and inject reference subject features, assuming that the Video Diffusion Model (VDM) alone is insufficient for zero-shot customized video generation. However, these methods often struggle to maintain consistent subject appearance due to suboptimal feature extraction and injection techniques. In this paper, we reveal that VDM inherently possesses the force to extract and inject subject features. Departing from previous heuristic approaches, we introduce a novel framework that leverages VDM's inherent force to enable high-quality zero-shot customized video generation. Specifically, for feature extraction, we directly input reference images into VDM and use its intrinsic feature extraction process, which not only provides fine-grained features but also significantly aligns with VDM's pre-trained knowledge. For feature injection, we devise an innovative bidirectional interaction between subject features and generated content through spatial self-attention within VDM, ensuring that VDM has better subject fidelity while maintaining the diversity of the generated video. Experiments on both customized human and object video generation validate the effectiveness of our framework.

- **Summary**: Event-based cameras are sensors that simulate the human eye, offering advantages such as high-speed robustness and low power consumption. Established Deep Learning techniques have shown effectiveness in processing event data. Chimera is a Block-Based Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework specifically designed for Event-Based Object Detection, aiming to create a systematic approach for adapting RGB-domain processing methods to the event domain. The Chimera design space is constructed from various macroblocks, including Attention blocks, Convolutions, State Space Models, and MLP-mixer-based architectures, which provide a valuable trade-off between local and global processing capabilities, as well as varying levels of complexity. The results on the PErson Detection in Robotics (PEDRo) dataset demonstrated performance levels comparable to leading state-of-the-art models, alongside an average parameter reduction of 1.6 times.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Tracking (VLT) aims to localize a target in video sequences using a visual template and language description. While textual cues enhance tracking potential, current datasets typically contain much more image data than text, limiting the ability of VLT methods to align the two modalities effectively. To address this imbalance, we propose a novel plug-and-play method named CTVLT that leverages the strong text-image alignment capabilities of foundation grounding models. CTVLT converts textual cues into interpretable visual heatmaps, which are easier for trackers to process. Specifically, we design a textual cue mapping module that transforms textual cues into target distribution heatmaps, visually representing the location described by the text. Additionally, the heatmap guidance module fuses these heatmaps with the search image to guide tracking more effectively. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating the utility of our method for enhanced VLT.

- **Summary**: The application of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) in Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) research powerful cross-modal semantic understanding capabilities. Existing methods attempt to optimize input text prompts for improved alignment of images and text, by finely adjusting text prototypes to facilitate semantic matching. Nevertheless, given the modality gap between text and vision spaces, the text prototypes employed by these methods have not effectively established a close correspondence with pixel-level vision features. In this work, our theoretical analysis indicates that the inherent modality gap results in misalignment of text and region features, and that this gap cannot be sufficiently reduced by minimizing contrast loss in CLIP. To mitigate the impact of the modality gap, we propose a Vision Prototype Learning (VPL) framework, by introducing more representative vision prototypes. The core of this framework is to learn class-specific vision prototypes in vision space with the help of text prototypes, for capturing high-quality localization maps. Moreover, we propose a regional semantic contrast module that contrasts regions embedding with corresponding prototypes, leading to more comprehensive and robust feature learning. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Computer-aided design (CAD) significantly enhances the efficiency, accuracy, and innovation of design processes by enabling precise 2D and 3D modeling, extensive analysis, and optimization. Existing methods for creating CAD models rely on latent vectors or point clouds, which are difficult to obtain and costly to store. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have inspired researchers to use natural language instructions and images for CAD model construction. However, these models still struggle with inferring accurate 3D spatial location and orientation, leading to inaccuracies in determining the spatial 3D starting points and extrusion directions for constructing geometries. This work introduces CAD-GPT, a CAD synthesis method with spatial reasoning-enhanced MLLM that takes either a single image or a textual description as input. To achieve precise spatial inference, our approach introduces a 3D Modeling Spatial Mechanism. This method maps 3D spatial positions and 3D sketch plane rotation angles into a 1D linguistic feature space using a specialized spatial unfolding mechanism, while discretizing 2D sketch coordinates into an appropriate planar space to enable precise determination of spatial starting position, sketch orientation, and 2D sketch coordinate translations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAD-GPT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in CAD model synthesis, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a scanner package enhanced by deep learning (DL) techniques. The proposed package addresses two significant challenges associated with previously developed DL-based methods: slow convergence in high-dimensional scans and the limited generalization of the DL network when mapping random points to the target space. To tackle the first issue, we utilize a similarity learning network that maps sampled points into a representation space. In this space, in-target points are grouped together while out-target points are effectively pushed apart. This approach enhances the scan convergence by refining the representation of sampled points. The second challenge is mitigated by integrating a dynamic sampling strategy. Specifically, we employ a VEGAS mapping to adaptively suggest new points for the DL network while also improving the mapping when more points are collected. Our proposed framework demonstrates substantial gains in both performance and efficiency compared to other scanning methods.

- **Summary**: Transformer-based methods have recently achieved significant success in 3D human pose estimation, owing to their strong ability to model long-range dependencies. However, relying solely on the global attention mechanism is insufficient for capturing the fine-grained local details, which are crucial for accurate pose estimation. To address this, we propose SSR-STF, a dual-stream model that effectively integrates local features with global dependencies to enhance 3D human pose estimation. Specifically, we introduce SSRFormer, a simple yet effective module that employs the skeleton selective refine attention (SSRA) mechanism to capture fine-grained local dependencies in human pose sequences, complementing the global dependencies modeled by the Transformer. By adaptively fusing these two feature streams, SSR-STF can better learn the underlying structure of human poses, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods in local feature extraction. Extensive experiments on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets demonstrate that SSR-STF achieves state-of-the-art performance, with P1 errors of 37.4 mm and 13.2 mm respectively, outperforming existing methods in both accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, the motion representations learned by our model prove effective in downstream tasks such as human mesh recovery. Codes are available at https://github.com/poker-xu/SSR-STF.

- **Summary**: Over the past decade, several image-processing methods and algorithms have been proposed for identifying plant diseases based on visual data. DNN (Deep Neural Networks) have recently become popular for this task. Both traditional image processing and DNN-based methods encounter significant performance issues in real-time detection owing to computational limitations and a broad spectrum of plant disease features. This article proposes a novel technique for identifying and localising plant disease based on the Quad-Tree decomposition of an image and feature learning simultaneously. The proposed algorithm significantly improves accuracy and faster convergence in high-resolution images with relatively low computational load. Hence it is ideal for deploying the algorithm in a standalone processor in a remotely operated image acquisition and disease detection system, ideally mounted on drones and robots working on large agricultural fields. The technique proposed in this article is hybrid as it exploits the advantages of traditional image processing methods and DNN-based models at different scales, resulting in faster inference. The F1 score is approximately 0.80 for four disease classes corresponding to potato and tomato crops.

- **Summary**: Image forgery localization, which centers on identifying tampered pixels within an image, has seen significant advancements. Traditional approaches often model this challenge as a variant of image segmentation, treating the binary segmentation of forged areas as the end product. We argue that the basic binary forgery mask is inadequate for explaining model predictions. It doesn't clarify why the model pinpoints certain areas and treats all forged pixels the same, making it hard to spot the most fake-looking parts. In this study, we mitigate the aforementioned limitations by generating salient region-focused interpretation for the forgery images. To support this, we craft a Multi-Modal Tramper Tracing (MMTT) dataset, comprising facial images manipulated using deepfake techniques and paired with manual, interpretable textual annotations. To harvest high-quality annotation, annotators are instructed to meticulously observe the manipulated images and articulate the typical characteristics of the forgery regions. Subsequently, we collect a dataset of 128,303 image-text pairs. Leveraging the MMTT dataset, we develop ForgeryTalker, an architecture designed for concurrent forgery localization and interpretation. ForgeryTalker first trains a forgery prompter network to identify the pivotal clues within the explanatory text. Subsequently, the region prompter is incorporated into multimodal large language model for finetuning to achieve the dual goals of localization and interpretation. Extensive experiments conducted on the MMTT dataset verify the superior performance of our proposed model. The dataset, code as well as pretrained checkpoints will be made publicly available to facilitate further research and ensure the reproducibility of our results.

- **Summary**: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool to enhance decision-making and optimize treatment protocols in in vitro fertilization (IVF). In particular, AI shows significant promise in supporting decision-making during the ovarian stimulation phase of the IVF process. This review evaluates studies focused on the applications of AI combined with medical imaging in ovarian stimulation, examining methodologies, outcomes, and current limitations. Our analysis of 13 studies on this topic reveals that, reveal that while AI algorithms demonstrated notable potential in predicting optimal hormonal dosages, trigger timing, and oocyte retrieval outcomes, the medical imaging data utilized predominantly came from two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound which mainly involved basic quantifications, such as follicle size and number, with limited use of direct feature extraction or advanced image analysis techniques. This points to an underexplored opportunity where advanced image analysis approaches, such as deep learning, and more diverse imaging modalities, like three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound, could unlock deeper insights. Additionally, the lack of explainable AI (XAI) in most studies raises concerns about the transparency and traceability of AI-driven decisions - key factors for clinical adoption and trust. Furthermore, many studies relied on single-center designs and small datasets, which limit the generalizability of their findings. This review highlights the need for integrating advanced imaging analysis techniques with explainable AI methodologies, as well as the importance of leveraging multicenter collaborations and larger datasets. Addressing these gaps has the potential to enhance ovarian stimulation management, paving the way for efficient, personalized, and data-driven treatment pathways that improve IVF outcomes.

Although recent studies have developed various generative models for graphic design, they usually face the following limitations: they only focus on certain subtasks and are far from achieving the design composition task; they do not consider the hierarchical information of graphic designs during the generation process. To tackle these issues, we introduce the layered design principle into Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and propose a novel approach, called LaDeCo, to accomplish this challenging task. Specifically, LaDeCo first performs layer planning for a given element set, dividing the input elements into different semantic layers according to their contents. Based on the planning results, it subsequently predicts element attributes that control the design composition in a layer-wise manner, and includes the rendered image of previously generated layers into the context. With this insightful design, LaDeCo decomposes the difficult task into smaller manageable steps, making the generation process smoother and clearer. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LaDeCo in design composition. Furthermore, we show that LaDeCo enables some interesting applications in graphic design, such as resolution adjustment, element filling, design variation, etc. In addition, it even outperforms the specialized models in some design subtasks without any task-specific training.

- **Summary**: The growing need for accurate and efficient 3D identification of tumors, particularly in liver segmentation, has spurred considerable research into deep learning models. While many existing architectures offer strong performance, they often face challenges such as overfitting and excessive computational costs. An adjustable and flexible architecture that strikes a balance between time efficiency and model complexity remains an unmet requirement. In this paper, we introduce proKAN, a progressive stacking methodology for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) designed to address these challenges. Unlike traditional architectures, proKAN dynamically adjusts its complexity by progressively adding KAN blocks during training, based on overfitting behavior. This approach allows the network to stop growing when overfitting is detected, preventing unnecessary computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy. Additionally, proKAN utilizes KAN's learnable activation functions modeled through B-splines, which provide enhanced flexibility in learning complex relationships in 3D medical data. Our proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance in liver segmentation tasks, outperforming standard Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and fixed KAN architectures. The dynamic nature of proKAN ensures efficient training times and high accuracy without the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, proKAN provides better interpretability by allowing insight into the decision-making process through its learnable coefficients. The experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy, Dice score, and time efficiency, making proKAN a compelling solution for 3D medical image segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) are vital implicit representations to represent high fidelity 3D surfaces. Current methods mainly leverage a neural network to learn an SDF from various supervisions including signed distances, 3D point clouds, or multi-view images. However, due to various reasons including the bias of neural network on low frequency content, 3D unaware sampling, sparsity in point clouds, or low resolutions of images, neural implicit representations still struggle to represent geometries with high frequency components like sharp structures, especially for the ones learned from images or point clouds. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a method to sharpen a low frequency SDF observation by recovering its high frequency components, pursuing a sharper and more complete surface. Our key idea is to learn a mapping from a low frequency observation to a full frequency coverage in a data-driven manner, leading to a prior knowledge of shape consolidation in the frequency domain, dubbed frequency consolidation priors. To better generalize a learned prior to unseen shapes, we introduce to represent frequency components as embeddings and disentangle the embedding of the low frequency component from the embedding of the full frequency component. This disentanglement allows the prior to generalize on an unseen low frequency observation by simply recovering its full frequency embedding through a test-time self-reconstruction. Our evaluations under widely used benchmarks or real scenes show that our method can recover high frequency component and produce more accurate surfaces than the latest methods.

- **Summary**: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated human-like computer control capability. Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods.

- **Summary**: Large-scale video generation models have the inherent ability to realistically model natural scenes. In this paper, we demonstrate that through a careful design of a generative video propagation framework, various video tasks can be addressed in a unified way by leveraging the generative power of such models. Specifically, our framework, GenProp, encodes the original video with a selective content encoder and propagates the changes made to the first frame using an image-to-video generation model. We propose a data generation scheme to cover multiple video tasks based on instance-level video segmentation datasets. Our model is trained by incorporating a mask prediction decoder head and optimizing a region-aware loss to aid the encoder to preserve the original content while the generation model propagates the modified region. This novel design opens up new possibilities: In editing scenarios, GenProp allows substantial changes to an object's shape; for insertion, the inserted objects can exhibit independent motion; for removal, GenProp effectively removes effects like shadows and reflections from the whole video; for tracking, GenProp is capable of tracking objects and their associated effects together. Experiment results demonstrate the leading performance of our model in various video tasks, and we further provide in-depth analyses of the proposed framework.

- **Summary**: To display an image, the color space in which the image is encoded is assumed to be known. Unfortunately, this assumption is rarely realistic. In this paper, we propose to identify the color space of a given color image using pixel embedding and the Gaussian process. Five color spaces are supported, namely Adobe RGB, Apple RGB, ColorMatch RGB, ProPhoto RGB and sRGB. The results obtained show that this problem deserves more efforts.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled significant progress in complex video understanding tasks. However, their robustness to real-world manipulations remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in critical applications. To address this gap, we introduce MVTamperBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLM's resilience to video tampering effects, including rotation, dropping, masking, substitution, and repetition. By systematically assessing state-of-the-art models, MVTamperBench reveals substantial variability in robustness, with models like InternVL2-8B achieving high performance, while others, such as Llama-VILA1.5-8B, exhibit severe vulnerabilities. To foster broader adoption and reproducibility, MVTamperBench is integrated into VLMEvalKit, a modular evaluation toolkit, enabling streamlined testing and facilitating advancements in model robustness. Our benchmark represents a critical step towards developing tamper-resilient VLMs, ensuring their dependability in real-world scenarios.   Project Page: https://amitbcp.github.io/MVTamperBench/
