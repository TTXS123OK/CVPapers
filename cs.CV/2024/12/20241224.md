- **Summary**: The rise of short-form videos, characterized by diverse content, editing styles, and artifacts, poses substantial challenges for learning-based blind video quality assessment (BVQA) models. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), renowned for their superior generalization capabilities, present a promising solution. This paper focuses on effectively leveraging a pretrained MLLM for short-form video quality assessment, regarding the impacts of pre-processing and response variability, and insights on combining the MLLM with BVQA models. We first investigated how frame pre-processing and sampling techniques influence the MLLM's performance. Then, we introduced a lightweight learning-based ensemble method that adaptively integrates predictions from the MLLM and state-of-the-art BVQA models. Our results demonstrated superior generalization performance with the proposed ensemble approach. Furthermore, the analysis of content-aware ensemble weights highlighted that some video characteristics are not fully represented by existing BVQA models, revealing potential directions to improve BVQA models further.

- **Summary**: In the domain of facial recognition security, multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is essential for countering presentation attacks. However, existing technologies encounter challenges due to modality biases and imbalances, as well as domain shifts. Our research introduces a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model to address these issues effectively. We identified three limitations in traditional MoE approaches to multimodal FAS: (1) Coarse-grained experts' inability to capture nuanced spoofing indicators; (2) Gated networks' susceptibility to input noise affecting decision-making; (3) MoE's sensitivity to prompt tokens leading to overfitting with conventional learning methods. To mitigate these, we propose the Bypass Isolated Gating MoE (BIG-MoE) framework, featuring: (1) Fine-grained experts for enhanced detection of subtle spoofing cues; (2) An isolation gating mechanism to counteract input noise; (3) A novel differential convolutional prompt bypass enriching the gating network with critical local features, thereby improving perceptual capabilities. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate significant generalization performance improvement in multimodal FAS task. The code is released at https://github.com/murInJ/BIG-MoE.

- **Summary**: With advances in foundational and vision-language models, and effective fine-tuning techniques, a large number of both general and special-purpose models have been developed for a variety of visual tasks. Despite the flexibility and accessibility of these models, no single model is able to handle all tasks and/or applications that may be envisioned by potential users. Recent approaches, such as visual programming and multimodal LLMs with integrated tools aim to tackle complex visual tasks, by way of program synthesis. However, such approaches overlook user constraints (e.g., performance / computational needs), produce test-time sample-specific solutions that are difficult to deploy, and, sometimes, require low-level instructions that maybe beyond the abilities of a naive user. To address these limitations, we introduce MMFactory, a universal framework that includes model and metrics routing components, acting like a solution search engine across various available models. Based on a task description and few sample input-output pairs and (optionally) resource and/or performance constraints, MMFactory can suggest a diverse pool of programmatic solutions by instantiating and combining visio-lingual tools from its model repository. In addition to synthesizing these solutions, MMFactory also proposes metrics and benchmarks performance / resource characteristics, allowing users to pick a solution that meets their unique design constraints. From the technical perspective, we also introduced a committee-based solution proposer that leverages multi-agent LLM conversation to generate executable, diverse, universal, and robust solutions for the user. Experimental results show that MMFactory outperforms existing methods by delivering state-of-the-art solutions tailored to user problem specifications.

- **Summary**: Single-modal object detection tasks often experience performance degradation when encountering diverse scenarios. In contrast, multimodal object detection tasks can offer more comprehensive information about object features by integrating data from various modalities. Current multimodal object detection methods generally use various fusion techniques, including conventional neural networks and transformer-based models, to implement feature fusion strategies and achieve complementary information. However, since multimodal images are captured by different sensors, there are often misalignments between them, making direct matching challenging. This misalignment hinders the ability to establish strong correlations for the same object across different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called the CrOss-Mamba interaction and Offset-guided fusion (COMO) framework for multimodal object detection tasks. The COMO framework employs the cross-mamba technique to formulate feature interaction equations, enabling multimodal serialized state computation. This results in interactive fusion outputs while reducing computational overhead and improving efficiency. Additionally, COMO leverages high-level features, which are less affected by misalignment, to facilitate interaction and transfer complementary information between modalities, addressing the positional offset challenges caused by variations in camera angles and capture times. Furthermore, COMO incorporates a global and local scanning mechanism in the cross-mamba module to capture features with local correlation, particularly in remote sensing images. To preserve low-level features, the offset-guided fusion mechanism ensures effective multiscale feature utilization, allowing the construction of a multiscale fusion data cube that enhances detection performance.

- **Summary**: Previous research on retinal vessel segmentation is targeted at a specific image domain, mostly color fundus photography (CFP). In this paper we make a brave attempt to attack a more challenging task of broad-domain retinal vessel segmentation (BD-RVS), which is to develop a unified model applicable to varied domains including CFP, SLO, UWF, OCTA and FFA. To that end, we propose Dual Convoltuional Prompting (DCP) that learns to extract domain-specific features by localized prompting along both position and channel dimensions. DCP is designed as a plug-in module that can effectively turn a R2AU-Net based vessel segmentation network to a unified model, yet without the need of modifying its network structure. For evaluation we build a broad-domain set using five public domain-specific datasets including ROSSA, FIVES, IOSTAR, PRIME-FP20 and VAMPIRE. In order to benchmark BD-RVS on the broad-domain dataset, we re-purpose a number of existing methods originally developed in other contexts, producing eight baseline methods in total. Extensive experiments show the the proposed method compares favorably against the baselines for BD-RVS.

- **Summary**: Small object detection aims to localize and classify small objects within images. With recent advances in large-scale vision-language pretraining, finetuning pretrained object detection models has emerged as a promising approach. However, finetuning large models is computationally and memory expensive. To address this issue, this paper introduces multi-point positional insertion (MPI) tuning, a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method for small object detection. Specifically, MPI incorporates multiple positional embeddings into a frozen pretrained model, enabling the efficient detection of small objects by providing precise positional information to latent features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method on the SODA-D dataset. MPI performed comparably to conventional PEFT methods, including CoOp and VPT, while significantly reducing the number of parameters that need to be tuned.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can learn directly from raw data, resulting in exceptional performance across various research areas. However, factors present in non-controllable environments such as unlabeled datasets with varying levels of domain and category shift can reduce model accuracy. The Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) is a challenging problem that arises when both of these issues occur together. Existing OSDA approaches in literature only align known classes or use supervised training to learn unknown classes as a single new category. In this work, we introduce a new approach to improve OSDA techniques by extracting a set of high-confidence unknown instances and using it as a hard constraint to tighten the classification boundaries. Specifically, we use a new loss constraint that is evaluated in three different ways: (1) using pristine negative instances directly; (2) using data augmentation techniques to create randomly transformed negatives; and (3) with generated synthetic negatives containing adversarial features. We analyze different strategies to improve the discriminator and the training of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) used to generate synthetic negatives. We conducted extensive experiments and analysis on OVANet using three widely-used public benchmarks, the Office-31, Office-Home, and VisDA datasets. We were able to achieve similar H-score to other state-of-the-art methods, while increasing the accuracy on unknown categories.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in visual understanding. This impressive leap raises a compelling question: how can language models, initially trained solely on linguistic data, effectively interpret and process visual content? This paper aims to address this question with systematic investigation across 4 model families and 4 model scales, uncovering a unique class of attention heads that focus specifically on visual content. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the behavior of these attention heads, the distribution of attention weights, and their concentration on visual tokens within the input. These findings enhance our understanding of how LLMs adapt to multimodal tasks, demonstrating their potential to bridge the gap between textual and visual understanding. This work paves the way for the development of AI systems capable of engaging with diverse modalities.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral salient object detection (HSOD) aims to extract targets or regions with significantly different spectra from hyperspectral images. While existing deep learning-based methods can achieve good detection results, they generally necessitate pixel-level annotations, which are notably challenging to acquire for hyperspectral images. To address this issue, we introduce point supervision into HSOD, and incorporate Spectral Saliency, derived from conventional HSOD methods, as a pivotal spectral representation within the framework. This integration leads to the development of a novel Spectrum-oriented Point-supervised Saliency Detector (SPSD). Specifically, we propose a novel pipeline, specifically designed for HSIs, to generate pseudo-labels, effectively mitigating the performance decline associated with point supervision strategy. Additionally, Spectral Saliency is employed to counteract information loss during model supervision and saliency refinement, thereby maintaining the structural integrity and edge accuracy of the detected objects. Furthermore, we introduce a Spectrum-transformed Spatial Gate to focus more precisely on salient regions while reducing feature redundancy. We have carried out comprehensive experiments on both HSOD-BIT and HS-SOD datasets to validate the efficacy of our proposed method, using mean absolute error (MAE), E-measure, F-measure, Area Under Curve, and Cross Correlation as evaluation metrics. For instance, on the HSOD-BIT dataset, our SPSD achieves a MAE of 0.031 and an F-measure of 0.878. Thorough ablation studies have substantiated the effectiveness of each individual module and provided insights into the model's working mechanism. Further evaluations on RGB-thermal salient object detection datasets highlight the versatility of our approach.

- **Summary**: The early detection of glottic carcinoma is critical for improving patient outcomes, as it enables timely intervention, preserves vocal function, and significantly reduces the risk of tumor progression and metastasis. However, the similarity in morphology between glottic carcinoma and vocal cord dysplasia results in suboptimal detection accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a vision large language model-based (VisionLLM-based) multimodal fusion network for glottic carcinoma detection, known as MMGC-Net. By integrating image and text modalities, multimodal models can capture complementary information, leading to more accurate and robust predictions. In this paper, we collect a private real glottic carcinoma dataset named SYSU1H from the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, with 5,799 image-text pairs. We leverage an image encoder and additional Q-Former to extract vision embeddings and the Large Language Model Meta AI (Llama3) to obtain text embeddings. These modalities are then integrated through a laryngeal feature fusion block, enabling a comprehensive integration of image and text features, thereby improving the glottic carcinoma identification performance. Extensive experiments on the SYSU1H dataset demonstrate that MMGC-Net can achieve state-of-the-art performance, which is superior to previous multimodal models.

- **Summary**: We present UniPLV, a powerful framework that unifies point clouds, images and text in a single learning paradigm for open-world 3D scene understanding. UniPLV employs the image modal as a bridge to co-embed 3D points with pre-aligned images and text in a shared feature space without requiring carefully crafted point cloud text pairs. To accomplish multi-modal alignment, we propose two key strategies:(i) logit and feature distillation modules between images and point clouds, and (ii) a vison-point matching module is given to explicitly correct the misalignment caused by points to pixels projection. To further improve the performance of our unified framework, we adopt four task-specific losses and a two-stage training strategy. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by an average of 15.6% and 14.8% for semantic segmentation over Base-Annotated and Annotation-Free tasks, respectively. The code will be released later.

Our experimental results show promising performance, with ResNet50 achieving 90.28% accuracy and an inference time of 1529ms per image on multiclass damage classification. This study contributes to the field of disaster management by offering a scalable, efficient, and objective tool for post-disaster analysis, potentially capable of transforming how communities and authorities respond to and learn from catastrophic events.

- **Summary**: The text-to-image (T2I) personalization diffusion model can generate images of the novel concept based on the user input text caption. However, existing T2I personalized methods either require test-time fine-tuning or fail to generate images that align well with the given text caption. In this work, we propose a new T2I personalization diffusion model, Dense-Face, which can generate face images with a consistent identity as the given reference subject and align well with the text caption. Specifically, we introduce a pose-controllable adapter for the high-fidelity image generation while maintaining the text-based editing ability of the pre-trained stable diffusion (SD). Additionally, we use internal features of the SD UNet to predict dense face annotations, enabling the proposed method to gain domain knowledge in face generation. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive generation performance in image-text alignment, identity preservation, and pose control.

- **Summary**: Recently, Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have achieved significant advancements. Correspondingly, many automated metrics have emerged to evaluate the image-text alignment capabilities of generative models. However, the performance comparison among these automated metrics is limited by existing small datasets. Additionally, these datasets lack the capacity to assess the performance of automated metrics at a fine-grained level. In this study, we contribute an EvalMuse-40K benchmark, gathering 40K image-text pairs with fine-grained human annotations for image-text alignment-related tasks. In the construction process, we employ various strategies such as balanced prompt sampling and data re-annotation to ensure the diversity and reliability of our benchmark. This allows us to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of image-text alignment metrics for T2I models. Meanwhile, we introduce two new methods to evaluate the image-text alignment capabilities of T2I models: FGA-BLIP2 which involves end-to-end fine-tuning of a vision-language model to produce fine-grained image-text alignment scores and PN-VQA which adopts a novel positive-negative VQA manner in VQA models for zero-shot fine-grained evaluation. Both methods achieve impressive performance in image-text alignment evaluations. We also use our methods to rank current AIGC models, in which the results can serve as a reference source for future study and promote the development of T2I generation. The data and code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Missing values remain a common challenge for depth data across its wide range of applications, stemming from various causes like incomplete data acquisition and perspective alteration. This work bridges this gap with DepthLab, a foundation depth inpainting model powered by image diffusion priors. Our model features two notable strengths: (1) it demonstrates resilience to depth-deficient regions, providing reliable completion for both continuous areas and isolated points, and (2) it faithfully preserves scale consistency with the conditioned known depth when filling in missing values. Drawing on these advantages, our approach proves its worth in various downstream tasks, including 3D scene inpainting, text-to-3D scene generation, sparse-view reconstruction with DUST3R, and LiDAR depth completion, exceeding current solutions in both numerical performance and visual quality.

- **Summary**: While learned image compression methods have achieved impressive results in either human visual perception or machine vision tasks, they are often specialized only for one domain. This drawback limits their versatility and generalizability across scenarios and also requires retraining to adapt to new applications-a process that adds significant complexity and cost in real-world scenarios. In this study, we introduce an innovative semantics DISentanglement and COmposition VERsatile codec (DISCOVER) to simultaneously enhance human-eye perception and machine vision tasks. The approach derives a set of labels per task through multimodal large models, which grounding models are then applied for precise localization, enabling a comprehensive understanding and disentanglement of image components at the encoder side. At the decoding stage, a comprehensive reconstruction of the image is achieved by leveraging these encoded components alongside priors from generative models, thereby optimizing performance for both human visual perception and machine-based analytical tasks. Extensive experimental evaluations substantiate the robustness and effectiveness of DISCOVER, demonstrating superior performance in fulfilling the dual objectives of human and machine vision requirements.



### Image Quality Assessment: Exploring Regional Heterogeneity via Response of Adaptive Multiple Quality Factors in Dictionary Space

- **Summary**: Given that the factors influencing image quality vary significantly with scene, content, and distortion type, particularly in the context of regional heterogeneity, we propose an adaptive multi-quality factor (AMqF) framework to represent image quality in a dictionary space, enabling the precise capture of quality features in non-uniformly distorted regions. By designing an adapter, the framework can flexibly decompose quality factors (such as brightness, structure, contrast, etc.) that best align with human visual perception and quantify them into discrete visual words. These visual words respond to the constructed dictionary basis vector, and by obtaining the corresponding coordinate vectors, we can measure visual similarity. Our method offers two key contributions. First, an adaptive mechanism that extracts and decomposes quality factors according to human visual perception principles enhances their representation ability through reconstruction constraints. Second, the construction of a comprehensive and discriminative dictionary space and basis vector allows quality factors to respond effectively to the dictionary basis vector and capture non-uniform distortion patterns in images, significantly improving the accuracy of visual similarity measurement. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in handling various types of distorted images.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving in high-speed racing, as opposed to urban environments, presents significant challenges in scene understanding due to rapid changes in the track environment. Traditional sequential network approaches may struggle to meet the real-time knowledge and decision-making demands of an autonomous agent covering large displacements in a short time. This paper proposes a novel baseline architecture for developing sophisticated models capable of true hardware-enabled parallelism, achieving neural processing speeds that mirror the agent's high velocity. The proposed model (Parallel Perception Network (PPN)) consists of two independent neural networks, segmentation and reconstruction networks, running parallelly on separate accelerated hardware. The model takes raw 3D point cloud data from the LiDAR sensor as input and converts it into a 2D Bird's Eye View Map on both devices. Each network independently extracts its input features along space and time dimensions and produces outputs parallelly. The proposed method's model is trained on a system with two NVIDIA T4 GPUs, using a combination of loss functions, including edge preservation, and demonstrates a 2x speedup in model inference time compared to a sequential configuration.

- **Summary**: Online continual learning (OCL) seeks to learn new tasks from data streams that appear only once, while retaining knowledge of previously learned tasks. Most existing methods rely on replay, focusing on enhancing memory retention through regularization or distillation. However, they often overlook the adaptability of the model, limiting the ability to learn generalizable and discriminative features incrementally from online training data. To address this, we introduce a plug-and-play module, S6MOD, which can be integrated into most existing methods and directly improve adaptability. Specifically, S6MOD introduces an extra branch after the backbone, where a mixture of discretization selectively adjusts parameters in a selective state space model, enriching selective scan patterns such that the model can adaptively select the most sensitive discretization method for current dynamics. We further design a class-conditional routing algorithm for dynamic, uncertainty-based adjustment and implement a contrastive discretization loss to optimize it. Extensive experiments combining our module with various models demonstrate that S6MOD significantly enhances model adaptability, leading to substantial performance gains and achieving the state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) are two dominant models for image analysis. While CNNs excel at extracting multi-scale features and ViTs effectively capture global dependencies, both suffer from high computational costs, particularly when processing high-resolution images. Recently, state-space models (SSMs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have attracted attention due to their efficiency. However, their performance in image classification tasks remains limited. To address these challenges, this paper introduces VisionGRU, a novel RNN-based architecture designed for efficient image classification. VisionGRU leverages a simplified Gated Recurrent Unit (minGRU) to process large-scale image features with linear complexity. It divides images into smaller patches and progressively reduces the sequence length while increasing the channel depth, thus facilitating multi-scale feature extraction. A hierarchical 2DGRU module with bidirectional scanning captures both local and global contexts, improving long-range dependency modeling, particularly for tasks like semantic segmentation. Experimental results on the ImageNet and ADE20K datasets demonstrate that VisionGRU outperforms ViTs, significantly reducing memory usage and computational costs, especially for high-resolution images. These findings underscore the potential of RNN-based approaches for developing efficient and scalable computer vision solutions.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image generative models excel in creating images from text but struggle with ensuring alignment and consistency between outputs and prompts. This paper introduces TextMatch, a novel framework that leverages multimodal optimization to address image-text discrepancies in text-to-image (T2I) generation and editing. TextMatch employs a scoring strategy powered by large language models (LLMs) and visual question-answering (VQA) models to evaluate semantic consistency between prompts and generated images. By integrating multimodal in-context learning and chain of thought reasoning, our method dynamically refines prompts through iterative optimization. This process ensures that the generated images better capture user intent of, resulting in higher fidelity and relevance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TextMatch significantly improves text-image consistency across multiple benchmarks, establishing a reliable framework for advancing the capabilities of text-to-image generative models.

- **Summary**: General-purposed embodied agents are designed to understand the users' natural instructions or intentions and act precisely to complete universal tasks. Recently, methods based on foundation models especially Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have shown a substantial potential to solve language-conditioned manipulation (LCM) tasks well. However, existing benchmarks do not adequately meet the needs of VLAs and relative algorithms. To better define such general-purpose tasks in the context of LLMs and advance the research in VLAs, we present VLABench, an open-source benchmark for evaluating universal LCM task learning. VLABench provides 100 carefully designed categories of tasks, with strong randomization in each category of task and a total of 2000+ objects. VLABench stands out from previous benchmarks in four key aspects: 1) tasks requiring world knowledge and common sense transfer, 2) natural language instructions with implicit human intentions rather than templates, 3) long-horizon tasks demanding multi-step reasoning, and 4) evaluation of both action policies and language model capabilities. The benchmark assesses multiple competencies including understanding of mesh\&texture, spatial relationship, semantic instruction, physical laws, knowledge transfer and reasoning, etc. To support the downstream finetuning, we provide high-quality training data collected via an automated framework incorporating heuristic skills and prior information. The experimental results indicate that both the current state-of-the-art pretrained VLAs and the workflow based on VLMs face challenges in our tasks.

- **Summary**: Extracting medication names from handwritten doctor prescriptions is challenging due to the wide variability in handwriting styles and prescription formats. This paper presents a robust method for extracting medicine names using a combination of Mask R-CNN and Transformer-based Optical Character Recognition (TrOCR) with Multi-Head Attention and Positional Embeddings. A novel dataset, featuring diverse handwritten prescriptions from various regions of Pakistan, was utilized to fine-tune the model on different handwriting styles. The Mask R-CNN model segments the prescription images to focus on the medicinal sections, while the TrOCR model, enhanced by Multi-Head Attention and Positional Embeddings, transcribes the isolated text. The transcribed text is then matched against a pre-existing database for accurate identification. The proposed approach achieved a character error rate (CER) of 1.4% on standard benchmarks, highlighting its potential as a reliable and efficient tool for automating medicine name extraction.

- **Summary**: In competitive combat sports like boxing, analyzing a boxers's performance statics is crucial for evaluating the quantity and variety of punches delivered during bouts. These statistics provide valuable data and feedback, which are routinely used for coaching and performance enhancement. We introduce BoxMAC, a real-world boxing dataset featuring 15 professional boxers and encompassing 13 distinct action labels. Comprising over 60,000 frames, our dataset has been meticulously annotated for multiple actions per frame with inputs from a boxing coach. Since two boxers can execute different punches within a single timestamp, this problem falls under the domain of multi-label action classification. We propose a novel architecture for jointly recognizing multiple actions in both individual images and videos. We investigate baselines using deep neural network architectures to address both tasks. We believe that BoxMAC will enable researchers and practitioners to develop and evaluate more efficient models for performance analysis. With its realistic and diverse nature, BoxMAC can serve as a valuable resource for the advancement of boxing as a sport

- **Summary**: Vehicle detection and tracking in satellite video is essential in remote sensing (RS) applications. However, upon the statistical analysis of existing datasets, we find that the dim vehicles with low radiation intensity and limited contrast against the background are rarely annotated, which leads to the poor effect of existing approaches in detecting moving vehicles under low radiation conditions. In this paper, we address the challenge by building a \textbf{S}mall and \textbf{D}im \textbf{M}oving Cars (SDM-Car) dataset with a multitude of annotations for dim vehicles in satellite videos, which is collected by the Luojia 3-01 satellite and comprises 99 high-quality videos. Furthermore, we propose a method based on image enhancement and attention mechanisms to improve the detection accuracy of dim vehicles, serving as a benchmark for evaluating the dataset. Finally, we assess the performance of several representative methods on SDM-Car and present insightful findings. The dataset is openly available at https://github.com/TanedaM/SDM-Car.

- **Summary**: Controversial contents largely inundate the Internet, infringing various cultural norms and child protection standards. Traditional Image Content Moderation (ICM) models fall short in producing precise moderation decisions for diverse standards, while recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs), when adopted to general rule-based ICM, often produce classification and explanation results that are inconsistent with human moderators. Aiming at flexible, explainable, and accurate ICM, we design a novel rule-based dataset generation pipeline, decomposing concise human-defined rules and leveraging well-designed multi-stage prompts to enrich short explicit image annotations. Our ICM-Instruct dataset includes detailed moderation explanation and moderation Q-A pairs. Built upon it, we create our ICM-Assistant model in the framework of rule-based ICM, making it readily applicable in real practice. Our ICM-Assistant model demonstrates exceptional performance and flexibility. Specifically, it significantly outperforms existing approaches on various sources, improving both the moderation classification (36.8\% on average) and moderation explanation quality (26.6\% on average) consistently over existing MLLMs. Code/Data is available at https://github.com/zhaoyuzhi/ICM-Assistant.

- **Summary**: We propose Adapter Merging with Centroid Prototype Mapping (ACMap), an exemplar-free framework for class-incremental learning (CIL) that addresses both catastrophic forgetting and scalability. While existing methods trade-off between inference time and accuracy, ACMap consolidates task-specific adapters into a single adapter, ensuring constant inference time across tasks without compromising accuracy. The framework employs adapter merging to build a shared subspace that aligns task representations and mitigates forgetting, while centroid prototype mapping maintains high accuracy through consistent adaptation in the shared subspace. To further improve scalability, an early stopping strategy limits adapter merging as tasks increase. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACMap matches state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining inference time comparable to the fastest existing methods.

- **Summary**: Feature-based image matching has extensive applications in computer vision. Keypoints detected in images can be naturally represented as graph structures, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to outperform traditional deep learning techniques. Consequently, the paradigm of image matching via GNNs has gained significant prominence in recent academic research. In this paper, we first introduce an innovative adaptive graph construction method that utilizes a filtering mechanism based on distance and dynamic threshold similarity. This method dynamically adjusts the criteria for incorporating new vertices based on the characteristics of existing vertices, allowing for the construction of more precise and robust graph structures while avoiding redundancy. We further combine the vertex processing capabilities of GNNs with the global awareness capabilities of Transformers to enhance the model's representation of spatial and feature information within graph structures. This hybrid model provides a deeper understanding of the interrelationships between vertices and their contributions to the matching process. Additionally, we employ the Sinkhorn algorithm to iteratively solve for optimal matching results. Finally, we validate our system using extensive image datasets and conduct comprehensive comparative experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves an average improvement of 3.8x-40.3x in overall matching performance. Additionally, the number of vertices and edges significantly impacts training efficiency and memory usage; therefore, we employ multi-GPU technology to accelerate the training process.

- **Summary**: Distinguishing spatial relations is a basic part of human cognition which requires fine-grained perception on cross-instance. Although benchmarks like MME, MMBench and SEED comprehensively have evaluated various capabilities which already include visual spatial reasoning(VSR). There is still a lack of sufficient quantity and quality evaluation and optimization datasets for Vision Large Language Models(VLLMs) specifically targeting visual positional reasoning. To handle this, we first diagnosed current VLLMs with the VSR dataset and proposed a unified test set. We found current VLLMs to exhibit a contradiction of over-sensitivity to language instructions and under-sensitivity to visual positional information. By expanding the original benchmark from two aspects of tunning data and model structure, we mitigated this phenomenon. To our knowledge, we expanded spatially positioned image data controllably using diffusion models for the first time and integrated original visual encoding(CLIP) with other 3 powerful visual encoders(SigLIP, SAM and DINO). After conducting combination experiments on scaling data and models, we obtained a VLLM VSR Expert(VSRE) that not only generalizes better to different instructions but also accurately distinguishes differences in visual positional information. VSRE achieved over a 27\% increase in accuracy on the VSR test set. It becomes a performant VLLM on the position reasoning of both the VSR dataset and relevant subsets of other evaluation benchmarks. We open-sourced the expanded model with data and Appendix at \url{https://github.com/peijin360/vsre} and hope it will accelerate advancements in VLLM on VSR learning.

- **Summary**: Edge computing has emerged as a key paradigm for deploying deep learning-based object detection in time-sensitive scenarios. However, existing edge detection methods face challenges: 1) difficulty balancing detection precision with lightweight models, 2) limited adaptability of generalized deployment designs, and 3) insufficient real-world validation. To address these issues, we propose the Edge Detection Toolbox (ED-TOOLBOX), which utilizes generalizable plug-and-play components to adapt object detection models for edge environments. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Reparameterized Dynamic Convolutional Network (Rep-DConvNet) featuring weighted multi-shape convolutional branches to enhance detection performance. Additionally, we design a Sparse Cross-Attention (SC-A) network with a localized-mapping-assisted self-attention mechanism, enabling a well-crafted joint module for adaptive feature transfer. For real-world applications, we incorporate an Efficient Head into the YOLO framework to accelerate edge model optimization. To demonstrate practical impact, we identify a gap in helmet detection -- overlooking band fastening, a critical safety factor -- and create the Helmet Band Detection Dataset (HBDD). Using ED-TOOLBOX-optimized models, we address this real-world task. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of ED-TOOLBOX, with edge detection models outperforming six state-of-the-art methods in visual surveillance simulations, achieving real-time and accurate performance. These results highlight ED-TOOLBOX as a superior solution for edge object detection.

- **Summary**: Local climate zone (LCZ) classification is of great value for understanding the complex interactions between urban development and local climate. Recent studies have increasingly focused on the fusion of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multi-spectral data to improve LCZ classification performance. However, it remains challenging due to the distinct physical properties of these two types of data and the absence of effective fusion guidance. In this paper, a novel band prompting aided data fusion framework is proposed for LCZ classification, namely BP-LCZ, which utilizes textual prompts associated with band groups to guide the model in learning the physical attributes of different bands and semantics of various categories inherent in SAR and multi-spectral data to augment the fused feature, thus enhancing LCZ classification performance. Specifically, a band group prompting (BGP) strategy is introduced to align the visual representation effectively at the level of band groups, which also facilitates a more adequate extraction of semantic information of different bands with textual information. In addition, a multivariate supervised matrix (MSM) based training strategy is proposed to alleviate the problem of positive and negative sample confusion by completing the supervised information. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed data fusion framework.

- **Summary**: Early detection of faults in induction motors is crucial for ensuring uninterrupted operations in industrial settings. Among the various fault types encountered in induction motors, bearing, rotor, and stator faults are the most prevalent. This paper introduces a Weighted Probability Ensemble Deep Learning (WPEDL) methodology, tailored for effectively diagnosing induction motor faults using high-dimensional data extracted from vibration and current features. The Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is employed to extract features from both vibration and current signals. The performance of the WPEDL fault diagnosis method is compared against conventional deep learning models, demonstrating the superior efficacy of the proposed system. The multi-class fault diagnosis system based on WPEDL achieves high accuracies across different fault types: 99.05% for bearing (vibrational signal), 99.10%, and 99.50% for rotor (current and vibration signal), and 99.60%, and 99.52% for stator faults (current and vibration signal) respectively. To evaluate the robustness of our multi-class classification decisions, tests have been conducted on a combined dataset of 52,000 STFT images encompassing all three faults. Our proposed model outperforms other models, achieving an accuracy of 98.89%. The findings underscore the effectiveness and reliability of the WPEDL approach for early-stage fault diagnosis in IMs, offering promising insights for enhancing industrial operational efficiency and reliability.

- **Summary**: Multimodal fake news detection aims to automatically identify real or fake news, thereby mitigating the adverse effects caused by such misinformation. Although prevailing approaches have demonstrated their effectiveness, challenges persist in cross-modal feature fusion and refinement for classification. To address this, we present a residual-aware compensation network with multi-granularity constraints (RaCMC) for fake news detection, that aims to sufficiently interact and fuse cross-modal features while amplifying the differences between real and fake news. First, a multiscale residual-aware compensation module is designed to interact and fuse features at different scales, and ensure both the consistency and exclusivity of feature interaction, thus acquiring high-quality features. Second, a multi-granularity constraints module is implemented to limit the distribution of both the news overall and the image-text pairs within the news, thus amplifying the differences between real and fake news at the news and feature levels. Finally, a dominant feature fusion reasoning module is developed to comprehensively evaluate news authenticity from the perspectives of both consistency and inconsistency. Experiments on three public datasets, including Weibo17, Politifact and GossipCop, reveal the superiority of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Recently, Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) have shown a remarkable generalization performance in 3D perception tasks. However, their effectiveness in large-scale outdoor datasets remains constrained by the scarcity of accurate supervision signals, the extensive noise caused by variable outdoor conditions, and the abundance of unknown objects. In this work, we propose a novel label-free learning method, Adaptive Label Correction (AdaCo), for 3D semantic segmentation. AdaCo first introduces the Cross-modal Label Generation Module (CLGM), providing cross-modal supervision with the formidable interpretive capabilities of the VFMs. Subsequently, AdaCo incorporates the Adaptive Noise Corrector (ANC), updating and adjusting the noisy samples within this supervision iteratively during training. Moreover, we develop an Adaptive Robust Loss (ARL) function to modulate each sample's sensitivity to noisy supervision, preventing potential underfitting issues associated with robust loss. Our proposed AdaCo can effectively mitigate the performance limitations of label-free learning networks in 3D semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments on two outdoor benchmark datasets highlight the superior performance of our method.

- **Summary**: Existing open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) develops methods for testing unseen categories by aligning object region embeddings with corresponding VLM features. A recent study leverages the idea that VLMs implicitly learn compositional structures of semantic concepts within the image. Instead of using an individual region embedding, it utilizes a bag of region embeddings as a new representation to incorporate compositional structures into the OVD task. However, this approach often fails to capture the contextual concepts of each region, leading to noisy compositional structures. This results in only marginal performance improvements and reduced efficiency. To address this, we propose a novel concept-based alignment method that samples a more powerful and efficient compositional structure. Our approach groups contextually related ``concepts'' into a bag and adjusts the scale of concepts within the bag for more effective embedding alignment. Combined with Faster R-CNN, our method achieves improvements of 2.6 box AP50 and 0.5 mask AP over prior work on novel categories in the open-vocabulary COCO and LVIS benchmarks. Furthermore, our method reduces CLIP computation in FLOPs by 80.3% compared to previous research, significantly enhancing efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on the OVD datasets.

- **Summary**: U-Net models with encoder, decoder, and skip-connections components have demonstrated effectiveness in a variety of vision tasks. The skip-connections transmit fine-grained information from the encoder to the decoder. It is necessary to maintain the feature maps used by the skip-connections in memory before the decoding stage. Therefore, they are not friendly to devices with limited resource. In this paper, we propose a universal method and architecture to reduce the memory consumption and meanwhile generate enhanced feature maps to improve network performance. To this end, we design a simple but effective Multi-Scale Information Aggregation Module (MSIAM) in the encoder and an Information Enhancement Module (IEM) in the decoder. The MSIAM aggregates multi-scale feature maps into single-scale with less memory. After that, the aggregated feature maps can be expanded and enhanced to multi-scale feature maps by the IEM. By applying the proposed method on NAFNet, a SOTA model in the field of image restoration, we design a memory-efficient and feature-enhanced network architecture, UNet--. The memory demand by the skip-connections in the UNet-- is reduced by 93.3%, while the performance is improved compared to NAFNet. Furthermore, we show that our proposed method can be generalized to multiple visual tasks, with consistent improvements in both memory consumption and network accuracy compared to the existing efficient architectures.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal learning has achieved remarkable success by integrating information from various modalities, achieving superior performance in tasks like recognition and retrieval compared to uni-modal approaches. However, real-world scenarios often present novel modalities that are unseen during training due to resource and privacy constraints, a challenge current methods struggle to address. This paper introduces Modality Generalization (MG), which focuses on enabling models to generalize to unseen modalities. We define two cases: weak MG, where both seen and unseen modalities can be mapped into a joint embedding space via existing perceptors, and strong MG, where no such mappings exist. To facilitate progress, we propose a comprehensive benchmark featuring multi-modal algorithms and adapt existing methods that focus on generalization. Extensive experiments highlight the complexity of MG, exposing the limitations of existing methods and identifying key directions for future research. Our work provides a foundation for advancing robust and adaptable multi-modal models, enabling them to handle unseen modalities in realistic scenarios.

- **Summary**: Feature Generative Adversarial Networks have emerged as powerful generative models in producing high-quality representations of unseen classes within the scope of Zero-shot Learning (ZSL). This paper delves into the pivotal influence of unseen class priors within the framework of transductive ZSL (TZSL) and illuminates the finding that even a marginal prior bias can result in substantial accuracy declines. Our extensive analysis uncovers that this inefficacy fundamentally stems from the utilization of an unconditional unseen discriminator - a core component in existing TZSL. We further establish that the detrimental effects of this component are inevitable unless the generator perfectly fits class-specific distributions. Building on these insights, we introduce our Improved Feature Generation Framework, termed I-VAEGAN, which incorporates two novel components: Pseudo-conditional Feature Adversarial (PFA) learning and Variational Embedding Regression (VER). PFA circumvents the need for prior estimation by explicitly injecting the predicted semantics as pseudo conditions for unseen classes premised by precise semantic regression. Meanwhile, VER utilizes reconstructive pre-training to learn class statistics, obtaining better semantic regression. Our I-VAEGAN achieves state-of-the-art TZSL accuracy across various benchmarks and priors. Our code would be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Attention mechanism has been extensively integrated within mainstream neural network architectures, such as Transformers and graph attention networks. Yet, its underlying working principles remain somewhat elusive. What is its essence? Are there any connections between it and traditional machine learning algorithms? In this study, we inspect the process of computing similarity using classic metrics and vector space properties in manifold learning, clustering, and supervised learning. We identify the key characteristics of similarity computation and information propagation in these methods and demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism in deep learning adheres to the same principles but operates more flexibly and adaptively. We decompose the self-attention mechanism into a learnable pseudo-metric function and an information propagation process based on similarity computation. We prove that the self-attention mechanism converges to a drift-diffusion process through continuous modeling provided the pseudo-metric is a transformation of a metric and certain reasonable assumptions hold. This equation could be transformed into a heat equation under a new metric. In addition, we give a first-order analysis of attention mechanism with a general pseudo-metric function. This study aids in understanding the effects and principle of attention mechanism through physical intuition. Finally, we propose a modified attention mechanism called metric-attention by leveraging the concept of metric learning to facilitate the ability to learn desired metrics more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms self-attention regarding training efficiency, accuracy, and robustness.

- **Summary**: Video anomaly detection (VAD) has witnessed significant advancements through the integration of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), addressing critical challenges such as interpretability, temporal reasoning, and generalization in dynamic, open-world scenarios. This paper presents an in-depth review of cutting-edge LLM-/VLM-based methods in 2024, focusing on four key aspects: (i) enhancing interpretability through semantic insights and textual explanations, making visual anomalies more understandable; (ii) capturing intricate temporal relationships to detect and localize dynamic anomalies across video frames; (iii) enabling few-shot and zero-shot detection to minimize reliance on large, annotated datasets; and (iv) addressing open-world and class-agnostic anomalies by using semantic understanding and motion features for spatiotemporal coherence. We highlight their potential to redefine the landscape of VAD. Additionally, we explore the synergy between visual and textual modalities offered by LLMs and VLMs, highlighting their combined strengths and proposing future directions to fully exploit the potential in enhancing video anomaly detection.

- **Summary**: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have rapidly advanced, enabling the generation of high-quality images that align closely with textual descriptions. However, this progress has also raised concerns about their misuse for propaganda and other malicious activities. Recent studies reveal that attackers can embed biases into these models through simple fine-tuning, causing them to generate targeted imagery when triggered by specific phrases. This underscores the potential for T2I models to act as tools for disseminating propaganda, producing images aligned with an attacker's objective for end-users.   Building on this concept, we introduce FameBias, a T2I biasing attack that manipulates the embeddings of input prompts to generate images featuring specific public figures. Unlike prior methods, Famebias operates solely on the input embedding vectors without requiring additional model training. We evaluate FameBias comprehensively using Stable Diffusion V2, generating a large corpus of images based on various trigger nouns and target public figures. Our experiments demonstrate that FameBias achieves a high attack success rate while preserving the semantic context of the original prompts across multiple trigger-target pairs.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) have revolutionized machine learning by leveraging large pre-trained models to tackle various downstream tasks. Despite improvements in label, training, and data efficiency, many state-of-the-art VLMs still require task-specific hyperparameter tuning and fail to fully exploit test samples. To overcome these challenges, we propose a graph-based approach for label-efficient adaptation and inference. Our method dynamically constructs a graph over text prompts, few-shot examples, and test samples, using label propagation for inference without task-specific tuning. Unlike existing zero-shot label propagation techniques, our approach requires no additional unlabeled support set and effectively leverages the test sample manifold through dynamic graph expansion. We further introduce a context-aware feature re-weighting mechanism to improve task adaptation accuracy. Additionally, our method supports efficient graph expansion, enabling real-time inductive inference. Extensive evaluations on downstream tasks, such as fine-grained categorization and out-of-distribution generalization, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: In this work, we aim to develop an MLLM that understands and solves questions by learning to create each intermediate step of the reasoning involved till the final answer. To this end, we propose Collective Monte Carlo Tree Search (CoMCTS), a new learning-to-reason method for MLLMs, which introduces the concept of collective learning into ``tree search'' for effective and efficient reasoning-path searching and learning. The core idea of CoMCTS is to leverage collective knowledge from multiple models to collaboratively conjecture, search and identify effective reasoning paths toward correct answers via four iterative operations including Expansion, Simulation and Error Positioning, Backpropagation, and Selection. Using CoMCTS, we construct Mulberry-260k, a multimodal dataset with a tree of rich, explicit and well-defined reasoning nodes for each question. With Mulberry-260k, we perform collective SFT to train our model, Mulberry, a series of MLLMs with o1-like step-by-step Reasoning and Reflection capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods on various benchmarks. Code will be available at https://github.com/HJYao00/Mulberry

- **Summary**: This study mainly explores the application of natural gesture recognition based on computer vision in human-computer interaction, aiming to improve the fluency and naturalness of human-computer interaction through gesture recognition technology. In the fields of virtual reality, augmented reality and smart home, traditional input methods have gradually failed to meet the needs of users for interactive experience. As an intuitive and convenient interaction method, gestures have received more and more attention. This paper proposes a gesture recognition method based on a three-dimensional hand skeleton model. By simulating the three-dimensional spatial distribution of hand joints, a simplified hand skeleton structure is constructed. By connecting the palm and each finger joint, a dynamic and static gesture model of the hand is formed, which further improves the accuracy and efficiency of gesture recognition. Experimental results show that this method can effectively recognize various gestures and maintain high recognition accuracy and real-time response capabilities in different environments. In addition, combined with multimodal technologies such as eye tracking, the intelligence level of the gesture recognition system can be further improved, bringing a richer and more intuitive user experience. In the future, with the continuous development of computer vision, deep learning and multimodal interaction technology, natural interaction based on gestures will play an important role in a wider range of application scenarios and promote revolutionary progress in human-computer interaction.

- **Summary**: Vision Question Answering (VQA) tasks use images to convey critical information to answer text-based questions, which is one of the most common forms of question answering in real-world scenarios. Numerous vision-text models exist today and have performed well on certain VQA tasks. However, these models exhibit significant limitations in understanding human annotations on text-heavy images. To address this, we propose the Human Annotation Understanding and Recognition (HAUR) task. As part of this effort, we introduce the Human Annotation Understanding and Recognition-5 (HAUR-5) dataset, which encompasses five common types of human annotations. Additionally, we developed and trained our model, OCR-Mix. Through comprehensive cross-model comparisons, our results demonstrate that OCR-Mix outperforms other models in this task. Our dataset and model will be released soon .

- **Summary**: Humans naturally rely on floor plans to navigate in unfamiliar environments, as they are readily available, reliable, and provide rich geometrical guidance. However, existing visual navigation settings overlook this valuable prior knowledge, leading to limited efficiency and accuracy. To eliminate this gap, we introduce a novel navigation task: Floor Plan Visual Navigation (FloNa), the first attempt to incorporate floor plan into embodied visual navigation. While the floor plan offers significant advantages, two key challenges emerge: (1) handling the spatial inconsistency between the floor plan and the actual scene layout for collision-free navigation, and (2) aligning observed images with the floor plan sketch despite their distinct modalities. To address these challenges, we propose FloDiff, a novel diffusion policy framework incorporating a localization module to facilitate alignment between the current observation and the floor plan. We further collect $20k$ navigation episodes across $117$ scenes in the iGibson simulator to support the training and evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework in unfamiliar scenes using floor plan knowledge. Project website: https://gauleejx.github.io/flona/.

- **Summary**: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) is a challenging task requiring models to accurately predict familiar categories while minimizing confidence for unknown categories to effectively reject them in unseen domains. While the OSDG field has seen considerable advancements, the impact of label noise--a common issue in real-world datasets--has been largely overlooked. Label noise can mislead model optimization, thereby exacerbating the challenges of open-set recognition in novel domains. In this study, we take the first step towards addressing Open-Set Domain Generalization under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL) by constructing dedicated benchmarks derived from widely used OSDG datasets, including PACS and DigitsDG. We evaluate baseline approaches by integrating techniques from both label denoising and OSDG methodologies, highlighting the limitations of existing strategies in handling label noise effectively. To address these limitations, we propose HyProMeta, a novel framework that integrates hyperbolic category prototypes for label noise-aware meta-learning alongside a learnable new-category agnostic prompt designed to enhance generalization to unseen classes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of HyProMeta compared to state-of-the-art methods across the newly established benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Federated continual learning (FCL) allows each client to continually update its knowledge from task streams, enhancing the applicability of federated learning in real-world scenarios. However, FCL needs to address not only spatial data heterogeneity between clients but also temporal data heterogeneity between tasks. In this paper, empirical experiments demonstrate that such input-level heterogeneity significantly affects the model's internal parameters and outputs, leading to severe spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting of local and previous knowledge. To this end, we propose Federated Tail Anchor (FedTA) to mix trainable Tail Anchor with the frozen output features to adjust their position in the feature space, thereby overcoming parameter-forgetting and output-forgetting. Moreover, three novel components are also included in FedTA: Input Enhancement for improving the performance of pre-trained models on downstream tasks; Selective Input Knowledge Fusion for fusion of heterogeneous local knowledge on the server side; and Best Global Prototype Selection for finding the best anchor point for each class in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedTA not only outperforms existing FCL methods but also effectively preserves the relative positions of features, remaining unaffected by spatial and temporal changes.

- **Summary**: This study presents RSGaussian, an innovative novel view synthesis (NVS) method for aerial remote sensing scenes that incorporate LiDAR point cloud as constraints into the 3D Gaussian Splatting method, which ensures that Gaussians grow and split along geometric benchmarks, addressing the overgrowth and floaters issues occurs. Additionally, the approach introduces coordinate transformations with distortion parameters for camera models to achieve pixel-level alignment between LiDAR point clouds and 2D images, facilitating heterogeneous data fusion and achieving the high-precision geo-alignment required in aerial remote sensing. Depth and plane consistency losses are incorporated into the loss function to guide Gaussians towards real depth and plane representations, significantly improving depth estimation accuracy. Experimental results indicate that our approach has achieved novel view synthesis that balances photo-realistic visual quality and high-precision geometric estimation under aerial remote sensing datasets. Finally, we have also established and open-sourced a dense LiDAR point cloud dataset along with its corresponding aerial multi-view images, AIR-LONGYAN.

- **Summary**: We introduce Switch-a-View, a model that learns to automatically select the viewpoint to display at each timepoint when creating a how-to video. The key insight of our approach is how to train such a model from unlabeled--but human-edited--video samples. We pose a pretext task that pseudo-labels segments in the training videos for their primary viewpoint (egocentric or exocentric), and then discovers the patterns between those view-switch moments on the one hand and the visual and spoken content in the how-to video on the other hand. Armed with this predictor, our model then takes an unseen multi-view video as input and orchestrates which viewpoint should be displayed when. We further introduce a few-shot training setting that permits steering the model towards a new data domain. We demonstrate our idea on a variety of real-world video from HowTo100M and Ego-Exo4D and rigorously validate its advantages.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have emerged as the de facto approach for high-fidelity image synthesis, operating diffusion processes on continuous VAE latent, which significantly differ from the text generation methods employed by Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce a novel generative framework, the Recurrent Diffusion Probabilistic Model (RDPM), which enhances the diffusion process through a recurrent token prediction mechanism, thereby pioneering the field of Discrete Diffusion. By progressively introducing Gaussian noise into the latent representations of images and encoding them into vector-quantized tokens in a recurrent manner, RDPM facilitates a unique diffusion process on discrete-value domains. This process iteratively predicts the token codes for subsequent timesteps, transforming the initial standard Gaussian noise into the source data distribution, aligning with GPT-style models in terms of the loss function. RDPM demonstrates superior performance while benefiting from the speed advantage of requiring only a few inference steps. This model not only leverages the diffusion process to ensure high-quality generation but also converts continuous signals into a series of high-fidelity discrete tokens, thereby maintaining a unified optimization strategy with other discrete tokens, such as text. We anticipate that this work will contribute to the development of a unified model for multimodal generation, specifically by integrating continuous signal domains such as images, videos, and audio with text. We will release the code and model weights to the open-source community.

- **Summary**: Recent vision-language foundation models still frequently produce outputs misaligned with their inputs, evidenced by object hallucination in captioning and prompt misalignment in the text-to-image generation model. Recent studies have explored methods for identifying misaligned elements, aiming not only to enhance interpretability but also to improve model performance. However, current approaches primarily rely on large foundation models in a zero-shot manner or fine-tuned models with human annotations, which limits scalability due to significant computational costs. This work proposes a novel approach, dubbed CLIP4DM, for detecting dense misalignments from pre-trained CLIP, specifically focusing on pinpointing misaligned words between image and text. We carefully revamp the gradient-based attribution computation method, enabling negative gradient of individual text tokens to indicate misalignment. We also propose F-CLIPScore, which aggregates misaligned attributions with a global alignment score. We evaluate our method on various dense misalignment detection benchmarks, covering various image and text domains and misalignment types. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance among zero-shot models and competitive performance with fine-tuned models while maintaining superior efficiency. Our qualitative examples show that our method has a unique strength to detect entity-level objects, intangible objects, and attributes that can not be easily detected for existing works. We conduct ablation studies and analyses to highlight the strengths and limitations of our approach. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/naver-ai/CLIP4DM.

- **Summary**: Mechanobiology is gaining more and more traction as the fundamental role of physical forces in biological function becomes clearer. Forces at the microscale are often measured indirectly using inverse problems such as Traction Force Microscopy because biological experiments are hard to access with physical probes. In contrast with the experimental nature of biology and physics, these measurements do not come with error bars, confidence regions, or p-values. The aim of this manuscript is to publicize this issue and to propose a first step towards a remedy in the form of a general reconstruction framework that enables hypothesis testing.

- **Summary**: ImageNet, an influential dataset in computer vision, is traditionally evaluated using single-label classification, which assumes that an image can be adequately described by a single concept or label. However, this approach may not fully capture the complex semantics within the images available in ImageNet, potentially hindering the development of models that effectively learn these intricacies. This study critically examines the prevalent single-label benchmarking approach and advocates for a shift to multi-label benchmarking for ImageNet. This shift would enable a more comprehensive assessment of the capabilities of deep neural network (DNN) models. We analyze the effectiveness of pre-trained state-of-the-art DNNs on ImageNet and one of its variants, ImageNetV2. Studies in the literature have reported unexpected accuracy drops of 11% to 14% on ImageNetV2. Our findings show that these reported declines are largely attributable to a characteristic of the dataset that has not received sufficient attention -- the proportion of images with multiple labels. Taking this characteristic into account, the results of our experiments provide evidence that there is no substantial degradation in effectiveness on ImageNetV2. Furthermore, we acknowledge that ImageNet pre-trained models exhibit some capability at capturing the multi-label nature of the dataset even though they were trained under the single-label assumption. Consequently, we propose a new evaluation approach to augment existing approaches that assess this capability. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the multi-label nature of the ImageNet dataset during benchmarking. Failing to do so could lead to incorrect conclusions regarding the effectiveness of DNNs and divert research efforts from addressing other substantial challenges related to the reliability and robustness of these models.

- **Summary**: The growing field of remote sensing faces a challenge: the ever-increasing size and volume of imagery data are exceeding the storage and transmission capabilities of satellite platforms. Efficient compression of remote sensing imagery is a critical solution to alleviate these burdens on satellites. However, existing compression methods are often too computationally expensive for satellites. With the continued advancement of compressed sensing theory, single-pixel imaging emerges as a powerful tool that brings new possibilities for on-orbit image compression. However, it still suffers from prolonged imaging times and the inability to perform high-resolution imaging, hindering its practical application. This paper advances the study of compressed sensing in remote sensing image compression, proposing Block Modulated Imaging (BMI). By requiring only a single exposure, BMI significantly enhances imaging acquisition speeds. Additionally, BMI obviates the need for digital micromirror devices and surpasses limitations in image resolution. Furthermore, we propose a novel decoding network specifically designed to reconstruct images compressed under the BMI framework. Leveraging the gated 3D convolutions and promoting efficient information flow across stages through a Two-Way Cross-Attention module, our decoding network exhibits demonstrably superior reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple renowned remote sensing datasets unequivocally demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. To further validate its practical applicability, we developed and tested a prototype of the BMI-based camera, which has shown promising potential for on-orbit image compression.

- **Summary**: Image generation in the fashion domain has predominantly focused on preserving body characteristics or following input prompts, but little attention has been paid to improving the inherent fashionability of the output images. This paper presents a novel diffusion model-based approach that generates fashion images with improved fashionability while maintaining control over key attributes. Key components of our method include: 1) fashionability enhancement, which ensures that the generated images are more fashionable than the input; 2) preservation of body characteristics, encouraging the generated images to maintain the original shape and proportions of the input; and 3) automatic fashion optimization, which does not rely on manual input or external prompts. We also employ two methods to collect training data for guidance while generating and evaluating the images. In particular, we rate outfit images using fashionability scores annotated by multiple fashion experts through OpenSkill-based and five critical aspect-based pairwise comparisons. These methods provide complementary perspectives for assessing and improving the fashionability of the generated images. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms the baseline Fashion++ in generating images with superior fashionability, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing more stylish and appealing fashion images.

- **Summary**: A 3D scene graph represents a compact scene model, storing information about the objects and the semantic relationships between them, making its use promising for robotic tasks. When interacting with a user, an embodied intelligent agent should be capable of responding to various queries about the scene formulated in natural language. Large Language Models (LLMs) are beneficial solutions for user-robot interaction due to their natural language understanding and reasoning abilities. Recent methods for creating learnable representations of 3D scenes have demonstrated the potential to improve the quality of LLMs responses by adapting to the 3D world. However, the existing methods do not explicitly utilize information about the semantic relationships between objects, limiting themselves to information about their coordinates. In this work, we propose a method 3DGraphLLM for constructing a learnable representation of a 3D scene graph. The learnable representation is used as input for LLMs to perform 3D vision-language tasks. In our experiments on popular ScanRefer, RIORefer, Multi3DRefer, ScanQA, Sqa3D, and Scan2cap datasets, we demonstrate the advantage of this approach over baseline methods that do not use information about the semantic relationships between objects.

- **Summary**: Underwater Image Restoration (UIR) remains a challenging task in computer vision due to the complex degradation of images in underwater environments. While recent approaches have leveraged various deep learning techniques, including Transformers and complex, parameter-heavy models to achieve significant improvements in restoration effects, we demonstrate that pure CNN architectures with lightweight parameters can achieve comparable results. In this paper, we introduce UIR-PolyKernel, a novel method for underwater image restoration that leverages Polymorphic Large Kernel CNNs. Our approach uniquely combines large kernel convolutions of diverse sizes and shapes to effectively capture long-range dependencies within underwater imagery. Additionally, we introduce a Hybrid Domain Attention module that integrates frequency and spatial domain attention mechanisms to enhance feature importance. By leveraging the frequency domain, we can capture hidden features that may not be perceptible to humans but are crucial for identifying patterns in both underwater and on-air images. This approach enhances the generalization and robustness of our UIR model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that UIR-PolyKernel achieves state-of-the-art performance in underwater image restoration tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our results show that well-designed pure CNN architectures can effectively compete with more complex models, offering a balance between performance and computational efficiency. This work provides new insights into the potential of CNN-based approaches for challenging image restoration tasks in underwater environments.

- **Summary**: African agriculture is undergoing rapid transformation. Annual maps of crop fields are key to understanding the nature of this transformation, but such maps are currently lacking and must be developed using advanced machine learning models trained on high resolution remote sensing imagery. To enable the development of such models, we delineated field boundaries in 33,746 Planet images captured between 2017 and 2023 across the continent using a custom labeling platform with built-in procedures for assessing and mitigating label error. We collected 42,403 labels, including 7,204 labels arising from tasks dedicated to assessing label quality (Class 1 labels), 32,167 from sites mapped once by a single labeller (Class 2) and 3,032 labels from sites where 3 or more labellers were tasked to map the same location (Class 4). Class 1 labels were used to calculate labeller-specific quality scores, while Class 1 and 4 sites mapped by at least 3 labellers were used to further evaluate label uncertainty using a Bayesian risk metric. Quality metrics showed that label quality was moderately high (0.75) for measures of total field extent, but low regarding the number of individual fields delineated (0.33), and the position of field edges (0.05). These values are expected when delineating small-scale fields in 3-5 m resolution imagery, which can be too coarse to reliably distinguish smaller fields, particularly in dense croplands, and therefore requires substantial labeller judgement. Nevertheless, previous work shows that such labels can train effective field mapping models. Furthermore, this large, probabilistic sample on its own provides valuable insight into regional agricultural characteristics, highlighting variations in the median field size and density. The imagery and vectorized labels along with quality information is available for download from two public repositories.

- **Summary**: This paper presents the Visual Optical Recognition Telemetry EXtraction (VORTEX) system for extracting and analyzing drone telemetry data from First Person View (FPV) Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS) footage. VORTEX employs MMOCR, a PyTorch-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) toolbox, to extract telemetry variables from drone Heads Up Display (HUD) recordings, utilizing advanced image preprocessing techniques, including CLAHE enhancement and adaptive thresholding. The study optimizes spatial accuracy and computational efficiency through systematic investigation of temporal sampling rates (1s, 5s, 10s, 15s, 20s) and coordinate processing methods. Results demonstrate that the 5-second sampling rate, utilizing 4.07% of available frames, provides the optimal balance with a point retention rate of 64% and mean speed accuracy within 4.2% of the 1-second baseline while reducing computational overhead by 80.5%. Comparative analysis of coordinate processing methods reveals that while UTM Zone 33N projection and Haversine calculations provide consistently similar results (within 0.1% difference), raw WGS84 coordinates underestimate distances by 15-30% and speeds by 20-35%. Altitude measurements showed unexpected resilience to sampling rate variations, with only 2.1% variation across all intervals. This research is the first of its kind, providing quantitative benchmarks for establishing a robust framework for drone telemetry extraction and analysis using open-source tools and spatial libraries.

- **Summary**: Despite significant advances in deep learning, current Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems struggle with the inherent complexity of historical documents, including diverse writing styles, degraded text quality, and computational efficiency requirements across multiple languages and time periods. This paper introduces HTR-JAND (HTR-JAND: Handwritten Text Recognition with Joint Attention Network and Knowledge Distillation), an efficient HTR framework that combines advanced feature extraction with knowledge distillation. Our architecture incorporates three key components: (1) a CNN architecture integrating FullGatedConv2d layers with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks for adaptive feature extraction, (2) a Combined Attention mechanism fusing Multi-Head Self-Attention with Proxima Attention for robust sequence modeling, and (3) a Knowledge Distillation framework enabling efficient model compression while preserving accuracy through curriculum-based training. The HTR-JAND framework implements a multi-stage training approach combining curriculum learning, synthetic data generation, and multi-task learning for cross-dataset knowledge transfer. We enhance recognition accuracy through context-aware T5 post-processing, particularly effective for historical documents. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate HTR-JAND's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art Character Error Rates (CER) of 1.23\%, 1.02\%, and 2.02\% on IAM, RIMES, and Bentham datasets respectively. Our Student model achieves a 48\% parameter reduction (0.75M versus 1.5M parameters) while maintaining competitive performance through efficient knowledge transfer.

- **Summary**: Computer Vision (CV) has yet to fully achieve the zero-shot task generalization observed in Natural Language Processing (NLP), despite following many of the milestones established in NLP, such as large transformer models, extensive pre-training, and the auto-regression paradigm, among others. In this paper, we explore the idea that CV adopts discrete and terminological task definitions (\eg, ``image segmentation''), which may be a key barrier to zero-shot task generalization. Our hypothesis is that without truly understanding previously-seen tasks--due to these terminological definitions--deep models struggle to generalize to novel tasks. To verify this, we introduce Explanatory Instructions, which provide an intuitive way to define CV task objectives through detailed linguistic transformations from input images to outputs. We create a large-scale dataset comprising 12 million ``image input $\to$ explanatory instruction $\to$ output'' triplets, and train an auto-regressive-based vision-language model (AR-based VLM) that takes both images and explanatory instructions as input. By learning to follow these instructions, the AR-based VLM achieves instruction-level zero-shot capabilities for previously-seen tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization for unseen CV tasks. Code and dataset will be openly available on our GitHub repository.

- **Summary**: Deformable image registration is a fundamental requirement for medical image analysis. Recently, transformers have been widely used in deep learning-based registration methods for their ability to capture long-range dependency via self-attention (SA). However, the high computation and memory loads of SA (growing quadratically with the spatial resolution) hinder transformers from processing subtle textural information in high-resolution image features, e.g., at the full and half image resolutions. This limits deformable registration as the high-resolution textural information is crucial for finding precise pixel-wise correspondence between subtle anatomical structures. Cross-covariance Attention (XCA), as a "transposed" version of SA that operates across feature channels, has complexity growing linearly with the spatial resolution, providing the feasibility of capturing long-range dependency among high-resolution image features. However, existing XCA-based transformers merely capture coarse global long-range dependency, which are unsuitable for deformable image registration relying primarily on fine-grained local correspondence. In this study, we propose to improve existing deep learning-based registration methods by embedding a new XCA mechanism. To this end, we design an XCA-based transformer block optimized for deformable medical image registration, named Multi-Axis XCA (MAXCA). Our MAXCA serves as a general network block that can be embedded into various registration network architectures. It can capture both global and local long-range dependency among high-resolution image features by applying regional and dilated XCA in parallel via a multi-axis design. Extensive experiments on two well-benchmarked inter-/intra-patient registration tasks with seven public medical datasets demonstrate that our MAXCA block enables state-of-the-art registration performance.

- **Summary**: Despite advances in neural rendering, due to the scarcity of high-quality 3D datasets and the inherent limitations of multi-view diffusion models, view synthesis and 3D model generation are restricted to low resolutions with suboptimal multi-view consistency. In this study, we present a novel 3D enhancement pipeline, dubbed 3DEnhancer, which employs a multi-view latent diffusion model to enhance coarse 3D inputs while preserving multi-view consistency. Our method includes a pose-aware encoder and a diffusion-based denoiser to refine low-quality multi-view images, along with data augmentation and a multi-view attention module with epipolar aggregation to maintain consistent, high-quality 3D outputs across views. Unlike existing video-based approaches, our model supports seamless multi-view enhancement with improved coherence across diverse viewing angles. Extensive evaluations show that 3DEnhancer significantly outperforms existing methods, boosting both multi-view enhancement and per-instance 3D optimization tasks.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based 3D imaging, in particular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is challenging because of limited availability of 3D training data. Therefore, 2D diffusion models trained on 2D slices are starting to be leveraged for 3D MRI reconstruction. However, as we show in this paper, existing methods pertain to a fixed voxel size, and performance degrades when the voxel size is varied, as it is often the case in clinical practice. In this paper, we propose and study several approaches for resolution-robust 3D MRI reconstruction with 2D diffusion priors. As a result of this investigation, we obtain a simple resolution-robust variational 3D reconstruction approach based on diffusion-guided regularization of randomly sampled 2D slices. This method provides competitive reconstruction quality compared to posterior sampling baselines. Towards resolving the sensitivity to resolution-shifts, we investigate state-of-the-art model-based approaches including Gaussian splatting, neural representations, and infinite-dimensional diffusion models, as well as a simple data-centric approach of training the diffusion model on several resolutions. Our experiments demonstrate that the model-based approaches fail to close the performance gap in 3D MRI. In contrast, the data-centric approach of training the diffusion model on various resolutions effectively provides a resolution-robust method without compromising accuracy.

- **Summary**: Tumor synthesis can generate examples that AI often misses or over-detects, improving AI performance by training on these challenging cases. However, existing synthesis methods, which are typically unconditional -- generating images from random variables -- or conditioned only by tumor shapes, lack controllability over specific tumor characteristics such as texture, heterogeneity, boundaries, and pathology type. As a result, the generated tumors may be overly similar or duplicates of existing training data, failing to effectively address AI's weaknesses. We propose a new text-driven tumor synthesis approach, termed TextoMorph, that provides textual control over tumor characteristics. This is particularly beneficial for examples that confuse the AI the most, such as early tumor detection (increasing Sensitivity by +8.5%), tumor segmentation for precise radiotherapy (increasing DSC by +6.3%), and classification between benign and malignant tumors (improving Sensitivity by +8.2%). By incorporating text mined from radiology reports into the synthesis process, we increase the variability and controllability of the synthetic tumors to target AI's failure cases more precisely. Moreover, TextoMorph uses contrastive learning across different texts and CT scans, significantly reducing dependence on scarce image-report pairs (only 141 pairs used in this study) by leveraging a large corpus of 34,035 radiology reports. Finally, we have developed rigorous tests to evaluate synthetic tumors, including Text-Driven Visual Turing Test and Radiomics Pattern Analysis, showing that our synthetic tumors is realistic and diverse in texture, heterogeneity, boundaries, and pathology.

- **Summary**: Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a serious medical condition that presents significant diagnostic challenges, particularly in settings with limited access to healthcare resources. Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) has emerged as a powerful diagnostic tool for visualizing the GI tract, but it requires time-consuming manual analysis by experienced gastroenterologists, which is prone to human error and inefficient given the increasing number of patients.To address this challenge, we propose ClassifyViStA, an AI-based framework designed for the automated detection and classification of bleeding and non-bleeding frames from WCE videos. The model consists of a standard classification path, augmented by two specialized branches: an implicit attention branch and a segmentation branch.The attention branch focuses on the bleeding regions, while the segmentation branch generates accurate segmentation masks, which are used for classification and interpretability. The model is built upon an ensemble of ResNet18 and VGG16 architectures to enhance classification performance. For the bleeding region detection, we implement a Soft Non-Maximum Suppression (Soft NMS) approach with YOLOv8, which improves the handling of overlapping bounding boxes, resulting in more accurate and nuanced detections.The system's interpretability is enhanced by using the segmentation masks to explain the classification results, offering insights into the decision-making process similar to the way a gastroenterologist identifies bleeding regions. Our approach not only automates the detection of GI bleeding but also provides an interpretable solution that can ease the burden on healthcare professionals and improve diagnostic efficiency. Our code is available at ClassifyViStA.

- **Summary**: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) produce high-quality, photo-realistic images, however, the latency incurred by multiple costly inference iterations can restrict their applicability. We introduce LatentCRF, a continuous Conditional Random Field (CRF) model, implemented as a neural network layer, that models the spatial and semantic relationships among the latent vectors in the LDM. By replacing some of the computationally-intensive LDM inference iterations with our lightweight LatentCRF, we achieve a superior balance between quality, speed and diversity. We increase inference efficiency by 33% with no loss in image quality or diversity compared to the full LDM. LatentCRF is an easy add-on, which does not require modifying the LDM.

- **Summary**: Sora-like video generation models have achieved remarkable progress with a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer MM-DiT architecture. However, the current video generation models predominantly focus on single-prompt, struggling to generate coherent scenes with multiple sequential prompts that better reflect real-world dynamic scenarios. While some pioneering works have explored multi-prompt video generation, they face significant challenges including strict training data requirements, weak prompt following, and unnatural transitions. To address these problems, we propose DiTCtrl, a training-free multi-prompt video generation method under MM-DiT architectures for the first time. Our key idea is to take the multi-prompt video generation task as temporal video editing with smooth transitions. To achieve this goal, we first analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism, finding that the 3D full attention behaves similarly to that of the cross/self-attention blocks in the UNet-like diffusion models, enabling mask-guided precise semantic control across different prompts with attention sharing for multi-prompt video generation. Based on our careful design, the video generated by DiTCtrl achieves smooth transitions and consistent object motion given multiple sequential prompts without additional training. Besides, we also present MPVBench, a new benchmark specially designed for multi-prompt video generation to evaluate the performance of multi-prompt generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without additional training.

- **Summary**: Human-scene interaction (HSI) generation is crucial for applications in embodied AI, virtual reality, and robotics. While existing methods can synthesize realistic human motions in 3D scenes and generate plausible human-object interactions, they heavily rely on datasets containing paired 3D scene and motion capture data, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect across diverse environments and interactions. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis by integrating video generation and neural human rendering. Our key insight is to leverage the rich motion priors learned by state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.

- **Summary**: Classifiers are important components in many computer vision tasks, serving as the foundational backbone of a wide variety of models employed across diverse applications. However, understanding the decision-making process of classifiers remains a significant challenge. We propose DiffEx, a novel method that leverages the capabilities of text-to-image diffusion models to explain classifier decisions. Unlike traditional GAN-based explainability models, which are limited to simple, single-concept analyses and typically require training a new model for each classifier, our approach can explain classifiers that focus on single concepts (such as faces or animals) as well as those that handle complex scenes involving multiple concepts. DiffEx employs vision-language models to create a hierarchical list of semantics, allowing users to identify not only the overarching semantic influences on classifiers (e.g., the 'beard' semantic in a facial classifier) but also their sub-types, such as 'goatee' or 'Balbo' beard. Our experiments demonstrate that DiffEx is able to cover a significantly broader spectrum of semantics compared to its GAN counterparts, providing a hierarchical tool that delivers a more detailed and fine-grained understanding of classifier decisions.

- **Summary**: Orientation is a key attribute of objects, crucial for understanding their spatial pose and arrangement in images. However, practical solutions for accurate orientation estimation from a single image remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce Orient Anything, the first expert and foundational model designed to estimate object orientation in a single- and free-view image. Due to the scarcity of labeled data, we propose extracting knowledge from the 3D world. By developing a pipeline to annotate the front face of 3D objects and render images from random views, we collect 2M images with precise orientation annotations. To fully leverage the dataset, we design a robust training objective that models the 3D orientation as probability distributions of three angles and predicts the object orientation by fitting these distributions. Besides, we employ several strategies to improve synthetic-to-real transfer. Our model achieves state-of-the-art orientation estimation accuracy in both rendered and real images and exhibits impressive zero-shot ability in various scenarios. More importantly, our model enhances many applications, such as comprehension and generation of complex spatial concepts and 3D object pose adjustment.

- **Summary**: World model-based searching and planning are widely recognized as a promising path toward human-level physical intelligence. However, current driving world models primarily rely on video diffusion models, which specialize in visual generation but lack the flexibility to incorporate other modalities like action. In contrast, autoregressive transformers have demonstrated exceptional capability in modeling multimodal data. Our work aims to unify both driving model simulation and trajectory planning into a single sequence modeling problem. We introduce a multimodal driving language based on interleaved image and action tokens, and develop DrivingGPT to learn joint world modeling and planning through standard next-token prediction. Our DrivingGPT demonstrates strong performance in both action-conditioned video generation and end-to-end planning, outperforming strong baselines on large-scale nuPlan and NAVSIM benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Text- or image-to-3D generators and 3D scanners can now produce 3D assets with high-quality shapes and textures. These assets typically consist of a single, fused representation, like an implicit neural field, a Gaussian mixture, or a mesh, without any useful structure. However, most applications and creative workflows require assets to be made of several meaningful parts that can be manipulated independently. To address this gap, we introduce PartGen, a novel approach that generates 3D objects composed of meaningful parts starting from text, an image, or an unstructured 3D object. First, given multiple views of a 3D object, generated or rendered, a multi-view diffusion model extracts a set of plausible and view-consistent part segmentations, dividing the object into parts. Then, a second multi-view diffusion model takes each part separately, fills in the occlusions, and uses those completed views for 3D reconstruction by feeding them to a 3D reconstruction network. This completion process considers the context of the entire object to ensure that the parts integrate cohesively. The generative completion model can make up for the information missing due to occlusions; in extreme cases, it can hallucinate entirely invisible parts based on the input 3D asset. We evaluate our method on generated and real 3D assets and show that it outperforms segmentation and part-extraction baselines by a large margin. We also showcase downstream applications such as 3D part editing.

- **Summary**: We present an efficient encoder-free approach for video-language understanding that achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. Current video-language models typically rely on heavyweight image encoders (300M-1.1B parameters) or video encoders (1B-1.4B parameters), creating a substantial computational burden when processing multi-frame videos. Our method introduces a novel Spatio-Temporal Alignment Block (STAB) that directly processes video inputs without requiring pre-trained encoders while using only 45M parameters for visual processing - at least a 6.5$\times$ reduction compared to traditional approaches. The STAB architecture combines Local Spatio-Temporal Encoding for fine-grained feature extraction, efficient spatial downsampling through learned attention and separate mechanisms for modeling frame-level and video-level relationships. Our model achieves comparable or superior performance to encoder-based approaches for open-ended video question answering on standard benchmarks. The fine-grained video question-answering evaluation demonstrates our model's effectiveness, outperforming the encoder-based approaches Video-ChatGPT and Video-LLaVA in key aspects like correctness and temporal understanding. Extensive ablation studies validate our architectural choices and demonstrate the effectiveness of our spatio-temporal modeling approach while achieving 3-4$\times$ faster processing speeds than previous methods.
