- **Summary**: Image editing technologies are tools used to transform, adjust, remove, or otherwise alter images. Recent research has significantly improved the capabilities of image editing tools, enabling the creation of photorealistic and semantically informed forged regions that are nearly indistinguishable from authentic imagery, presenting new challenges in digital forensics and media credibility. While current image forensic techniques are adept at localizing forged regions produced by traditional image manipulation methods, current capabilities struggle to localize regions created by diffusion-based techniques. To bridge this gap, we present a novel framework that integrates a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) for enhanced reasoning capabilities to localize tampered regions in images produced by diffusion model-based editing methods. By leveraging the contextual and semantic strengths of LLMs, our framework achieves promising results on MagicBrush, AutoSplice, and PerfBrush (novel diffusion-based dataset) datasets, outperforming previous approaches in mIoU and F1-score metrics. Notably, our method excels on the PerfBrush dataset, a self-constructed test set featuring previously unseen types of edits. Here, where traditional methods typically falter, achieving markedly low scores, our approach demonstrates promising performance.

- **Summary**: Automatic detection of prohibited items in X-ray images plays a crucial role in public security. However, existing methods rely heavily on labor-intensive box annotations. To address this, we investigate X-ray prohibited item detection under labor-efficient point supervision and develop an intra-inter objectness learning network (I$^2$OL-Net). I$^2$OL-Net consists of two key modules: an intra-modality objectness learning (intra-OL) module and an inter-modality objectness learning (inter-OL) module. The intra-OL module designs a local focus Gaussian masking block and a global random Gaussian masking block to collaboratively learn the objectness in X-ray images. Meanwhile, the inter-OL module introduces the wavelet decomposition-based adversarial learning block and the objectness block, effectively reducing the modality discrepancy and transferring the objectness knowledge learned from natural images with box annotations to X-ray images. Based on the above, I$^2$OL-Net greatly alleviates the problem of part domination caused by severe intra-class variations in X-ray images. Experimental results on four X-ray datasets show that I$^2$OL-Net can achieve superior performance with a significant reduction of annotation cost, thus enhancing its accessibility and practicality.

- **Summary**: Foreground-conditioned inpainting aims to seamlessly fill the background region of an image by utilizing the provided foreground subject and a text description. While existing T2I-based image inpainting methods can be applied to this task, they suffer from issues of subject shape expansion, distortion, or impaired ability to align with the text description, resulting in inconsistencies between the visual elements and the text description. To address these challenges, we propose Pinco, a plug-and-play foreground-conditioned inpainting adapter that generates high-quality backgrounds with good text alignment while effectively preserving the shape of the foreground subject. Firstly, we design a Self-Consistent Adapter that integrates the foreground subject features into the layout-related self-attention layer, which helps to alleviate conflicts between the text and subject features by ensuring that the model can effectively consider the foreground subject's characteristics while processing the overall image layout. Secondly, we design a Decoupled Image Feature Extraction method that employs distinct architectures to extract semantic and shape features separately, significantly improving subject feature extraction and ensuring high-quality preservation of the subject's shape. Thirdly, to ensure precise utilization of the extracted features and to focus attention on the subject region, we introduce a Shared Positional Embedding Anchor, greatly improving the model's understanding of subject features and boosting training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance and efficiency in foreground-conditioned inpainting.

- **Summary**: Image Restoration aims to restore degraded images, with deep learning, especially CNNs and Transformers, enhancing performance. However, there's a lack of a unified training benchmark for IR. We identified a bias in image complexity between training and testing datasets, affecting restoration quality. To address this, we created ReSyn, a large-scale IR dataset with balanced complexity, including real and synthetic images. We also established a unified training standard for IR models. Our RWKV-IR model integrates linear complexity RWKV into transformers for global and local receptive fields. It replaces Q-Shift with Depth-wise Convolution for local dependencies and combines Bi-directional attention for global-local awareness. The Cross-Bi-WKV module balances horizontal and vertical attention. Experiments show RWKV-IR's effectiveness in image restoration.

- **Summary**: Industrial anomaly classification (AC) is an indispensable task in industrial manufacturing, which guarantees quality and safety of various product. To address the scarcity of data in industrial scenarios, lots of few-shot anomaly detection methods emerge recently. In this paper, we propose an effective few-shot anomaly classification (FSAC) framework with one-stage training, dubbed CLIP-FSAC++. Specifically, we introduce a cross-modality interaction module named Anomaly Descriptor following image and text encoders, which enhances the correlation of visual and text embeddings and adapts the representations of CLIP from pre-trained data to target data. In anomaly descriptor, image-to-text cross-attention module is used to obtain image-specific text embeddings and text-to-image cross-attention module is used to obtain text-specific visual embeddings. Then these modality-specific embeddings are used to enhance original representations of CLIP for better matching ability. Comprehensive experiment results are provided for evaluating our method in few-normal shot anomaly classification on VisA and MVTEC-AD for 1, 2, 4 and 8-shot settings.

- **Summary**: Image Compression for Machines (ICM) aims to compress images for machine vision tasks rather than human viewing. Current works predominantly concentrate on high-level tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation. However, the quality of original images is usually not guaranteed in the real world, leading to even worse perceptual quality or downstream task performance after compression. Low-level (LL) machine vision models, like image restoration models, can help improve such quality, and thereby their compression requirements should also be considered. In this paper, we propose a pioneered ICM framework for LL machine vision tasks, namely LL-ICM. By jointly optimizing compression and LL tasks, the proposed LL-ICM not only enriches its encoding ability in generalizing to versatile LL tasks but also optimizes the processing ability of down-stream LL task models, achieving mutual adaptation for image codecs and LL task models. Furthermore, we integrate large-scale vision-language models into the LL-ICM framework to generate more universal and distortion-robust feature embeddings for LL vision tasks. Therefore, one LL-ICM codec can generalize to multiple tasks. We establish a solid benchmark to evaluate LL-ICM, which includes extensive objective experiments by using both full and no-reference image quality assessments. Experimental results show that LL-ICM can achieve 22.65% BD-rate reductions over the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Generating high-quality novel view renderings of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in scenes featuring transient objects is challenging. We propose a novel hybrid representation, termed as HybridGS, using 2D Gaussians for transient objects per image and maintaining traditional 3D Gaussians for the whole static scenes. Note that, the 3DGS itself is better suited for modeling static scenes that assume multi-view consistency, but the transient objects appear occasionally and do not adhere to the assumption, thus we model them as planar objects from a single view, represented with 2D Gaussians. Our novel representation decomposes the scene from the perspective of fundamental viewpoint consistency, making it more reasonable. Additionally, we present a novel multi-view regulated supervision method for 3DGS that leverages information from co-visible regions, further enhancing the distinctions between the transients and statics. Then, we propose a straightforward yet effective multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust training and high-quality view synthesis across various settings. Experiments on benchmark datasets show our state-of-the-art performance of novel view synthesis in both indoor and outdoor scenes, even in the presence of distracting elements.

- **Summary**: Professional photo editing remains challenging, requiring extensive knowledge of imaging pipelines and significant expertise. With the ubiquity of smartphone photography, there is an increasing demand for accessible yet sophisticated image editing solutions. While recent deep learning approaches, particularly style transfer methods, have attempted to automate this process, they often struggle with output fidelity, editing control, and complex retouching capabilities. We propose a novel retouch transfer approach that learns from professional edits through before-after image pairs, enabling precise replication of complex editing operations. To facilitate this research direction, we introduce a comprehensive Photo Retouching Dataset comprising 100,000 high-quality images edited using over 170 professional Adobe Lightroom presets. We develop a context-aware Implicit Neural Representation that learns to apply edits adaptively based on image content and context, requiring no pretraining and capable of learning from a single example. Our method extracts implicit transformations from reference edits and adaptively applies them to new images. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach not only surpasses existing methods in photo retouching but also enhances performance in related image reconstruction tasks like Gamut Mapping and Raw Reconstruction. By bridging the gap between professional editing capabilities and automated solutions, our work presents a significant step toward making sophisticated photo editing more accessible while maintaining high-fidelity results.

- **Summary**: Converting mathematical expressions into LaTeX is challenging. In this paper, we explore using newer transformer based architectures for addressing the problem of converting handwritten/digital mathematical expression images into equivalent LaTeX code. We use the current state of the art CNN encoder and RNN decoder as a baseline for our experiments. We also investigate improvements to CNN-RNN architecture by replacing the CNN encoder with the ResNet50 model. Our experiments show that transformer architectures achieve a higher overall accuracy and BLEU scores along with lower Levenschtein scores compared to the baseline CNN/RNN architecture with room to achieve even better results with appropriate fine-tuning of model parameters.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have been recognized for their ability to generate images that are not only visually appealing but also of high artistic quality. As a result, Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation has been proposed to leverage region-specific positions and descriptions to enable more precise and controllable generation. However, previous methods primarily focus on UNet-based models (e.g., SD1.5 and SDXL), and limited effort has explored Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs), which have demonstrated powerful image generation capabilities. Enabling MM-DiT for layout-to-image generation seems straightforward but is challenging due to the complexity of how layout is introduced, integrated, and balanced among multiple modalities. To this end, we explore various network variants to efficiently incorporate layout guidance into MM-DiT, and ultimately present SiamLayout. To Inherit the advantages of MM-DiT, we use a separate set of network weights to process the layout, treating it as equally important as the image and text modalities. Meanwhile, to alleviate the competition among modalities, we decouple the image-layout interaction into a siamese branch alongside the image-text one and fuse them in the later stage. Moreover, we contribute a large-scale layout dataset, named LayoutSAM, which includes 2.7 million image-text pairs and 10.7 million entities. Each entity is annotated with a bounding box and a detailed description. We further construct the LayoutSAM-Eval benchmark as a comprehensive tool for evaluating the L2I generation quality. Finally, we introduce the Layout Designer, which taps into the potential of large language models in layout planning, transforming them into experts in layout generation and optimization. Our code, model, and dataset will be available at https://creatilayout.github.io.

- **Summary**: Beyond the success of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), recent trends mark a shift toward exploring the applicability of lightweight vision-language models for resource-constrained scenarios. These models often deliver suboptimal performance when relying solely on a single image-text contrastive learning objective, spotlighting the need for more effective training mechanisms that guarantee robust cross-modal feature alignment. In this work, we propose CLIP-PING: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training with Proximus Intrinsic Neighbors Guidance, a simple and efficient training paradigm designed to boost the performance of lightweight vision-language models with minimal computational overhead and lower data demands. CLIP-PING bootstraps unimodal features extracted from arbitrary pre-trained encoders to obtain intrinsic guidance of proximus neighbor samples, i.e., nearest-neighbor (NN) and cross nearest-neighbor (XNN). We find that extra contrastive supervision from these neighbors substantially boosts cross-modal alignment, enabling lightweight models to learn more generic features with rich semantic diversity. Extensive experiments reveal that CLIP-PING notably surpasses its peers in zero-shot generalization and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Specifically, a 5.5% gain on zero-shot ImageNet1K with 10.7% (I2T) and 5.7% (T2I) on Flickr30K, compared to the original CLIP when using ViT-XS image encoder trained on 3 million (image, text) pairs. Moreover, CLIP-PING showcases strong transferability under the linear evaluation protocol across several downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models are widely recognized for their ability to generate high-quality and diverse images based on text prompts. However, despite recent advances, these models are still prone to generating unsafe images containing sensitive or inappropriate content, which can be harmful to users. Current efforts to prevent inappropriate image generation for diffusion models are easy to bypass and vulnerable to adversarial attacks. How to ensure that T2I models align with specific safety goals remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel, training-free approach, called Prompt-Noise Optimization (PNO), to mitigate unsafe image generation. Our method introduces a novel optimization framework that leverages both the continuous prompt embedding and the injected noise trajectory in the sampling process to generate safe images. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in suppressing toxic image generations and demonstrates robustness to adversarial attacks, without needing to tune the model parameters. Furthermore, compared with existing methods, PNO uses comparable generation time while offering the best tradeoff between the conflicting goals of safe generation and prompt-image alignment.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of several streaming services in recent years has now made it possible for a diverse audience across the world to view the same media content, such as movies or TV shows. While translation and dubbing services are being added to make content accessible to the local audience, the support for making content accessible to people with different abilities, such as the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) community, is still lagging. Our goal is to make media content more accessible to the DHH community by generating sign language videos with synthetic signers that are realistic and expressive. Using the same signer for a given media content that is viewed globally may have limited appeal. Hence, our approach combines parametric modeling and generative modeling to generate realistic-looking synthetic signers and customize their appearance based on user preferences. We first retarget human sign language poses to 3D sign language avatars by optimizing a parametric model. The high-fidelity poses from the rendered avatars are then used to condition the poses of synthetic signers generated using a diffusion-based generative model. The appearance of the synthetic signer is controlled by an image prompt supplied through a visual adapter. Our results show that the sign language videos generated using our approach have better temporal consistency and realism than signing videos generated by a diffusion model conditioned only on text prompts. We also support multimodal prompts to allow users to further customize the appearance of the signer to accommodate diversity (e.g. skin tone, gender). Our approach is also useful for signer anonymization.

- **Summary**: Maritime environmental sensing requires overcoming challenges from complex conditions such as harsh weather, platform perturbations, large dynamic objects, and the requirement for long detection ranges. While cameras and LiDAR are commonly used in ground vehicle navigation, their applicability in maritime settings is limited by range constraints and hardware maintenance issues. Radar sensors, however, offer robust long-range detection capabilities and resilience to physical contamination from weather and saline conditions, making it a powerful sensor for maritime navigation. Among various radar types, X-band radar (e.g., marine radar) is widely employed for maritime vessel navigation, providing effective long-range detection essential for situational awareness and collision avoidance. Nevertheless, it exhibits limitations during berthing operations where close-range object detection is critical. To address this shortcoming, we incorporate W-band radar (e.g., Navtech imaging radar), which excels in detecting nearby objects with a higher update rate. We present a comprehensive maritime sensor dataset featuring multi-range detection capabilities. This dataset integrates short-range LiDAR data, medium-range W-band radar data, and long-range X-band radar data into a unified framework. Additionally, it includes object labels for oceanic object detection usage, derived from radar and stereo camera images. The dataset comprises seven sequences collected from diverse regions with varying levels of estimation difficulty, ranging from easy to challenging, and includes common locations suitable for global localization tasks. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing research in place recognition, odometry estimation, SLAM, object detection, and dynamic object elimination within maritime environments.

- **Summary**: For designing a wide range of everyday objects, the design process should be aware of both the human body and the underlying semantics of the design specification. However, these two objectives present significant challenges to the current AI-based designing tools. In this work, we present a method to synthesize body-aware 3D objects from a base mesh given an input body geometry and either text or image as guidance. The generated objects can be simulated on virtual characters, or fabricated for real-world use. We propose to use a mesh deformation procedure that optimizes for both semantic alignment as well as contact and penetration losses. Using our method, users can generate both virtual or real-world objects from text, image, or sketch, without the need for manual artist intervention. We present both qualitative and quantitative results on various object categories, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: Deep learning (DL) has been widely applied into hyperspectral image (HSI) classification owing to its promising feature learning and representation capabilities. However, limited by the spatial resolution of sensors, existing DL-based classification approaches mainly focus on pixel-level spectral and spatial information extraction through complex network architecture design, while ignoring the existence of mixed pixels in actual scenarios. To tackle this difficulty, we propose a novel dual-branch subpixel-guided network for HSI classification, called DSNet, which automatically integrates subpixel information and convolutional class features by introducing a deep autoencoder unmixing architecture to enhance classification performance. DSNet is capable of fully considering physically nonlinear properties within subpixels and adaptively generating diagnostic abundances in an unsupervised manner to achieve more reliable decision boundaries for class label distributions. The subpixel fusion module is designed to ensure high-quality information fusion across pixel and subpixel features, further promoting stable joint classification. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of DSNet compared with state-of-the-art DL-based HSI classification approaches. The codes will be available at https://github.com/hanzhu97702/DSNet, contributing to the remote sensing community.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models excel in generating high-quality images. However, current diffusion models struggle to produce reliable images without guidance methods, such as classifier-free guidance (CFG). Are guidance methods truly necessary? Observing that noise obtained via diffusion inversion can reconstruct high-quality images without guidance, we focus on the initial noise of the denoising pipeline. By mapping Gaussian noise to `guidance-free noise', we uncover that small low-magnitude low-frequency components significantly enhance the denoising process, removing the need for guidance and thus improving both inference throughput and memory. Expanding on this, we propose \ours, a novel method that replaces guidance methods with a single refinement of the initial noise. This refined noise enables high-quality image generation without guidance, within the same diffusion pipeline. Our noise-refining model leverages efficient noise-space learning, achieving rapid convergence and strong performance with just 50K text-image pairs. We validate its effectiveness across diverse metrics and analyze how refined noise can eliminate the need for guidance. See our project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/NoiseRefine/.

- **Summary**: Cross-scene image classification aims to transfer prior knowledge of ground materials to annotate regions with different distributions and reduce hand-crafted cost in the field of remote sensing. However, existing approaches focus on single-source domain generalization to unseen target domains, and are easily confused by large real-world domain shifts due to the limited training information and insufficient diversity modeling capacity. To address this gap, we propose a novel multi-source collaborative domain generalization framework (MS-CDG) based on homogeneity and heterogeneity characteristics of multi-source remote sensing data, which considers data-aware adversarial augmentation and model-aware multi-level diversification simultaneously to enhance cross-scene generalization performance. The data-aware adversarial augmentation adopts an adversary neural network with semantic guide to generate MS samples by adaptively learning realistic channel and distribution changes across domains. In views of cross-domain and intra-domain modeling, the model-aware diversification transforms the shared spatial-channel features of MS data into the class-wise prototype and kernel mixture module, to address domain discrepancies and cluster different classes effectively. Finally, the joint classification of original and augmented MS samples is employed by introducing a distribution consistency alignment to increase model diversity and ensure better domain-invariant representation learning. Extensive experiments on three public MS remote sensing datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method when benchmarked with the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Large-scale dynamic three-dimensional (3D) photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is significantly important in clinical applications. In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption. The project for 4D SlingBAG can be found in the following GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}.

- **Summary**: Incremental anomaly detection sequentially recognizes abnormal regions in novel categories for dynamic industrial scenarios. This remains highly challenging due to knowledge overwriting and feature conflicts, leading to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose ONER, an end-to-end ONline Experience Replay method, which efficiently mitigates catastrophic forgetting while adapting to new tasks with minimal cost. Specifically, our framework utilizes two types of experiences from past tasks: decomposed prompts and semantic prototypes, addressing both model parameter updates and feature optimization. The decomposed prompts consist of learnable components that assemble to produce attention-conditioned prompts. These prompts reuse previously learned knowledge, enabling model to learn novel tasks effectively. The semantic prototypes operate at both pixel and image levels, performing regularization in the latent feature space to prevent forgetting across various tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in incremental anomaly detection with significantly reduced forgetting, as well as efficiently adapting to new categories with minimal costs. These results confirm the efficiency and stability of ONER, making it a powerful solution for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Targeted poisoning attacks aim to compromise the model's prediction on specific target samples. In a common clean-label setting, they are achieved by slightly perturbing a subset of training samples given access to those specific targets. Despite continuous efforts, it remains unexplored whether such attacks can generalize to unknown variations of those targets. In this paper, we take the first step to systematically study this generalization problem. Observing that the widely adopted, cosine similarity-based attack exhibits limited generalizability, we propose a well-generalizable attack that leverages both the direction and magnitude of model gradients. In particular, we explore diverse target variations, such as an object with varied viewpoints and an animal species with distinct appearances. Extensive experiments across various generalization scenarios demonstrate that our method consistently achieves the best attack effectiveness. For example, our method outperforms the cosine similarity-based attack by 20.95% in attack success rate with similar overall accuracy, averaged over four models on two image benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular video is critical for real-world applications. This paper tackles the dual challenges of dynamic novel-view synthesis and 3D geometry reconstruction by introducing a hybrid framework: Deformable Gaussian Splatting and Dynamic Neural Surfaces (DGNS), in which both modules can leverage each other for both tasks. During training, depth maps generated by the deformable Gaussian splatting module guide the ray sampling for faster processing and provide depth supervision within the dynamic neural surface module to improve geometry reconstruction. Simultaneously, the dynamic neural surface directs the distribution of Gaussian primitives around the surface, enhancing rendering quality. To further refine depth supervision, we introduce a depth-filtering process on depth maps derived from Gaussian rasterization. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that DGNS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both novel-view synthesis and 3D reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Autonomous agents often require accurate methods for detecting and localizing changes in their environment, particularly when observations are captured from unconstrained and inconsistent viewpoints. We propose a novel label-free, pose-agnostic change detection method that integrates information from multiple viewpoints to construct a change-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation of the scene. With as few as 5 images of the post-change scene, our approach can learn additional change channels in a 3DGS and produce change masks that outperform single-view techniques. Our change-aware 3D scene representation additionally enables the generation of accurate change masks for unseen viewpoints. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in complex multi-object scenes, achieving a 1.7$\times$ and 1.6$\times$ improvement in Mean Intersection Over Union and F1 score respectively over other baselines. We also contribute a new real-world dataset to benchmark change detection in diverse challenging scenes in the presence of lighting variations.

- **Summary**: Deep learning techniques have proven highly effective in image classification, but their deployment in resourceconstrained environments remains challenging due to high computational demands. Furthermore, their interpretability is of high importance which demands even more available resources. In this work, we introduce an approach that combines saliency-guided training with quantization techniques to create an interpretable and resource-efficient model without compromising accuracy. We utilize Parameterized Clipping Activation (PACT) to perform quantization-aware training, specifically targeting activations and weights to optimize precision while minimizing resource usage. Concurrently, saliency-guided training is employed to enhance interpretability by iteratively masking features with low gradient values, leading to more focused and meaningful saliency maps. This training procedure helps in mitigating noisy gradients and yields models that provide clearer, more interpretable insights into their decision-making processes. To evaluate the impact of our approach, we conduct experiments using famous Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architecture on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 benchmark datasets as two popular datasets. We compare the saliency maps generated by standard and quantized models to assess the influence of quantization on both interpretability and classification accuracy. Our results demonstrate that the combined use of saliency-guided training and PACT-based quantization not only maintains classification performance but also produces models that are significantly more efficient and interpretable, making them suitable for deployment in resource-limited settings.

- **Summary**: Motion artifacts caused by prolonged acquisition time are a significant challenge in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), hindering accurate tissue segmentation. These artifacts appear as blurred images that mimic tissue-like appearances, making segmentation difficult. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework that demonstrates superior performance in both motion correction and robust brain tissue segmentation in the presence of artifacts. The core concept lies in a complementary process: a disentanglement learning network progressively removes artifacts, leading to cleaner images and consequently, more accurate segmentation by a jointly trained motion estimation and segmentation network. This network generates three outputs: a motioncorrected image, a motion deformation map that identifies artifact-affected regions, and a brain tissue segmentation mask. This deformation serves as a guidance mechanism for the disentanglement process, aiding the model in recovering lost information or removing artificial structures introduced by the artifacts. Extensive in-vivo experiments on pediatric motion data demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmenting motion-corrupted MRI scans.

- **Summary**: In vision-language models (VLMs), the ability to perceive and interpret color and physical environment is crucial for achieving contextually accurate understanding and interaction. However, despite advances in multimodal modeling, there remains a significant lack of specialized datasets that rigorously evaluate a model's capacity to discern subtle color variations and spatial context -- critical elements for situational comprehension and reliable deployment across real-world applications. Toward that goal, we curate MegaCOIN, a high-quality, human-labeled dataset based on \emph{real} images with various contextual attributes. MegaCOIN consists of two parts: MegaCOIN-Instruct, which serves as a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset for VLMs; and MegaCOIN-Bench, an annotated test set that can be used as a stand-alone QA dataset. MegaCOIN~provides three annotated features for 220,000 real images: foreground color, background color, and description of an object's physical environment, constituting 660k human annotations. In addition, MegaCOIN can be applied to benchmark domain generalization (DG) algorithms. We explore benchmarking DG methods in the linear probing setup for VLM and show some new insights. Last but not least, we show that VLMs, including GPT-4o, have subpar color recognition capabilities, and fine-tuning with MegaCOIN can result in improved performance on visual evaluation tasks. In certain cases, MegaCOIN fine-tuned small-scale opensource models such as LLaVA and Bunny can outperform closed-source GPT-4o. We hope the utilities of MegaCOIN can shed light on the directions VLMs can improve and provide a more complex platform for domain generalization algorithms.

- **Summary**: In image-assisted minimally invasive surgeries (MIS), understanding surgical scenes is vital for real-time feedback to surgeons, skill evaluation, and improving outcomes through collaborative human-robot procedures. Within this context, the challenge lies in accurately detecting, segmenting, and estimating the depth of surgical scenes depicted in high-resolution images, while simultaneously reconstructing the scene in 3D and providing segmentation of surgical instruments along with detection labels for each instrument. To address this challenge, a novel Multi-Task Learning (MTL) network is proposed for performing these tasks concurrently. A key aspect of this approach involves overcoming the optimization hurdles associated with handling multiple tasks concurrently by integrating a Adversarial Weight Update into the MTL framework, the proposed MTL model achieves 3D reconstruction through the integration of segmentation, depth estimation, and object detection, thereby enhancing the understanding of surgical scenes, which marks a significant advancement compared to existing studies that lack 3D capabilities. Comprehensive experiments on the EndoVis2018 benchmark dataset underscore the adeptness of the model in efficiently addressing all three tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed techniques.

- **Summary**: We present InfiniCube, a scalable method for generating unbounded dynamic 3D driving scenes with high fidelity and controllability. Previous methods for scene generation either suffer from limited scales or lack geometric and appearance consistency along generated sequences. In contrast, we leverage the recent advancements in scalable 3D representation and video models to achieve large dynamic scene generation that allows flexible controls through HD maps, vehicle bounding boxes, and text descriptions. First, we construct a map-conditioned sparse-voxel-based 3D generative model to unleash its power for unbounded voxel world generation. Then, we re-purpose a video model and ground it on the voxel world through a set of carefully designed pixel-aligned guidance buffers, synthesizing a consistent appearance. Finally, we propose a fast feed-forward approach that employs both voxel and pixel branches to lift the dynamic videos to dynamic 3D Gaussians with controllable objects. Our method can generate controllable and realistic 3D driving scenes, and extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of our model.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have recently demonstrated notable success in solving inverse problems. However, current diffusion model-based solutions typically require a large number of function evaluations (NFEs) to generate high-quality images conditioned on measurements, as they incorporate only limited information at each step. To accelerate the diffusion-based inverse problem-solving process, we introduce \textbf{M}easurements \textbf{O}ptimization (MO), a more efficient plug-and-play module for integrating measurement information at each step of the inverse problem-solving process. This method is comprehensively evaluated across eight diverse linear and nonlinear tasks on the FFHQ and ImageNet datasets. By using MO, we establish state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple tasks, with key advantages: (1) it operates with no more than 100 NFEs, with phase retrieval on ImageNet being the sole exception; (2) it achieves SOTA or near-SOTA results even at low NFE counts; and (3) it can be seamlessly integrated into existing diffusion model-based solutions for inverse problems, such as DPS \cite{chung2022diffusion} and Red-diff \cite{mardani2023variational}. For example, DPS-MO attains a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 28.71 dB on the FFHQ 256 dataset for high dynamic range imaging, setting a new SOTA benchmark with only 100 NFEs, whereas current methods require between 1000 and 4000 NFEs for comparable performance.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims at producing realistic images corresponding to text descriptions. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has proven to be successful in this task. Typical T2I GANs are 2 phase methods that first pretrain an inter-modal representation from aligned image-text pairs and then use GAN to train image generator on that basis. However, such representation ignores the inner-modal semantic correspondence, e.g. the images with same label. The semantic label in priory describes the inherent distribution pattern with underlying cross-image relationships, which is supplement to the text description for understanding the full characteristics of image. In this paper, we propose a framework leveraging both inter- and inner-modal correspondence by label guided supervised contrastive learning. We extend the T2I GANs to two parameter-sharing contrast branches in both pretraining and generation phases. This integration effectively clusters the semantically similar image-text pair representations, thereby fostering the generation of higher-quality images. We demonstrate our framework on four novel T2I GANs by both single-object dataset CUB and multi-object dataset COCO, achieving significant improvements in the Inception Score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) metrics of imagegeneration evaluation. Notably, on more complex multi-object COCO, our framework improves FID by 30.1%, 27.3%, 16.2% and 17.1% for AttnGAN, DM-GAN, SSA-GAN and GALIP, respectively. We also validate our superiority by comparing with other label guided T2I GANs. The results affirm the effectiveness and competitiveness of our approach in advancing the state-of-the-art GAN for T2I generation

- **Summary**: The training of score-based diffusion models (SDMs) is based on score matching. The challenge of score matching is that it includes a computationally expensive Jacobian trace. While several methods have been proposed to avoid this computation, each has drawbacks, such as instability during training and approximating the learning as learning a denoising vector field rather than a true score. We propose a novel score matching variant, local curvature smoothing with Stein's identity (LCSS). The LCSS bypasses the Jacobian trace by applying Stein's identity, enabling regularization effectiveness and efficient computation. We show that LCSS surpasses existing methods in sample generation performance and matches the performance of denoising score matching, widely adopted by most SDMs, in evaluations such as FID, Inception score, and bits per dimension. Furthermore, we show that LCSS enables realistic image generation even at a high resolution of $1024 \times 1024$.

- **Summary**: Automated crop mapping through Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) has emerged as a crucial avenue for agricultural monitoring and management. However, due to the low resolution and unclear parcel boundaries, annotating pixel-level masks is exceptionally complex and time-consuming in SITS. This paper embraces the weakly supervised paradigm (i.e., only image-level categories available) to liberate the crop mapping task from the exhaustive annotation burden. The unique characteristics of SITS give rise to several challenges in weakly supervised learning: (1) noise perturbation from spatially neighboring regions, and (2) erroneous semantic bias from anomalous temporal periods. To address the above difficulties, we propose a novel method, termed exploring space-time perceptive clues (Exact). First, we introduce a set of spatial clues to explicitly capture the representative patterns of different crops from the most class-relative regions. Besides, we leverage the temporal-to-class interaction of the model to emphasize the contributions of pivotal clips, thereby enhancing the model perception for crop regions. Build upon the space-time perceptive clues, we derive the clue-based CAMs to effectively supervise the SITS segmentation network. Our method demonstrates impressive performance on various SITS benchmarks. Remarkably, the segmentation network trained on Exact-generated masks achieves 95% of its fully supervised performance, showing the bright promise of weakly supervised paradigm in crop mapping scenario. Our code will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: In the manufacturing industry, defect detection is an essential but challenging task aiming to detect defects generated in the process of production. Though traditional YOLO models presents a good performance in defect detection, they still have limitations in capturing high-order feature interrelationships, which hurdles defect detection in the complex scenarios and across the scales. To this end, we introduce hypergraph computation into YOLO framework, dubbed HyperDefect-YOLO (HD-YOLO), to improve representative ability and semantic exploitation. HD-YOLO consists of Defect Aware Module (DAM) and Mixed Graph Network (MGNet) in the backbone, which specialize for perception and extraction of defect features. To effectively aggregate multi-scale features, we propose HyperGraph Aggregation Network (HGANet) which combines hypergraph and attention mechanism to aggregate multi-scale features. Cross-Scale Fusion (CSF) is proposed to adaptively fuse and handle features instead of simple concatenation and convolution. Finally, we propose Semantic Aware Module (SAM) in the neck to enhance semantic exploitation for accurately localizing defects with different sizes in the disturbed background. HD-YOLO undergoes rigorous evaluation on public HRIPCB and NEU-DET datasets with significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluate HD-YOLO on self-built MINILED dataset collected in real industrial scenarios to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed with the main purpose of increasing the safety and comfort of vehicle occupants. Most of current computer vision-based ADAS perform detection and tracking tasks quite successfully under regular conditions, but are not completely reliable, particularly under adverse weather and changing lighting conditions, neither in complex situations with many overlapping objects. In this work we explore the use of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in ADAS on the assumption that the distinct near infrared (NIR) spectral reflectances of different materials can help to better separate the objects in a driving scene. In particular, this paper describes some experimental results of the application of fully convolutional networks (FCN) to the image segmentation of HSI for ADAS applications. More specifically, our aim is to investigate to what extent the spatial features codified by convolutional filters can be helpful to improve the performance of HSI segmentation systems. With that aim, we use the HSI-Drive v1.1 dataset, which provides a set of labelled images recorded in real driving conditions with a small-size snapshot NIR-HSI camera. Finally, we analyze the implementability of such a HSI segmentation system by prototyping the developed FCN model together with the necessary hyperspectral cube preprocessing stage and characterizing its performance on an MPSoC.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving (AD) operates in open-world scenarios, where encountering unknown objects is inevitable. However, standard object detectors trained on a limited number of base classes tend to ignore any unknown objects, posing potential risks on the road. To address this, it is important to learn a generic rather than a class specific objectness from objects seen during training. We therefore introduce an occupancy prediction together with bounding box regression. It learns to score the objectness by calculating the ratio of the predicted area occupied by actual objects. To enhance its generalizability, we increase the object diversity by exploiting data from other domains via Mosaic and Mixup augmentation. The objects outside the AD training classes are classified as a newly added out-of-distribution (OOD) class. Our solution UNCOVER, for UNknown Class Object detection for autonomous VEhicles in Real-time, excels at achieving both real-time detection and high recall of unknown objects on challenging AD benchmarks. To further attain very low false positive rates, particularly for close objects, we introduce a post-hoc filtering step that utilizes geometric cues extracted from the depth map, typically available within the AD system.

- **Summary**: Backdoor attacks embed hidden associations between triggers and targets in deep neural networks (DNNs), causing them to predict the target when a trigger is present while maintaining normal behavior otherwise. Physical backdoor attacks, which use physical objects as triggers, are feasible but lack remote control, temporal stealthiness, flexibility, and mobility. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose a new type of backdoor triggers utilizing lasers that feature long-distance transmission and instant-imaging properties. Based on the laser-based backdoor triggers, we present a physical backdoor attack, called LaserGuider, which possesses remote control ability and achieves high temporal stealthiness, flexibility, and mobility. We also introduce a systematic approach to optimize laser parameters for improving attack effectiveness. Our evaluation on traffic sign recognition DNNs, critical in autonomous vehicles, demonstrates that LaserGuider with three different laser-based triggers achieves over 90% attack success rate with negligible impact on normal inputs. Additionally, we release LaserMark, the first dataset of real world traffic signs stamped with physical laser spots, to support further research in backdoor attacks and defenses.

- **Summary**: The exploration of underwater environments is essential for applications such as biological research, archaeology, and infrastructure maintenanceHowever, underwater imaging is challenging due to the waters unique properties, including scattering, absorption, color distortion, and reduced visibility. To address such visual degradations, a variety of approaches have been proposed covering from basic signal processing methods to deep learning models; however, none of them has proven to be consistently successful. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning model, Co-Operational Regressor Networks (CoRe-Nets), designed to achieve the best possible underwater image restoration. A CoRe-Net consists of two co-operating networks: the Apprentice Regressor (AR), responsible for image transformation, and the Master Regressor (MR), which evaluates the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of the images generated by the AR and feeds it back to AR. CoRe-Nets are built on Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs), which offer a superior learning capability by modulating nonlinearity in kernel transformations. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated on the benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI) dataset. Leveraging the joint learning capabilities of the two cooperating networks, the proposed model achieves the state-of-art restoration performance with significantly reduced computational complexity and often presents such results that can even surpass the visual quality of the ground truth with a 2-pass application. Our results and the optimized PyTorch implementation of the proposed approach are now publicly shared on GitHub.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel approach for high-resolution talking head generation from a single image and audio input. Prior methods using explicit face models, like 3D morphable models (3DMM) and facial landmarks, often fall short in generating high-fidelity videos due to their lack of appearance-aware motion representation. While generative approaches such as video diffusion models achieve high video quality, their slow processing speeds limit practical application. Our proposed model, Implicit Face Motion Diffusion Model (IF-MDM), employs implicit motion to encode human faces into appearance-aware compressed facial latents, enhancing video generation. Although implicit motion lacks the spatial disentanglement of explicit models, which complicates alignment with subtle lip movements, we introduce motion statistics to help capture fine-grained motion information. Additionally, our model provides motion controllability to optimize the trade-off between motion intensity and visual quality during inference. IF-MDM supports real-time generation of 512x512 resolution videos at up to 45 frames per second (fps). Extensive evaluations demonstrate its superior performance over existing diffusion and explicit face models. The code will be released publicly, available alongside supplementary materials. The video results can be found on https://bit.ly/ifmdm_supplementary.

- **Summary**: Reliable perception of spatial and motion information is crucial for safe autonomous navigation. Traditional approaches typically fall into two categories: object-centric and class-agnostic methods. While object-centric methods often struggle with missed detections, leading to inaccuracies in motion prediction, many class-agnostic methods focus heavily on encoder design, often overlooking important priors like rigidity and temporal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance, particularly with sparse LiDAR data at distant region. To address these issues, we propose $\textbf{PriorMotion}$, a generative framework that extracts rasterized and vectorized scene representations to model spatio-temporal priors. Our model comprises a BEV encoder, an Raster-Vector prior Encoder, and a Spatio-Temporal prior Generator, improving both spatial and temporal consistency in motion prediction. Additionally, we introduce a standardized evaluation protocol for class-agnostic motion prediction. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that PriorMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance, with further validation on advanced FMCW LiDAR confirming its robustness.

- **Summary**: The development of larger models for medical image analysis has led to increased performance. However, it also affected our ability to explain and validate model decisions. Models can use non-relevant parts of images, also called spurious correlations or shortcuts, to obtain high performance on benchmark datasets but fail in real-world scenarios. In this work, we challenge the capacity of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify chest X-rays and eye fundus images while masking out clinically relevant parts of the image. We show that all models trained on the PadChest dataset, irrespective of the masking strategy, are able to obtain an Area Under the Curve (AUC) above random. Moreover, the models trained on full images obtain good performance on images without the region of interest (ROI), even superior to the one obtained on images only containing the ROI. We also reveal a possible spurious correlation in the Chaksu dataset while the performances are more aligned with the expectation of an unbiased model. We go beyond the performance analysis with the usage of the explainability method SHAP and the analysis of embeddings. We asked a radiology resident to interpret chest X-rays under different masking to complement our findings with clinical knowledge.

- **Summary**: Imagine having a conversation with a socially intelligent agent. It can attentively listen to your words and offer visual and linguistic feedback promptly. This seamless interaction allows for multiple rounds of conversation to flow smoothly and naturally. In pursuit of actualizing it, we propose INFP, a novel audio-driven head generation framework for dyadic interaction. Unlike previous head generation works that only focus on single-sided communication, or require manual role assignment and explicit role switching, our model drives the agent portrait dynamically alternates between speaking and listening state, guided by the input dyadic audio. Specifically, INFP comprises a Motion-Based Head Imitation stage and an Audio-Guided Motion Generation stage. The first stage learns to project facial communicative behaviors from real-life conversation videos into a low-dimensional motion latent space, and use the motion latent codes to animate a static image. The second stage learns the mapping from the input dyadic audio to motion latent codes through denoising, leading to the audio-driven head generation in interactive scenarios. To facilitate this line of research, we introduce DyConv, a large scale dataset of rich dyadic conversations collected from the Internet. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate superior performance and effectiveness of our method. Project Page: https://grisoon.github.io/INFP/.

- **Summary**: Robotic-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) is a recognized treatment for esophageal cancer, offering better patient outcomes compared to open surgery and traditional minimally invasive surgery. RAMIE is highly complex, spanning multiple anatomical areas and involving repetitive phases and non-sequential phase transitions. Our goal is to leverage deep learning for surgical phase recognition in RAMIE to provide intraoperative support to surgeons. To achieve this, we have developed a new surgical phase recognition dataset comprising 27 videos. Using this dataset, we conducted a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art surgical phase recognition models. To more effectively capture the temporal dynamics of this complex procedure, we developed a novel deep learning model featuring an encoder-decoder structure with causal hierarchical attention, which demonstrates superior performance compared to existing models.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose ZipAR, a training-free, plug-and-play parallel decoding framework for accelerating auto-regressive (AR) visual generation. The motivation stems from the observation that images exhibit local structures, and spatially distant regions tend to have minimal interdependence. Given a partially decoded set of visual tokens, in addition to the original next-token prediction scheme in the row dimension, the tokens corresponding to spatially adjacent regions in the column dimension can be decoded in parallel, enabling the ``next-set prediction'' paradigm. By decoding multiple tokens simultaneously in a single forward pass, the number of forward passes required to generate an image is significantly reduced, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that ZipAR can reduce the number of model forward passes by up to 91% on the Emu3-Gen model without requiring any additional retraining.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to utilize labeled data from a source domain to solve tasks in an unlabeled target domain, often hindered by significant domain gaps. Traditional CNN-based methods struggle to fully capture complex domain relationships, motivating the shift to vision transformers like the Swin Transformer, which excel in modeling both local and global dependencies. In this work, we propose a novel UDA approach leveraging the Swin Transformer with three key modules. A Graph Domain Discriminator enhances domain alignment by capturing inter-pixel correlations through graph convolutions and entropy-based attention differentiation. An Adaptive Double Attention module combines Windows and Shifted Windows attention with dynamic reweighting to align long-range and local features effectively. Finally, a Cross-Feature Transform modifies Swin Transformer blocks to improve generalization across domains. Extensive benchmarks confirm the state-of-the-art performance of our versatile method, which requires no task-specific alignment modules, establishing its adaptability to diverse applications.

- **Summary**: Domain generalization (DG) aims to adapt a model using one or multiple source domains to ensure robust performance in unseen target domains. Recently, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models has shown promising results in the context of DG problem. Nevertheless, existing PEFT methods still struggle to strike a balance between preserving generalizable components of the pre-trained model and learning task-specific features. To gain insights into the distribution of generalizable components, we begin by analyzing the pre-trained weights through the lens of singular value decomposition. Building on these insights, we introduce Singular Value Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (SoRA), an approach that selectively tunes minor singular components while keeping the residual parts frozen. SoRA effectively retains the generalization ability of the pre-trained model while efficiently acquiring task-specific skills. Furthermore, we freeze domain-generalizable blocks and employ an annealing weight decay strategy, thereby achieving an optimal balance in the delicate trade-off between generalizability and discriminability. SoRA attains state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks that span both domain generalized semantic segmentation to domain generalized object detection. In addition, our methods introduce no additional inference overhead or regularization loss, maintain compatibility with any backbone or head, and are designed to be versatile, allowing easy integration into a wide range of tasks.

- **Summary**: Open-World Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (OW-CZSL) addresses the challenge of recognizing novel compositions of known primitives and entities. Even though prior works utilize language knowledge for recognition, such approaches exhibit limited interactions between language-image modalities. Our approach primarily focuses on enhancing the inter-modality interactions through fostering richer interactions between image and textual data. Additionally, we introduce a novel module aimed at alleviating the computational burden associated with exhaustive exploration of all possible compositions during the inference stage. While previous methods exclusively learn compositions jointly or independently, we introduce an advanced hybrid procedure that leverages both learning mechanisms to generate final predictions. Our proposed model, achieves state-of-the-art in OW-CZSL in three datasets, while surpassing Large Vision Language Models (LLVM) in two datasets.

- **Summary**: Accurately generating images of human bodies from text remains a challenging problem for state of the art text-to-image models. Commonly observed body-related artifacts include extra or missing limbs, unrealistic poses, blurred body parts, etc. Currently, evaluation of such artifacts relies heavily on time-consuming human judgments, limiting the ability to benchmark models at scale. We address this by proposing BodyMetric, a learnable metric that predicts body realism in images. BodyMetric is trained on realism labels and multi-modal signals including 3D body representations inferred from the input image, and textual descriptions. In order to facilitate this approach, we design an annotation pipeline to collect expert ratings on human body realism leading to a new dataset for this task, namely, BodyRealism. Ablation studies support our architectural choices for BodyMetric and the importance of leveraging a 3D human body prior in capturing body-related artifacts in 2D images. In comparison to concurrent metrics which evaluate general user preference in images, BodyMetric specifically reflects body-related artifacts. We demonstrate the utility of BodyMetric through applications that were previously infeasible at scale. In particular, we use BodyMetric to benchmark the generation ability of text-to-image models to produce realistic human bodies. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of BodyMetric in ranking generated images based on the predicted realism scores.

- **Summary**: We present the first loss agent, dubbed LossAgent, for low-level image processing tasks, e.g., image super-resolution and restoration, intending to achieve any customized optimization objectives of low-level image processing in different practical applications. Notably, not all optimization objectives, such as complex hand-crafted perceptual metrics, text description, and intricate human feedback, can be instantiated with existing low-level losses, e.g., MSE loss. which presents a crucial challenge in optimizing image processing networks in an end-to-end manner. To eliminate this, our LossAgent introduces the powerful large language model (LLM) as the loss agent, where the rich textual understanding of prior knowledge empowers the loss agent with the potential to understand complex optimization objectives, trajectory, and state feedback from external environments in the optimization process of the low-level image processing networks. In particular, we establish the loss repository by incorporating existing loss functions that support the end-to-end optimization for low-level image processing. Then, we design the optimization-oriented prompt engineering for the loss agent to actively and intelligently decide the compositional weights for each loss in the repository at each optimization interaction, thereby achieving the required optimization trajectory for any customized optimization objectives. Extensive experiments on three typical low-level image processing tasks and multiple optimization objectives have shown the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed LossAgent. Code and pre-trained models will be available at https://github.com/lbc12345/LossAgent.

- **Summary**: Accurate and automatic segmentation of brain tumors in multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is essential for quantitative measurements, which play an increasingly important role in clinical diagnosis and prognosis. The International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge 2024 offers a unique benchmarking opportunity, including various types of brain tumors in both adult and pediatric populations, such as pediatric brain tumors (PED), meningiomas (MEN-RT) and brain metastases (MET), among others. Compared to previous editions, BraTS 2024 has implemented changes to substantially increase clinical relevance, such as refined tumor regions for evaluation. We propose a deep learning-based ensemble approach that integrates state-of-the-art segmentation models. Additionally, we introduce innovative, adaptive pre- and post-processing techniques that employ MRI-based radiomic analyses to differentiate tumor subtypes. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tumors present in the BraTS datasets, this approach enhances the precision and generalizability of segmentation models. On the final testing sets, our method achieved mean lesion-wise Dice similarity coefficients of 0.926, 0.801, and 0.688 for the whole tumor in PED, MEN-RT, and MET, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving segmentation performance and generalizability for various brain tumor types.

- **Summary**: We present HyperFLINT (Hypernetwork-based FLow estimation and temporal INTerpolation), a novel deep learning-based approach for estimating flow fields, temporally interpolating scalar fields, and facilitating parameter space exploration in spatio-temporal scientific ensemble data. This work addresses the critical need to explicitly incorporate ensemble parameters into the learning process, as traditional methods often neglect these, limiting their ability to adapt to diverse simulation settings and provide meaningful insights into the data dynamics. HyperFLINT introduces a hypernetwork to account for simulation parameters, enabling it to generate accurate interpolations and flow fields for each timestep by dynamically adapting to varying conditions, thereby outperforming existing parameter-agnostic approaches. The architecture features modular neural blocks with convolutional and deconvolutional layers, supported by a hypernetwork that generates weights for the main network, allowing the model to better capture intricate simulation dynamics. A series of experiments demonstrates HyperFLINT's significantly improved performance in flow field estimation and temporal interpolation, as well as its potential in enabling parameter space exploration, offering valuable insights into complex scientific ensembles.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel framework named D-LORD (Double Latent Optimization for Representation Disentanglement), which is designed for motion stylization (motion style transfer and motion retargeting). The primary objective of this framework is to separate the class and content information from a given motion sequence using a data-driven latent optimization approach. Here, class refers to person-specific style, such as a particular emotion or an individual's identity, while content relates to the style-agnostic aspect of an action, such as walking or jumping, as universally understood concepts. The key advantage of D-LORD is its ability to perform style transfer without needing paired motion data. Instead, it utilizes class and content labels during the latent optimization process. By disentangling the representation, the framework enables the transformation of one motion sequences style to another's style using Adaptive Instance Normalization. The proposed D-LORD framework is designed with a focus on generalization, allowing it to handle different class and content labels for various applications. Additionally, it can generate diverse motion sequences when specific class and content labels are provided. The framework's efficacy is demonstrated through experimentation on three datasets: the CMU XIA dataset for motion style transfer, the MHAD dataset, and the RRIS Ability dataset for motion retargeting. Notably, this paper presents the first generalized framework for motion style transfer and motion retargeting, showcasing its potential contributions in this area.

- **Summary**: Gliomas, a kind of brain tumor characterized by high mortality, present substantial diagnostic challenges in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper introduces a novel approach to glioma segmentation using transfer learning to address challenges in resource-limited regions with minimal and low-quality MRI data. We leverage pre-trained deep learning models, nnU-Net and MedNeXt, and apply a stratified fine-tuning strategy using the BraTS2023-Adult-Glioma and BraTS-Africa datasets. Our method exploits radiomic analysis to create stratified training folds, model training on a large brain tumor dataset, and transfer learning to the Sub-Saharan context. A weighted model ensembling strategy and adaptive post-processing are employed to enhance segmentation accuracy. The evaluation of our proposed method on unseen validation cases on the BraTS-Africa 2024 task resulted in lesion-wise mean Dice scores of 0.870, 0.865, and 0.926, for enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions and was ranked first for the challenge. Our approach highlights the ability of integrated machine-learning techniques to bridge the gap between the medical imaging capabilities of resource-limited countries and established developed regions. By tailoring our methods to a target population's specific needs and constraints, we aim to enhance diagnostic capabilities in isolated environments. Our findings underscore the importance of approaches like local data integration and stratification refinement to address healthcare disparities, ensure practical applicability, and enhance impact.

- **Summary**: The inspection of wind turbine blades (WTBs) is crucial for ensuring their structural integrity and operational efficiency. Traditional inspection methods can be dangerous and inefficient, prompting the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that access hard-to-reach areas and capture high-resolution imagery. In this study, we address the challenge of enhancing defect detection on WTBs by integrating thermal and RGB images obtained from UAVs. We propose a multispectral image composition method that combines thermal and RGB imagery through spatial coordinate transformation, key point detection, binary descriptor creation, and weighted image overlay. Using a benchmark dataset of WTB images annotated for defects, we evaluated several state-of-the-art object detection models. Our results show that composite images significantly improve defect detection efficiency. Specifically, the YOLOv8 model's accuracy increased from 91% to 95%, precision from 89% to 94%, recall from 85% to 92%, and F1-score from 87% to 93%. The number of false positives decreased from 6 to 3, and missed defects reduced from 5 to 2. These findings demonstrate that integrating thermal and RGB imagery enhances defect detection on WTBs, contributing to improved maintenance and reliability.

- **Summary**: We address multi-view pedestrian detection in a setting where labeled data is collected using a multi-camera setup different from the one used for testing. While recent multi-view pedestrian detectors perform well on the camera rig used for training, their performance declines when applied to a different setup. To facilitate seamless deployment across varied camera rigs, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method that adapts the model to new rigs without requiring additional labeled data. Specifically, we leverage the mean teacher self-training framework with a novel pseudo-labeling technique tailored to multi-view pedestrian detection. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including MultiviewX$\rightarrow$Wildtrack. Unlike previous methods, our approach eliminates the need for external labeled monocular datasets, thereby reducing reliance on labeled data. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and validate key design choices. By enabling robust adaptation across camera setups, our work enhances the practicality of multi-view pedestrian detectors and establishes a strong UDA baseline for future research.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing complex structures from planar cross-sections is a challenging problem, with wide-reaching applications in medical imaging, manufacturing, and topography. Out-of-the-box point cloud reconstruction methods can often fail due to the data sparsity between slicing planes, while current bespoke methods struggle to reconstruct thin geometric structures and preserve topological continuity. This is important for medical applications where thin vessel structures are present in CT and MRI scans. This paper introduces \method, a novel approach for extracting a 3D signed distance field from 2D signed distances generated from planar contours. Our approach makes the training of neural SDFs contour-aware by using losses designed for the case where geometry is known within 2D slices. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement over existing methods, effectively reconstructing thin structures and producing accurate 3D models without the interpolation artifacts or over-smoothing of prior approaches.

- **Summary**: Satellite optical images, upon their on-ground receipt, offer a distorted view of the observed scene. Their restoration, classically including denoising, deblurring, and sometimes super-resolution, is required before their exploitation. Moreover, quantifying the uncertainty related to this restoration could be valuable by lowering the risk of hallucination and avoiding propagating these biases in downstream applications. Deep learning methods are now state-of-the-art for satellite image restoration. However, they require to train a specific network for each sensor and they do not provide the associated uncertainties. This paper proposes a generic method involving a single network to restore images from several sensors and a scalable way to derive the uncertainties. We focus on deep regularization (DR) methods, which learn a deep prior on target images before plugging it into a model-based optimization scheme. First, we introduce VBLE-xz, which solves the inverse problem in the latent space of a variational compressive autoencoder, estimating the uncertainty jointly in the latent and in the image spaces. It enables scalable posterior sampling with relevant and calibrated uncertainties. Second, we propose the denoiser-based method SatDPIR, adapted from DPIR, which efficiently computes accurate point estimates. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on very high resolution simulated and real Pleiades images, asserting both the performance and robustness of the proposed methods. VBLE-xz and SatDPIR achieve state-of-the-art results compared to direct inversion methods. In particular, VBLE-xz is a scalable method to get realistic posterior samples and accurate uncertainties, while SatDPIR represents a compelling alternative to direct inversion methods when uncertainty quantification is not required.

- **Summary**: Document comparison typically relies on optical character recognition (OCR) as its core technology. However, OCR requires the selection of appropriate language models for each document and the performance of multilingual or hybrid models remains limited. To overcome these challenges, we propose text change detection (TCD) using an image comparison model tailored for multilingual documents. Unlike OCR-based approaches, our method employs word-level text image-to-image comparison to detect changes. Our model generates bidirectional change segmentation maps between the source and target documents. To enhance performance without requiring explicit text alignment or scaling preprocessing, we employ correlations among multi-scale attention features. We also construct a benchmark dataset comprising actual printed and scanned word pairs in various languages to evaluate our model. We validate our approach using our benchmark dataset and public benchmarks Distorted Document Images and the LRDE Document Binarization Dataset. We compare our model against state-of-the-art semantic segmentation and change detection models, as well as to conventional OCR-based models.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in garment-centric image generation from text and image prompts based on diffusion models are impressive. However, existing methods lack support for various combinations of attire, and struggle to preserve the garment details while maintaining faithfulness to the text prompts, limiting their performance across diverse scenarios. In this paper, we focus on a new task, i.e., Multi-Garment Virtual Dressing, and we propose a novel AnyDressing method for customizing characters conditioned on any combination of garments and any personalized text prompts. AnyDressing comprises two primary networks named GarmentsNet and DressingNet, which are respectively dedicated to extracting detailed clothing features and generating customized images. Specifically, we propose an efficient and scalable module called Garment-Specific Feature Extractor in GarmentsNet to individually encode garment textures in parallel. This design prevents garment confusion while ensuring network efficiency. Meanwhile, we design an adaptive Dressing-Attention mechanism and a novel Instance-Level Garment Localization Learning strategy in DressingNet to accurately inject multi-garment features into their corresponding regions. This approach efficiently integrates multi-garment texture cues into generated images and further enhances text-image consistency. Additionally, we introduce a Garment-Enhanced Texture Learning strategy to improve the fine-grained texture details of garments. Thanks to our well-craft design, AnyDressing can serve as a plug-in module to easily integrate with any community control extensions for diffusion models, improving the diversity and controllability of synthesized images. Extensive experiments show that AnyDressing achieves state-of-the-art results.



### Frequency-Adaptive Low-Latency Object Detection Using Events and Frames

- **Summary**: Fusing Events and RGB images for object detection leverages the robustness of Event cameras in adverse environments and the rich semantic information provided by RGB cameras. However, two critical mismatches: low-latency Events \textit{vs.}~high-latency RGB frames; temporally sparse labels in training \textit{vs.}~continuous flow in inference, significantly hinder the high-frequency fusion-based object detection. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{F}requency-\textbf{A}daptive Low-Latency \textbf{O}bject \textbf{D}etector (FAOD). FAOD aligns low-frequency RGB frames with high-frequency Events through an Align Module, which reinforces cross-modal style and spatial proximity to address the Event-RGB Mismatch. We further propose a training strategy, Time Shift, which enforces the module to align the prediction from temporally shifted Event-RGB pairs and their original representation, that is, consistent with Event-aligned annotations. This strategy enables the network to use high-frequency Event data as the primary reference while treating low-frequency RGB images as supplementary information, retaining the low-latency nature of the Event stream toward high-frequency detection. Furthermore, we observe that these corrected Event-RGB pairs demonstrate better generalization from low training frequency to higher inference frequencies compared to using Event data alone. Extensive experiments on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD and DSEC-Detection datasets demonstrate that our FAOD achieves SOTA performance. Specifically, in the PKU-DAVIS-SOD Dataset, FAOD achieves 9.8 points improvement in terms of the mAP in fully paired Event-RGB data with only a quarter of the parameters compared to SODFormer, and even maintains robust performance (only a 3 points drop in mAP) under 80$\times$ Event-RGB frequency mismatch.

- **Summary**: Despite the recent strides in video generation, state-of-the-art methods still struggle with elements of visual detail. One particularly challenging case is the class of egocentric instructional videos in which the intricate motion of the hand coupled with a mostly stable and non-distracting environment is necessary to convey the appropriate visual action instruction. To address these challenges, we introduce a new method for instructional video generation. Our diffusion-based method incorporates two distinct innovations. First, we propose an automatic method to generate the expected region of motion, guided by both the visual context and the action text. Second, we introduce a critical hand structure loss to guide the diffusion model to focus on smooth and consistent hand poses. We evaluate our method on augmented instructional datasets based on EpicKitchens and Ego4D, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of instructional clarity, especially of the hand motion in the target region, across diverse environments and actions.Video results can be found on the project webpage: https://excitedbutter.github.io/Instructional-Video-Generation/

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are frequently noisy and of low resolution due to the constraints of imaging devices. Recently launched satellites can concurrently acquire HSIs and panchromatic (PAN) images, enabling the restoration of HSIs to generate clean and high-resolution imagery through fusing PAN images for denoising and super-resolution. However, previous studies treated these two tasks as independent processes, resulting in accumulated errors. This paper introduces \textbf{H}yperspectral \textbf{I}mage Joint \textbf{Pand}enoising \textbf{a}nd Pan\textbf{s}harpening (Hipandas), a novel learning paradigm that reconstructs HRHS images from noisy low-resolution HSIs (LRHS) and high-resolution PAN images. The proposed zero-shot Hipandas framework consists of a guided denoising network, a guided super-resolution network, and a PAN reconstruction network, utilizing an HSI low-rank prior and a newly introduced detail-oriented low-rank prior. The interconnection of these networks complicates the training process, necessitating a two-stage training strategy to ensure effective training. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world datasets indicate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms, yielding more accurate and visually pleasing HRHS images.

- **Summary**: Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for extracting representations from Earth observation data, but their evaluation remains inconsistent and narrow. Existing works often evaluate on suboptimal downstream datasets and tasks, that are often too easy or too narrow, limiting the usefulness of the evaluations to assess the real-world applicability of GFMs. Additionally, there is a distinct lack of diversity in current evaluation protocols, which fail to account for the multiplicity of image resolutions, sensor types, and temporalities, which further complicates the assessment of GFM performance. In particular, most existing benchmarks are geographically biased towards North America and Europe, questioning the global applicability of GFMs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PANGAEA, a standardized evaluation protocol that covers a diverse set of datasets, tasks, resolutions, sensor modalities, and temporalities. It establishes a robust and widely applicable benchmark for GFMs. We evaluate the most popular GFMs openly available on this benchmark and analyze their performance across several domains. In particular, we compare these models to supervised baselines (e.g. UNet and vanilla ViT), and assess their effectiveness when faced with limited labeled data. Our findings highlight the limitations of GFMs, under different scenarios, showing that they do not consistently outperform supervised models. PANGAEA is designed to be highly extensible, allowing for the seamless inclusion of new datasets, models, and tasks in future research. By releasing the evaluation code and benchmark, we aim to enable other researchers to replicate our experiments and build upon our work, fostering a more principled evaluation protocol for large pre-trained geospatial models.

- **Summary**: The digitization of vocal music scores presents unique challenges that go beyond traditional Optical Music Recognition (OMR) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR), as it necessitates preserving the critical alignment between music notation and lyrics. This alignment is essential for proper interpretation and processing in practical applications. This paper introduces and formalizes, for the first time, the Aligned Music Notation and Lyrics Transcription (AMNLT) challenge, which addresses the complete transcription of vocal scores by jointly considering music symbols, lyrics, and their synchronization. We analyze different approaches to address this challenge, ranging from traditional divide-and-conquer methods that handle music and lyrics separately, to novel end-to-end solutions including direct transcription, unfolding mechanisms, and language modeling. To evaluate these methods, we introduce four datasets of Gregorian chants, comprising both real and synthetic sources, along with custom metrics specifically designed to assess both transcription and alignment accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate that end-to-end approaches generally outperform heuristic methods in the alignment challenge, with language models showing particular promise in scenarios where sufficient training data is available. This work establishes the first comprehensive framework for AMNLT, providing both theoretical foundations and practical solutions for preserving and digitizing vocal music heritage.

- **Summary**: The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a significant breakthrough in scaling segmentation models, delivering strong performance across various downstream applications in the RGB modality. However, directly applying SAM to emerging visual modalities, such as depth and event data results in suboptimal performance in multi-modal segmentation tasks. In this paper, we make the first attempt to adapt SAM for multi-modal semantic segmentation by proposing a Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation Experts (MoE-LoRA) tailored for different input visual modalities. By training only the MoE-LoRA layers while keeping SAM's weights frozen, SAM's strong generalization and segmentation capabilities can be preserved for downstream tasks. Specifically, to address cross-modal inconsistencies, we propose a novel MoE routing strategy that adaptively generates weighted features across modalities, enhancing multi-modal feature integration. Additionally, we incorporate multi-scale feature extraction and fusion by adapting SAM's segmentation head and introducing an auxiliary segmentation head to combine multi-scale features for improved segmentation performance effectively. Extensive experiments were conducted on three multi-modal benchmarks: DELIVER, MUSES, and MCubeS. The results consistently demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across diverse scenarios. Notably, under the particularly challenging condition of missing modalities, our approach exhibits a substantial performance gain, achieving an improvement of 32.15% compared to existing methods.

- **Summary**: Ranking entities such as algorithms, devices, methods, or models based on their performances, while accounting for application-specific preferences, is a challenge. To address this challenge, we establish the foundations of a universal theory for performance-based ranking. First, we introduce a rigorous framework built on top of both the probability and order theories. Our new framework encompasses the elements necessary to (1) manipulate performances as mathematical objects, (2) express which performances are worse than or equivalent to others, (3) model tasks through a variable called satisfaction, (4) consider properties of the evaluation, (5) define scores, and (6) specify application-specific preferences through a variable called importance. On top of this framework, we propose the first axiomatic definition of performance orderings and performance-based rankings. Then, we introduce a universal parametric family of scores, called ranking scores, that can be used to establish rankings satisfying our axioms, while considering application-specific preferences. Finally, we show, in the case of two-class classification, that the family of ranking scores encompasses well-known performance scores, including the accuracy, the true positive rate (recall, sensitivity), the true negative rate (specificity), the positive predictive value (precision), and F1. However, we also show that some other scores commonly used to compare classifiers are unsuitable to derive performance orderings satisfying the axioms. Therefore, this paper provides the computer vision and machine learning communities with a rigorous framework for evaluating and ranking entities.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We introduce DEIM, an innovative and efficient training framework designed to accelerate convergence in real-time object detection with Transformer-based architectures (DETR). To mitigate the sparse supervision inherent in one-to-one (O2O) matching in DETR models, DEIM employs a Dense O2O matching strategy. This approach increases the number of positive samples per image by incorporating additional targets, using standard data augmentation techniques. While Dense O2O matching speeds up convergence, it also introduces numerous low-quality matches that could affect performance. To address this, we propose the Matchability-Aware Loss (MAL), a novel loss function that optimizes matches across various quality levels, enhancing the effectiveness of Dense O2O. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset validate the efficacy of DEIM. When integrated with RT-DETR and D-FINE, it consistently boosts performance while reducing training time by 50%. Notably, paired with RT-DETRv2, DEIM achieves 53.2% AP in a single day of training on an NVIDIA 4090 GPU. Additionally, DEIM-trained real-time models outperform leading real-time object detectors, with DEIM-D-FINE-L and DEIM-D-FINE-X achieving 54.7% and 56.5% AP at 124 and 78 FPS on an NVIDIA T4 GPU, respectively, without the need for additional data. We believe DEIM sets a new baseline for advancements in real-time object detection. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/ShihuaHuang95/DEIM.

- **Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have proven effective for layout generation due to their ability to produce structure-description languages, such as HTML or JSON, even without access to visual information. Recently, LLM providers have evolved these models into large vision-language models (LVLM), which shows prominent multi-modal understanding capabilities. Then, how can we leverage this multi-modal power for layout generation? To answer this, we propose Visual-Aware Self-Correction LAyout GeneRation (VASCAR) for LVLM-based content-aware layout generation. In our method, LVLMs iteratively refine their outputs with reference to rendered layout images, which are visualized as colored bounding boxes on poster backgrounds. In experiments, we demonstrate that our method combined with the Gemini. Without any additional training, VASCAR achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) layout generation quality outperforming both existing layout-specific generative models and other LLM-based methods.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown impressive performance in interactive and zero-shot segmentation across diverse domains, suggesting that they have learned a general concept of "objects" from their large-scale training. However, we observed that SAM struggles with certain types of objects, particularly those featuring dense, tree-like structures and low textural contrast from their surroundings. These failure modes are critical for understanding its limitations in real-world use. In order to systematically examine this issue, we propose metrics to quantify two key object characteristics: tree-likeness and textural separability. Through extensive controlled synthetic experiments and testing on real datasets, we demonstrate that SAM's performance is noticeably correlated with these factors. We link these behaviors under the concept of "textural confusion", where SAM misinterprets local structure as global texture, leading to over-segmentation, or struggles to differentiate objects from similarly textured backgrounds. These findings offer the first quantitative framework to model SAM's challenges, providing valuable insights into its limitations and guiding future improvements for vision foundation models.

- **Summary**: Understanding bimanual human hand activities is a critical problem in AI and robotics. We cannot build large models of bimanual activities because existing datasets lack the scale, coverage of diverse hand activities, and detailed annotations. We introduce GigaHands, a massive annotated dataset capturing 34 hours of bimanual hand activities from 56 subjects and 417 objects, totaling 14k motion clips derived from 183 million frames paired with 84k text annotations. Our markerless capture setup and data acquisition protocol enable fully automatic 3D hand and object estimation while minimizing the effort required for text annotation. The scale and diversity of GigaHands enable broad applications, including text-driven action synthesis, hand motion captioning, and dynamic radiance field reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Despite extensive research since the community learned about adversarial examples 10 years ago, we still do not know how to train high-accuracy classifiers that are guaranteed to be robust to small perturbations of their inputs. Previous works often argued that this might be because no classifier exists that is robust and accurate at the same time. However, in computer vision this assumption does not match reality where humans are usually accurate and robust on most tasks of interest. We offer an alternative explanation and show that in certain settings robust generalization is only possible with unrealistically large amounts of data. More precisely we find a setting where a robust classifier exists, it is easy to learn an accurate classifier, yet it requires an exponential amount of data to learn a robust classifier. Based on this theoretical result, we explore how well robust classifiers generalize on datasets such as CIFAR-10. We come to the conclusion that on this datasets, the limitation of current robust models also lies in the generalization, and that they require a lot of data to do well on the test set. We also show that the problem is not in the expressiveness or generalization capabilities of current architectures, and that there are low magnitude features in the data which are useful for non-robust generalization but are not available for robust classifiers.

- **Summary**: Supervised 3D part segmentation models are tailored for a fixed set of objects and parts, limiting their transferability to open-set, real-world scenarios. Recent works have explored vision-language models (VLMs) as a promising alternative, using multi-view rendering and textual prompting to identify object parts. However, naively applying VLMs in this context introduces several drawbacks, such as the need for meticulous prompt engineering, and fails to leverage the 3D geometric structure of objects. To address these limitations, we propose COPS, a COmprehensive model for Parts Segmentation that blends the semantics extracted from visual concepts and 3D geometry to effectively identify object parts. COPS renders a point cloud from multiple viewpoints, extracts 2D features, projects them back to 3D, and uses a novel geometric-aware feature aggregation procedure to ensure spatial and semantic consistency. Finally, it clusters points into parts and labels them. We demonstrate that COPS is efficient, scalable, and achieves zero-shot state-of-the-art performance across five datasets, covering synthetic and real-world data, texture-less and coloured objects, as well as rigid and non-rigid shapes.

- **Summary**: Domain shift in the field of histopathological imaging is a common phenomenon due to the intra- and inter-hospital variability of staining and digitization protocols. The implementation of robust models, capable of creating generalized domains, represents a need to be solved. In this work, a new domain adaptation method to deal with the variability between histopathological images from multiple centers is presented. In particular, our method adds a training constraint to the supervised contrastive learning approach to achieve domain adaptation and improve inter-class separability. Experiments performed on domain adaptation and classification of whole-slide images of six skin cancer subtypes from two centers demonstrate the method's usefulness. The results reflect superior performance compared to not using domain adaptation after feature extraction or staining normalization.

- **Summary**: We propose to learn legged robot locomotion skills by watching thousands of wild animal videos from the internet, such as those featured in nature documentaries. Indeed, such videos offer a rich and diverse collection of plausible motion examples, which could inform how robots should move. To achieve this, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Wild Animal Videos (RLWAV), a method to ground these motions into physical robots. We first train a video classifier on a large-scale animal video dataset to recognize actions from RGB clips of animals in their natural habitats. We then train a multi-skill policy to control a robot in a physics simulator, using the classification score of a third-person camera capturing videos of the robot's movements as a reward for reinforcement learning. Finally, we directly transfer the learned policy to a real quadruped Solo. Remarkably, despite the extreme gap in both domain and embodiment between animals in the wild and robots, our approach enables the policy to learn diverse skills such as walking, jumping, and keeping still, without relying on reference trajectories nor skill-specific rewards.

- **Summary**: 6D Object pose estimation is a fundamental component in robotics enabling efficient interaction with the environment. It is particularly challenging in bin-picking applications, where objects may be textureless and in difficult poses, and occlusion between objects of the same type may cause confusion even in well-trained models. We propose a novel method of hard example synthesis that is model-agnostic, using existing simulators and the modeling of pose error in both the camera-to-object viewsphere and occlusion space. Through evaluation of the model performance with respect to the distribution of object poses and occlusions, we discover regions of high error and generate realistic training samples to specifically target these regions. With our training approach, we demonstrate an improvement in correct detection rate of up to 20% across several ROBI-dataset objects using state-of-the-art pose estimation models.

- **Summary**: We present HumanEdit, a high-quality, human-rewarded dataset specifically designed for instruction-guided image editing, enabling precise and diverse image manipulations through open-form language instructions. Previous large-scale editing datasets often incorporate minimal human feedback, leading to challenges in aligning datasets with human preferences. HumanEdit bridges this gap by employing human annotators to construct data pairs and administrators to provide feedback. With meticulously curation, HumanEdit comprises 5,751 images and requires more than 2,500 hours of human effort across four stages, ensuring both accuracy and reliability for a wide range of image editing tasks. The dataset includes six distinct types of editing instructions: Action, Add, Counting, Relation, Remove, and Replace, encompassing a broad spectrum of real-world scenarios. All images in the dataset are accompanied by masks, and for a subset of the data, we ensure that the instructions are sufficiently detailed to support mask-free editing. Furthermore, HumanEdit offers comprehensive diversity and high-resolution $1024 \times 1024$ content sourced from various domains, setting a new versatile benchmark for instructional image editing datasets. With the aim of advancing future research and establishing evaluation benchmarks in the field of image editing, we release HumanEdit at \url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/BryanW/HumanEdit}.

- **Summary**: Capturing the temporal evolution of Gaussian properties such as position, rotation, and scale is a challenging task due to the vast number of time-varying parameters and the limited photometric data available, which generally results in convergence issues, making it difficult to find an optimal solution. While feeding all inputs into an end-to-end neural network can effectively model complex temporal dynamics, this approach lacks explicit supervision and struggles to generate high-quality transformation fields. On the other hand, using time-conditioned polynomial functions to model Gaussian trajectories and orientations provides a more explicit and interpretable solution, but requires significant handcrafted effort and lacks generalizability across diverse scenes. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach based on a learnable infinite Taylor Formula to model the temporal evolution of Gaussians. This method offers both the flexibility of an implicit network-based approach and the interpretability of explicit polynomial functions, allowing for more robust and generalizable modeling of Gaussian dynamics across various dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments on dynamic novel view rendering tasks are conducted on public datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in this domain.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of generative models in creating highly realistic images poses substantial risks for misinformation dissemination. For instance, a synthetic image, when shared on social media, can mislead extensive audiences and erode trust in digital content, resulting in severe repercussions. Despite some progress, academia has not yet created a large and diversified deepfake detection dataset for social media, nor has it devised an effective solution to address this issue. In this paper, we introduce the Social media Image Detection dataSet (SID-Set), which offers three key advantages: (1) extensive volume, featuring 300K AI-generated/tampered and authentic images with comprehensive annotations, (2) broad diversity, encompassing fully synthetic and tampered images across various classes, and (3) elevated realism, with images that are predominantly indistinguishable from genuine ones through mere visual inspection. Furthermore, leveraging the exceptional capabilities of large multimodal models, we propose a new image deepfake detection, localization, and explanation framework, named SIDA (Social media Image Detection, localization, and explanation Assistant). SIDA not only discerns the authenticity of images, but also delineates tampered regions through mask prediction and provides textual explanations of the model's judgment criteria. Compared with state-of-the-art deepfake detection models on SID-Set and other benchmarks, extensive experiments demonstrate that SIDA achieves superior performance among diversified settings. The code, model, and dataset will be released.

- **Summary**: Accurate medical image segmentation is essential for effective diagnosis and treatment planning but is often challenged by domain shifts caused by variations in imaging devices, acquisition conditions, and patient-specific attributes. Traditional domain generalization methods typically require inclusion of parts of the test domain within the training set, which is not always feasible in clinical settings with limited diverse data. Additionally, although diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in image generation and style transfer, they often fail to preserve the critical structural information necessary for precise medical analysis. To address these issues, we propose a novel medical image segmentation method that combines diffusion models and Structure-Preserving Network for structure-aware one-shot image stylization. Our approach effectively mitigates domain shifts by transforming images from various sources into a consistent style while maintaining the location, size, and shape of lesions. This ensures robust and accurate segmentation even when the target domain is absent from the training data. Experimental evaluations on colonoscopy polyp segmentation and skin lesion segmentation datasets show that our method enhances the robustness and accuracy of segmentation models, achieving superior performance metrics compared to baseline models without style transfer. This structure-aware stylization framework offers a practical solution for improving medical image segmentation across diverse domains, facilitating more reliable clinical diagnoses.

- **Summary**: Evaluating the quality of synthesized images remains a significant challenge in the development of text-to-image (T2I) generation. Most existing studies in this area primarily focus on evaluating text-image alignment, image quality, and object composition capabilities, with comparatively fewer studies addressing the evaluation of the factuality of T2I models, particularly when the concepts involved are knowledge-intensive. To mitigate this gap, we present T2I-FactualBench in this work - the largest benchmark to date in terms of the number of concepts and prompts specifically designed to evaluate the factuality of knowledge-intensive concept generation. T2I-FactualBench consists of a three-tiered knowledge-intensive text-to-image generation framework, ranging from the basic memorization of individual knowledge concepts to the more complex composition of multiple knowledge concepts. We further introduce a multi-round visual question answering (VQA) based evaluation framework to assess the factuality of three-tiered knowledge-intensive text-to-image generation tasks. Experiments on T2I-FactualBench indicate that current state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models still leave significant room for improvement.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in text-guided image editing enable users to perform image edits through simple text inputs, leveraging the extensive priors of multi-step diffusion-based text-to-image models. However, these methods often fall short of the speed demands required for real-world and on-device applications due to the costly multi-step inversion and sampling process involved. In response to this, we introduce SwiftEdit, a simple yet highly efficient editing tool that achieve instant text-guided image editing (in 0.23s). The advancement of SwiftEdit lies in its two novel contributions: a one-step inversion framework that enables one-step image reconstruction via inversion and a mask-guided editing technique with our proposed attention rescaling mechanism to perform localized image editing. Extensive experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SwiftEdit. In particular, SwiftEdit enables instant text-guided image editing, which is extremely faster than previous multi-step methods (at least 50 times faster) while maintain a competitive performance in editing results.

- **Summary**: 3D anomaly detection and localization is of great significance for industrial inspection. Prior 3D anomaly detection and localization methods focus on the setting that the testing data share the same category as the training data which is normal. However, in real-world applications, the normal training data for the target 3D objects can be unavailable due to issues like data privacy or export control regulation. To tackle these challenges, we identify a new task -- zero-shot 3D anomaly detection and localization, where the training and testing classes do not overlap. To this end, we design 3DzAL, a novel patch-level contrastive learning framework based on pseudo anomalies generated using the inductive bias from task-irrelevant 3D xyz data to learn more representative feature representations. Furthermore, we train a normalcy classifier network to classify the normal patches and pseudo anomalies and utilize the classification result jointly with feature distance to design anomaly scores. Instead of directly using the patch point clouds, we introduce adversarial perturbations to the input patch xyz data before feeding into the 3D normalcy classifier for the classification-based anomaly score.

- **Summary**: In the computer vision and machine learning communities, as well as in many other research domains, rigorous evaluation of any new method, including classifiers, is essential. One key component of the evaluation process is the ability to compare and rank methods. However, ranking classifiers and accurately comparing their performances, especially when taking application-specific preferences into account, remains challenging. For instance, commonly used evaluation tools like Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision/Recall (PR) spaces display performances based on two scores. Hence, they are inherently limited in their ability to compare classifiers across a broader range of scores and lack the capability to establish a clear ranking among classifiers. In this paper, we present a novel versatile tool, named the Tile, that organizes an infinity of ranking scores in a single 2D map for two-class classifiers, including common evaluation scores such as the accuracy, the true positive rate, the positive predictive value, Jaccard's coefficient, and all F-beta scores. Furthermore, we study the properties of the underlying ranking scores, such as the influence of the priors or the correspondences with the ROC space, and depict how to characterize any other score by comparing them to the Tile. Overall, we demonstrate that the Tile is a powerful tool that effectively captures all the rankings in a single visualization and allows interpreting them.

- **Summary**: Standard single-image super-resolution (SR) upsamples and restores entire images. Yet several real-world applications require higher resolutions only in specific regions, such as license plates or faces, making the super-resolution of the entire image, along with the associated memory and computational cost, unnecessary. We propose a novel task, called LocalSR, to restore only local regions of the low-resolution image. For this problem setting, we propose a context-based local super-resolution (CLSR) to super-resolve only specified regions of interest (ROI) while leveraging the entire image as context. Our method uses three parallel processing modules: a base module for super-resolving the ROI, a global context module for gathering helpful features from across the image, and a proximity integration module for concentrating on areas surrounding the ROI, progressively propagating features from distant pixels to the target region. Experimental results indicate that our approach, with its reduced low complexity, outperforms variants that focus exclusively on the ROI.

- **Summary**: Despite a big leap forward in capability, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) tend to behave like a sloth in practical use, i.e., slow response and large latency. Recent efforts are devoted to building tiny MLLMs for better efficiency, but the plethora of visual tokens still used limit their actual speedup. In this paper, we propose a powerful and fast tiny MLLM called FlashSloth. Different from previous efforts, FlashSloth focuses on improving the descriptive power of visual tokens in the process of compressing their redundant semantics. In particular, FlashSloth introduces embedded visual compression designs to capture both visually salient and instruction-related image information, so as to achieving superior multimodal performance with fewer visual tokens. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed FlashSloth, and a bunch of tiny but strong MLLMs are also comprehensively compared, e.g., InternVL2, MiniCPM-V2 and Qwen2-VL. The experimental results show that compared with these advanced tiny MLLMs, our FlashSloth can greatly reduce the number of visual tokens, training memory and computation complexity while retaining high performance on various VL tasks.

- **Summary**: Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently shown promising results for image reconstruction on simulated positron emission tomography (PET) datasets. In this work we have developed and implemented practical methodology for 3D image reconstruction with SGMs, and perform (to our knowledge) the first SGM-based reconstruction of real fully 3D PET data. We train an SGM on full-count reference brain images, and extend methodology to allow SGM-based reconstructions at very low counts (1% of original, to simulate low-dose or short-duration scanning). We then perform reconstructions for multiple independent realisations of 1% count data, allowing us to analyse the bias and variance characteristics of the method. We sample from the learned posterior distribution of the generative algorithm to calculate uncertainty images for our reconstructions. We evaluate the method's performance on real full- and low-count PET data and compare with conventional OSEM and MAP-EM baselines, showing that our SGM-based low-count reconstructions match full-dose reconstructions more closely and in a bias-variance trade-off comparison, our SGM-reconstructed images have lower variance than existing baselines. Future work will compare to supervised deep-learned methods, with other avenues for investigation including how data conditioning affects the SGM's posterior distribution and the algorithm's performance with different tracers.

- **Summary**: Large high-quality medical image datasets are difficult to acquire but necessary for many deep learning applications. For positron emission tomography (PET), reconstructed image quality is limited by inherent Poisson noise. We propose a novel method for synthesising diverse and realistic pseudo-PET images with improved signal-to-noise ratio. We also show how our pseudo-PET images may be exploited as a generative prior for single-subject PET image reconstruction. Firstly, we perform deep-learned deformable registration of multi-subject magnetic resonance (MR) images paired to multi-subject PET images. We then use the anatomically-learned deformation fields to transform multiple PET images to the same reference space, before averaging random subsets of the transformed multi-subject data to form a large number of varying pseudo-PET images. We observe that using MR information for registration imbues the resulting pseudo-PET images with improved anatomical detail compared to the originals. We consider applications to PET image reconstruction, by generating pseudo-PET images in the same space as the intended single-subject reconstruction and using them as training data for a diffusion model-based reconstruction method. We show visual improvement and reduced background noise in our 2D reconstructions as compared to OSEM, MAP-EM and an existing state-of-the-art diffusion model-based approach. Our method shows the potential for utilising highly subject-specific prior information within a generative reconstruction framework. Future work may compare the benefits of our approach to explicitly MR-guided reconstruction methodologies.

- **Summary**: We present Liquid, an auto-regressive generation paradigm that seamlessly integrates visual comprehension and generation by tokenizing images into discrete codes and learning these code embeddings alongside text tokens within a shared feature space for both vision and language. Unlike previous multimodal large language model (MLLM), Liquid achieves this integration using a single large language model (LLM), eliminating the need for external pretrained visual embeddings such as CLIP. For the first time, Liquid uncovers a scaling law that performance drop unavoidably brought by the unified training of visual and language tasks diminishes as the model size increases. Furthermore, the unified token space enables visual generation and comprehension tasks to mutually enhance each other, effectively removing the typical interference seen in earlier models. We show that existing LLMs can serve as strong foundations for Liquid, saving 100x in training costs while outperforming Chameleon in multimodal capabilities and maintaining language performance comparable to mainstream LLMs like LLAMA2. Liquid also outperforms models like SD v2.1 and SD-XL (FID of 5.47 on MJHQ-30K), excelling in both vision-language and text-only tasks. This work demonstrates that LLMs such as LLAMA3.2 and GEMMA2 are powerful multimodal generators, offering a scalable solution for enhancing both vision-language understanding and generation. The code and models will be released.

- **Summary**: Applying pseudo labeling techniques has been found to be advantageous in semi-supervised 3D object detection (SSOD) in Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) for autonomous driving, particularly where labeled data is limited. In the literature, Exponential Moving Average (EMA) has been used for adjustments of the weights of teacher network by the student network. However, the same induces catastrophic forgetting in the teacher network. In this work, we address this issue by introducing a novel concept of Reflective Teacher where the student is trained by both labeled and pseudo labeled data while its knowledge is progressively passed to the teacher through a regularizer to ensure retention of previous knowledge. Additionally, we propose Geometry Aware BEV Fusion (GA-BEVFusion) for efficient alignment of multi-modal BEV features, thus reducing the disparity between the modalities - camera and LiDAR. This helps to map the precise geometric information embedded among LiDAR points reliably with the spatial priors for extraction of semantic information from camera images. Our experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate: 1) improved performance over state-of-the-art methods in both fully supervised and semi-supervised settings; 2) Reflective Teacher achieves equivalent performance with only 25% and 22% of labeled data for nuScenes and Waymo datasets respectively, in contrast to other fully supervised methods that utilize the full labeled dataset.

- **Summary**: Medical image reconstruction with pre-trained score-based generative models (SGMs) has advantages over other existing state-of-the-art deep-learned reconstruction methods, including improved resilience to different scanner setups and advanced image distribution modeling. SGM-based reconstruction has recently been applied to simulated positron emission tomography (PET) datasets, showing improved contrast recovery for out-of-distribution lesions relative to the state-of-the-art. However, existing methods for SGM-based reconstruction from PET data suffer from slow reconstruction, burdensome hyperparameter tuning and slice inconsistency effects (in 3D). In this work, we propose a practical methodology for fully 3D reconstruction that accelerates reconstruction and reduces the number of critical hyperparameters by matching the likelihood of an SGM's reverse diffusion process to a current iterate of the maximum-likelihood expectation maximization algorithm. Using the example of low-count reconstruction from simulated $[^{18}$F]DPA-714 datasets, we show our methodology can match or improve on the NRMSE and SSIM of existing state-of-the-art SGM-based PET reconstruction while reducing reconstruction time and the need for hyperparameter tuning. We evaluate our methodology against state-of-the-art supervised and conventional reconstruction algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate a first-ever implementation of SGM-based reconstruction for real 3D PET data, specifically $[^{18}$F]DPA-714 data, where we integrate perpendicular pre-trained SGMs to eliminate slice inconsistency issues.

- **Summary**: While motion generation has made substantial progress, its practical application remains constrained by dataset diversity and scale, limiting its ability to handle out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this, we propose a simple and effective baseline, RMD, which enhances the generalization of motion generation through retrieval-augmented techniques. Unlike previous retrieval-based methods, RMD requires no additional training and offers three key advantages: (1) the external retrieval database can be flexibly replaced; (2) body parts from the motion database can be reused, with an LLM facilitating splitting and recombination; and (3) a pre-trained motion diffusion model serves as a prior to improve the quality of motions obtained through retrieval and direct combination. Without any training, RMD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with notable advantages on out-of-distribution data.

- **Summary**: Temporal action segmentation and long-term action anticipation are two popular vision tasks for the temporal analysis of actions in videos. Despite apparent relevance and potential complementarity, these two problems have been investigated as separate and distinct tasks. In this work, we tackle these two problems, action segmentation and action anticipation, jointly using a unified diffusion model dubbed ActFusion. The key idea to unification is to train the model to effectively handle both visible and invisible parts of the sequence in an integrated manner; the visible part is for temporal segmentation, and the invisible part is for future anticipation. To this end, we introduce a new anticipative masking strategy during training in which a late part of the video frames is masked as invisible, and learnable tokens replace these frames to learn to predict the invisible future. Experimental results demonstrate the bi-directional benefits between action segmentation and anticipation. ActFusion achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the standard benchmarks of 50 Salads, Breakfast, and GTEA, outperforming task-specific models in both of the two tasks with a single unified model through joint learning.

- **Summary**: Properly understanding the performances of classifiers is essential in various scenarios. However, the literature often relies only on one or two standard scores to compare classifiers, which fails to capture the nuances of application-specific requirements, potentially leading to suboptimal classifier selection. Recently, a paper on the foundations of the theory of performance-based ranking introduced a tool, called the Tile, that organizes an infinity of ranking scores into a 2D map. Thanks to the Tile, it is now possible to evaluate and compare classifiers efficiently, displaying all possible application-specific preferences instead of having to rely on a pair of scores. In this paper, we provide a first hitchhiker's guide for understanding the performances of two-class classifiers by presenting four scenarios, each showcasing a different user profile: a theoretical analyst, a method designer, a benchmarker, and an application developer. Particularly, we show that we can provide different interpretative flavors that are adapted to the user's needs by mapping different values on the Tile. As an illustration, we leverage the newly introduced Tile tool and the different flavors to rank and analyze the performances of 74 state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models in two-class classification through the eyes of the four user profiles. Through these user profiles, we demonstrate that the Tile effectively captures the behavior of classifiers in a single visualization, while accommodating an infinite number of ranking scores.

- **Summary**: Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have become the de facto approach for discriminative vision-language representation learning. However, these models have limited language understanding, often exhibiting a "bag of words" behavior. At the same time, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which combine vision encoders with LLMs, have been shown capable of detailed vision-language reasoning, yet their autoregressive nature renders them less suitable for discriminative tasks.   In this work, we propose to combine "the best of both worlds": a new training approach for discriminative fine-tuning of LVLMs that results in strong discriminative and compositional capabilities. Essentially, our approach converts a generative LVLM into a discriminative one, unlocking its capability for powerful image-text discrimination combined with enhanced language understanding.   Our contributions include: (1) A carefully designed training/optimization framework that utilizes image-text pairs of variable length and granularity for training the model with both contrastive and next-token prediction losses. This is accompanied by ablation studies that justify the necessity of our framework's components. (2) A parameter-efficient adaptation method using a combination of soft prompting and LoRA adapters. (3) Significant improvements over state-of-the-art CLIP-like models of similar size, including standard image-text retrieval benchmarks and notable gains in compositionality.

- **Summary**: 3D occupancy prediction provides a comprehensive description of the surrounding scenes and has become an essential task for 3D perception. Most existing methods focus on offline perception from one or a few views and cannot be applied to embodied agents which demands to gradually perceive the scene through progressive embodied exploration. In this paper, we formulate an embodied 3D occupancy prediction task to target this practical scenario and propose a Gaussian-based EmbodiedOcc framework to accomplish it. We initialize the global scene with uniform 3D semantic Gaussians and progressively update local regions observed by the embodied agent. For each update, we extract semantic and structural features from the observed image and efficiently incorporate them via deformable cross-attention to refine the regional Gaussians. Finally, we employ Gaussian-to-voxel splatting to obtain the global 3D occupancy from the updated 3D Gaussians. Our EmbodiedOcc assumes an unknown (i.e., uniformly distributed) environment and maintains an explicit global memory of it with 3D Gaussians. It gradually gains knowledge through local refinement of regional Gaussians, which is consistent with how humans understand new scenes through embodied exploration. We reorganize an EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet benchmark based on local annotations to facilitate the evaluation of the embodied 3D occupancy prediction task. Experiments demonstrate that our EmbodiedOcc outperforms existing local prediction methods and accomplishes the embodied occupancy prediction with high accuracy and strong expandability.

- **Summary**: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in 3D scenes based on textual descriptions, which is essential for applications like augmented reality and robotics. Traditional 3DVG approaches rely on annotated 3D datasets and predefined object categories, limiting scalability and adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SeeGround, a zero-shot 3DVG framework leveraging 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on large-scale 2D data. We propose to represent 3D scenes as a hybrid of query-aligned rendered images and spatially enriched text descriptions, bridging the gap between 3D data and 2D-VLMs input formats. We propose two modules: the Perspective Adaptation Module, which dynamically selects viewpoints for query-relevant image rendering, and the Fusion Alignment Module, which integrates 2D images with 3D spatial descriptions to enhance object localization. Extensive experiments on ScanRefer and Nr3D demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing zero-shot methods by large margins. Notably, we exceed weakly supervised methods and rival some fully supervised ones, outperforming previous SOTA by 7.7% on ScanRefer and 7.1% on Nr3D, showcasing its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is an important task for robust vision-centric autonomous driving, which predicts fine-grained geometry and semantics of the surrounding scene. Most existing methods leverage dense grid-based scene representations, overlooking the spatial sparsity of the driving scenes. Although 3D semantic Gaussian serves as an object-centric sparse alternative, most of the Gaussians still describe the empty region with low efficiency. To address this, we propose a probabilistic Gaussian superposition model which interprets each Gaussian as a probability distribution of its neighborhood being occupied and conforms to probabilistic multiplication to derive the overall geometry. Furthermore, we adopt the exact Gaussian mixture model for semantics calculation to avoid unnecessary overlapping of Gaussians. To effectively initialize Gaussians in non-empty region, we design a distribution-based initialization module which learns the pixel-aligned occupancy distribution instead of the depth of surfaces. We conduct extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI-360 datasets and our GaussianFormer-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

- **Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) marks a transformative approach to distributed model training by combining locally optimized models from various clients into a unified global model. While FL preserves data privacy by eliminating centralized storage, it encounters significant challenges such as performance degradation, slower convergence, and reduced robustness of the global model due to the heterogeneity in client data distributions. Among the various forms of data heterogeneity, label skew emerges as a particularly formidable and prevalent issue, especially in domains such as image classification. To address these challenges, we begin with comprehensive experiments to pinpoint the underlying issues in the FL training process. Based on our findings, we then introduce an innovative dual-strategy approach designed to effectively resolve these issues. First, we introduce an adaptive loss function for client-side training, meticulously crafted to preserve previously acquired knowledge while maintaining an optimal equilibrium between local optimization and global model coherence. Secondly, we develop a dynamic aggregation strategy for aggregating client models at the server. This approach adapts to each client's unique learning patterns, effectively addressing the challenges of diverse data across the network. Our comprehensive evaluation, conducted across three diverse real-world datasets, coupled with theoretical convergence guarantees, demonstrates the superior efficacy of our method compared to several established state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: We present Florence-VL, a new family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with enriched visual representations produced by Florence-2, a generative vision foundation model. Unlike the widely used CLIP-style vision transformer trained by contrastive learning, Florence-2 can capture different levels and aspects of visual features, which are more versatile to be adapted to diverse downstream tasks. We propose a novel feature-fusion architecture and an innovative training recipe that effectively integrates Florence-2's visual features into pretrained LLMs, such as Phi 3.5 and LLama 3. In particular, we propose "depth-breath fusion (DBFusion)" to fuse the visual features extracted from different depths and under multiple prompts. Our model training is composed of end-to-end pretraining of the whole model followed by finetuning of the projection layer and the LLM, on a carefully designed recipe of diverse open-source datasets that include high-quality image captions and instruction-tuning pairs. Our quantitative analysis and visualization of Florence-VL's visual features show its advantages over popular vision encoders on vision-language alignment, where the enriched depth and breath play important roles. Florence-VL achieves significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art MLLMs across various multi-modal and vision-centric benchmarks covering general VQA, perception, hallucination, OCR, Chart, knowledge-intensive understanding, etc. To facilitate future research, our models and the complete training recipe are open-sourced. https://github.com/JiuhaiChen/Florence-VL

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have been cherished for their ability to perform zero-shot visual recognition on open-vocabulary concepts. This is achieved by selecting the object category whose textual representation bears the highest similarity with the query image. While successful in some domains, this method struggles with identifying fine-grained entities as well as generalizing to unseen concepts that are not captured by the training distribution. Recent works attempt to mitigate these challenges by integrating category descriptions at test time, albeit yielding modest improvements. We attribute these limited gains to a fundamental misalignment between image and description representations, which is rooted in the pretraining structure of CLIP. In this paper, we propose GRAIN, a new pretraining strategy aimed at aligning representations at both fine and coarse levels simultaneously. Our approach learns to jointly ground textual descriptions in image regions along with aligning overarching captions with global image representations. To drive this pre-training, we leverage frozen Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to derive large-scale synthetic annotations. We demonstrate the enhanced zero-shot performance of our model compared to current state-of-the art methods across 11 diverse image classification datasets. Additionally, we introduce Products-2023, a newly curated, manually labeled dataset featuring novel concepts, and showcase our model's ability to recognize these concepts by benchmarking on it. Significant improvements achieved by our model on other downstream tasks like retrieval further highlight the superior quality of representations learned by our approach.

- **Summary**: We present Infinity, a Bitwise Visual AutoRegressive Modeling capable of generating high-resolution, photorealistic images following language instruction. Infinity redefines visual autoregressive model under a bitwise token prediction framework with an infinite-vocabulary tokenizer & classifier and bitwise self-correction mechanism, remarkably improving the generation capacity and details. By theoretically scaling the tokenizer vocabulary size to infinity and concurrently scaling the transformer size, our method significantly unleashes powerful scaling capabilities compared to vanilla VAR. Infinity sets a new record for autoregressive text-to-image models, outperforming top-tier diffusion models like SD3-Medium and SDXL. Notably, Infinity surpasses SD3-Medium by improving the GenEval benchmark score from 0.62 to 0.73 and the ImageReward benchmark score from 0.87 to 0.96, achieving a win rate of 66%. Without extra optimization, Infinity generates a high-quality 1024x1024 image in 0.8 seconds, making it 2.6x faster than SD3-Medium and establishing it as the fastest text-to-image model. Models and codes will be released to promote further exploration of Infinity for visual generation and unified tokenizer modeling.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there has been a significant surge of interest in unifying image comprehension and generation within Large Language Models (LLMs). This growing interest has prompted us to explore extending this unification to videos. The core challenge lies in developing a versatile video tokenizer that captures both the spatial characteristics and temporal dynamics of videos to obtain representations for LLMs, and the representations can be further decoded into realistic video clips to enable video generation. In this work, we introduce Divot, a Diffusion-Powered Video Tokenizer, which leverages the diffusion process for self-supervised video representation learning. We posit that if a video diffusion model can effectively de-noise video clips by taking the features of a video tokenizer as the condition, then the tokenizer has successfully captured robust spatial and temporal information. Additionally, the video diffusion model inherently functions as a de-tokenizer, decoding videos from their representations. Building upon the Divot tokenizer, we present Divot-Vicuna through video-to-text autoregression and text-to-video generation by modeling the distributions of continuous-valued Divot features with a Gaussian Mixture Model. Experimental results demonstrate that our diffusion-based video tokenizer, when integrated with a pre-trained LLM, achieves competitive performance across various video comprehension and generation benchmarks. The instruction tuned Divot-Vicuna also excels in video storytelling, generating interleaved narratives and corresponding videos.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel clothed human model that can be learned from multiview RGB videos, with a particular emphasis on recovering physically accurate body and cloth movements. Our method, Position Based Dynamic Gaussians (PBDyG), realizes ``movement-dependent'' cloth deformation via physical simulation, rather than merely relying on ``pose-dependent'' rigid transformations. We model the clothed human holistically but with two distinct physical entities in contact: clothing modeled as 3D Gaussians, which are attached to a skinned SMPL body that follows the movement of the person in the input videos. The articulation of the SMPL body also drives physically-based simulation of the clothes' Gaussians to transform the avatar to novel poses. In order to run position based dynamics simulation, physical properties including mass and material stiffness are estimated from the RGB videos through Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting. Experiments demonstrate that our method not only accurately reproduces appearance but also enables the reconstruction of avatars wearing highly deformable garments, such as skirts or coats, which have been challenging to reconstruct using existing methods.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the challenge of performing open-vocabulary video instance segmentation (OV-VIS) in real-time. We analyze the computational bottlenecks of state-of-the-art foundation models that performs OV-VIS, and propose a new method, TROY-VIS, that significantly improves processing speed while maintaining high accuracy. We introduce three key techniques: (1) Decoupled Attention Feature Enhancer to speed up information interaction between different modalities and scales; (2) Flash Embedding Memory for obtaining fast text embeddings of object categories; and, (3) Kernel Interpolation for exploiting the temporal continuity in videos. Our experiments demonstrate that TROY-VIS achieves the best trade-off between accuracy and speed on two large-scale OV-VIS benchmarks, BURST and LV-VIS, running 20x faster than GLEE-Lite (25 FPS v.s. 1.25 FPS) with comparable or even better accuracy. These results demonstrate TROY-VIS's potential for real-time applications in dynamic environments such as mobile robotics and augmented reality. Code and model will be released at https://github.com/google-research/troyvis.

- **Summary**: Text-to-video generation models have shown significant progress in the recent years. However, they still struggle with generating complex dynamic scenes based on compositional text prompts, such as attribute binding for multiple objects, temporal dynamics associated with different objects, and interactions between objects. Our key motivation is that complex tasks can be decomposed into simpler ones, each handled by a role-specialized MLLM agent. Multiple agents can collaborate together to achieve collective intelligence for complex goals. We propose GenMAC, an iterative, multi-agent framework that enables compositional text-to-video generation. The collaborative workflow includes three stages: Design, Generation, and Redesign, with an iterative loop between the Generation and Redesign stages to progressively verify and refine the generated videos. The Redesign stage is the most challenging stage that aims to verify the generated videos, suggest corrections, and redesign the text prompts, frame-wise layouts, and guidance scales for the next iteration of generation. To avoid hallucination of a single MLLM agent, we decompose this stage to four sequentially-executed MLLM-based agents: verification agent, suggestion agent, correction agent, and output structuring agent. Furthermore, to tackle diverse scenarios of compositional text-to-video generation, we design a self-routing mechanism to adaptively select the proper correction agent from a collection of correction agents each specialized for one scenario. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GenMAC, achieving state-of-the art performance in compositional text-to-video generation.

- **Summary**: Despite nearly a decade of literature on style transfer, there is no undisputed definition of artistic style. State-of-the-art models produce impressive results but are difficult to interpret since, without a coherent definition of style, the problem of style transfer is inherently ill-posed. Early work framed style-transfer as an optimization problem but treated style as a measure only of texture. This led to artifacts in the outputs of early models where content features from the style image sometimes bled into the output image. Conversely, more recent work with diffusion models offers compelling empirical results but provides little theoretical grounding. To address these issues, we propose an alternative definition of artistic style. We suggest that style should be thought of as a set of global symmetries that dictate the arrangement of local textures. We validate this perspective empirically by learning the symmetries of a large dataset of paintings and showing that symmetries are predictive of the artistic movement to which each painting belongs. Finally, we show that by considering both local and global features, using both Lie generators and traditional measures of texture, we can quantitatively capture the stylistic similarity between artists better than with either set of features alone. This approach not only aligns well with art historians' consensus but also offers a robust framework for distinguishing nuanced stylistic differences, allowing for a more interpretable, theoretically grounded approach to style transfer.

- **Summary**: Recent developments in Large Language Models pre-trained on extensive corpora have shown significant success in various natural language processing tasks with minimal fine-tuning. This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich "corpus", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging "language" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.

- **Summary**: Videos are inherently temporal sequences by their very nature. In this work, we explore the potential of modeling videos in a chronological and scalable manner with autoregressive (AR) language models, inspired by their success in natural language processing. We introduce DiCoDe, a novel approach that leverages Diffusion-Compressed Deep Tokens to generate videos with a language model in an autoregressive manner. Unlike existing methods that employ low-level representations with limited compression rates, DiCoDe utilizes deep tokens with a considerable compression rate (a 1000x reduction in token count). This significant compression is made possible by a tokenizer trained through leveraging the prior knowledge of video diffusion models. Deep tokens enable DiCoDe to employ vanilla AR language models for video generation, akin to translating one visual "language" into another. By treating videos as temporal sequences, DiCoDe fully harnesses the capabilities of language models for autoregressive generation. DiCoDe is scalable using readily available AR architectures, and is capable of generating videos ranging from a few seconds to one minute using only 4 A100 GPUs for training. We evaluate DiCoDe both quantitatively and qualitatively, demonstrating that it performs comparably to existing methods in terms of quality while ensuring efficient training. To showcase its scalability, we release a series of DiCoDe configurations with varying parameter sizes and observe a consistent improvement in performance as the model size increases from 100M to 3B. We believe that DiCoDe's exploration in academia represents a promising initial step toward scalable video modeling with AR language models, paving the way for the development of larger and more powerful video generation models.

- **Summary**: The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models, leveraging the power of Large Language Models, has recently demonstrated superior multimodal understanding and reasoning abilities, heralding a new era for artificial general intelligence. However, achieving AGI necessitates more than just comprehension and reasoning. A crucial capability required is effective planning in diverse scenarios, which involves making reasonable decisions based on complex environments to solve real-world problems. Despite its importance, the planning abilities of current MLLMs in varied scenarios remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce EgoPlan-Bench2, a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the planning capabilities of MLLMs across a wide range of real-world scenarios. EgoPlan-Bench2 encompasses everyday tasks spanning 4 major domains and 24 detailed scenarios, closely aligned with human daily life. EgoPlan-Bench2 is constructed through a semi-automatic process utilizing egocentric videos, complemented by manual verification. Grounded in a first-person perspective, it mirrors the way humans approach problem-solving in everyday life. We evaluate 21 competitive MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their limitations, revealing that they face significant challenges in real-world planning. To further improve the planning proficiency of current MLLMs, we propose a training-free approach using multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting through investigating the effectiveness of various multimodal prompts in complex planning. Our approach enhances the performance of GPT-4V by 10.24 on EgoPlan-Bench2 without additional training. Our work not only sheds light on the current limitations of MLLMs in planning, but also provides insights for future enhancements in this critical area. We have made data and code available at https://qiulu66.github.io/egoplanbench2/.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in video diffusion models have unlocked new potential for realistic audio-driven talking video generation. However, achieving seamless audio-lip synchronization, maintaining long-term identity consistency, and producing natural, audio-aligned expressions in generated talking videos remain significant challenges. To address these challenges, we propose Memory-guided EMOtion-aware diffusion (MEMO), an end-to-end audio-driven portrait animation approach to generate identity-consistent and expressive talking videos. Our approach is built around two key modules: (1) a memory-guided temporal module, which enhances long-term identity consistency and motion smoothness by developing memory states to store information from a longer past context to guide temporal modeling via linear attention; and (2) an emotion-aware audio module, which replaces traditional cross attention with multi-modal attention to enhance audio-video interaction, while detecting emotions from audio to refine facial expressions via emotion adaptive layer norm. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that MEMO generates more realistic talking videos across diverse image and audio types, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in overall quality, audio-lip synchronization, identity consistency, and expression-emotion alignment.

- **Summary**: Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs impede their advancement. The majority of computation stems from the overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer decoder. In this paper, we propose to build efficient MLLMs by leveraging the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each transformer decoder layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layer and thus design a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and performance of our models. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments with two baseline models across 14 benchmarks. Our model, p-MoD, matches or even surpasses the performance of the baseline models, with only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.8% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.

- **Summary**: Latent variable generative models have emerged as powerful tools for generative tasks including image and video synthesis. These models are enabled by pretrained autoencoders that map high resolution data into a compressed lower dimensional latent space, where the generative models can subsequently be developed while requiring fewer computational resources. Despite their effectiveness, the direct application of latent variable models to higher dimensional domains such as videos continues to pose challenges for efficient training and inference. In this paper, we propose an autoencoder that projects volumetric data onto a four-plane factorized latent space that grows sublinearly with the input size, making it ideal for higher dimensional data like videos. The design of our factorized model supports straightforward adoption in a number of conditional generation tasks with latent diffusion models (LDMs), such as class-conditional generation, frame prediction, and video interpolation. Our results show that the proposed four-plane latent space retains a rich representation needed for high-fidelity reconstructions despite the heavy compression, while simultaneously enabling LDMs to operate with significant improvements in speed and memory.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes to solve the problem of Vision-and-Language Navigation with legged robots, which not only provides a flexible way for humans to command but also allows the robot to navigate through more challenging and cluttered scenes. However, it is non-trivial to translate human language instructions all the way to low-level leg joint actions. We propose NaVILA, a 2-level framework that unifies a Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) with locomotion skills. Instead of directly predicting low-level actions from VLA, NaVILA first generates mid-level actions with spatial information in the form of language, (e.g., "moving forward 75cm"), which serves as an input for a visual locomotion RL policy for execution. NaVILA substantially improves previous approaches on existing benchmarks. The same advantages are demonstrated in our newly developed benchmarks with IsaacLab, featuring more realistic scenes, low-level controls, and real-world robot experiments. We show more results at https://navila-bot.github.io/

- **Summary**: Automatic detection and prevention of open-set failures are crucial in closed-loop robotic systems. Recent studies often struggle to simultaneously identify unexpected failures reactively after they occur and prevent foreseeable ones proactively. To this end, we propose Code-as-Monitor (CaM), a novel paradigm leveraging the vision-language model (VLM) for both open-set reactive and proactive failure detection. The core of our method is to formulate both tasks as a unified set of spatio-temporal constraint satisfaction problems and use VLM-generated code to evaluate them for real-time monitoring. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of monitoring, we further introduce constraint elements that abstract constraint-related entities or their parts into compact geometric elements. This approach offers greater generality, simplifies tracking, and facilitates constraint-aware visual programming by leveraging these elements as visual prompts. Experiments show that CaM achieves a 28.7% higher success rate and reduces execution time by 31.8% under severe disturbances compared to baselines across three simulators and a real-world setting. Moreover, CaM can be integrated with open-loop control policies to form closed-loop systems, enabling long-horizon tasks in cluttered scenes with dynamic environments.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel method for human shape and pose recovery that can fully leverage multiple static views. We target fixed-multiview people monitoring, including elderly care and safety monitoring, in which calibrated cameras can be installed at the corners of a room or an open space but whose configuration may vary depending on the environment. Our key idea is to formulate it as neural optimization. We achieve this with HeatFormer, a neural optimizer that iteratively refines the SMPL parameters given multiview images, which is fundamentally agonistic to the configuration of views. HeatFormer realizes this SMPL parameter estimation as heat map generation and alignment with a novel transformer encoder and decoder. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HeatFormer including its accuracy, robustness to occlusion, and generalizability through an extensive set of experiments. We believe HeatFormer can serve a key role in passive human behavior modeling.

- **Summary**: Gaussian splatting methods are emerging as a popular approach for converting multi-view image data into scene representations that allow view synthesis. In particular, there is interest in enabling view synthesis for dynamic scenes using only monocular input data -- an ill-posed and challenging problem. The fast pace of work in this area has produced multiple simultaneous papers that claim to work best, which cannot all be true. In this work, we organize, benchmark, and analyze many Gaussian-splatting-based methods, providing apples-to-apples comparisons that prior works have lacked. We use multiple existing datasets and a new instructive synthetic dataset designed to isolate factors that affect reconstruction quality. We systematically categorize Gaussian splatting methods into specific motion representation types and quantify how their differences impact performance. Empirically, we find that their rank order is well-defined in synthetic data, but the complexity of real-world data currently overwhelms the differences. Furthermore, the fast rendering speed of all Gaussian-based methods comes at the cost of brittleness in optimization. We summarize our experiments into a list of findings that can help to further progress in this lively problem setting. Project Webpage: https://lynl7130.github.io/MonoDyGauBench.github.io/

- **Summary**: We consider indoor 3D object detection with respect to a single RGB(-D) frame acquired from a commodity handheld device. We seek to significantly advance the status quo with respect to both data and modeling. First, we establish that existing datasets have significant limitations to scale, accuracy, and diversity of objects. As a result, we introduce the Cubify-Anything 1M (CA-1M) dataset, which exhaustively labels over 400K 3D objects on over 1K highly accurate laser-scanned scenes with near-perfect registration to over 3.5K handheld, egocentric captures. Next, we establish Cubify Transformer (CuTR), a fully Transformer 3D object detection baseline which rather than operating in 3D on point or voxel-based representations, predicts 3D boxes directly from 2D features derived from RGB(-D) inputs. While this approach lacks any 3D inductive biases, we show that paired with CA-1M, CuTR outperforms point-based methods - accurately recalling over 62% of objects in 3D, and is significantly more capable at handling noise and uncertainty present in commodity LiDAR-derived depth maps while also providing promising RGB only performance without architecture changes. Furthermore, by pre-training on CA-1M, CuTR can outperform point-based methods on a more diverse variant of SUN RGB-D - supporting the notion that while inductive biases in 3D are useful at the smaller sizes of existing datasets, they fail to scale to the data-rich regime of CA-1M. Overall, this dataset and baseline model provide strong evidence that we are moving towards models which can effectively Cubify Anything.

- **Summary**: We propose an efficient radiance field rendering algorithm that incorporates a rasterization process on sparse voxels without neural networks or 3D Gaussians. There are two key contributions coupled with the proposed system. The first is to render sparse voxels in the correct depth order along pixel rays by using dynamic Morton ordering. This avoids the well-known popping artifact found in Gaussian splatting. Second, we adaptively fit sparse voxels to different levels of detail within scenes, faithfully reproducing scene details while achieving high rendering frame rates. Our method improves the previous neural-free voxel grid representation by over 4db PSNR and more than 10x rendering FPS speedup, achieving state-of-the-art comparable novel-view synthesis results. Additionally, our neural-free sparse voxels are seamlessly compatible with grid-based 3D processing algorithms. We achieve promising mesh reconstruction accuracy by integrating TSDF-Fusion and Marching Cubes into our sparse grid system.

- **Summary**: Large-scale diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual descriptions, gaining popularity across various applications. However, the generation of layered content, such as transparent images with foreground and background layers, remains an under-explored area. Layered content generation is crucial for creative workflows in fields like graphic design, animation, and digital art, where layer-based approaches are fundamental for flexible editing and composition. In this paper, we propose a novel image generation pipeline based on Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) that generates images with two layers: a foreground layer (RGBA) with transparency information and a background layer (RGB). Unlike existing methods that generate these layers sequentially, our approach introduces a harmonized generation mechanism that enables dynamic interactions between the layers for more coherent outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, showing significant improvements in visual coherence, image quality, and layer consistency compared to baseline methods.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We propose 4Real-Video, a novel framework for generating 4D videos, organized as a grid of video frames with both time and viewpoint axes. In this grid, each row contains frames sharing the same timestep, while each column contains frames from the same viewpoint. We propose a novel two-stream architecture. One stream performs viewpoint updates on columns, and the other stream performs temporal updates on rows. After each diffusion transformer layer, a synchronization layer exchanges information between the two token streams. We propose two implementations of the synchronization layer, using either hard or soft synchronization. This feedforward architecture improves upon previous work in three ways: higher inference speed, enhanced visual quality (measured by FVD, CLIP, and VideoScore), and improved temporal and viewpoint consistency (measured by VideoScore and Dust3R-Confidence).

- **Summary**: We present a system that allows for accurate, fast, and robust estimation of camera parameters and depth maps from casual monocular videos of dynamic scenes. Most conventional structure from motion and monocular SLAM techniques assume input videos that feature predominantly static scenes with large amounts of parallax. Such methods tend to produce erroneous estimates in the absence of these conditions. Recent neural network-based approaches attempt to overcome these challenges; however, such methods are either computationally expensive or brittle when run on dynamic videos with uncontrolled camera motion or unknown field of view. We demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of a deep visual SLAM framework: with careful modifications to its training and inference schemes, this system can scale to real-world videos of complex dynamic scenes with unconstrained camera paths, including videos with little camera parallax. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real videos demonstrate that our system is significantly more accurate and robust at camera pose and depth estimation when compared with prior and concurrent work, with faster or comparable running times.

- **Summary**: The choice of data representation is a key factor in the success of deep learning in geometric tasks. For instance, DUSt3R has recently introduced the concept of viewpoint-invariant point maps, generalizing depth prediction, and showing that one can reduce all the key problems in the 3D reconstruction of static scenes to predicting such point maps. In this paper, we develop an analogous concept for a very different problem, namely, the reconstruction of the 3D shape and pose of deformable objects. To this end, we introduce the Dual Point Maps (DualPM), where a pair of point maps is extracted from the {same} image, one associating pixels to their 3D locations on the object, and the other to a canonical version of the object at rest pose. We also extend point maps to amodal reconstruction, seeing through self-occlusions to obtain the complete shape of the object. We show that 3D reconstruction and 3D pose estimation reduce to the prediction of the DualPMs. We demonstrate empirically that this representation is a good target for a deep network to predict; specifically, we consider modeling horses, showing that DualPMs can be trained purely on 3D synthetic data, consisting of a single model of a horse, while generalizing very well to real images. With this, we improve by a large margin previous methods for the 3D analysis and reconstruction of this type of objects.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces UnZipLoRA, a method for decomposing an image into its constituent subject and style, represented as two distinct LoRAs (Low-Rank Adaptations). Unlike existing personalization techniques that focus on either subject or style in isolation, or require separate training sets for each, UnZipLoRA disentangles these elements from a single image by training both the LoRAs simultaneously. UnZipLoRA ensures that the resulting LoRAs are compatible, i.e., they can be seamlessly combined using direct addition. UnZipLoRA enables independent manipulation and recontextualization of subject and style, including generating variations of each, applying the extracted style to new subjects, and recombining them to reconstruct the original image or create novel variations. To address the challenge of subject and style entanglement, UnZipLoRA employs a novel prompt separation technique, as well as column and block separation strategies to accurately preserve the characteristics of subject and style, and ensure compatibility between the learned LoRAs. Evaluation with human studies and quantitative metrics demonstrates UnZipLoRA's effectiveness compared to other state-of-the-art methods, including DreamBooth-LoRA, Inspiration Tree, and B-LoRA.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in vision-language models have enhanced performance by increasing the length of visual tokens, making them much longer than text tokens and significantly raising computational costs. However, we observe that the visual tokens generated by popular vision encoders, such as CLIP and SigLIP, contain significant redundancy. To address this, we introduce VisionZip, a simple yet effective method that selects a set of informative tokens for input to the language model, reducing visual token redundancy and improving efficiency while maintaining model performance. The proposed VisionZip can be widely applied to image and video understanding tasks and is well-suited for multi-turn dialogues in real-world scenarios, where previous methods tend to underperform. Experimental results show that VisionZip outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by at least 5% performance gains across nearly all settings. Moreover, our method significantly enhances model inference speed, improving the prefilling time by 8x and enabling the LLaVA-Next 13B model to infer faster than the LLaVA-Next 7B model while achieving better results. Furthermore, we analyze the causes of this redundancy and encourage the community to focus on extracting better visual features rather than merely increasing token length.

- **Summary**: Visual language models (VLMs) have made significant advances in accuracy in recent years. However, their efficiency has received much less attention. This paper introduces NVILA, a family of open VLMs designed to optimize both efficiency and accuracy. Building on top of VILA, we improve its model architecture by first scaling up the spatial and temporal resolutions, and then compressing visual tokens. This "scale-then-compress" approach enables NVILA to efficiently process high-resolution images and long videos. We also conduct a systematic investigation to enhance the efficiency of NVILA throughout its entire lifecycle, from training and fine-tuning to deployment. NVILA matches or surpasses the accuracy of many leading open and proprietary VLMs across a wide range of image and video benchmarks. At the same time, it reduces training costs by 4.5X, fine-tuning memory usage by 3.4X, pre-filling latency by 1.6-2.2X, and decoding latency by 1.2-2.8X. We will soon make our code and models available to facilitate reproducibility.

- **Summary**: Online free-viewpoint video (FVV) streaming is a challenging problem, which is relatively under-explored. It requires incremental on-the-fly updates to a volumetric representation, fast training and rendering to satisfy real-time constraints and a small memory footprint for efficient transmission. If achieved, it can enhance user experience by enabling novel applications, e.g., 3D video conferencing and live volumetric video broadcast, among others. In this work, we propose a novel framework for QUantized and Efficient ENcoding (QUEEN) for streaming FVV using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). QUEEN directly learns Gaussian attribute residuals between consecutive frames at each time-step without imposing any structural constraints on them, allowing for high quality reconstruction and generalizability. To efficiently store the residuals, we further propose a quantization-sparsity framework, which contains a learned latent-decoder for effectively quantizing attribute residuals other than Gaussian positions and a learned gating module to sparsify position residuals. We propose to use the Gaussian viewspace gradient difference vector as a signal to separate the static and dynamic content of the scene. It acts as a guide for effective sparsity learning and speeds up training. On diverse FVV benchmarks, QUEEN outperforms the state-of-the-art online FVV methods on all metrics. Notably, for several highly dynamic scenes, it reduces the model size to just 0.7 MB per frame while training in under 5 sec and rendering at 350 FPS.

- **Summary**: We present Turbo3D, an ultra-fast text-to-3D system capable of generating high-quality Gaussian splatting assets in under one second. Turbo3D employs a rapid 4-step, 4-view diffusion generator and an efficient feed-forward Gaussian reconstructor, both operating in latent space. The 4-step, 4-view generator is a student model distilled through a novel Dual-Teacher approach, which encourages the student to learn view consistency from a multi-view teacher and photo-realism from a single-view teacher. By shifting the Gaussian reconstructor's inputs from pixel space to latent space, we eliminate the extra image decoding time and halve the transformer sequence length for maximum efficiency. Our method demonstrates superior 3D generation results compared to previous baselines, while operating in a fraction of their runtime.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized 2D and 3D content creation, yet generating photorealistic dynamic 4D scenes remains a significant challenge. Existing dynamic 4D generation methods typically rely on distilling knowledge from pre-trained 3D generative models, often fine-tuned on synthetic object datasets. Consequently, the resulting scenes tend to be object-centric and lack photorealism. While text-to-video models can generate more realistic scenes with motion, they often struggle with spatial understanding and provide limited control over camera viewpoints during rendering. To address these limitations, we present PaintScene4D, a novel text-to-4D scene generation framework that departs from conventional multi-view generative models in favor of a streamlined architecture that harnesses video generative models trained on diverse real-world datasets. Our method first generates a reference video using a video generation model, and then employs a strategic camera array selection for rendering. We apply a progressive warping and inpainting technique to ensure both spatial and temporal consistency across multiple viewpoints. Finally, we optimize multi-view images using a dynamic renderer, enabling flexible camera control based on user preferences. Adopting a training-free architecture, our PaintScene4D efficiently produces realistic 4D scenes that can be viewed from arbitrary trajectories. The code will be made publicly available.

By elegantly coupling these complementary worlds through a dual-branch architecture, we seamlessly integrate stereo matching with learned contextual cues. Following this design, our framework introduces novel cost volume fusion mechanisms that effectively handle critical challenges such as textureless regions, occlusions, and non-Lambertian surfaces. Through our novel optical illusion dataset, MonoTrap, and extensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that our synthetic-only trained model achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot generalization, significantly outperforming existing solutions while showing remarkable robustness to challenging cases such as mirrors and transparencies.
