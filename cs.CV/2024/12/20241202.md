- **Summary**: Most real-world datasets consist of a natural hierarchy between classes or an inherent label structure that is either already available or can be constructed cheaply. However, most existing representation learning methods ignore this hierarchy, treating labels as permutation invariant. Recent work [Zeng et al., 2022] proposes using this structured information explicitly, but the use of Euclidean distance may distort the underlying semantic context [Chen et al., 2013]. In this work, motivated by the advantage of hyperbolic spaces in modeling hierarchical relationships, we propose a novel approach HypStructure: a Hyperbolic Structured regularization approach to accurately embed the label hierarchy into the learned representations. HypStructure is a simple-yet-effective regularizer that consists of a hyperbolic tree-based representation loss along with a centering loss, and can be combined with any standard task loss to learn hierarchy-informed features. Extensive experiments on several large-scale vision benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of HypStructure in reducing distortion and boosting generalization performance especially under low dimensional scenarios. For a better understanding of structured representation, we perform eigenvalue analysis that links the representation geometry to improved Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection performance seen empirically.

- **Summary**: Text-guided image manipulation has experienced notable advancement in recent years. In order to mitigate linguistic ambiguity, few-shot learning with visual examples has been applied for instructions that are underrepresented in the training set, or difficult to describe purely in language. However, learning from visual prompts requires strong reasoning capability, which diffusion models are struggling with. To address this issue, we introduce a novel multi-modal autoregressive model, dubbed $\textbf{InstaManip}$, that can $\textbf{insta}$ntly learn a new image $\textbf{manip}$ulation operation from textual and visual guidance via in-context learning, and apply it to new query images. Specifically, we propose an innovative group self-attention mechanism to break down the in-context learning process into two separate stages -- learning and applying, which simplifies the complex problem into two easier tasks. We also introduce a relation regularization method to further disentangle image transformation features from irrelevant contents in exemplar images. Extensive experiments suggest that our method surpasses previous few-shot image manipulation models by a notable margin ($\geq$19% in human evaluation). We also find our model can be further boosted by increasing the number or diversity of exemplar images.

- **Summary**: Several evaluation metrics have been developed recently to automatically assess the quality of generative AI reports for chest radiographs based only on textual information using lexical, semantic, or clinical named entity recognition methods. In this paper, we develop a new method of report quality evaluation by first extracting fine-grained finding patterns capturing the location, laterality, and severity of a large number of clinical findings. We then performed phrasal grounding to localize their associated anatomical regions on chest radiograph images. The textual and visual measures are then combined to rate the quality of the generated reports. We present results that compare this evaluation metric with other textual metrics on a gold standard dataset derived from the MIMIC collection and show its robustness and sensitivity to factual errors.

- **Summary**: Deep neural network (DNN)-based policy models like vision-language-action (VLA) models are transformative in automating complex decision-making across applications by interpreting multi-modal data. However, scaling these models greatly increases computational costs, which presents challenges in fields like robot manipulation and autonomous driving that require quick, accurate responses. To address the need for deployment on resource-limited hardware, we propose a new quantization framework for IL-based policy models that fine-tunes parameters to enhance robustness against low-bit precision errors during training, thereby maintaining efficiency and reliability under constrained conditions. Our evaluations with representative robot manipulation for 4-bit weight-quantization on a real edge GPU demonstrate that our framework achieves up to 2.5x speedup and 2.5x energy savings while preserving accuracy. For 4-bit weight and activation quantized self-driving models, the framework achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 3.1x energy saving on a low-end GPU. These results highlight the practical potential of deploying IL-based policy models on resource-constrained devices.

- **Summary**: Pluralistic Image Inpainting (PII) offers multiple plausible solutions for restoring missing parts of images and has been successfully applied to various applications including image editing and object removal. Recently, VQGAN-based methods have been proposed and have shown that they significantly improve the structural integrity in the generated images. Nevertheless, the state-of-the-art VQGAN-based model PUT faces a critical challenge: degradation of detail quality in output images due to feature quantization. Feature quantization restricts the latent space and causes information loss, which negatively affects the detail quality essential for image inpainting. To tackle the problem, we propose the FDM (Feature Dequantization Module) specifically designed to restore the detail quality of images by compensating for the information loss. Furthermore, we develop an efficient training method for FDM which drastically reduces training costs. We empirically demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the detail quality of the generated images with negligible training and inference overheads.

- **Summary**: We introduce a new framework, dubbed Cerberus, for attribute-based person re-identification (reID). Our approach leverages person attribute labels to learn local and global person representations that encode specific traits, such as gender and clothing style. To achieve this, we define semantic IDs (SIDs) by combining attribute labels, and use a semantic guidance loss to align the person representations with the prototypical features of corresponding SIDs, encouraging the representations to encode the relevant semantics. Simultaneously, we enforce the representations of the same person to be embedded closely, enabling recognizing subtle differences in appearance to discriminate persons sharing the same attribute labels. To increase the generalization ability on unseen data, we also propose a regularization method that takes advantage of the relationships between SID prototypes. Our framework performs individual comparisons of local and global person representations between query and gallery images for attribute-based reID. By exploiting the SID prototypes aligned with the corresponding representations, it can also perform person attribute recognition (PAR) and attribute-based person search (APS) without bells and whistles. Experimental results on standard benchmarks on attribute-based person reID, Market-1501 and DukeMTMC, demonstrate the superiority of our model compared to the state of the art.



### CRISP: Object Pose and Shape Estimation with Test-Time Adaptation

- **Summary**: We consider the problem of estimating object pose and shape from an RGB-D image. Our first contribution is to introduce CRISP, a category-agnostic object pose and shape estimation pipeline. The pipeline implements an encoder-decoder model for shape estimation. It uses FiLM-conditioning for implicit shape reconstruction and a DPT-based network for estimating pose-normalized points for pose estimation. As a second contribution, we propose an optimization-based pose and shape corrector that can correct estimation errors caused by a domain gap. Observing that the shape decoder is well behaved in the convex hull of known shapes, we approximate the shape decoder with an active shape model, and show that this reduces the shape correction problem to a constrained linear least squares problem, which can be solved efficiently by an interior point algorithm. Third, we introduce a self-training pipeline to perform self-supervised domain adaptation of CRISP. The self-training is based on a correct-and-certify approach, which leverages the corrector to generate pseudo-labels at test time, and uses them to self-train CRISP. We demonstrate CRISP (and the self-training) on YCBV, SPE3R, and NOCS datasets. CRISP shows high performance on all the datasets. Moreover, our self-training is capable of bridging a large domain gap. Finally, CRISP also shows an ability to generalize to unseen objects. Code and pre-trained models will be available on https://web.mit.edu/sparklab/research/crisp_object_pose_shape/.

- **Summary**: Accurate diagnosis of gait impairments is often hindered by subjective or costly assessment methods, with current solutions requiring either expensive multi-camera equipment or relying on subjective clinical observation. There is a critical need for accessible, objective tools that can aid in gait assessment while preserving patient privacy. In this work, we present a mobile phone-based, privacy-preserving artificial intelligence (AI) system for classifying gait impairments and introduce a novel dataset of 743 videos capturing seven distinct gait patterns. The dataset consists of frontal and sagittal views of trained subjects simulating normal gait and six types of pathological gait (circumduction, Trendelenburg, antalgic, crouch, Parkinsonian, and vaulting), recorded using standard mobile phone cameras. Our system achieved 86.5% accuracy using combined frontal and sagittal views, with sagittal views generally outperforming frontal views except for specific gait patterns like Circumduction. Model feature importance analysis revealed that frequency-domain features and entropy measures were critical for classifcation performance, specifically lower limb keypoints proved most important for classification, aligning with clinical understanding of gait assessment. These findings demonstrate that mobile phone-based systems can effectively classify diverse gait patterns while preserving privacy through on-device processing. The high accuracy achieved using simulated gait data suggests their potential for rapid prototyping of gait analysis systems, though clinical validation with patient data remains necessary. This work represents a significant step toward accessible, objective gait assessment tools for clinical, community, and tele-rehabilitation settings

- **Summary**: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. We shift the generative modeling from the pixel-based latent space to a learned motion latent space, enabling efficient design of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with a simple yet effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Video monocular depth estimation is essential for applications such as autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotics. Recent transformer-based single-image monocular depth estimation models perform well on single images but struggle with depth consistency across video frames. Traditional methods aim to improve temporal consistency using multi-frame temporal modules or prior information like optical flow and camera parameters. However, these approaches face issues such as high memory use, reduced performance with dynamic or irregular motion, and limited motion understanding. We propose STATIC, a novel model that independently learns temporal consistency in static and dynamic area without additional information. A difference mask from surface normals identifies static and dynamic area by measuring directional variance. For static area, the Masked Static (MS) module enhances temporal consistency by focusing on stable regions. For dynamic area, the Surface Normal Similarity (SNS) module aligns areas and enhances temporal consistency by measuring feature similarity between frames. A final refinement integrates the independently learned static and dynamic area, enabling STATIC to achieve temporal consistency across the entire sequence. Our method achieves state-of-the-art video depth estimation on the KITTI and NYUv2 datasets without additional information.

- **Summary**: Recently, extended short-term precipitation nowcasting struggles with decreasing precision because of insufficient consideration of meteorological knowledge, such as weather fronts which significantly influence precipitation intensity, duration, and spatial distribution. Therefore, in this paper, we present DuoCast, a novel dual-probabilistic meteorology-aware model designed to address both broad weather evolution and micro-scale fluctuations using two diffusion models, PrecipFlow and MicroDynamic, respectively. Our PrecipFlow model captures evolution trends through an Extreme Precipitation-Aware Encoder (EPA-Encoder), which includes AirConvolution and FrontAttention blocks to process two levels of precipitation data: general and extreme. The output conditions a UNet-based diffusion to produce prediction maps enriched with weather front information. The MicroDynamic model further refines the results to capture micro-scale variability. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our DuoCast, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has established a new paradigm in video anomaly detection (VAD): leveraging VLMs to simultaneously detect anomalies and provide comprehendible explanations for the decisions. Existing work in this direction often assumes the complex reasoning required for VAD exceeds the capabilities of pretrained VLMs. Consequently, these approaches either incorporate specialized reasoning modules during inference or rely on instruction tuning datasets through additional training to adapt VLMs for VAD. However, such strategies often incur substantial computational costs or data annotation overhead. To address these challenges in explainable VAD, we introduce a verbalized learning framework named VERA that enables VLMs to perform VAD without model parameter modifications. Specifically, VERA automatically decomposes the complex reasoning required for VAD into reflections on simpler, more focused guiding questions capturing distinct abnormal patterns. It treats these reflective questions as learnable parameters and optimizes them through data-driven verbal interactions between learner and optimizer VLMs, using coarsely labeled training data. During inference, VERA embeds the learned questions into model prompts to guide VLMs in generating segment-level anomaly scores, which are then refined into frame-level scores via the fusion of scene and temporal contexts. Experimental results on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the learned questions of VERA are highly adaptable, significantly improving both detection performance and explainability of VLMs for VAD.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates the feasibility of a proactive DeepFake defense framework, {\em FacePosion}, to prevent individuals from becoming victims of DeepFake videos by sabotaging face detection. The motivation stems from the reliance of most DeepFake methods on face detectors to automatically extract victim faces from videos for training or synthesis (testing). Once the face detectors malfunction, the extracted faces will be distorted or incorrect, subsequently disrupting the training or synthesis of the DeepFake model. To achieve this, we adapt various adversarial attacks with a dedicated design for this purpose and thoroughly analyze their feasibility. Based on FacePoison, we introduce {\em VideoFacePoison}, a strategy that propagates FacePoison across video frames rather than applying them individually to each frame. This strategy can largely reduce the computational overhead while retaining the favorable attack performance. Our method is validated on five face detectors, and extensive experiments against eleven different DeepFake models demonstrate the effectiveness of disrupting face detectors to hinder DeepFake generation.

- **Summary**: Building realistic and animatable avatars still requires minutes of multi-view or monocular self-rotating videos, and most methods lack precise control over gestures and expressions. To push this boundary, we address the challenge of constructing a whole-body talking avatar from a single image. We propose a novel pipeline that tackles two critical issues: 1) complex dynamic modeling and 2) generalization to novel gestures and expressions. To achieve seamless generalization, we leverage recent pose-guided image-to-video diffusion models to generate imperfect video frames as pseudo-labels. To overcome the dynamic modeling challenge posed by inconsistent and noisy pseudo-videos, we introduce a tightly coupled 3DGS-mesh hybrid avatar representation and apply several key regularizations to mitigate inconsistencies caused by imperfect labels. Extensive experiments on diverse subjects demonstrate that our method enables the creation of a photorealistic, precisely animatable, and expressive whole-body talking avatar from just a single image.

- **Summary**: Image captioning models often suffer from performance degradation when applied to novel datasets, as they are typically trained on domain-specific data. To enhance generalization in out-of-domain scenarios, retrieval-augmented approaches have garnered increasing attention. However, current methods face two key challenges: (1) image features used for retrieval are often optimized based on ground-truth (GT) captions, which represent the image from a specific perspective and are influenced by annotator biases, and (2) they underutilize the full potential of retrieved text, typically relying on raw captions or parsed objects, which fail to capture the full semantic richness of the data. In this paper, we propose Dive Into Retrieval (DIR), a method designed to enhance both the image-to-text retrieval process and the utilization of retrieved text to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the visual content. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) diffusion-guided retrieval enhancement, where a pretrained diffusion model guides image feature learning by reconstructing noisy images, allowing the model to capture more comprehensive and fine-grained visual information beyond standard annotated captions; and (2) a high-quality retrieval database, which provides comprehensive semantic information to enhance caption generation, especially in out-of-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIR not only maintains competitive in-domain performance but also significantly improves out-of-domain generalization, all without increasing inference costs.

- **Summary**: Evaluation is critical to both developing and tuning Structure from Motion (SfM) and Visual SLAM (VSLAM) systems, but is universally reliant on high-quality geometric ground truth -- a resource that is not only costly and time-intensive but, in many cases, entirely unobtainable. This dependency on ground truth restricts SfM and SLAM applications across diverse environments and limits scalability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel ground-truth-free (GTF) evaluation methodology that eliminates the need for geometric ground truth, instead using sensitivity estimation via sampling from both original and noisy versions of input images. Our approach shows strong correlation with traditional ground-truth-based benchmarks and supports GTF hyperparameter tuning. Removing the need for ground truth opens up new opportunities to leverage a much larger number of dataset sources, and for self-supervised and online tuning, with the potential for a data-driven breakthrough analogous to what has occurred in generative AI.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated significant potential in image generation. However, their ability to replicate training data presents a privacy risk, particularly when the training data includes confidential information. Existing mitigation strategies primarily focus on augmenting the training dataset, leaving the impact of diffusion model architecture under explored. In this paper, we address this gap by examining and mitigating the impact of the model structure, specifically the skip connections in the diffusion model's U-Net model. We first present our observation on a trade-off in the skip connections. While they enhance image generation quality, they also reinforce the memorization of training data, increasing the risk of replication. To address this, we propose a replication-aware U-Net (RAU-Net) architecture that incorporates information transfer blocks into skip connections that are less essential for image quality. Recognizing the potential impact of RAU-Net on generation quality, we further investigate and identify specific timesteps during which the impact on memorization is most pronounced. By applying RAU-Net selectively at these critical timesteps, we couple our novel diffusion model with a targeted training and inference strategy, forming a framework we refer to as LoyalDiffusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoyalDiffusion outperforms the state-of-the-art replication mitigation method achieving a 48.63% reduction in replication while maintaining comparable image quality.

- **Summary**: Object tracking is a fundamental tool in modern innovation, with applications in defense systems, autonomous vehicles, and biomedical research. It enables precise identification, monitoring, and spatiotemporal analysis of objects across sequential frames, providing insights into dynamic behaviors. In cell biology, object tracking is vital for uncovering cellular mechanisms, such as migration, interactions, and responses to drugs or pathogens. These insights drive breakthroughs in understanding disease progression and therapeutic interventions.   Over time, object tracking methods have evolved from traditional feature-based approaches to advanced machine learning and deep learning frameworks. While classical methods are reliable in controlled settings, they struggle in complex environments with occlusions, variable lighting, and high object density. Deep learning models address these challenges by delivering greater accuracy, adaptability, and robustness.   This review categorizes object tracking techniques into traditional, statistical, feature-based, and machine learning paradigms, with a focus on biomedical applications. These methods are essential for tracking cells and subcellular structures, advancing our understanding of health and disease. Key performance metrics, including accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability, are discussed. The paper explores limitations of current methods and highlights emerging trends to guide the development of next-generation tracking systems for biomedical research and broader scientific domains.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in video question answering (VideoQA) offer promising applications, especially in traffic monitoring, where efficient video interpretation is critical. Within ITS, answering complex, real-time queries like "How many red cars passed in the last 10 minutes?" or "Was there an incident between 3:00 PM and 3:05 PM?" enhances situational awareness and decision-making. Despite progress in vision-language models, VideoQA remains challenging, especially in dynamic environments involving multiple objects and intricate spatiotemporal relationships. This study evaluates state-of-the-art VideoQA models using non-benchmark synthetic and real-world traffic sequences. The framework leverages GPT-4o to assess accuracy, relevance, and consistency across basic detection, temporal reasoning, and decomposition queries. VideoLLaMA-2 excelled with 57% accuracy, particularly in compositional reasoning and consistent answers. However, all models, including VideoLLaMA-2, faced limitations in multi-object tracking, temporal coherence, and complex scene interpretation, highlighting gaps in current architectures. These findings underscore VideoQA's potential in traffic monitoring but also emphasize the need for improvements in multi-object tracking, temporal reasoning, and compositional capabilities. Enhancing these areas could make VideoQA indispensable for incident detection, traffic flow management, and responsive urban planning. The study's code and framework are open-sourced for further exploration: https://github.com/joe-rabbit/VideoQA_Pilot_Study

- **Summary**: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) seeks to segment objects throughout a video based on natural language expressions. While existing methods have made strides in vision-language alignment, they often overlook the importance of robust video object tracking, where inconsistent mask tracks can disrupt vision-language alignment, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we present Selection by Object Language Alignment (SOLA), a novel framework that reformulates RVOS into two sub-problems, track generation and track selection. In track generation, we leverage a vision foundation model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), which generates consistent mask tracks across frames, producing reliable candidates for both foreground and background objects. For track selection, we propose a light yet effective selection module that aligns visual and textual features while modeling object appearance and motion within video sequences. This design enables precise motion modeling and alignment of the vision language. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging MeViS dataset and demonstrates superior results in zero-shot settings on the Ref-Youtube-VOS and Ref-DAVIS datasets. Furthermore, SOLA exhibits strong generalization and robustness in corrupted settings, such as those with added Gaussian noise or motion blur.

- **Summary**: Scene text recognition (STR) suffers from the challenges of either less realistic synthetic training data or the difficulty of collecting sufficient high-quality real-world data, limiting the effectiveness of trained STR models. Meanwhile, despite producing holistically appealing text images, diffusion-based text image generation methods struggle to generate accurate and realistic instance-level text on a large scale. To tackle this, we introduce TextSSR: a novel framework for Synthesizing Scene Text Recognition data via a diffusion-based universal text region synthesis model. It ensures accuracy by focusing on generating text within a specified image region and leveraging rich glyph and position information to create the less complex text region compared to the entire image. Furthermore, we utilize neighboring text within the region as a prompt to capture real-world font styles and layout patterns, guiding the generated text to resemble actual scenes. Finally, due to its prompt-free nature and capability for character-level synthesis, TextSSR enjoys a wonderful scalability and we construct an anagram-based TextSSR-F dataset with 0.4 million text instances with complexity and realism. Experiments show that models trained on added TextSSR-F data exhibit better accuracy compared to models trained on 4 million existing synthetic data. Moreover, its accuracy margin to models trained fully on a real-world dataset is less than 3.7%, confirming TextSSR's effectiveness and its great potential in scene text image synthesis.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral 3D imaging captures both depth maps and hyperspectral images, enabling comprehensive geometric and material analysis. Recent methods achieve high spectral and depth accuracy; however, they require long acquisition times often over several minutes or rely on large, expensive systems, restricting their use to static scenes. We present Dense Dispersed Structured Light (DDSL), an accurate hyperspectral 3D imaging method for dynamic scenes that utilizes stereo RGB cameras and an RGB projector equipped with an affordable diffraction grating film. We design spectrally multiplexed DDSL patterns that significantly reduce the number of required projector patterns, thereby accelerating acquisition speed. Additionally, we formulate an image formation model and a reconstruction method to estimate a hyperspectral image and depth map from captured stereo images. As the first practical and accurate hyperspectral 3D imaging method for dynamic scenes, we experimentally demonstrate that DDSL achieves a spectral resolution of 15.5 nm full width at half maximum (FWHM), a depth error of 4 mm, and a frame rate of 6.6 fps.

- **Summary**: Handling occlusion remains a significant challenge for video instance-level tasks like Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) and Video Instance Segmentation (VIS). In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Amodal-Aware Video Instance Segmentation (A2VIS), which incorporates amodal representations to achieve a reliable and comprehensive understanding of both visible and occluded parts of objects in a video. The key intuition is that awareness of amodal segmentation through spatiotemporal dimension enables a stable stream of object information. In scenarios where objects are partially or completely hidden from view, amodal segmentation offers more consistency and less dramatic changes along the temporal axis compared to visible segmentation. Hence, both amodal and visible information from all clips can be integrated into one global instance prototype. To effectively address the challenge of video amodal segmentation, we introduce the spatiotemporal-prior Amodal Mask Head, which leverages visible information intra clips while extracting amodal characteristics inter clips. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we show that A2VIS excels in both MOT and VIS tasks in identifying and tracking object instances with a keen understanding of their full shape.

- **Summary**: Manipulation of facial images to meet specific controls such as pose, expression, and lighting, also known as face rigging, is a complex task in computer vision. Existing methods are limited by their reliance on image datasets, which necessitates individual-specific fine-tuning and limits their ability to retain fine-grained identity and semantic details, reducing practical usability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ControlFace, a novel face rigging method conditioned on 3DMM renderings that enables flexible, high-fidelity control. We employ a dual-branch U-Nets: one, referred to as FaceNet, captures identity and fine details, while the other focuses on generation. To enhance control precision, the control mixer module encodes the correlated features between the target-aligned control and reference-aligned control, and a novel guidance method, reference control guidance, steers the generation process for better control adherence. By training on a facial video dataset, we fully utilize FaceNet's rich representations while ensuring control adherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate ControlFace's superior performance in identity preservation and control precision, highlighting its practicality.

- **Summary**: We present a spatio-temporal perspective on category-agnostic 3D lifting of 2D keypoints over a temporal sequence. Our approach differs from existing state-of-the-art methods that are either: (i) object agnostic, but can only operate on individual frames, or (ii) can model space-time dependencies, but are only designed to work with a single object category. Our approach is grounded in two core principles. First, when there is a lack of data about an object, general information from similar objects can be leveraged for better performance. Second, while temporal information is important, the most critical information is in immediate temporal proximity. These two principles allow us to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on per-frame and per-sequence metrics for a variety of objects. Lastly, we release a new synthetic dataset containing 3D skeletons and motion sequences of a diverse set animals. Dataset and code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: We introduce OmniFlow, a novel generative model designed for any-to-any generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-audio, and audio-to-image synthesis. OmniFlow advances the rectified flow (RF) framework used in text-to-image models to handle the joint distribution of multiple modalities. It outperforms previous any-to-any models on a wide range of tasks, such as text-to-image and text-to-audio synthesis. Our work offers three key contributions: First, we extend RF to a multi-modal setting and introduce a novel guidance mechanism, enabling users to flexibly control the alignment between different modalities in the generated outputs. Second, we propose a novel architecture that extends the text-to-image MMDiT architecture of Stable Diffusion 3 and enables audio and text generation. The extended modules can be efficiently pretrained individually and merged with the vanilla text-to-image MMDiT for fine-tuning. Lastly, we conduct a comprehensive study on the design choices of rectified flow transformers for large-scale audio and text generation, providing valuable insights into optimizing performance across diverse modalities.

- **Summary**: We introduce OBI-Bench, a holistic benchmark crafted to systematically evaluate large multi-modal models (LMMs) on whole-process oracle bone inscriptions (OBI) processing tasks demanding expert-level domain knowledge and deliberate cognition. OBI-Bench includes 5,523 meticulously collected diverse-sourced images, covering five key domain problems: recognition, rejoining, classification, retrieval, and deciphering. These images span centuries of archaeological findings and years of research by front-line scholars, comprising multi-stage font appearances from excavation to synthesis, such as original oracle bone, inked rubbings, oracle bone fragments, cropped single character, and handprinted character. Unlike existing benchmarks, OBI-Bench focuses on advanced visual perception and reasoning with OBI-specific knowledge, challenging LMMs to perform tasks akin to those faced by experts. The evaluation of 6 proprietary LMMs as well as 17 open-source LMMs highlights the substantial challenges and demands posed by OBI-Bench. Even the latest versions of GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Qwen-VL-Max are still far from public-level humans in some fine-grained perception tasks. However, they perform at a level comparable to untrained humans in deciphering task, indicating remarkable capabilities in offering new interpretative perspectives and generating creative guesses. We hope OBI-Bench can facilitate the community to develop domain-specific multi-modal foundation models towards ancient language research and delve deeper to discover and enhance these untapped potentials of LMMs.

- **Summary**: Human Mesh Reconstruction (HMR) from monocular video plays an important role in human-robot interaction and collaboration. However, existing video-based human mesh reconstruction methods face a trade-off between accurate reconstruction and smooth motion. These methods design networks based on either RNNs or attention mechanisms to extract local temporal correlations or global temporal dependencies, but the lack of complementary long-term information and local details limits their performance. To address this problem, we propose a \textbf{D}ual-branch \textbf{G}raph \textbf{T}ransformer network for 3D human mesh \textbf{R}econstruction from video, named DGTR. DGTR employs a dual-branch network including a Global Motion Attention (GMA) branch and a Local Details Refine (LDR) branch to parallelly extract long-term dependencies and local crucial information, helping model global human motion and local human details (e.g., local motion, tiny movement). Specifically, GMA utilizes a global transformer to model long-term human motion. LDR combines modulated graph convolutional networks and the transformer framework to aggregate local information in adjacent frames and extract crucial information of human details. Experiments demonstrate that our DGTR outperforms state-of-the-art video-based methods in reconstruction accuracy and maintains competitive motion smoothness. Moreover, DGTR utilizes fewer parameters and FLOPs, which validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed DGTR.

- **Summary**: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by the consumption of gluten. It causes damage to the villi, the finger-like projections in the small intestine that are responsible for nutrient absorption. Additionally, the crypts, which form the base of the villi, are also affected, impairing the regenerative process. The deterioration in villi length, computed as the villi-to-crypt length ratio, indicates the severity of celiac disease. However, manual measurement of villi-crypt length can be both time-consuming and susceptible to inter-observer variability, leading to inconsistencies in diagnosis. While some methods can perform measurement as a post-hoc process, they are prone to errors in the initial stages. This gap underscores the need for pathologically driven solutions that enhance measurement accuracy and reduce human error in celiac disease assessments.   Our proposed method, MeasureNet, is a pathologically driven polyline detection framework incorporating polyline localization and object-driven losses specifically designed for measurement tasks. Furthermore, we leverage segmentation model to provide auxiliary guidance about crypt location when crypt are partially visible. To ensure that model is not overdependent on segmentation mask we enhance model robustness through a mask feature mixup technique. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset for grading celiac disease, consisting of 750 annotated duodenum biopsy images. MeasureNet achieves an 82.66% classification accuracy for binary classification and 81% accuracy for multi-class grading of celiac disease. Code: https://github.com/dair-iitd/MeasureNet

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Recent advances in Customized Concept Swapping (CCS) enable a text-to-image model to swap a concept in the source image with a customized target concept. However, the existing methods still face the challenges of inconsistency and inefficiency. They struggle to maintain consistency in both the foreground and background during concept swapping, especially when the shape difference is large between objects. Additionally, they either require time-consuming training processes or involve redundant calculations during inference. To tackle these issues, we introduce InstantSwap, a new CCS method that aims to handle sharp shape disparity at speed. Specifically, we first extract the bbox of the object in the source image automatically based on attention map analysis and leverage the bbox to achieve both foreground and background consistency. For background consistency, we remove the gradient outside the bbox during the swapping process so that the background is free from being modified. For foreground consistency, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to inject semantic information into both source and target concepts inside the box. This helps learn semantic-enhanced representations that encourage the swapping process to focus on the foreground objects. To improve swapping speed, we avoid computing gradients at each timestep but instead calculate them periodically to reduce the number of forward passes, which improves efficiency a lot with a little sacrifice on performance. Finally, we establish a benchmark dataset to facilitate comprehensive evaluation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority and versatility of InstantSwap.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image generation but often come with excessive parameterization, resulting in considerable inference overhead in real-world applications. In this work, we present TinyFusion, a depth pruning method designed to remove redundant layers from diffusion transformers via end-to-end learning. The core principle of our approach is to create a pruned model with high recoverability, allowing it to regain strong performance after fine-tuning. To accomplish this, we introduce a differentiable sampling technique to make pruning learnable, paired with a co-optimized parameter to simulate future fine-tuning. While prior works focus on minimizing loss or error after pruning, our method explicitly models and optimizes the post-fine-tuning performance of pruned models. Experimental results indicate that this learnable paradigm offers substantial benefits for layer pruning of diffusion transformers, surpassing existing importance-based and error-based methods. Additionally, TinyFusion exhibits strong generalization across diverse architectures, such as DiTs, MARs, and SiTs. Experiments with DiT-XL show that TinyFusion can craft a shallow diffusion transformer at less than 7% of the pre-training cost, achieving a 2$\times$ speedup with an FID score of 2.86, outperforming competitors with comparable efficiency.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a Neuron Abandoning Attention Flow (NAFlow) method to address the open problem of visually explaining the attention evolution dynamics inside CNNs when making their classification decisions. A novel cascading neuron abandoning back-propagation algorithm is designed to trace neurons in all layers of a CNN that involve in making its prediction to address the problem of significant interference from abandoned neurons. Firstly, a Neuron Abandoning Back-Propagation (NA-BP) module is proposed to generate Back-Propagated Feature Maps (BPFM) by using the inverse function of the intermediate layers of CNN models, on which the neurons not used for decision-making are abandoned. Meanwhile, the cascading NA-BP modules calculate the tensors of importance coefficients which are linearly combined with the tensors of BPFMs to form the NAFlow. Secondly, to be able to visualize attention flow for similarity metric-based CNN models, a new channel contribution weights module is proposed to calculate the importance coefficients via Jacobian Matrix. The effectiveness of the proposed NAFlow is validated on nine widely-used CNN models for various tasks of general image classification, contrastive learning classification, few-shot image classification, and image retrieval.

- **Summary**: Domain shift (the difference between source and target domains) poses a significant challenge in clinical applications, e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) grading. Despite considering certain clinical requirements, like source data privacy, conventional transfer methods are predominantly model-centered and often struggle to prevent model-targeted attacks. In this paper, we address a challenging Online Model-aGnostic Domain Adaptation (OMG-DA) setting, driven by the demands of clinical environments. This setting is characterized by the absence of the model and the flow of target data. To tackle the new challenge, we propose a novel approach, Generative Unadversarial ExampleS (GUES), which enables adaptation from a data-centric perspective. Specifically, we first theoretically reformulate conventional perturbation optimization in a generative way--learning a perturbation generation function with a latent input variable. During model instantiation, we leverage a Variational AutoEncoder to express this function. The encoder with the reparameterization trick predicts the latent input, whilst the decoder is responsible for the generation. Furthermore, the saliency map is selected as pseudo-perturbation labels. Because it not only captures potential lesions but also theoretically provides an upper bound on the function input, enabling the identification of the latent variable. Extensive comparative experiments on DR benchmarks with both frozen pre-trained models and trainable models demonstrate the superiority of GUES, showing robustness even with small batch size.

- **Summary**: High-quality reconstruction is crucial for dense SLAM. Recent popular approaches utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) techniques for RGB, depth, and semantic reconstruction of scenes. However, these methods often overlook issues of detail and consistency in different parts of the scene. To address this, we propose RGBDS-SLAM, a RGB-D semantic dense SLAM system based on 3D multi-level pyramid gaussian splatting, which enables high-quality dense reconstruction of scene RGB, depth, and semantics.In this system, we introduce a 3D multi-level pyramid gaussian splatting method that restores scene details by extracting multi-level image pyramids for gaussian splatting training, ensuring consistency in RGB, depth, and semantic reconstructions. Additionally, we design a tightly-coupled multi-features reconstruction optimization mechanism, allowing the reconstruction accuracy of RGB, depth, and semantic maps to mutually enhance each other during the rendering optimization process. Extensive quantitative, qualitative, and ablation experiments on the Replica and ScanNet public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Recently, diffusion models have exhibited superior performance in the area of image inpainting. Inpainting methods based on diffusion models can usually generate realistic, high-quality image content for masked areas. However, due to the limitations of diffusion models, existing methods typically encounter problems in terms of semantic consistency between images and text, and the editing habits of users. To address these issues, we present PainterNet, a plugin that can be flexibly embedded into various diffusion models. To generate image content in the masked areas that highly aligns with the user input prompt, we proposed local prompt input, Attention Control Points (ACP), and Actual-Token Attention Loss (ATAL) to enhance the model's focus on local areas. Additionally, we redesigned the MASK generation algorithm in training and testing dataset to simulate the user's habit of applying MASK, and introduced a customized new training dataset, PainterData, and a benchmark dataset, PainterBench. Our extensive experimental analysis exhibits that PainterNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art models in key metrics including image quality and global/local text consistency.

- **Summary**: As a foundational model, SAM has significantly influenced multiple fields within computer vision, and its upgraded version, SAM 2, enhances capabilities in video segmentation, poised to make a substantial impact once again. While SAMs (SAM and SAM 2) have demonstrated excellent performance in segmenting context-independent concepts like people, cars, and roads, they overlook more challenging context-dependent (CD) concepts, such as visual saliency, camouflage, product defects, and medical lesions. CD concepts rely heavily on global and local contextual information, making them susceptible to shifts in different contexts, which requires strong discriminative capabilities from the model. The lack of comprehensive evaluation of SAMs limits understanding of their performance boundaries, which may hinder the design of future models. In this paper, we conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation of SAMs on 11 CD concepts across 2D and 3D images and videos in various visual modalities within natural, medical, and industrial scenes. We develop a unified evaluation framework for SAM and SAM 2 that supports manual, automatic, and intermediate self-prompting, aided by our specific prompt generation and interaction strategies. We further explore the potential of SAM 2 for in-context learning and introduce prompt robustness testing to simulate real-world imperfect prompts. Finally, we analyze the benefits and limitations of SAMs in understanding CD concepts and discuss their future development in segmentation tasks. This work aims to provide valuable insights to guide future research in both context-independent and context-dependent concepts segmentation, potentially informing the development of the next version - SAM 3.

- **Summary**: Diffusion and flow models have achieved remarkable successes in various applications such as text-to-image generation. However, these models typically rely on the same predetermined denoising schedules during inference for each prompt, which potentially limits the inference efficiency as well as the flexibility when handling different prompts. In this paper, we argue that the optimal noise schedule should adapt to each inference instance, and introduce the Time Prediction Diffusion Model (TPDM) to accomplish this. TPDM employs a plug-and-play Time Prediction Module (TPM) that predicts the next noise level based on current latent features at each denoising step. We train the TPM using reinforcement learning, aiming to maximize a reward that discounts the final image quality by the number of denoising steps. With such an adaptive scheduler, TPDM not only generates high-quality images that are aligned closely with human preferences but also adjusts the number of denoising steps and time on the fly, enhancing both performance and efficiency. We train TPDMs on multiple diffusion model benchmarks. With Stable Diffusion 3 Medium architecture, TPDM achieves an aesthetic score of 5.44 and a human preference score (HPS) of 29.59, while using around 50% fewer denoising steps to achieve better performance. We will release our best model alongside this paper.

- **Summary**: As large-scale diffusion models continue to advance, they excel at producing high-quality images but often generate unwanted content, such as sexually explicit or violent content. Existing methods for concept removal generally guide the image generation process but can unintentionally modify unrelated regions, leading to inconsistencies with the original model. We propose a novel approach for targeted concept replacing in diffusion models, enabling specific concepts to be removed without affecting non-target areas. Our method introduces a dedicated concept localizer for precisely identifying the target concept during the denoising process, trained with few-shot learning to require minimal labeled data. Within the identified region, we introduce a training-free Dual Prompts Cross-Attention (DPCA) module to substitute the target concept, ensuring minimal disruption to surrounding content. We evaluate our method on concept localization precision and replacement efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior precision in localizing target concepts and performs coherent concept replacement with minimal impact on non-target areas, outperforming existing approaches.

- **Summary**: Assessing disease severity involving ordinal classes, where each class represents increasing levels of severity, benefit from loss functions that account for this ordinal structure. Traditional categorical loss functions, like Cross-Entropy (CE), often perform suboptimally in these scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel loss function, Class Distance Weighted Cross-Entropy (CDW-CE), which penalizes misclassifications more harshly when classes are farther apart. We evaluated CDW-CE on the Labeled Images for Ulcerative Colitis (LIMUC) dataset using various deep architectures. Its performance was compared against several categorical and ordinal loss functions. To analyze the quality of latent representations, we used t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualizations and quantified their clustering with the Silhouette Score. We also compared Class Activation Maps (CAM) generated by models trained with CDW-CE and CE loss, incorporating domain expert feedback to evaluate alignment with expert knowledge. Our results show that CDW-CE consistently improves performance in ordinal image classification tasks. It achieves higher Silhouette Scores, indicating better differentiation of class representations, and its CAM visualizations demonstrate a stronger focus on clinically significant regions, as confirmed by domain experts.

- **Summary**: Multimodal fusion learning has shown significant promise in classifying various diseases such as skin cancer and brain tumors. However, existing methods face three key limitations. First, they often lack generalizability to other diagnosis tasks due to their focus on a particular disease. Second, they do not fully leverage multiple health records from diverse modalities to learn robust complementary information. And finally, they typically rely on a single attention mechanism, missing the benefits of multiple attention strategies within and across various modalities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a dual robust information fusion attention mechanism (DRIFA) that leverages two attention modules, i.e. multi-branch fusion attention module and the multimodal information fusion attention module. DRIFA can be integrated with any deep neural network, forming a multimodal fusion learning framework denoted as DRIFA-Net. We show that the multi-branch fusion attention of DRIFA learns enhanced representations for each modality, such as dermoscopy, pap smear, MRI, and CT-scan, whereas multimodal information fusion attention module learns more refined multimodal shared representations, improving the network's generalization across multiple tasks and enhancing overall performance. Additionally, to estimate the uncertainty of DRIFA-Net predictions, we have employed an ensemble Monte Carlo dropout strategy. Extensive experiments on five publicly available datasets with diverse modalities demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: This paper aims to bring fine-grained expression control to identity-preserving portrait generation. Existing methods tend to synthesize portraits with either neutral or stereotypical expressions. Even when supplemented with control signals like facial landmarks, these models struggle to generate accurate and vivid expressions following user instructions. To solve this, we introduce EmojiDiff, an end-to-end solution to facilitate simultaneous dual control of fine expression and identity. Unlike the conventional methods using coarse control signals, our method directly accepts RGB expression images as input templates to provide extremely accurate and fine-grained expression control in the diffusion process. As its core, an innovative decoupled scheme is proposed to disentangle expression features in the expression template from other extraneous information, such as identity, skin, and style. On one hand, we introduce \textbf{I}D-irrelevant \textbf{D}ata \textbf{I}teration (IDI) to synthesize extremely high-quality cross-identity expression pairs for decoupled training, which is the crucial foundation to filter out identity information hidden in the expressions. On the other hand, we meticulously investigate network layer function and select expression-sensitive layers to inject reference expression features, effectively preventing style leakage from expression signals. To further improve identity fidelity, we propose a novel fine-tuning strategy named \textbf{I}D-enhanced \textbf{C}ontrast \textbf{A}lignment (ICA), which eliminates the negative impact of expression control on original identity preservation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method remarkably outperforms counterparts, achieves precise expression control with highly maintained identity, and generalizes well to various diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Accurate embryo morphology assessment is essential in assisted reproductive technology for selecting the most viable embryo. Artificial intelligence has the potential to enhance this process. However, the limited availability of embryo data presents challenges for training deep learning models. To address this, we trained two generative models using two datasets, one we created and made publicly available, and one existing public dataset, to generate synthetic embryo images at various cell stages, including 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst. These were combined with real images to train classification models for embryo cell stage prediction. Our results demonstrate that incorporating synthetic images alongside real data improved classification performance, with the model achieving 97% accuracy compared to 95% when trained solely on real data. Notably, even when trained exclusively on synthetic data and tested on real data, the model achieved a high accuracy of 94%. Furthermore, combining synthetic data from both generative models yielded better classification results than using data from a single generative model. Four embryologists evaluated the fidelity of the synthetic images through a Turing test, during which they annotated inaccuracies and offered feedback. The analysis showed the diffusion model outperformed the generative adversarial network model, deceiving embryologists 66.6% versus 25.3% and achieving lower Frechet inception distance scores.

- **Summary**: The emergence of vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, has revolutionized image-text representation, enabling a broad range of applications via prompt learning. Despite its promise, real-world datasets often contain noisy labels that can degrade prompt learning performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that using mean absolute error (MAE) loss in prompt learning, named PromptMAE, significantly enhances robustness against noisy labels while maintaining high accuracy. Though MAE is straightforward and recognized for its robustness, it is rarely used in noisy-label learning due to its slow convergence and poor performance outside prompt learning scenarios. To elucidate the robustness of PromptMAE, we leverage feature learning theory to show that MAE can suppress the influence of noisy samples, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio and enhancing overall robustness. Additionally, we introduce PromptOT, a prompt-based optimal transport data purification method to enhance the robustness further. PromptOT employs text encoder representations in vision-language models as prototypes to construct an optimal transportation matrix. This matrix effectively partitions datasets into clean and noisy subsets, allowing for the application of cross-entropy loss to the clean subset and MAE loss to the noisy subset. Our Noise-Label Prompt Learning method, named NLPrompt, offers a simple and efficient approach that leverages the expressive representation and precise alignment capabilities of vision-language models for robust prompt learning. We validate NLPrompt through extensive experiments across various noise settings, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the challenges of Online Action Recognition (OAR), a framework that involves instantaneous analysis and classification of behaviors in video streams. OAR must operate under stringent latency constraints, making it an indispensable component for real-time feedback for edge computing. Existing methods, which typically rely on the processing of entire video clips, fall short in scenarios requiring immediate recognition. To address this, we designed EdgeOAR, a novel framework specifically designed for OAR on edge devices. EdgeOAR includes the Early Exit-oriented Task-specific Feature Enhancement Module (TFEM), which comprises lightweight submodules to optimize features in both temporal and spatial dimensions. We design an iterative training method to enable TFEM learning features from the beginning of the video. Additionally, EdgeOAR includes an Inverse Information Entropy (IIE) and Modality Consistency (MC)-driven fusion module to fuse features and make better exit decisions. This design overcomes the two main challenges: robust modeling of spatio-temporal action representations with limited initial frames in online video streams and balancing accuracy and efficiency on resource-constrained edge devices. Experiments show that on the UCF-101 dataset, our method EdgeOAR reduces latency by 99.23% and energy consumption by 99.28% compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) method. And achieves an adequate accuracy on edge devices.

- **Summary**: Most existing GUI agents typically depend on non-vision inputs like HTML source code or accessibility trees, limiting their flexibility across diverse software environments and platforms. Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which excel at using vision to ground real-world objects, offer a potential alternative. However, they often struggle with accurately localizing GUI elements -- a critical requirement for effective GUI automation -- due to the semantic gap between real-world objects and GUI elements. In this work, we introduce Ponder & Press, a divide-and-conquer framework for general computer control using only visual input. Our approach combines an general-purpose MLLM as an 'interpreter', responsible for translating high-level user instructions into detailed action descriptions, with a GUI-specific MLLM as a 'locator' that precisely locates GUI elements for action placement. By leveraging a purely visual input, our agent offers a versatile, human-like interaction paradigm applicable to a wide range of applications. Ponder & Press locator outperforms existing models by +22.5% on the ScreenSpot GUI grounding benchmark. Both offline and interactive agent benchmarks across various GUI environments -- including web pages, desktop software, and mobile UIs -- demonstrate that Ponder & Press framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the potential of visual GUI agents.

- **Summary**: Together with industry experts, we are exploring the potential of head-mounted augmented reality to facilitate safety inspections on high-rise construction sites. A particular concern in the industry is inspecting perimeter safety screens on higher levels of construction sites, intended to prevent falls of people and objects. We aim to support workers performing this inspection task by tracking which parts of the safety screens have been inspected. We use machine learning to automatically detect gaps in the perimeter screens that require closer inspection and remediation and to automate reporting. This work-in-progress paper describes the problem, our early progress, concerns around worker privacy, and the possibilities to mitigate these.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) bring powerful understanding and reasoning capabilities to multimodal tasks. Meanwhile, the great need for capable aritificial intelligence on mobile devices also arises, such as the AI assistant software. Some efforts try to migrate VLMs to edge devices to expand their application scope. Simplifying the model structure is a common method, but as the model shrinks, the trade-off between performance and size becomes more and more difficult. Knowledge distillation (KD) can help models improve comprehensive capabilities without increasing size or data volume. However, most of the existing large model distillation techniques only consider applications on single-modal LLMs, or only use teachers to create new data environments for students. None of these methods take into account the distillation of the most important cross-modal alignment knowledge in VLMs. We propose a method called Align-KD to guide the student model to learn the cross-modal matching that occurs at the shallow layer. The teacher also helps student learn the projection of vision token into text embedding space based on the focus of text. Under the guidance of Align-KD, the 1.7B MobileVLM V2 model can learn rich knowledge from the 7B teacher model with light design of training loss, and achieve an average score improvement of 2.0 across 6 benchmarks under two training subsets respectively.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image generation models have become transformative tools. However, diffusion-based vision language models still lack the ability to precisely control the shape, appearance, and positional placement of objects in generated images using text guidance alone. Global image editing models typically achieve global layout control by relying on additional masks or images as guidance, which often require model training. Although local object-editing models enable modification of object shapes, they do not provide control over the positional placement of these objects. To address these limitations, we propose the MFTF model, which enables precise control over object positioning without requiring additional masks or images. The MFTF model supports both single-object and multi-object positional control (such as translation, rotation, etc.) and allows for concurrent layout control and object semantic editing. This is achieved by controlling the denoising process of the diffusion model through parallel denoising. Attention masks are dynamically generated from the cross-attention layers of the source diffusion model and applied to queries from the self-attention layers to isolate objects. These queries are then modified according to layout control parameters and injected back into the self-attention layers of the target diffusion model to enable precise positional control.

- **Summary**: Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) equip language models with visual capabilities by aligning vision encoders with language models. Existing methods to enhance the visual perception of MLLMs often involve designing more powerful vision encoders, which requires exploring a vast design space and re-aligning each potential encoder with the language model, resulting in prohibitively high training costs. In this paper, we introduce VisionFuse, a novel integration framework that efficiently utilizes multiple vision encoders from off-the-shelf MLLMs to enhance visual perception without requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation that different MLLMs tend to focus on distinct regions given the same query and image. Moreover, we find that the feature distributions of vision encoders within an MLLM family, a group of MLLMs sharing the same pretrained LLM, are highly aligned. Building on these insights, VisionFuse enriches the visual context by concatenating the tokens generated by the vision encoders of selected MLLMs within a family. By merging the parameters of language models from these MLLMs, VisionFuse allows a single language model to align with various vision encoders, significantly reducing deployment overhead. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple multimodal benchmarks using various MLLM combinations, demonstrating substantial improvements in multimodal tasks. Notably, when integrating MiniGemini-8B and SLIME-8B, VisionFuse achieves an average performance increase of over 4%.

- **Summary**: Research on 3D Vision-Language Models (3D-VLMs) is gaining increasing attention, which is crucial for developing embodied AI within 3D scenes, such as visual navigation and embodied question answering. Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.

To reduce manual effort, image clustering can significantly speed up the annotation process. In this work, we phrase the clustering task as a Minimum Cost Multicut Problem [MP]. Solutions to the MP have been shown to provide clusterings that maximize the posterior probability, solely from provided local, pairwise probabilities of two images belonging to the same cluster. We discuss the efficacy of numerous embedding spaces to detect visual frames and show its superiority over other clustering methods. To this end, we employ the climate change dataset \textit{ClimateTV} which contains images commonly used for visual frame analysis. For broad visual frames, DINOv2 is a suitable embedding space, while ConvNeXt V2 returns a larger number of clusters which contain fine-grain differences, i.e. speech and protest. Our insights into embedding space differences in combination with the optimal clustering - by definition - advances automated visual frame detection.

- **Summary**: Cross-modal localization has drawn increasing attention in recent years, while the visual relocalization in prior LiDAR maps is less studied. Related methods usually suffer from inconsistency between the 2D texture and 3D geometry, neglecting the intensity features in the LiDAR point cloud. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal visual relocalization system in prior LiDAR maps utilizing intensity textures, which consists of three main modules: map projection, coarse retrieval, and fine relocalization. In the map projection module, we construct the database of intensity channel map images leveraging the dense characteristic of panoramic projection. The coarse retrieval module retrieves the top-K most similar map images to the query image from the database, and retains the top-K' results by covisibility clustering. The fine relocalization module applies a two-stage 2D-3D association and a covisibility inlier selection method to obtain robust correspondences for 6DoF pose estimation. The experimental results on our self-collected datasets demonstrate the effectiveness in both place recognition and pose estimation tasks.

- **Summary**: Tracking Any Point (TAP) plays a crucial role in motion analysis. Video-based approaches rely on iterative local matching for tracking, but they assume linear motion during the blind time between frames, which leads to target point loss under large displacements or nonlinear motion. The high temporal resolution and motion blur-free characteristics of event cameras provide continuous, fine-grained motion information, capturing subtle variations with microsecond precision. This paper presents an event-based framework for tracking any point, which tackles the challenges posed by spatial sparsity and motion sensitivity in events through two tailored modules. Specifically, to resolve ambiguities caused by event sparsity, a motion-guidance module incorporates kinematic features into the local matching process. Additionally, a variable motion aware module is integrated to ensure temporally consistent responses that are insensitive to varying velocities, thereby enhancing matching precision. To validate the effectiveness of the approach, an event dataset for tracking any point is constructed by simulation, and is applied in experiments together with two real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing SOTA methods. Moreover, it achieves 150\% faster processing with competitive model parameters.

- **Summary**: Medical patient data is always multimodal. Images, text, age, gender, histopathological data are only few examples for different modalities in this context. Processing and integrating this multimodal data with deep learning based methods is of utmost interest due to its huge potential for medical procedure such as diagnosis and patient treatment planning. In this work we retrain a multimodal transformer-based model for disease classification. To this end we use the text-image pair dataset from OpenI consisting of 2D chest X-rays associated with clinical reports. Our focus is on fusion methods for merging text and vision information extracted from medical datasets. Different architecture structures with a LLaMA II backbone model are tested. Early fusion of modality specific features creates better results with the best model reaching 97.10% mean AUC than late fusion from a deeper level of the architecture (best model: 96.67% mean AUC). Both outperform former classification models tested on the same multimodal dataset. The newly introduced multimodal architecture can be applied to other multimodal datasets with little effort and can be easily adapted for further research, especially, but not limited to, the field of medical AI.

- **Summary**: We introduce Presto, a novel video diffusion model designed to generate 15-second videos with long-range coherence and rich content. Extending video generation methods to maintain scenario diversity over long durations presents significant challenges. To address this, we propose a Segmented Cross-Attention (SCA) strategy, which splits hidden states into segments along the temporal dimension, allowing each segment to cross-attend to a corresponding sub-caption. SCA requires no additional parameters, enabling seamless incorporation into current DiT-based architectures. To facilitate high-quality long video generation, we build the LongTake-HD dataset, consisting of 261k content-rich videos with scenario coherence, annotated with an overall video caption and five progressive sub-captions. Experiments show that our Presto achieves 78.5% on the VBench Semantic Score and 100% on the Dynamic Degree, outperforming existing state-of-the-art video generation methods. This demonstrates that our proposed Presto significantly enhances content richness, maintains long-range coherence, and captures intricate textual details.

- **Summary**: Text-based adversarial guidance using a negative prompt has emerged as a widely adopted approach to push the output features away from undesired concepts. While useful, performing adversarial guidance using text alone can be insufficient to capture complex visual concepts and avoid undesired visual elements like copyrighted characters. In this paper, for the first time we explore an alternate modality in this direction by performing adversarial guidance directly using visual features from a reference image or other images in a batch. In particular, we introduce negative token merging (NegToMe), a simple but effective training-free approach which performs adversarial guidance by selectively pushing apart matching semantic features (between reference and output generation) during the reverse diffusion process. When used w.r.t. other images in the same batch, we observe that NegToMe significantly increases output diversity (racial, gender, visual) without sacrificing output image quality. Similarly, when used w.r.t. a reference copyrighted asset, NegToMe helps reduce visual similarity with copyrighted content by 34.57%. NegToMe is simple to implement using just few-lines of code, uses only marginally higher (<4%) inference times and generalizes to different diffusion architectures like Flux, which do not natively support the use of a separate negative prompt.

- **Summary**: Existing pretrained text-to-video (T2V) models have demonstrated impressive abilities in generating realistic videos with basic motion or camera movement. However, these models exhibit significant limitations when generating intricate, human-centric motions. Current efforts primarily focus on fine-tuning models on a small set of videos containing a specific motion. They often fail to effectively decouple motion and the appearance in the limited reference videos, thereby weakening the modeling capability of motion patterns. To this end, we propose MoTrans, a customized motion transfer method enabling video generation of similar motion in new context. Specifically, we introduce a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based recaptioner to expand the initial prompt to focus more on appearance and an appearance injection module to adapt appearance prior from video frames to the motion modeling process. These complementary multimodal representations from recaptioned prompt and video frames promote the modeling of appearance and facilitate the decoupling of appearance and motion. In addition, we devise a motion-specific embedding for further enhancing the modeling of the specific motion. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively learns specific motion pattern from singular or multiple reference videos, performing favorably against existing methods in customized video generation.

- **Summary**: Cloth-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID) aims to match individuals across multiple surveillance cameras despite variations in clothing. Existing methods typically focus on mitigating the effects of clothing changes or enhancing ID-relevant features but often struggle to capture complex semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt learning framework, Semantic Contextual Integration (SCI), for CC-ReID, which leverages the visual-text representation capabilities of CLIP to minimize the impact of clothing changes and enhance ID-relevant features. Specifically, we introduce Semantic Separation Enhancement (SSE) module, which uses dual learnable text tokens to separately capture confounding and clothing-related semantic information, effectively isolating ID-relevant features from distracting clothing semantics. Additionally, we develop a Semantic-Guided Interaction Module (SIM) that uses orthogonalized text features to guide visual representations, sharpening the model's focus on distinctive ID characteristics. This integration enhances the model's discriminative power and enriches the visual context with high-dimensional semantic insights. Extensive experiments on three CC-ReID datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques. The code will be released at github.

- **Summary**: With the growing demand for interpretable deep learning models, this paper introduces Integrative CAM, an advanced Class Activation Mapping (CAM) technique aimed at providing a holistic view of feature importance across Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Traditional gradient-based CAM methods, such as Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++, primarily use final layer activations to highlight regions of interest, often neglecting critical features derived from intermediate layers. Integrative CAM addresses this limitation by fusing insights across all network layers, leveraging both gradient and activation scores to adaptively weight layer contributions, thus yielding a comprehensive interpretation of the model's internal representation. Our approach includes a novel bias term in the saliency map calculation, a factor frequently omitted in existing CAM techniques, but essential for capturing a more complete feature importance landscape, as modern CNNs rely on both weighted activations and biases to make predictions. Additionally, we generalize the alpha term from Grad-CAM++ to apply to any smooth function, expanding CAM applicability across a wider range of models. Through extensive experiments on diverse and complex datasets, Integrative CAM demonstrates superior fidelity in feature importance mapping, effectively enhancing interpretability for intricate fusion scenarios and complex decision-making tasks. By advancing interpretability methods to capture multi-layered model insights, Integrative CAM provides a valuable tool for fusion-driven applications, promoting the trustworthy and insightful deployment of deep learning models.

- **Summary**: Nowadays, many tools are used to facilitate forensic tasks about data extraction and data analysis. In particular, some tools leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automatically label examined data into specific categories (\ie, drugs, weapons, nudity). However, this raises a serious concern about the robustness of the employed AI algorithms against adversarial attacks. Indeed, some people may need to hide specific data to AI-based digital forensics tools, thus manipulating the content so that the AI system does not recognize the offensive/prohibited content and marks it at as suspicious to the analyst. This could be seen as an anti-forensics attack scenario. For this reason, we analyzed two of the most important forensics tools employing AI for data classification: Magnet AI, used by Magnet Axiom, and Excire Photo AI, used by X-Ways Forensics. We made preliminary tests using about $200$ images, other $100$ sent in $3$ chats about pornography and teenage nudity, drugs and weapons to understand how the tools label them. Moreover, we loaded some deepfake images (images generated by AI forging real ones) of some actors to understand if they would be classified in the same category as the original images. From our preliminary study, we saw that the AI algorithm is not robust enough, as we expected since these topics are still open research problems. For example, some sexual images were not categorized as nudity, and some deepfakes were categorized as the same real person, while the human eye can see the clear nudity image or catch the difference between the deepfakes. Building on these results and other state-of-the-art works, we provide some suggestions for improving how digital forensics analysis tool leverage AI and their robustness against adversarial attacks or different scenarios than the trained one.

- **Summary**: Museums serve as vital repositories of cultural heritage and historical artifacts spanning diverse epochs, civilizations, and regions, preserving well-documented collections. Data reveal key attributes such as age, origin, material, and cultural significance. Understanding museum exhibits from their images requires reasoning beyond visual features. In this work, we facilitate such reasoning by (a) collecting and curating a large-scale dataset of 65M images and 200M question-answer pairs in the standard museum catalog format for exhibits from all around the world; (b) training large vision-language models on the collected dataset; (c) benchmarking their ability on five visual question answering tasks. The complete dataset is labeled by museum experts, ensuring the quality as well as the practical significance of the labels. We train two VLMs from different categories: the BLIP model, with vision-language aligned embeddings, but lacking the expressive power of large language models, and the LLaVA model, a powerful instruction-tuned LLM enriched with vision-language reasoning capabilities. Through exhaustive experiments, we provide several insights on the complex and fine-grained understanding of museum exhibits. In particular, we show that some questions whose answers can often be derived directly from visual features are well answered by both types of models. On the other hand, questions that require the grounding of the visual features in repositories of human knowledge are better answered by the large vision-language models, thus demonstrating their superior capacity to perform the desired reasoning.

- **Summary**: Synthetic data is gaining increasing popularity for face recognition technologies, mainly due to the privacy concerns and challenges associated with obtaining real data, including diverse scenarios, quality, and demographic groups, among others. It also offers some advantages over real data, such as the large amount of data that can be generated or the ability to customize it to adapt to specific problem-solving needs. To effectively use such data, face recognition models should also be specifically designed to exploit synthetic data to its fullest potential. In order to promote the proposal of novel Generative AI methods and synthetic data, and investigate the application of synthetic data to better train face recognition systems, we introduce the 2nd FRCSyn-onGoing challenge, based on the 2nd Face Recognition Challenge in the Era of Synthetic Data (FRCSyn), originally launched at CVPR 2024. This is an ongoing challenge that provides researchers with an accessible platform to benchmark i) the proposal of novel Generative AI methods and synthetic data, and ii) novel face recognition systems that are specifically proposed to take advantage of synthetic data. We focus on exploring the use of synthetic data both individually and in combination with real data to solve current challenges in face recognition such as demographic bias, domain adaptation, and performance constraints in demanding situations, such as age disparities between training and testing, changes in the pose, or occlusions. Very interesting findings are obtained in this second edition, including a direct comparison with the first one, in which synthetic databases were restricted to DCFace and GANDiffFace.

- **Summary**: 3D scene understanding is a long-standing challenge in computer vision and a key component in enabling mixed reality, wearable computing, and embodied AI. Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered by current works. In this work, we address this shortcoming and introduce (1) an expertly curated dataset in the Universal Scene Description (USD) format, featuring high-quality manual annotations, for instance, segmentation and articulation on 280 indoor scenes; (2) a learning-based model together with a novel baseline capable of predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes, including motion type, articulated and interactable parts, and motion parameters; (3) a benchmark serving to compare upcoming methods for the task at hand. Overall, our dataset provides 8 types of annotations - object and part segmentations, motion types, movable and interactable parts, motion parameters, connectivity, and object mass annotations. With its broad and high-quality annotations, the data provides the basis for holistic 3D scene understanding models. All data is provided in the USD format, allowing interoperability and easy integration with downstream tasks. We provide open access to our dataset, benchmark, and method's source code.

- **Summary**: Predicting the extent of massive wildfires once ignited is essential to reduce the subsequent socioeconomic losses and environmental damage, but challenging because of the complexity of fire behaviour. Existing physics-based models are limited in predicting large or long-duration wildfire events. Here, we develop a deep-learning-based predictive model, Fire-Image-DenseNet (FIDN), that uses spatial features derived from both near real-time and reanalysis data on the environmental and meteorological drivers of wildfire. We trained and tested this model using more than 300 individual wildfires that occurred between 2012 and 2019 in the western US. In contrast to existing models, the performance of FIDN does not degrade with fire size or duration. Furthermore, it predicts final burnt area accurately even in very heterogeneous landscapes in terms of fuel density and flammability. The FIDN model showed higher accuracy, with a mean squared error (MSE) about 82% and 67% lower than those of the predictive models based on cellular automata (CA) and the minimum travel time (MTT) approaches, respectively. Its structural similarity index measure (SSIM) averages 97%, outperforming the CA and FlamMap MTT models by 6% and 2%, respectively. Additionally, FIDN is approximately three orders of magnitude faster than both CA and MTT models. The enhanced computational efficiency and accuracy advancements offer vital insights for strategic planning and resource allocation for firefighting operations.

- **Summary**: While Gaussian Splatting (GS) demonstrates efficient and high-quality scene rendering and small area surface extraction ability, it falls short in handling large-scale aerial image surface extraction tasks. To overcome this, we present ULSR-GS, a framework dedicated to high-fidelity surface extraction in ultra-large-scale scenes, addressing the limitations of existing GS-based mesh extraction methods. Specifically, we propose a point-to-photo partitioning approach combined with a multi-view optimal view matching principle to select the best training images for each sub-region. Additionally, during training, ULSR-GS employs a densification strategy based on multi-view geometric consistency to enhance surface extraction details. Experimental results demonstrate that ULSR-GS outperforms other state-of-the-art GS-based works on large-scale aerial photogrammetry benchmark datasets, significantly improving surface extraction accuracy in complex urban environments.

- **Summary**: Early detection of skin abnormalities plays a crucial role in diagnosing and treating skin cancer. Segmentation of affected skin regions using AI-powered devices is relatively common and supports the diagnostic process. However, achieving high performance remains a significant challenge due to the need for high-resolution images and the often unclear boundaries of individual lesions. At the same time, medical devices require segmentation models to have a small memory foot-print and low computational cost. Based on these requirements, we introduce a novel lightweight model called MambaU-Lite, which combines the strengths of Mamba and CNN architectures, featuring just over 400K parameters and a computational cost of more than 1G flops. To enhance both global context and local feature extraction, we propose the P-Mamba block, a novel component that incorporates VSS blocks along-side multiple pooling layers, enabling the model to effectively learn multiscale features and enhance segmentation performance. We evaluate the model's performance on two skin datasets, ISIC2018 and PH2, yielding promising results. Our source code will be made publicly available at: https://github.com/nqnguyen812/MambaU-Lite.

- **Summary**: Generative models have significantly improved the generation and prediction quality on either camera images or LiDAR point clouds for autonomous driving. However, a real-world autonomous driving system uses multiple kinds of input modality, usually cameras and LiDARs, where they contain complementary information for generation, while existing generation methods ignore this crucial feature, resulting in the generated results only covering separate 2D or 3D information. In order to fill the gap in 2D-3D multi-modal joint generation for autonomous driving, in this paper, we propose our framework, \emph{HoloDrive}, to jointly generate the camera images and LiDAR point clouds. We employ BEV-to-Camera and Camera-to-BEV transform modules between heterogeneous generative models, and introduce a depth prediction branch in the 2D generative model to disambiguate the un-projecting from image space to BEV space, then extend the method to predict the future by adding temporal structure and carefully designed progressive training. Further, we conduct experiments on single frame generation and world model benchmarks, and demonstrate our method leads to significant performance gains over SOTA methods in terms of generation metrics.

- **Summary**: Recent trends in cell segmentation have shifted towards universal models to handle diverse cell morphologies and imaging modalities. However, for continuously emerging cell types and imaging techniques, these models still require hundreds or thousands of annotated cells for fine-tuning. We introduce CellSeg1, a practical solution for segmenting cells of arbitrary morphology and modality with a few dozen cell annotations in 1 image. By adopting Low-Rank Adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), we achieve robust cell segmentation. Tested on 19 diverse cell datasets, CellSeg1 trained on 1 image achieved 0.81 average mAP at 0.5 IoU, performing comparably to existing models trained on over 500 images. It also demonstrated superior generalization in cross-dataset tests on TissueNet. We found that high-quality annotation of a few dozen densely packed cells of varied sizes is key to effective segmentation. CellSeg1 provides an efficient solution for cell segmentation with minimal annotation effort.

- **Summary**: Real-time 2D keypoint detection plays an essential role in computer vision. Although CNN-based and Transformer-based methods have achieved breakthrough progress, they often fail to deliver superior performance and real-time speed. This paper introduces MamKPD, the first efficient yet effective mamba-based pose estimation framework for 2D keypoint detection. The conventional Mamba module exhibits limited information interaction between patches. To address this, we propose a lightweight contextual modeling module (CMM) that uses depth-wise convolutions to model inter-patch dependencies and linear layers to distill the pose cues within each patch. Subsequently, by combining Mamba for global modeling across all patches, MamKPD effectively extracts instances' pose information. We conduct extensive experiments on human and animal pose estimation datasets to validate the effectiveness of MamKPD. Our MamKPD-L achieves 77.3% AP on the COCO dataset with 1492 FPS on an NVIDIA GTX 4090 GPU. Moreover, MamKPD achieves state-of-the-art results on the MPII dataset and competitive results on the AP-10K dataset while saving 85% of the parameters compared to ViTPose.

- **Summary**: Despite the significant progress made by all-in-one models in universal image restoration, existing methods suffer from a generalization bottleneck in real-world scenarios, as they are mostly trained on small-scale synthetic datasets with limited degradations. Therefore, large-scale high-quality real-world training data is urgently needed to facilitate the emergence of foundational models for image restoration. To advance this field, we spare no effort in contributing a million-scale dataset with two notable advantages over existing training data: real-world samples with larger-scale, and degradation types with higher diversity. By adjusting internal camera settings and external imaging conditions, we can capture aligned image pairs using our well-designed data acquisition system over multiple rounds and our data alignment criterion. Moreover, we propose a robust model, FoundIR, to better address a broader range of restoration tasks in real-world scenarios, taking a further step toward foundation models. Specifically, we first utilize a diffusion-based generalist model to remove degradations by learning the degradation-agnostic common representations from diverse inputs, where incremental learning strategy is adopted to better guide model training. To refine the model's restoration capability in complex scenarios, we introduce degradation-aware specialist models for achieving final high-quality results. Extensive experiments show the value of our dataset and the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Despite the significant advancements made by Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based methods in video generation, there remains a notable gap with controllable camera pose perspectives. Existing works such as OpenSora do NOT adhere precisely to anticipated trajectories and physical interactions, thereby limiting the flexibility in downstream applications. To alleviate this issue, we introduce CPA, a unified camera-pose-awareness text-to-video generation approach that elaborates the camera movement and integrates the textual, visual, and spatial conditions. Specifically, we deploy the Sparse Motion Encoding (SME) module to transform camera pose information into a spatial-temporal embedding and activate the Temporal Attention Injection (TAI) module to inject motion patches into each ST-DiT block. Our plug-in architecture accommodates the original DiT parameters, facilitating diverse types of camera poses and flexible object movement. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms LDM-based methods for long video generation while achieving optimal performance in trajectory consistency and object consistency.

- **Summary**: MVImgNet is a large-scale dataset that contains multi-view images of ~220k real-world objects in 238 classes. As a counterpart of ImageNet, it introduces 3D visual signals via multi-view shooting, making a soft bridge between 2D and 3D vision. This paper constructs the MVImgNet2.0 dataset that expands MVImgNet into a total of ~520k objects and 515 categories, which derives a 3D dataset with a larger scale that is more comparable to ones in the 2D domain. In addition to the expanded dataset scale and category range, MVImgNet2.0 is of a higher quality than MVImgNet owing to four new features: (i) most shoots capture 360-degree views of the objects, which can support the learning of object reconstruction with completeness; (ii) the segmentation manner is advanced to produce foreground object masks of higher accuracy; (iii) a more powerful structure-from-motion method is adopted to derive the camera pose for each frame of a lower estimation error; (iv) higher-quality dense point clouds are reconstructed via advanced methods for objects captured in 360-degree views, which can serve for downstream applications. Extensive experiments confirm the value of the proposed MVImgNet2.0 in boosting the performance of large 3D reconstruction models. MVImgNet2.0 will be public at luyues.github.io/mvimgnet2, including multi-view images of all 520k objects, the reconstructed high-quality point clouds, and data annotation codes, hoping to inspire the broader vision community.

- **Summary**: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a critical task in computer vision, that utilized in applications such as virtual reality (VR). SSC aims to construct detailed 3D models from partial views by transforming a single 2D image into a 3D representation, assigning each voxel a semantic label. The main challenge lies in completing 3D volumes with limited information, compounded by data imbalance, inter-class ambiguity, and intra-class diversity in indoor scenes. To address this, we propose the Multi-Feature Data Balancing Network (MDBNet), a dual-head model for RGB and depth data (F-TSDF) inputs. Our hybrid encoder-decoder architecture with identity transformation in a pre-activation residual module (ITRM) effectively manages diverse signals within F-TSDF. We evaluate RGB feature fusion strategies and use a combined loss function cross entropy for 2D RGB features and weighted cross-entropy for 3D SSC predictions. MDBNet results surpass comparable state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on NYU datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: Physical adversarial patches printed on clothing can easily allow individuals to evade person detectors. However, most existing adversarial patch generation methods prioritize attack effectiveness over stealthiness, resulting in patches that are aesthetically unpleasing. Although existing methods using generative adversarial networks or diffusion models can produce more natural-looking patches, they often struggle to balance stealthiness with attack effectiveness and lack flexibility for user customization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion-based customizable patch generation framework termed DiffPatch, specifically tailored for creating naturalistic and customizable adversarial patches. Our approach enables users to utilize a reference image as the source, rather than starting from random noise, and incorporates masks to craft naturalistic patches of various shapes, not limited to squares. To prevent the original semantics from being lost during the diffusion process, we employ Null-text inversion to map random noise samples to a single input image and generate patches through Incomplete Diffusion Optimization (IDO). Notably, while maintaining a natural appearance, our method achieves a comparable attack performance to state-of-the-art non-naturalistic patches when using similarly sized attacks. Using DiffPatch, we have created a physical adversarial T-shirt dataset, AdvPatch-1K, specifically targeting YOLOv5s. This dataset includes over a thousand images across diverse scenarios, validating the effectiveness of our attack in real-world environments. Moreover, it provides a valuable resource for future research.

We explore methods like geometric data extraction from artistic images, the impact on human perception, and its use in discriminative tasks. The review also discusses the potential for improving data quality through innovative annotation techniques and the use of geometric data to enhance model adaptability and output refinement. Overall, incorporating geometric guidance boosts model performance in classification and synthesis tasks, providing crucial insights for future AI applications in the visual arts domain.

- **Summary**: Quality degradation is observed in underwater images due to the effects of light refraction and absorption by water, leading to issues like color cast, haziness, and limited visibility. This degradation negatively affects the performance of autonomous underwater vehicles used in marine applications. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight phase-based transformer network with 1.77M parameters for underwater image restoration (UIR). Our approach focuses on effectively extracting non-contaminated features using a phase-based self-attention mechanism. We also introduce an optimized phase attention block to restore structural information by propagating prominent attentive features from the input. We evaluate our method on both synthetic (UIEB, UFO-120) and real-world (UIEB, U45, UCCS, SQUID) underwater image datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate its effectiveness for low-light image enhancement using the LOL dataset. Through extensive ablation studies and comparative analysis, it is clear that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

- **Summary**: Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) have emerged as a major platform in maritime operations, capable of supporting a wide range of applications. USVs can help reduce labor costs, increase safety, save energy, and allow for difficult unmanned tasks in harsh maritime environments. With the rapid development of USVs, many vision tasks such as detection and segmentation become increasingly important. Datasets play an important role in encouraging and improving the research and development of reliable vision algorithms for USVs. In this regard, a large number of recent studies have focused on the release of vision datasets for USVs. Along with the development of datasets, a variety of deep learning techniques have also been studied, with a focus on USVs. However, there is a lack of a systematic review of recent studies in both datasets and vision techniques to provide a comprehensive picture of the current development of vision on USVs, including limitations and trends. In this study, we provide a comprehensive review of both USV datasets and deep learning techniques for vision tasks. Our review was conducted using a large number of vision datasets from USVs. We elaborate several challenges and potential opportunities for research and development in USV vision based on a thorough analysis of current datasets and deep learning techniques.

- **Summary**: Previous tone mapping methods mainly focus on how to enhance tones in low-resolution images and recover details using the high-frequent components extracted from the input image. These methods typically rely on traditional feature pyramids to artificially extract high-frequency components, such as Laplacian and Gaussian pyramids with handcrafted kernels. However, traditional handcrafted features struggle to effectively capture the high-frequency components in HDR images, resulting in excessive smoothing and loss of detail in the output image. To mitigate the above issue, we introduce a learnable Differential Pyramid Representation Network (DPRNet). Based on the learnable differential pyramid, our DPRNet can capture detailed textures and structures, which is crucial for high-quality tone mapping recovery. In addition, to achieve global consistency and local contrast harmonization, we design a global tone perception module and a local tone tuning module that ensure the consistency of global tuning and the accuracy of local tuning, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving PSNR by 2.58 dB in the HDR+ dataset and 3.31 dB in the HDRI Haven dataset respectively compared with the second-best method. Notably, our method exhibits the best generalization ability in the non-homologous image and video tone mapping operation.

- **Summary**: Current benchmarks for video segmentation are limited to annotating only salient objects (i.e., foreground instances). Despite their impressive architectural designs, previous works trained on these benchmarks have struggled to adapt to real-world scenarios. Thus, developing a new video segmentation dataset aimed at tracking multi-granularity segmentation target in the video scene is necessary. In this work, we aim to generate multi-granularity video segmentation dataset that is annotated for both salient and non-salient masks. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale, densely annotated multi-granularity video object segmentation (MUG-VOS) dataset that includes various types and granularities of mask annotations. We automatically collected a training set that assists in tracking both salient and non-salient objects, and we also curated a human-annotated test set for reliable evaluation. In addition, we present memory-based mask propagation model (MMPM), trained and evaluated on MUG-VOS dataset, which leads to the best performance among the existing video object segmentation methods and Segment SAM-based video segmentation methods.

- **Summary**: In many computer vision domains the collection of sufficient real-world data is challenging and can severely impact model performance, particularly when running inference on samples that are unseen or underrepresented in training. Synthetically generated images provide a promising solution, but it remains unclear how to design synthetic data to optimally improve model performance, for example whether to introduce more realism or more abstraction in such datasets. Here we propose a novel conceptual approach to improve the performance of computer vision models trained on synthetic images, by using robust Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to guide the modification of 3D models used to generate these images. Importantly, this framework allows both modifications that increase and decrease realism in synthetic data, which can both improve model performance. We illustrate this concept using a real-world example where data are sparse; the detection of vehicles in infrared imagery. We fine-tune an initial YOLOv8 model on the ATR DSIAC infrared dataset and synthetic images generated from 3D mesh models in the Unity gaming engine, and then use XAI saliency maps to guide modification of our Unity models. We show that synthetic data can improve detection of vehicles in orientations unseen in training by 4.6\% (to mAP50 scores of 94.6\%). We further improve performance by an additional 1.5\% (to 96.1\%) through our new XAI-guided approach, which reduces misclassifications through both increasing and decreasing the realism of different parts of the synthetic data. These proof-of-concept results pave the way for fine, XAI-controlled curation of synthetic datasets through detailed feature modifications, tailored to improve object detection performance.

- **Summary**: In this work, we are interested in achieving both high text controllability and overall appearance consistency in the generation of personalized human characters. We propose a novel framework, named SerialGen, which is a serial generation method consisting of two stages: first, a standardization stage that standardizes reference images, and then a personalized generation stage based on the standardized reference. Furthermore, we introduce two modules aimed at enhancing the standardization process. Our experimental results validate the proposed framework's ability to produce personalized images that faithfully recover the reference image's overall appearance while accurately responding to a wide range of text prompts. Through thorough analysis, we highlight the critical contribution of the proposed serial generation method and standardization model, evidencing enhancements in appearance consistency between reference and output images and across serial outputs generated from diverse text prompts. The term "Serial" in this work carries a double meaning: it refers to the two-stage method and also underlines our ability to generate serial images with consistent appearance throughout.

- **Summary**: Learning lighting adaption is a key step in obtaining a good visual perception and supporting downstream vision tasks. There are multiple light-related tasks (e.g., image retouching and exposure correction) and previous studies have mainly investigated these tasks individually. However, we observe that the light-related tasks share fundamental properties: i) different color channels have different light properties, and ii) the channel differences reflected in the time and frequency domains are different. Based on the common light property guidance, we propose a Learning Adaptive Lighting Network (LALNet), a unified framework capable of processing different light-related tasks. Specifically, we introduce the color-separated features that emphasize the light difference of different color channels and combine them with the traditional color-mixed features by Light Guided Attention (LGA). The LGA utilizes color-separated features to guide color-mixed features focusing on channel differences and ensuring visual consistency across channels. We introduce dual domain channel modulation to generate color-separated features and a wavelet followed by a vision state space module to generate color-mixed features. Extensive experiments on four representative light-related tasks demonstrate that LALNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark tests and requires fewer computational resources.

- **Summary**: Determining whether two sets of images belong to the same or different domain is a crucial task in modern medical image analysis and deep learning, where domain shift is a common problem that commonly results in decreased model performance. This determination is also important to evaluate the output quality of generative models, e.g., image-to-image translation models used to mitigate domain shift. Current metrics for this either rely on the (potentially biased) choice of some downstream task such as segmentation, or adopt task-independent perceptual metrics (e.g., FID) from natural imaging which insufficiently capture anatomical consistency and realism in medical images. We introduce a new perceptual metric tailored for medical images: Radiomic Feature Distance (RaD), which utilizes standardized, clinically meaningful and interpretable image features. We show that RaD is superior to other metrics for out-of-domain (OOD) detection in a variety of experiments. Furthermore, RaD outperforms previous perceptual metrics (FID, KID, etc.) for image-to-image translation by correlating more strongly with downstream task performance as well as anatomical consistency and realism, and shows similar utility for evaluating unconditional image generation. RaD also offers additional benefits such as interpretability, as well as stability and computational efficiency at low sample sizes. Our results are supported by broad experiments spanning four multi-domain medical image datasets, nine downstream tasks, six image translation models, and other factors, highlighting the broad potential of RaD for medical image analysis.

- **Summary**: For high-level geo-spatial applications and intelligent robotics, accurate global pose information is of crucial importance. Map-aided localization is an important and universal approach to overcome the limitations of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) in challenging environments. However, current solutions face challenges in terms of mapping flexibility, storage burden and re-localization performance. In this work, we present SF-Loc, a lightweight visual mapping and map-aided localization system, whose core idea is the map representation based on sparse frames with dense (though downsampled) depth, termed as visual structure frames. In the mapping phase, multi-sensor dense bundle adjustment (MS-DBA) is applied to construct geo-referenced visual structure frames. The local co-visbility is checked to keep the map sparsity and achieve incremental mapping. In the localization phase, coarse-to-fine vision-based localization is performed, in which multi-frame information and the map distribution are fully integrated. To be specific, the concept of spatially smoothed similarity (SSS) is proposed to overcome the place ambiguity, and pairwise frame matching is applied for efficient and robust pose estimation. Experimental results on both public and self-made datasets verify the effectiveness of the system. In complex urban road scenarios, the map size is down to 3 MB per kilometer and stable decimeter-level re-localization can be achieved. The code will be made open-source soon (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/SF-Loc).

- **Summary**: Scoliosis is traditionally assessed based solely on 2D lateral deviations, but recent studies have also revealed the importance of other imaging planes in understanding the deformation of the spine. Consequently, extracting the spinal geometry in 3D would help quantify these spinal deformations and aid diagnosis. In this study, we propose an automated general framework to estimate the 3D spine shape from 2D DXA scans. We achieve this by explicitly predicting the sagittal view of the spine from the DXA scan. Using these two orthogonal projections of the spine (coronal in DXA, and sagittal from the prediction), we are able to describe the 3D shape of the spine. The prediction is learnt from over 30k paired images of DXA and MRI scans. We assess the performance of the method on a held out test set, and achieve high accuracy.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel 3D generation method for versatile and high-quality 3D asset creation. The cornerstone is a unified Structured LATent (SLAT) representation which allows decoding to different output formats, such as Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussians, and meshes. This is achieved by integrating a sparsely-populated 3D grid with dense multiview visual features extracted from a powerful vision foundation model, comprehensively capturing both structural (geometry) and textural (appearance) information while maintaining flexibility during decoding. We employ rectified flow transformers tailored for SLAT as our 3D generation models and train models with up to 2 billion parameters on a large 3D asset dataset of 500K diverse objects. Our model generates high-quality results with text or image conditions, significantly surpassing existing methods, including recent ones at similar scales. We showcase flexible output format selection and local 3D editing capabilities which were not offered by previous models. Code, model, and data will be released.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes the second version of the widespread Hand Gesture Recognition dataset HaGRID -- HaGRIDv2. We cover 15 new gestures with conversation and control functions, including two-handed ones. Building on the foundational concepts proposed by HaGRID's authors, we implemented the dynamic gesture recognition algorithm and further enhanced it by adding three new groups of manipulation gestures. The ``no gesture" class was diversified by adding samples of natural hand movements, which allowed us to minimize false positives by 6 times. Combining extra samples with HaGRID, the received version outperforms the original in pre-training models for gesture-related tasks. Besides, we achieved the best generalization ability among gesture and hand detection datasets. In addition, the second version enhances the quality of the gestures generated by the diffusion model. HaGRIDv2, pre-trained models, and a dynamic gesture recognition algorithm are publicly available.

- **Summary**: Recently, the quality of artworks generated using Artificial Intelligence (AI) has increased significantly, resulting in growing difficulties in detecting synthetic artworks. However, limited studies have been conducted on identifying the authenticity of synthetic artworks and their source. This paper introduces AI-ArtBench, a dataset featuring 185,015 artistic images across 10 art styles. It includes 125,015 AI-generated images and 60,000 pieces of human-created artwork. This paper also outlines a method to accurately detect AI-generated images and trace them to their source model. This work proposes a novel Convolutional Neural Network model based on the ConvNeXt model called AttentionConvNeXt. AttentionConvNeXt was implemented and trained to differentiate between the source of the artwork and its style with an F1-Score of 0.869. The accuracy of attribution to the generative model reaches 0.999. To combine the scientific contributions arising from this study, a web-based application named ArtBrain was developed to enable both technical and non-technical users to interact with the model. Finally, this study presents the results of an Artistic Turing Test conducted with 50 participants. The findings reveal that humans could identify AI-generated images with an accuracy of approximately 58%, while the model itself achieved a significantly higher accuracy of around 99%.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving systems struggle with complex scenarios due to limited access to diverse, extensive, and out-of-distribution driving data which are critical for safe navigation. World models offer a promising solution to this challenge; however, current driving world models are constrained by short time windows and limited scenario diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce InfinityDrive, the first driving world model with exceptional generalization capabilities, delivering state-of-the-art performance in high fidelity, consistency, and diversity with minute-scale video generation. InfinityDrive introduces an efficient spatio-temporal co-modeling module paired with an extended temporal training strategy, enabling high-resolution (576$\times$1024) video generation with consistent spatial and temporal coherence. By incorporating memory injection and retention mechanisms alongside an adaptive memory curve loss to minimize cumulative errors, achieving consistent video generation lasting over 1500 frames (more than 2 minutes). Comprehensive experiments in multiple datasets validate InfinityDrive's ability to generate complex and varied scenarios, highlighting its potential as a next-generation driving world model built for the evolving demands of autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models are widely used to process Computed Tomography (CT) data in the automated screening of pulmonary diseases, significantly reducing the workload of physicians. However, the three-dimensional nature of CT volumes involves an excessive number of voxels, which significantly increases the complexity of model processing. Previous screening approaches often overlook this issue, which undoubtedly reduces screening efficiency. Towards efficient and effective screening, we design a hierarchical approach to reduce the computational cost of pulmonary disease screening. The new approach re-organizes the screening workflows into three steps. First, we propose a Computed Tomography Volume Compression (CTVC) method to select a small slice subset that comprehensively represents the whole CT volume. Second, the selected CT slices are used to detect pulmonary diseases coarsely via a lightweight classification model. Third, an uncertainty measurement strategy is applied to identify samples with low diagnostic confidence, which are re-detected by radiologists. Experiments on two public pulmonary disease datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves comparable accuracy and recall while reducing the time by 50%-70% compared with the counterparts using full CT volumes. Besides, we also found that our approach outperforms previous cutting-edge CTVC methods in retaining important indications after compression.

- **Summary**: Despite ongoing research on the topic of adversarial examples in deep learning for computer vision, some fundamentals of the nature of these attacks remain unclear. As the manifold hypothesis posits, high-dimensional data tends to be part of a low-dimensional manifold. To verify the thesis with adversarial patches, this paper provides an analysis of a set of adversarial patches and investigates the reconstruction abilities of three different dimensionality reduction methods. Quantitatively, the performance of reconstructed patches in an attack setting is measured and the impact of sampled patches from the latent space during adversarial training is investigated. The evaluation is performed on two publicly available datasets for person detection. The results indicate that more sophisticated dimensionality reduction methods offer no advantages over a simple principal component analysis.

- **Summary**: Existing approaches of hand reconstruction predominantly adhere to a multi-stage framework, encompassing detection, left-right classification, and pose estimation. This paradigm induces redundant computation and cumulative errors. In this work, we propose HandOS, an end-to-end framework for 3D hand reconstruction. Our central motivation lies in leveraging a frozen detector as the foundation while incorporating auxiliary modules for 2D and 3D keypoint estimation. In this manner, we integrate the pose estimation capacity into the detection framework, while at the same time obviating the necessity of using the left-right category as a prerequisite. Specifically, we propose an interactive 2D-3D decoder, where 2D joint semantics is derived from detection cues while 3D representation is lifted from those of 2D joints. Furthermore, hierarchical attention is designed to enable the concurrent modeling of 2D joints, 3D vertices, and camera translation. Consequently, we achieve an end-to-end integration of hand detection, 2D pose estimation, and 3D mesh reconstruction within a one-stage framework, so that the above multi-stage drawbacks are overcome. Meanwhile, the HandOS reaches state-of-the-art performances on public benchmarks, e.g., 5.0 PA-MPJPE on FreiHand and 64.6\% PCK@0.05 on HInt-Ego4D. Project page: idea-research.github.io/HandOSweb.

- **Summary**: 3D open-vocabulary scene graph methods are a promising map representation for embodied agents, however many current approaches are computationally expensive. In this paper, we reexamine the critical design choices established in previous works to optimize both efficiency and performance. We propose a general scene graph framework and conduct three studies that focus on image pre-processing, feature fusion, and feature selection. Our findings reveal that commonly used image pre-processing techniques provide minimal performance improvement while tripling computation (on a per object view basis). We also show that averaging feature labels across different views significantly degrades performance. We study alternative feature selection strategies that enhance performance without adding unnecessary computational costs. Based on our findings, we introduce a computationally balanced approach for 3D point cloud segmentation with per-object features. The approach matches state-of-the-art classification accuracy while achieving a threefold reduction in computation.

- **Summary**: Efficient and accurate object pose estimation is an essential component for modern vision systems in many applications such as Augmented Reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While research in model-based 6D object pose estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation \& tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in Gaussian Splatting. Thanks to the fast differentiable rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting, 6DOPE-GS can simultaneously optimize for 6D object poses and 3D object reconstruction. To achieve the necessary efficiency and accuracy for live tracking, our method uses incremental 2D Gaussian Splatting with an intelligent dynamic keyframe selection procedure to achieve high spatial object coverage and prevent erroneous pose updates. We also propose an opacity statistic-based pruning mechanism for adaptive Gaussian density control, to ensure training stability and efficiency. We evaluate our method on the HO3D and YCBInEOAT datasets and show that 6DOPE-GS matches the performance of state-of-the-art baselines for model-free simultaneous 6D pose tracking and reconstruction while providing a 5$\times$ speedup. We also demonstrate the method's suitability for live, dynamic object tracking and reconstruction in a real-world setting.

- **Summary**: 3D affordance segmentation aims to link human instructions to touchable regions of 3D objects for embodied manipulations. Existing efforts typically adhere to single-object, single-affordance paradigms, where each affordance type or explicit instruction strictly corresponds to a specific affordance region and are unable to handle long-horizon tasks. Such a paradigm cannot actively reason about complex user intentions that often imply sequential affordances. In this paper, we introduce the Sequential 3D Affordance Reasoning task, which extends the traditional paradigm by reasoning from cumbersome user intentions and then decomposing them into a series of segmentation maps. Toward this, we construct the first instruction-based affordance segmentation benchmark that includes reasoning over both single and sequential affordances, comprising 180K instruction-point cloud pairs. Based on the benchmark, we propose our model, SeqAfford, to unlock the 3D multi-modal large language model with additional affordance segmentation abilities, which ensures reasoning with world knowledge and fine-grained affordance grounding in a cohesive framework. We further introduce a multi-granular language-point integration module to endow 3D dense prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world generalization with sequential reasoning abilities.

- **Summary**: Standard 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) relies on known or pre-computed camera poses and a sparse point cloud, obtained from structure-from-motion (SfM) preprocessing, to initialize and grow 3D Gaussians. We propose a novel SfM-Free 3DGS (SFGS) method for video input, eliminating the need for known camera poses and SfM preprocessing. Our approach introduces a hierarchical training strategy that trains and merges multiple 3D Gaussian representations -- each optimized for specific scene regions -- into a single, unified 3DGS model representing the entire scene. To compensate for large camera motions, we leverage video frame interpolation models. Additionally, we incorporate multi-source supervision to reduce overfitting and enhance representation. Experimental results reveal that our approach significantly surpasses state-of-the-art SfM-free novel view synthesis methods. On the Tanks and Temples dataset, we improve PSNR by an average of 2.25dB, with a maximum gain of 3.72dB in the best scene. On the CO3D-V2 dataset, we achieve an average PSNR boost of 1.74dB, with a top gain of 3.90dB. The code is available at https://github.com/jibo27/3DGS_Hierarchical_Training.

- **Summary**: Approximate Nearest Neighbor search is one of the keys to high-scale data retrieval performance in many applications. The work is a bridge between feature extraction and ANN indexing through fine-tuning a ResNet50 model with various ANN methods: FAISS and Annoy. We evaluate the systems with respect to indexing time, memory usage, query time, precision, recall, F1-score, and Recall@5 on a custom image dataset. FAISS's Product Quantization can achieve a precision of 98.40% with low memory usage at 0.24 MB index size, and Annoy is the fastest, with average query times of 0.00015 seconds, at a slight cost to accuracy. These results reveal trade-offs among speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency and offer actionable insights into the optimization of feature-based image retrieval systems. This study will serve as a blueprint for constructing actual retrieval pipelines and be built on fine-tuned deep learning networks and associated ANN methods.

- **Summary**: RGB-Thermal Salient Object Detection aims to pinpoint prominent objects within aligned pairs of visible and thermal infrared images. Traditional encoder-decoder architectures, while designed for cross-modality feature interactions, may not have adequately considered the robustness against noise originating from defective modalities. Inspired by hierarchical human visual systems, we propose the ConTriNet, a robust Confluent Triple-Flow Network employing a Divide-and-Conquer strategy. Specifically, ConTriNet comprises three flows: two modality-specific flows explore cues from RGB and Thermal modalities, and a third modality-complementary flow integrates cues from both modalities. ConTriNet presents several notable advantages. It incorporates a Modality-induced Feature Modulator in the modality-shared union encoder to minimize inter-modality discrepancies and mitigate the impact of defective samples. Additionally, a foundational Residual Atrous Spatial Pyramid Module in the separated flows enlarges the receptive field, allowing for the capture of multi-scale contextual information. Furthermore, a Modality-aware Dynamic Aggregation Module in the modality-complementary flow dynamically aggregates saliency-related cues from both modality-specific flows. Leveraging the proposed parallel triple-flow framework, we further refine saliency maps derived from different flows through a flow-cooperative fusion strategy, yielding a high-quality, full-resolution saliency map for the final prediction. To evaluate the robustness and stability of our approach, we collect a comprehensive RGB-T SOD benchmark, VT-IMAG, covering various real-world challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and our VT-IMAG dataset demonstrate that ConTriNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in both common and challenging scenarios.

- **Summary**: Video Highlight Detection and Moment Retrieval (HD/MR) are essential in video analysis. Recent joint prediction transformer models often overlook their cross-task dynamics and video-text alignment and refinement. Moreover, most models typically use limited, uni-directional attention mechanisms, resulting in weakly integrated representations and suboptimal performance in capturing the interdependence between video and text modalities. Although large-language and vision-language models (LLM/LVLMs) have gained prominence across various domains, their application in this field remains relatively underexplored. Here we propose VideoLights, a novel HD/MR framework addressing these limitations through (i) Convolutional Projection and Feature Refinement modules with an alignment loss for better video-text feature alignment, (ii) Bi-Directional Cross-Modal Fusion network for strongly coupled query-aware clip representations, and (iii) Uni-directional joint-task feedback mechanism enhancing both tasks through correlation. In addition, (iv) we introduce hard positive/negative losses for adaptive error penalization and improved learning, and (v) leverage LVLMs like BLIP-2 for enhanced multimodal feature integration and intelligent pretraining using synthetic data generated from LVLMs. Comprehensive experiments on QVHighlights, TVSum, and Charades-STA benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art video deblurring methods use deep network architectures to recover sharpened video frames. Blurring especially degrades high-frequency (HF) information, yet this aspect is often overlooked by recent models that focus more on enhancing architectural design. Recovering these fine details is challenging, partly due to the spectral bias of neural networks, which are inclined towards learning low-frequency functions. To address this, we enforce explicit network structures to capture the fine details and edges. We dynamically predict adaptive high-pass kernels from a linear combination of high-pass basis kernels to extract high-frequency features. This strategy is highly efficient, resulting in low-memory footprints for training and fast run times for inference, all while achieving state-of-the-art when compared to low-budget models.

- **Summary**: Human pose estimation methods work well on separated people but struggle with multi-body scenarios. Recent work has addressed this problem by conditioning pose estimation with detected bounding boxes or bottom-up-estimated poses. Unfortunately, all of these approaches overlooked segmentation masks and their connection to estimated keypoints. We condition pose estimation model by segmentation masks instead of bounding boxes to improve instance separation. This improves top-down pose estimation in multi-body scenarios but does not fix detection errors. Consequently, we develop BBox-Mask-Pose (BMP), integrating detection, segmentation and pose estimation into self-improving feedback loop. We adapt detector and pose estimation model for conditioning by instance masks and use Segment Anything as pose-to-mask model to close the circle. With only small models, BMP is superior to top-down methods on OCHuman dataset and to detector-free methods on COCO dataset, combining the best from both approaches and matching state of art performance in both settings.

- **Summary**: The creation of 3D scenes has traditionally been both labor-intensive and costly, requiring designers to meticulously configure 3D assets and environments. Recent advancements in generative AI, including text-to-3D and image-to-3D methods, have dramatically reduced the complexity and cost of this process. However, current techniques for editing complex 3D scenes continue to rely on generally interactive multi-step, 2D-to-3D projection methods and diffusion-based techniques, which often lack precision in control and hamper real-time performance. In this work, we propose 3DSceneEditor, a fully 3D-based paradigm for real-time, precise editing of intricate 3D scenes using Gaussian Splatting. Unlike conventional methods, 3DSceneEditor operates through a streamlined 3D pipeline, enabling direct manipulation of Gaussians for efficient, high-quality edits based on input prompts.The proposed framework (i) integrates a pre-trained instance segmentation model for semantic labeling; (ii) employs a zero-shot grounding approach with CLIP to align target objects with user prompts; and (iii) applies scene modifications, such as object addition, repositioning, recoloring, replacing, and deletion directly on Gaussians. Extensive experimental results show that 3DSceneEditor achieves superior editing precision and speed with respect to current SOTA 3D scene editing approaches, establishing a new benchmark for efficient and interactive 3D scene customization.

- **Summary**: The integration of deep learning tools in gastrointestinal vision holds the potential for significant advancements in diagnosis, treatment, and overall patient care. A major challenge, however, is these tools' tendency to make overconfident predictions, even when encountering unseen or newly emerging disease patterns, undermining their reliability.   We address this critical issue of reliability by framing it as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, where previously unseen and emerging diseases are identified as OOD examples. However, gastrointestinal images pose a unique challenge due to the overlapping feature representations between in- Distribution (ID) and OOD examples. Existing approaches often overlook this characteristic, as they are primarily developed for natural image datasets, where feature distinctions are more apparent. Despite the overlap, we hypothesize that the features of an in-distribution example will cluster closer to the centroids of their ground truth class, resulting in a shorter distance to the nearest centroid. In contrast, OOD examples maintain an equal distance from all class centroids. Based on this observation, we propose a novel nearest-centroid distance deficit (NCCD) score in the feature space for gastrointestinal OOD detection.   Evaluations across multiple deep learning architectures and two publicly available benchmarks, Kvasir2 and Gastrovision, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to several state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Spatial understanding of the semantics of the surroundings is a key capability needed by autonomous cars to enable safe driving decisions. Recently, purely vision-based solutions have gained increasing research interest. In particular, approaches extracting a bird's eye view (BEV) from multiple cameras have demonstrated great performance for spatial understanding. This paper addresses the dependency on learned positional encodings to correlate image and BEV feature map elements for transformer-based methods. We propose leveraging epipolar geometric constraints to model the relationship between cameras and the BEV by Epipolar Attention Fields. They are incorporated into the attention mechanism as a novel attribution term, serving as an alternative to learned positional encodings. Experiments show that our method EAFormer outperforms previous BEV approaches by 2% mIoU for map semantic segmentation and exhibits superior generalization capabilities compared to implicitly learning the camera configuration.

- **Summary**: Modern machine learning models, that excel on computer vision tasks such as classification and object detection, are often overconfident in their predictions for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) examples, resulting in unpredictable behaviour for open-set environments. Recent works have demonstrated that the free energy score is an effective measure of uncertainty for OOD detection given its close relationship to the data distribution. However, despite free energy-based methods representing a significant empirical advance in OOD detection, our theoretical analysis reveals previously unexplored and inherent vulnerabilities within the free energy score formulation such that in-distribution and OOD instances can have distinct feature representations yet identical free energy scores. This phenomenon occurs when the vector direction representing the feature space difference between the in-distribution and OOD sample lies within the null space of the last layer of a neural-based classifier. To mitigate these issues, we explore lower-dimensional feature spaces to reduce the null space footprint and introduce novel regularisation to maximize the least singular value of the final linear layer, hence enhancing inter-sample free energy separation. We refer to these techniques as Free Energy Vulnerability Elimination for Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection (FEVER-OOD). Our experiments show that FEVER-OOD techniques achieve state of the art OOD detection in Imagenet-100, with average OOD false positive rate (at 95% true positive rate) of 35.83% when used with the baseline Dream-OOD model.

- **Summary**: The problem of converting images of text into plain text is a widely researched topic in both academia and industry. Arabic handwritten Text Recognation (AHTR) poses additional challenges due to diverse handwriting styles and limited labeled data. In this paper we present a complete OCR pipeline that starts with line segmentation using Differentiable Binarization and Adaptive Scale Fusion techniques to ensure accurate detection of text lines. Following segmentation, a CNN-BiLSTM-CTC architecture is applied to recognize characters. Our system, trained on the Arabic Multi-Fonts Dataset (AMFDS), achieves a Character Recognition Rate (CRR) of 99.20% and a Word Recognition Rate (WRR) of 93.75% on single-word samples containing 7 to 10 characters, along with a CRR of 83.76% for sentences. These results demonstrate the system's strong performance in handling Arabic scripts, establishing a new benchmark for AHTR systems.

- **Summary**: With the rapid growth of generative AI and its widespread application in image editing, new risks have emerged regarding the authenticity and integrity of digital content. Existing versatile watermarking approaches suffer from trade-offs between tamper localization precision and visual quality. Constrained by the limited flexibility of previous framework, their localized watermark must remain fixed across all images. Under AIGC-editing, their copyright extraction accuracy is also unsatisfactory. To address these challenges, we propose OmniGuard, a novel augmented versatile watermarking approach that integrates proactive embedding with passive, blind extraction for robust copyright protection and tamper localization. OmniGuard employs a hybrid forensic framework that enables flexible localization watermark selection and introduces a degradation-aware tamper extraction network for precise localization under challenging conditions. Additionally, a lightweight AIGC-editing simulation layer is designed to enhance robustness across global and local editing. Extensive experiments show that OmniGuard achieves superior fidelity, robustness, and flexibility. Compared to the recent state-of-the-art approach EditGuard, our method outperforms it by 4.25dB in PSNR of the container image, 20.7% in F1-Score under noisy conditions, and 14.8% in average bit accuracy.

- **Summary**: We introduce camera ray matching (CRAYM) into the joint optimization of camera poses and neural fields from multi-view images. The optimized field, referred to as a feature volume, can be "probed" by the camera rays for novel view synthesis (NVS) and 3D geometry reconstruction. One key reason for matching camera rays, instead of pixels as in prior works, is that the camera rays can be parameterized by the feature volume to carry both geometric and photometric information. Multi-view consistencies involving the camera rays and scene rendering can be naturally integrated into the joint optimization and network training, to impose physically meaningful constraints to improve the final quality of both the geometric reconstruction and photorealistic rendering. We formulate our per-ray optimization and matched ray coherence by focusing on camera rays passing through keypoints in the input images to elevate both the efficiency and accuracy of scene correspondences. Accumulated ray features along the feature volume provide a means to discount the coherence constraint amid erroneous ray matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRAYM for both NVS and geometry reconstruction, over dense- or sparse-view settings, with qualitative and quantitative comparisons to state-of-the-art alternatives.

- **Summary**: Metric depth prediction from monocular videos suffers from bad generalization between datasets and requires supervised depth data for scale-correct training. Self-supervised training using multi-view reconstruction can benefit from large scale natural videos but not provide correct scale, limiting its benefits. Recently, reflecting audible Echoes off objects is investigated for improved depth prediction and was shown to be sufficient to reconstruct objects at scale even without a visual signal. Because Echoes travel at fixed speed, they have the potential to resolve ambiguities in object scale and appearance. However, predicting depth end-to-end from sound and vision cannot benefit from unsupervised depth prediction approaches, which can process large scale data without sound annotation. In this work we show how Echoes can benefit depth prediction in two ways: When learning metric depth learned from supervised data and as supervisory signal for scale-correct self-supervised training. We show how we can improve the predictions of several state-of-the-art approaches and how the method can scale-correct a self-supervised depth approach.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in deep learning-based compression techniques have surpassed traditional methods. However, deep neural networks remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where pre-defined triggers induce malicious behaviors. This paper introduces a novel frequency-based trigger injection model for launching backdoor attacks with multiple triggers on learned image compression models. Inspired by the widely used DCT in compression codecs, triggers are embedded in the DCT domain. We design attack objectives tailored to diverse scenarios, including: 1) degrading compression quality in terms of bit-rate and reconstruction accuracy; 2) targeting task-driven measures like face recognition and semantic segmentation. To improve training efficiency, we propose a dynamic loss function that balances loss terms with fewer hyper-parameters, optimizing attack objectives effectively. For advanced scenarios, we evaluate the attack's resistance to defensive preprocessing and propose a two-stage training schedule with robust frequency selection to enhance resilience. To improve cross-model and cross-domain transferability for downstream tasks, we adjust the classification boundary in the attack loss during training. Experiments show that our trigger injection models, combined with minor modifications to encoder parameters, successfully inject multiple backdoors and their triggers into a single compression model, demonstrating strong performance and versatility.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have emerged as strong visual representation learners by training an image encoder to maximize similarity between features of different views of the same image. To perform this view-invariance task, current SSL algorithms rely on hand-crafted augmentations such as random cropping and color jittering to create multiple views of an image. Recently, generative diffusion models have been shown to improve SSL by providing a wider range of data augmentations. However, these diffusion models require pre-training on large-scale image-text datasets, which might not be available for many specialized domains like histopathology. In this work, we introduce Gen-SIS, a diffusion-based augmentation technique trained exclusively on unlabeled image data, eliminating any reliance on external sources of supervision such as text captions. We first train an initial SSL encoder on a dataset using only hand-crafted augmentations. We then train a diffusion model conditioned on embeddings from that SSL encoder. Following training, given an embedding of the source image, this diffusion model can synthesize its diverse views. We show that these `self-augmentations', i.e. generative augmentations based on the vanilla SSL encoder embeddings, facilitate the training of a stronger SSL encoder. Furthermore, based on the ability to interpolate between images in the encoder latent space, we introduce the novel pretext task of disentangling the two source images of an interpolated synthetic image. We validate Gen-SIS's effectiveness by demonstrating performance improvements across various downstream tasks in both natural images, which are generally object-centric, as well as digital histopathology images, which are typically context-based.

- **Summary**: Image inpainting is a fundamental task in computer vision, aiming to restore missing or corrupted regions in images realistically. While recent deep learning approaches have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art, challenges remain in maintaining structural continuity and generating coherent textures, particularly in large missing areas. Diffusion models have shown promise in generating high-fidelity images but often lack the structural guidance necessary for realistic inpainting. We propose a novel inpainting method that combines diffusion models with anisotropic Gaussian splatting to capture both local structures and global context effectively. By modeling missing regions using anisotropic Gaussian functions that adapt to local image gradients, our approach provides structural guidance to the diffusion-based inpainting network. The Gaussian splat maps are integrated into the diffusion process, enhancing the model's ability to generate high-fidelity and structurally coherent inpainting results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, producing visually plausible results with enhanced structural integrity and texture realism.

- **Summary**: This paper tackles the problem of video question answering (VideoQA), a task that often requires multi-step reasoning and a profound understanding of spatial-temporal dynamics. While large video-language models perform well on benchmarks, they often lack explainability and spatial-temporal grounding. In this paper, we propose Agent-of-Thoughts Distillation (AoTD), a method that enhances models by incorporating automatically generated Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) into the instruction-tuning process. Specifically, we leverage an agent-based system to decompose complex questions into sub-tasks, and address them with specialized vision models, the intermediate results are then treated as reasoning chains. We also introduce a verification mechanism using a large language model (LLM) to ensure the reliability of generated CoTs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AoTD improves the performance on multiple-choice and open-ended benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Can computer vision help us explore the ocean? The ultimate challenge for computer vision is to recognize any visual phenomena, more than only the objects and animals humans encounter in their terrestrial lives. Previous datasets have explored everyday objects and fine-grained categories humans see frequently. We present the FathomVerse v0 detection dataset to push the limits of our field by exploring animals that rarely come in contact with people in the deep sea. These animals present a novel vision challenge.   The FathomVerse v0 dataset consists of 3843 images with 8092 bounding boxes from 12 distinct morphological groups recorded at two locations on the deep seafloor that are new to computer vision. It features visually perplexing scenarios such as an octopus intertwined with a sea star, and confounding categories like vampire squids and sea spiders. This dataset can push forward research on topics like fine-grained transfer learning, novel category discovery, species distribution modeling, and carbon cycle analysis, all of which are important to the care and husbandry of our planet.

- **Summary**: Sparse-view Computed Tomography (CT) is an emerging protocol designed to reduce X-ray dose radiation in medical imaging. Traditional Filtered Back Projection algorithm reconstructions suffer from severe artifacts due to sparse data. In contrast, Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR) algorithms, though better at mitigating noise through regularization, are too computationally costly for clinical use. This paper introduces a novel technique, denoted as the Deep Guess acceleration scheme, using a trained neural network both to quicken the regularized MBIR and to enhance the reconstruction accuracy. We integrate state-of-the-art deep learning tools to initialize a clever starting guess for a proximal algorithm solving a non-convex model and thus computing an interpretable solution image in a few iterations. Experimental results on real CT images demonstrate the Deep Guess effectiveness in (very) sparse tomographic protocols, where it overcomes its mere variational counterpart and many data-driven approaches at the state of the art. We also consider a ground truth-free implementation and test the robustness of the proposed framework to noise.

- **Summary**: Driving scene synthesis along free-form trajectories is essential for driving simulations to enable closed-loop evaluation of end-to-end driving policies. While existing methods excel at novel view synthesis on recorded trajectories, they face challenges with novel trajectories due to limited views of driving videos and the vastness of driving environments. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel free-form driving view synthesis approach, dubbed DriveX, by leveraging video generative prior to optimize a 3D model across a variety of trajectories. Concretely, we crafted an inverse problem that enables a video diffusion model to be utilized as a prior for many-trajectory optimization of a parametric 3D model (e.g., Gaussian splatting). To seamlessly use the generative prior, we iteratively conduct this process during optimization. Our resulting model can produce high-fidelity virtual driving environments outside the recorded trajectory, enabling free-form trajectory driving simulation. Beyond real driving scenes, DriveX can also be utilized to simulate virtual driving worlds from AI-generated videos.

- **Summary**: In the past few decades, autonomous driving algorithms have made significant progress in perception, planning, and control. However, evaluating individual components does not fully reflect the performance of entire systems, highlighting the need for more holistic assessment methods. This motivates the development of HUGSIM, a closed-loop, photo-realistic, and real-time simulator for evaluating autonomous driving algorithms. We achieve this by lifting captured 2D RGB images into the 3D space via 3D Gaussian Splatting, improving the rendering quality for closed-loop scenarios, and building the closed-loop environment. In terms of rendering, We tackle challenges of novel view synthesis in closed-loop scenarios, including viewpoint extrapolation and 360-degree vehicle rendering. Beyond novel view synthesis, HUGSIM further enables the full closed simulation loop, dynamically updating the ego and actor states and observations based on control commands. Moreover, HUGSIM offers a comprehensive benchmark across more than 70 sequences from KITTI-360, Waymo, nuScenes, and PandaSet, along with over 400 varying scenarios, providing a fair and realistic evaluation platform for existing autonomous driving algorithms. HUGSIM not only serves as an intuitive evaluation benchmark but also unlocks the potential for fine-tuning autonomous driving algorithms in a photorealistic closed-loop setting.

- **Summary**: With the rapid advancement of multimodal information retrieval, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged. Existing methods predominately rely on task-specific fine-tuning of vision-language models, often those trained with image-text contrastive learning. In this paper, we explore the possibility of re-purposing generative Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for retrieval. This approach enables unifying all retrieval tasks under the same formulation and, more importantly, allows for extrapolation towards unseen retrieval tasks without additional training. Our contributions can be summarised in the following aspects: (i) We introduce LamRA, a versatile framework designed to empower LMMs with sophisticated retrieval and reranking capabilities. (ii) For retrieval, we adopt a two-stage training strategy comprising language-only pre-training and multimodal instruction tuning to progressively enhance LMM's retrieval performance. (iii) For reranking, we employ joint training for both pointwise and listwise reranking, offering two distinct ways to further boost the retrieval performance. (iv) Extensive experimental results underscore the efficacy of our method in handling more than ten retrieval tasks, demonstrating robust performance in both supervised and zero-shot settings, including scenarios involving previously unseen retrieval tasks.

- **Summary**: Camera calibration and localization, sometimes simply named camera calibration, enables many applications in the context of soccer broadcasting, for instance regarding the interpretation and analysis of the game, or the insertion of augmented reality graphics for storytelling or refereeing purposes. To contribute to such applications, the research community has typically focused on single-view calibration methods, leveraging the near-omnipresence of soccer field markings in wide-angle broadcast views, but leaving all temporal aspects, if considered at all, to general-purpose tracking or filtering techniques. Only a few contributions have been made to leverage any domain-specific knowledge for this tracking task, and, as a result, there lacks a truly performant and off-the-shelf camera tracking system tailored for soccer broadcasting, specifically for elevated tripod-mounted cameras around the stadium. In this work, we present such a system capable of addressing the task of soccer broadcast camera tracking efficiently, robustly, and accurately, outperforming by far the most precise methods of the state-of-the-art. By combining the available open-source soccer field detectors with carefully designed camera and tripod models, our tracking system, BroadTrack, halves the mean reprojection error rate and gains more than 15% in terms of Jaccard index for camera calibration on the SoccerNet dataset. Furthermore, as the SoccerNet dataset videos are relatively short (30 seconds), we also present qualitative results on a 20-minute broadcast clip to showcase the robustness and the soundness of our system.

- **Summary**: Today, models capable of working with various modalities simultaneously in a chat format are gaining increasing popularity. Despite this, there is an issue of potential attacks on these models, especially considering that many of them include open-source components. It is important to study whether the vulnerabilities of these components are inherited and how dangerous this can be when using such models in the industry. This work is dedicated to researching various types of attacks on such models and evaluating their generalization capabilities. Modern VLM models (LLaVA, BLIP, etc.) often use pre-trained parts from other models, so the main part of this research focuses on them, specifically on the CLIP architecture and its image encoder (CLIP-ViT) and various patch attack variations for it.

- **Summary**: Traveling through toll plazas is one of the primary causes of congestion, as identified in recent studies. Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) systems can mitigate this problem. This experiment focuses on enhancing the security of ETC using RFID tags and number plate verification. For number plate verification, image processing is employed, and a CNN classifier is implemented to detect vehicle registration numbers. Based on the registered number, a notification email is sent to the respective owner for toll fee payment within a specific timeframe to avoid fines. Additionally, toll fees are automatically deducted in real-time from the owner's balance. This system benefits travelers by eliminating the need to queue for toll payment, thereby reducing delays and improving convenience.

- **Summary**: Seamless integration of both aerial and street view images remains a significant challenge in neural scene reconstruction and rendering. Existing methods predominantly focus on single domain, limiting their applications in immersive environments, which demand extensive free view exploration with large view changes both horizontally and vertically. We introduce Horizon-GS, a novel approach built upon Gaussian Splatting techniques, tackles the unified reconstruction and rendering for aerial and street views. Our method addresses the key challenges of combining these perspectives with a new training strategy, overcoming viewpoint discrepancies to generate high-fidelity scenes. We also curate a high-quality aerial-to-ground views dataset encompassing both synthetic and real-world scene to advance further research. Experiments across diverse urban scene datasets confirm the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the challenges of estimating a continuous-time human motion field from a stream of events. Existing Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) methods rely predominantly on frame-based approaches, which are prone to aliasing and inaccuracies due to limited temporal resolution and motion blur. In this work, we predict a continuous-time human motion field directly from events by leveraging a recurrent feed-forward neural network to predict human motion in the latent space of possible human motions. Prior state-of-the-art event-based methods rely on computationally intensive optimization across a fixed number of poses at high frame rates, which becomes prohibitively expensive as we increase the temporal resolution. In comparison, we present the first work that replaces traditional discrete-time predictions with a continuous human motion field represented as a time-implicit function, enabling parallel pose queries at arbitrary temporal resolutions. Despite the promises of event cameras, few benchmarks have tested the limit of high-speed human motion estimation. We introduce Beam-splitter Event Agile Human Motion Dataset-a hardware-synchronized high-speed human dataset to fill this gap. On this new data, our method improves joint errors by 23.8% compared to previous event human methods while reducing the computational time by 69%.

- **Summary**: Image tokenizers play a critical role in shaping the performance of subsequent generative models. Since the introduction of VQ-GAN, discrete image tokenization has undergone remarkable advancements. Improvements in architecture, quantization techniques, and training recipes have significantly enhanced both image reconstruction and the downstream generation quality. In this paper, we present XQ-GAN, an image tokenization framework designed for both image reconstruction and generation tasks. Our framework integrates state-of-the-art quantization techniques, including vector quantization (VQ), residual quantization (RQ), multi-scale residual quantization (MSVQ), product quantization (PQ), lookup-free quantization (LFQ), and binary spherical quantization (BSQ), within a highly flexible and customizable training environment. On the standard ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, our released model achieves an rFID of 0.64, significantly surpassing MAGVIT-v2 (0.9 rFID) and VAR (0.9 rFID). Furthermore, we demonstrate that using XQ-GAN as a tokenizer improves gFID metrics alongside rFID. For instance, with the same VAR architecture, XQ-GAN+VAR achieves a gFID of 2.6, outperforming VAR's 3.3 gFID by a notable margin. To support further research, we provide pre-trained weights of different image tokenizers for the community to directly train the subsequent generative models on it or fine-tune for specialized tasks.

- **Summary**: DEtection TRansformer (DETR) has emerged as a promising architecture for object detection, offering an end-to-end prediction pipeline. In practice, however, DETR generates hundreds of predictions that far outnumber the actual number of objects present in an image. This raises the question: can we trust and use all of these predictions? Addressing this concern, we present empirical evidence highlighting how different predictions within the same image play distinct roles, resulting in varying reliability levels across those predictions. More specifically, while multiple predictions are often made for a single object, our findings show that most often one such prediction is well-calibrated, and the others are poorly calibrated. Based on these insights, we demonstrate identifying a reliable subset of DETR's predictions is crucial for accurately assessing the reliability of the model at both object and image levels.   Building on this viewpoint, we first tackle the shortcomings of widely used performance and calibration metrics, such as average precision and various forms of expected calibration error. Specifically, they are inadequate for determining which subset of DETR's predictions should be trusted and utilized. In response, we present Object-level Calibration Error (OCE), which is capable of assessing the calibration quality both across different models and among various configurations within a specific model. As a final contribution, we introduce a post hoc Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) framework that predicts the accuracy of the model on a per-image basis. By contrasting the average confidence scores of positive (i.e., likely to be matched) and negative predictions determined by OCE, the framework assesses the reliability of the DETR model for each test image.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in 3D representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have greatly improved realistic scene modeling and novel-view synthesis. However, achieving controllable and consistent editing in dynamic 3D scenes remains a significant challenge. Previous work is largely constrained by its editing backbones, resulting in inconsistent edits and limited controllability. In our work, we introduce a novel framework that first fine-tunes the InstructPix2Pix model, followed by a two-stage optimization of the scene based on deformable 3D Gaussians. Our fine-tuning enables the model to "learn" the editing ability from a single edited reference image, transforming the complex task of dynamic scene editing into a simple 2D image editing process. By directly learning editing regions and styles from the reference, our approach enables consistent and precise local edits without the need for tracking desired editing regions, effectively addressing key challenges in dynamic scene editing. Then, our two-stage optimization progressively edits the trained dynamic scene, using a designed edited image buffer to accelerate convergence and improve temporal consistency. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach offers more flexible and controllable local scene editing, achieving high-quality and consistent results.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based models have recently transformed conditional image generation, achieving unprecedented fidelity in generating photorealistic and semantically accurate images. However, consistently generating high-quality images remains challenging, partly due to the lack of mechanisms for conditioning outputs on perceptual quality. In this work, we propose methods to integrate image quality assessment (IQA) models into diffusion-based generators, enabling quality-aware image generation. First, we experiment with gradient-based guidance to optimize image quality directly and show this approach has limited generalizability. To address this, we introduce IQA-Adapter, a novel architecture that conditions generation on target quality levels by learning the relationship between images and quality scores. When conditioned on high target quality, IQA-Adapter shifts the distribution of generated images towards a higher-quality subdomain. This approach achieves up to a 10% improvement across multiple objective metrics, as confirmed by a subjective study, while preserving generative diversity and content. Additionally, IQA-Adapter can be used inversely as a degradation model, generating progressively more distorted images when conditioned on lower quality scores. Our quality-aware methods also provide insights into the adversarial robustness of IQA models, underscoring the potential of quality conditioning in generative modeling and the importance of robust IQA methods.

- **Summary**: Long video understanding presents challenges due to the inherent high computational complexity and redundant temporal information. An effective representation for long videos must process such redundancy efficiently while preserving essential contents for downstream tasks. This paper introduces SEmantic Attention Learning (SEAL), a novel unified representation for long videos. To reduce computational complexity, long videos are decomposed into three distinct types of semantic entities: scenes, objects, and actions, allowing models to operate on a handful of entities rather than a large number of frames or pixels. To further address redundancy, we propose an attention learning module that balances token relevance with diversity formulated as a subset selection optimization problem. Our representation is versatile, enabling applications across various long video understanding tasks. Extensive experiments show that SEAL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in video question answering and temporal grounding tasks and benchmarks including LVBench, MovieChat-1K, and Ego4D.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in video-based large language models (Video LLMs) have witnessed the emergence of diverse capabilities to reason and interpret dynamic visual content. Among them, gameplay videos stand out as a distinctive data source, often containing glitches that defy physics commonsense. This characteristic renders them an effective benchmark for assessing the under-explored capability of physical commonsense understanding in video LLMs. In this paper, we propose PhysGame as a pioneering benchmark to evaluate physical commonsense violations in gameplay videos. PhysGame comprises 880 videos associated with glitches spanning four fundamental domains (i.e., mechanics, kinematics, optics, and material properties) and across 12 distinct physical commonsense. Through extensively evaluating various state-ofthe-art video LLMs, our findings reveal that the performance of current open-source video LLMs significantly lags behind that of proprietary counterparts. To bridge this gap, we curate an instruction tuning dataset PhysInstruct with 140,057 question-answering pairs to facilitate physical commonsense learning. In addition, we also propose a preference optimization dataset PhysDPO with 34,358 training pairs, where the dis-preferred responses are generated conditioned on misleading titles (i.e., meta information hacking), fewer frames (i.e., temporal hacking) and lower spatial resolutions (i.e., spatial hacking). Based on the suite of datasets, we propose PhysVLM as a physical knowledge-enhanced video LLM. Extensive experiments on both physical-oriented benchmark PhysGame and general video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the state-ofthe-art performance of PhysVLM.

- **Summary**: We present SceneFactor, a diffusion-based approach for large-scale 3D scene generation that enables controllable generation and effortless editing. SceneFactor enables text-guided 3D scene synthesis through our factored diffusion formulation, leveraging latent semantic and geometric manifolds for generation of arbitrary-sized 3D scenes. While text input enables easy, controllable generation, text guidance remains imprecise for intuitive, localized editing and manipulation of the generated 3D scenes. Our factored semantic diffusion generates a proxy semantic space composed of semantic 3D boxes that enables controllable editing of generated scenes by adding, removing, changing the size of the semantic 3D proxy boxes that guides high-fidelity, consistent 3D geometric editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables high-fidelity 3D scene synthesis with effective controllable editing through our factored diffusion approach.

- **Summary**: TL;DR: Gaussian Splatting is a widely adopted approach for 3D scene representation that offers efficient, high-quality 3D reconstruction and rendering. A major reason for the success of 3DGS is its simplicity of representing a scene with a set of Gaussians, which makes it easy to interpret and adapt. To enhance scene understanding beyond the visual representation, approaches have been developed that extend 3D Gaussian Splatting with semantic vision-language features, especially allowing for open-set tasks. In this setting, the language features of 3D Gaussian Splatting are often aggregated from multiple 2D views. Existing works address this aggregation problem using cumbersome techniques that lead to high computational cost and training time.   In this work, we show that the sophisticated techniques for language-grounded 3D Gaussian Splatting are simply unnecessary. Instead, we apply Occam's razor to the task at hand and perform weighted multi-view feature aggregation using the weights derived from the standard rendering process, followed by a simple heuristic-based noisy Gaussian filtration. Doing so offers us state-of-the-art results with a speed-up of two orders of magnitude. We showcase our results in two commonly used benchmark datasets: LERF and 3D-OVS. Our simple approach allows us to perform reasoning directly in the language features, without any compression whatsoever. Such modeling in turn offers easy scene manipulation, unlike the existing methods -- which we illustrate using an application of object insertion in the scene. Furthermore, we provide a thorough discussion regarding the significance of our contributions within the context of the current literature.

- **Summary**: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies offer a promising paradigm to mitigate the limitations of constrained observability in single-vehicle systems. Prior work primarily focuses on single-frame cooperative perception, which fuses agents' information across different spatial locations but ignores temporal cues and temporal tasks (e.g., temporal perception and prediction). In this paper, we focus on temporal perception and prediction tasks in V2X scenarios and design one-step and multi-step communication strategies (when to transmit) as well as examine their integration with three fusion strategies - early, late, and intermediate (what to transmit), providing comprehensive benchmarks with various fusion models (how to fuse). Furthermore, we propose V2XPnP, a novel intermediate fusion framework within one-step communication for end-to-end perception and prediction. Our framework employs a unified Transformer-based architecture to effectively model complex spatiotemporal relationships across temporal per-frame, spatial per-agent, and high-definition map. Moreover, we introduce the V2XPnP Sequential Dataset that supports all V2X cooperation modes and addresses the limitations of existing real-world datasets, which are restricted to single-frame or single-mode cooperation. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both perception and prediction tasks.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained with contrastive loss have achieved significant advancements in various vision and language tasks. However, the global nature of contrastive loss makes VLMs focus predominantly on foreground objects, neglecting other crucial information in the image, which limits their effectiveness in downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose COSMOS: CrOSs-MOdality Self-distillation for vision-language pre-training that integrates a novel text-cropping strategy and cross-attention module into a self-supervised learning framework. We create global and local views of images and texts (i.e., multi-modal augmentations), which are essential for self-distillation in VLMs. We further introduce a cross-attention module, enabling COSMOS to learn comprehensive cross-modal representations optimized via a cross-modality self-distillation loss. COSMOS consistently outperforms previous strong baselines on various zero-shot downstream tasks, including retrieval, classification, and semantic segmentation. Additionally, it surpasses CLIP-based models trained on larger datasets in visual perception and contextual understanding tasks.

- **Summary**: A recent study has shown that large-scale visual datasets are very biased: they can be easily classified by modern neural networks. However, the concrete forms of bias among these datasets remain unclear. In this study, we propose a framework to identify the unique visual attributes distinguishing these datasets. Our approach applies various transformations to extract semantic, structural, boundary, color, and frequency information from datasets, and assess how much each type of information reflects their bias. We further decompose their semantic bias with object-level analysis, and leverage natural language methods to generate detailed, open-ended descriptions of each dataset's characteristics. Our work aims to help researchers understand the bias in existing large-scale pre-training datasets, and build more diverse and representative ones in the future.

- **Summary**: Transformers, known for their attention mechanisms, have proven highly effective in focusing on critical elements within complex data. This feature can effectively be used to address the time-varying channels in wireless communication systems. In this work, we introduce a channel-aware adaptive framework for semantic communication, where different regions of the image are encoded and compressed based on their semantic content. By employing vision transformers, we interpret the attention mask as a measure of the semantic contents of the patches and dynamically categorize the patches to be compressed at various rates as a function of the instantaneous channel bandwidth. Our method enhances communication efficiency by adapting the encoding resolution to the content's relevance, ensuring that even in highly constrained environments, critical information is preserved. We evaluate the proposed adaptive transmission framework using the TinyImageNet dataset, measuring both reconstruction quality and accuracy. The results demonstrate that our approach maintains high semantic fidelity while optimizing bandwidth, providing an effective solution for transmitting multi-resolution data in limited bandwidth conditions.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often rely on a substantial number of visual tokens when interacting with large language models (LLMs), which has proven to be inefficient. Recent efforts have aimed to accelerate VLM inference by pruning visual tokens. Most existing methods assess the importance of visual tokens based on the text-visual cross-attentions in LLMs. In this study, we find that the cross-attentions between text and visual tokens in LLMs are inaccurate. Pruning tokens based on these inaccurate attentions leads to significant performance degradation, especially at high reduction ratios. To this end, we introduce FasterVLM, a simple yet effective training-free visual token pruning method that evaluates the importance of visual tokens more accurately by utilizing attentions between the [CLS] token and image tokens from the visual encoder. Since FasterVLM eliminates redundant visual tokens immediately after the visual encoder, ensuring they do not interact with LLMs and resulting in faster VLM inference. It is worth noting that, benefiting from the accuracy of [CLS] cross-attentions, FasterVLM can prune 95\% of visual tokens while maintaining 90\% of the performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B. We apply FasterVLM to various VLMs, including LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Video-LLaVA, to demonstrate its effectiveness. Experimental results show that our FasterVLM maintains strong performance across various VLM architectures and reduction ratios, significantly outperforming existing text-visual attention-based methods.

- **Summary**: This work presents Switti, a scale-wise transformer for text-to-image generation. Starting from existing next-scale prediction AR models, we first explore them for T2I generation and propose architectural modifications to improve their convergence and overall performance. We then observe that self-attention maps of our pretrained scale-wise AR model exhibit weak dependence on preceding scales. Based on this insight, we propose a non-AR counterpart facilitating ~11% faster sampling and lower memory usage while also achieving slightly better generation quality. Furthermore, we reveal that classifier-free guidance at high-resolution scales is often unnecessary and can even degrade performance. By disabling guidance at these scales, we achieve an additional sampling acceleration of ~20% and improve the generation of fine-grained details. Extensive human preference studies and automated evaluations show that Switti outperforms existing T2I AR models and competes with state-of-the-art T2I diffusion models while being up to 7 times faster.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in diffusion models have set new benchmarks in image and video generation, enabling realistic visual synthesis across single- and multi-frame contexts. However, these models still struggle with efficiently and explicitly generating 3D-consistent content. To address this, we propose World-consistent Video Diffusion (WVD), a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D supervision using XYZ images, which encode global 3D coordinates for each image pixel. More specifically, we train a diffusion transformer to learn the joint distribution of RGB and XYZ frames. This approach supports multi-task adaptability via a flexible inpainting strategy. For example, WVD can estimate XYZ frames from ground-truth RGB or generate novel RGB frames using XYZ projections along a specified camera trajectory. In doing so, WVD unifies tasks like single-image-to-3D generation, multi-view stereo, and camera-controlled video generation. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance across multiple benchmarks, providing a scalable solution for 3D-consistent video and image generation with a single pretrained model.

- **Summary**: The recent surge in high-quality visual instruction tuning samples from closed-source vision-language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4V has accelerated the release of open-source VLMs across various model sizes. However, scaling VLMs to improve performance using larger models brings significant computational challenges, especially for deployment on resource-constrained devices like mobile platforms and robots. To address this, we propose VLsI: Verbalized Layers-to-Interactions, a new VLM family in 2B and 7B model sizes, which prioritizes efficiency without compromising accuracy. VLsI leverages a unique, layer-wise distillation process, introducing intermediate "verbalizers" that map features from each layer to natural language space, allowing smaller VLMs to flexibly align with the reasoning processes of larger VLMs. This approach mitigates the training instability often encountered in output imitation and goes beyond typical final-layer tuning by aligning the small VLMs' layer-wise progression with that of the large ones. We validate VLsI across ten challenging vision-language benchmarks, achieving notable performance gains (11.0% for 2B and 17.4% for 7B) over GPT-4V without the need for model scaling, merging, or architectural changes.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in neural rendering, particularly 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS), have shown promising results for jointly reconstructing fine appearance and geometry by leveraging 2D Gaussian surfels. However, current methods face significant challenges when rendering at arbitrary viewpoints, such as anti-aliasing for down-sampled rendering, and texture detail preservation for high-resolution rendering. We proposed a novel method to align the 2D surfels with texture maps and augment it with per-ray depth sorting and fisher-based pruning for rendering consistency and efficiency. With correct order, per-surfel texture maps significantly improve the capabilities to capture fine details. Additionally, to render high-fidelity details in varying viewpoints, we designed a frustum-based sampling method to mitigate the aliasing artifacts. Experimental results on benchmarks and our custom texture-rich dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses existing techniques, particularly in detail preservation and anti-aliasing.

- **Summary**: In-context generation is a key component of large language models' (LLMs) open-task generalization capability. By leveraging a few examples as context, LLMs can perform both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Recent advancements in auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) built upon LLMs have showcased impressive performance in text-to-image generation. However, the potential of in-context learning for general image generation tasks remains largely unexplored. To address this, we introduce X-Prompt, a purely auto-regressive large-vision language model designed to deliver competitive performance across a wide range of both seen and unseen image generation tasks, all within a unified in-context learning framework. X-Prompt incorporates a specialized design that efficiently compresses valuable features from in-context examples, supporting longer in-context token sequences and improving its ability to generalize to unseen tasks. A unified training task for both text and image prediction enables X-Prompt to handle general image generation with enhanced task awareness from in-context examples. Extensive experiments validate the model's performance across diverse seen image generation tasks and its capacity to generalize to previously unseen tasks.

- **Summary**: We present RELOCATE, a simple training-free baseline designed to perform the challenging task of visual query localization in long videos. To eliminate the need for task-specific training and efficiently handle long videos, RELOCATE leverages a region-based representation derived from pretrained vision models. At a high level, it follows the classic object localization approach: (1) identify all objects in each video frame, (2) compare the objects with the given query and select the most similar ones, and (3) perform bidirectional tracking to get a spatio-temporal response. However, we propose some key enhancements to handle small objects, cluttered scenes, partial visibility, and varying appearances. Notably, we refine the selected objects for accurate localization and generate additional visual queries to capture visual variations. We evaluate RELOCATE on the challenging Ego4D Visual Query 2D Localization dataset, establishing a new baseline that outperforms prior task-specific methods by 49% (relative improvement) in spatio-temporal average precision.

- **Summary**: We introduce RandAR, a decoder-only visual autoregressive (AR) model capable of generating images in arbitrary token orders. Unlike previous decoder-only AR models that rely on a predefined generation order, RandAR removes this inductive bias, unlocking new capabilities in decoder-only generation. Our essential design enables random order by inserting a "position instruction token" before each image token to be predicted, representing the spatial location of the next image token. Trained on randomly permuted token sequences -- a more challenging task than fixed-order generation, RandAR achieves comparable performance to its conventional raster-order counterpart. More importantly, decoder-only transformers trained from random orders acquire new capabilities. For the efficiency bottleneck of AR models, RandAR adopts parallel decoding with KV-Cache at inference time, enjoying 2.5x acceleration without sacrificing generation quality. Additionally, RandAR supports inpainting, outpainting and resolution extrapolation in a zero-shot manner. We hope RandAR inspires new directions for decoder-only visual generation models and broadens their applications across diverse scenarios. Our project page is at https://rand-ar.github.io/.

- **Summary**: Fine-tuning pre-trained models has become invaluable in computer vision and robotics. Recent fine-tuning approaches focus on improving efficiency rather than accuracy by using a mixture of smaller learning rates or frozen backbones. To return the spotlight to model accuracy, we present PROFIT, one of the first optimizers specifically designed for incrementally fine-tuning converged models on new tasks or datasets. Unlike traditional optimizers such as SGD or Adam, which make minimal assumptions due to random initialization, PROFIT leverages the structure of a converged model to regularize the optimization process, leading to improved results. By employing a simple temporal gradient orthogonalization process, PROFIT outperforms traditional fine-tuning methods across various tasks: image classification, representation learning, and large-scale motion prediction. Moreover, PROFIT is encapsulated within the optimizer logic, making it easily integrated into any training pipeline with minimal engineering effort. A new class of fine-tuning optimizers like PROFIT can drive advancements as fine-tuning and incremental training become increasingly prevalent, reducing reliance on costly model training from scratch.

- **Summary**: This paper presents Planar Gaussian Splatting (PGS), a novel neural rendering approach to learn the 3D geometry and parse the 3D planes of a scene, directly from multiple RGB images. The PGS leverages Gaussian primitives to model the scene and employ a hierarchical Gaussian mixture approach to group them. Similar Gaussians are progressively merged probabilistically in the tree-structured Gaussian mixtures to identify distinct 3D plane instances and form the overall 3D scene geometry. In order to enable the grouping, the Gaussian primitives contain additional parameters, such as plane descriptors derived by lifting 2D masks from a general 2D segmentation model and surface normals. Experiments show that the proposed PGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D planar reconstruction without requiring either 3D plane labels or depth supervision. In contrast to existing supervised methods that have limited generalizability and struggle under domain shift, PGS maintains its performance across datasets thanks to its neural rendering and scene-specific optimization mechanism, while also being significantly faster than existing optimization-based approaches.

- **Summary**: Robustness to out-of-distribution data is crucial for deploying modern neural networks. Recently, Vision Transformers, such as SegFormer for semantic segmentation, have shown impressive robustness to visual corruptions like blur or noise affecting the acquisition device. In this paper, we propose Channel Wise Feature Augmentation (CWFA), a simple yet efficient feature augmentation technique to improve the robustness of Vision Transformers for semantic segmentation. CWFA applies a globally estimated perturbation per encoder with minimal compute overhead during training. Extensive evaluations on Cityscapes and ADE20K, with three state-of-the-art Vision Transformer architectures : SegFormer, Swin Transformer, and Twins demonstrate that CWFA-enhanced models significantly improve robustness without affecting clean data performance. For instance, on Cityscapes, a CWFA-augmented SegFormer-B1 model yields up to 27.7% mIoU robustness gain on impulse noise compared to the non-augmented SegFormer-B1. Furthermore, CWFA-augmented SegFormer-B5 achieves a new state-of-the-art 84.3% retention rate, a 0.7% improvement over the recently published FAN+STL.

- **Summary**: Recent studies have shown that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve impressive results in crop segmentation of Satellite Image Time Series (SITS). However, the emergence of transformer networks in various vision tasks raises the question of whether they can outperform CNNs in this task as well. This paper presents a revised version of the Transformer-based Swin UNETR model, specifically adapted for crop segmentation of SITS. The proposed model demonstrates significant advancements, achieving a validation accuracy of 96.14% and a test accuracy of 95.26% on the Munich dataset, surpassing the previous best results of 93.55% for validation and 92.94% for the test. Additionally, the model's performance on the Lombardia dataset is comparable to UNet3D and superior to FPN and DeepLabV3. Experiments of this study indicate that the model will likely achieve comparable or superior accuracy to CNNs while requiring significantly less training time. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based architectures for crop segmentation in SITS, opening new avenues for remote sensing applications.

- **Summary**: This paper evaluates the use of metamorphic relations to enhance the robustness and real-world performance of machine learning models. We propose a Metamorphic Retraining Framework, which applies metamorphic relations to data and utilizes semi-supervised learning algorithms in an iterative and adaptive multi-cycle process. The framework integrates multiple semi-supervised retraining algorithms, including FixMatch, FlexMatch, MixMatch, and FullMatch, to automate the retraining, evaluation, and testing of models with specified configurations. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we conducted experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MNIST datasets using a variety of image processing models, both pretrained and non-pretrained. Our results demonstrate the potential of metamorphic retraining to significantly improve model robustness as we show in our results that each model witnessed an increase of an additional flat 17 percent on average in our robustness metric.

- **Summary**: Colorectal cancer is a prevalent form of cancer, and many patients develop colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) as a result. Early detection of CRLM is critical for improving survival rates. Radiologists usually rely on a series of multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scans done during follow-up visits to perform early detection of the potential CRLM. These scans form unique five-dimensional data (time, phase, and axial, sagittal, and coronal planes in 3D CT). Most of the existing deep learning models can readily handle four-dimensional data (e.g., time-series 3D CT images) and it is not clear how well they can be extended to handle the additional dimension of phase. In this paper, we build a dataset of time-series CECT scans to aid in the early diagnosis of CRLM, and build upon state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to evaluate how to best predict CRLM. Our experimental results show that a multi-plane architecture based on 3D bi-directional LSTM, which we call MPBD-LSTM, works best, achieving an area under curve (AUC) of 0.79. On the other hand, analysis of the results shows that there is still great room for further improvement.

- **Summary**: The increasing urbanization and the growing number of vehicles in cities have underscored the need for efficient parking management systems. Traditional smart parking solutions often rely on sensors or cameras for occupancy detection, each with its limitations. Recent advancements in deep learning have introduced new YOLO models (YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and YOLOv11), but these models have not been extensively evaluated in the context of smart parking systems, particularly when combined with Region of Interest (ROI) selection for object detection. Existing methods still rely on fixed polygonal ROI selections or simple pixel-based modifications, which limit flexibility and precision. This work introduces a novel approach that integrates Internet of Things, Edge Computing, and Deep Learning concepts, by using the latest YOLO models for vehicle detection. By exploring both edge and cloud computing, it was found that inference times on edge devices ranged from 1 to 92 seconds, depending on the hardware and model version. Additionally, a new pixel-wise post-processing ROI selection method is proposed for accurately identifying regions of interest to count vehicles in parking lot images. The proposed system achieved 99.68% balanced accuracy on a custom dataset of 3,484 images, offering a cost-effective smart parking solution that ensures precise vehicle detection while preserving data privacy

- **Summary**: Mesh quality assessment (MQA) models play a critical role in the design, optimization, and evaluation of mesh operation systems in a wide variety of applications. Current MQA models, whether model-based methods using topology-aware features or projection-based approaches working on rendered 2D projections, often fail to capture the intricate interactions between texture and 3D geometry. We introduce HybridMQA, a first-of-its-kind hybrid full-reference colored MQA framework that integrates model-based and projection-based approaches, capturing complex interactions between textural information and 3D structures for enriched quality representations. Our method employs graph learning to extract detailed 3D representations, which are then projected to 2D using a novel feature rendering process that precisely aligns them with colored projections. This enables the exploration of geometry-texture interactions via cross-attention, producing comprehensive mesh quality representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate HybridMQA's superior performance across diverse datasets, highlighting its ability to effectively leverage geometry-texture interactions for a thorough understanding of mesh quality. Our implementation will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: The goal of this work is to generate step-by-step visual instructions in the form of a sequence of images, given an input image that provides the scene context and the sequence of textual instructions. This is a challenging problem as it requires generating multi-step image sequences to achieve a complex goal while being grounded in a specific environment. Part of the challenge stems from the lack of large-scale training data for this problem. The contribution of this work is thus three-fold. First, we introduce an automatic approach for collecting large step-by-step visual instruction training data from instructional videos. We apply this approach to one million videos and create a large-scale, high-quality dataset of 0.6M sequences of image-text pairs. Second, we develop and train ShowHowTo, a video diffusion model capable of generating step-by-step visual instructions consistent with the provided input image. Third, we evaluate the generated image sequences across three dimensions of accuracy (step, scene, and task) and show our model achieves state-of-the-art results on all of them. Our code, dataset, and trained models are publicly available.

- **Summary**: Recent works in pathological speech analysis have increasingly relied on powerful self-supervised speech representations, leading to promising results. However, the complex, black-box nature of these embeddings and the limited research on their interpretability significantly restrict their adoption for clinical diagnosis. To address this gap, we propose a novel, interpretable framework specifically designed to support Parkinson's Disease (PD) diagnosis. Through the design of simple yet effective cross-attention mechanisms for both embedding- and temporal-level analysis, the proposed framework offers interpretability from two distinct but complementary perspectives. Experimental findings across five well-established speech benchmarks for PD detection demonstrate the framework's capability to identify meaningful speech patterns within self-supervised representations for a wide range of assessment tasks. Fine-grained temporal analyses further underscore its potential to enhance the interpretability of deep-learning pathological speech models, paving the way for the development of more transparent, trustworthy, and clinically applicable computer-assisted diagnosis systems in this domain. Moreover, in terms of classification accuracy, our method achieves results competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, while also demonstrating robustness in cross-lingual scenarios when applied to spontaneous speech production.

- **Summary**: Due to their large sizes, volumetric scans and whole-slide pathology images (WSIs) are often processed by extracting embeddings from local regions and then an aggregator makes predictions from this set. However, current methods require post-hoc visualization techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM) and often fail to localize small yet clinically crucial details. To address these limitations, we introduce INSIGHT, a novel weakly-supervised aggregator that integrates heatmap generation as an inductive bias. Starting from pre-trained feature maps, INSIGHT employs a detection module with small convolutional kernels to capture fine details and a context module with a broader receptive field to suppress local false positives. The resulting internal heatmap highlights diagnostically relevant regions. On CT and WSI benchmarks, INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art classification results and high weakly-labeled semantic segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: Safety filters in control systems correct nominal controls that violate safety constraints. Designing such filters as functions of visual observations in uncertain and complex environments is challenging. Several deep learning-based approaches to tackle this challenge have been proposed recently. However, formally verifying that the learned filters satisfy critical properties that enable them to guarantee the safety of the system is currently beyond reach. Instead, in this work, motivated by the success of ensemble methods in reinforcement learning, we empirically investigate the efficacy of ensembles in enhancing the accuracy and the out-of-distribution generalization of such filters, as a step towards more reliable ones. We experiment with diverse pre-trained vision representation models as filter backbones, training approaches, and output aggregation techniques. We compare the performance of ensembles with different configurations against each other, their individual member models, and large single-model baselines in distinguishing between safe and unsafe states and controls in the DeepAccident dataset. Our results show that diverse ensembles have better state and control classification accuracies compared to individual models.

- **Summary**: We introduce NitroFusion, a fundamentally different approach to single-step diffusion that achieves high-quality generation through a dynamic adversarial framework. While one-step methods offer dramatic speed advantages, they typically suffer from quality degradation compared to their multi-step counterparts. Just as a panel of art critics provides comprehensive feedback by specializing in different aspects like composition, color, and technique, our approach maintains a large pool of specialized discriminator heads that collectively guide the generation process. Each discriminator group develops expertise in specific quality aspects at different noise levels, providing diverse feedback that enables high-fidelity one-step generation. Our framework combines: (i) a dynamic discriminator pool with specialized discriminator groups to improve generation quality, (ii) strategic refresh mechanisms to prevent discriminator overfitting, and (iii) global-local discriminator heads for multi-scale quality assessment, and unconditional/conditional training for balanced generation. Additionally, our framework uniquely supports flexible deployment through bottom-up refinement, allowing users to dynamically choose between 1-4 denoising steps with the same model for direct quality-speed trade-offs. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that NitroFusion significantly outperforms existing single-step methods across multiple evaluation metrics, particularly excelling in preserving fine details and global consistency.

- **Summary**: Large Foundation Models like Dust3r can produce high quality outputs such as pointmaps, camera intrinsics, and depth estimation, given stereo-image pairs as input. However, the application of these outputs on tasks like Visual Localization requires a large amount of inference time and compute resources. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose the use of a knowledge distillation pipeline, where we aim to build a student-teacher model with Dust3r as the teacher and explore multiple architectures of student models that are trained using the 3D reconstructed points output by Dust3r. Our goal is to build student models that can learn scene-specific representations and output 3D points with replicable performance such as Dust3r. The data set we used to train our models is 12Scenes. We test two main architectures of models: a CNN-based architecture and a Vision Transformer based architecture. For each architecture, we also compare the use of pre-trained models against models built from scratch. We qualitatively compare the reconstructed 3D points output by the student model against Dust3r's and discuss the various features learned by the student model. We also perform ablation studies on the models through hyperparameter tuning. Overall, we observe that the Vision Transformer presents the best performance visually and quantitatively.
