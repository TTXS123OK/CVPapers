- **Summary**: Image restoration (IR) is a long-standing task to recover a high-quality image from its corrupted observation. Recently, transformer-based algorithms and some attention-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have presented promising results on several IR tasks. However, existing convolutional residual building modules for IR encounter limited ability to map inputs into high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, and their local receptive fields have difficulty in capturing long-range context information like Transformer. Besides, CNN-based attention modules for IR either face static abundant parameters or have limited receptive fields. To address the first issue, we propose an efficient residual star module (ERSM) that includes context-aware "star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to contextually map features into exceedingly high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, which greatly enhances representation learning. To further boost the extraction of contextual information, as for the second issue, we propose a large dynamic integration module (LDIM) which possesses an extremely large receptive field. Thus, LDIM can dynamically and efficiently integrate more contextual information that helps to further significantly improve the reconstruction performance. Integrating ERSM and LDIM into an U-shaped backbone, we propose a context-aware convolutional network (CCNet) with powerful learning ability for contextual high-dimensional mapping and abundant contextual information. Extensive experiments show that our CCNet with low model complexity achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art IR methods on several IR tasks, including image dehazing, image motion deblurring, and image desnowing.

- **Summary**: Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) addresses the challenges of evolving data distributions and the difficulty of data acquisition in real-world scenarios. To counteract the catastrophic forgetting typically encountered in FSCIL, knowledge distillation is employed as a way to maintain the knowledge from learned data distribution. Recognizing the limitations of generating discriminative feature representations in a few-shot context, our approach incorporates structural information between samples into knowledge distillation. This structural information serves as a remedy for the low quality of features. Diverging from traditional structured distillation methods that compute sample similarity, we introduce the Displacement Knowledge Distillation (DKD) method. DKD utilizes displacement rather than similarity between samples, incorporating both distance and angular information to significantly enhance the information density retained through knowledge distillation. Observing performance disparities in feature distribution between base and novel classes, we propose the Dual Distillation Network (DDNet). This network applies traditional knowledge distillation to base classes and DKD to novel classes, challenging the conventional integration of novel classes with base classes. Additionally, we implement an instance-aware sample selector during inference to dynamically adjust dual branch weights, thereby leveraging the complementary strengths of each approach. Extensive testing on three benchmarks demonstrates that DDNet achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, through rigorous experimentation and comparison, we establish the robustness and general applicability of our proposed DKD method.

- **Summary**: Contextual information at the video level has become increasingly crucial for visual object tracking. However, existing methods typically use only a few tokens to convey this information, which can lead to information loss and limit their ability to fully capture the context. To address this issue, we propose a new video-level visual object tracking framework called MCITrack. It leverages Mamba's hidden states to continuously record and transmit extensive contextual information throughout the video stream, resulting in more robust object tracking. The core component of MCITrack is the Contextual Information Fusion module, which consists of the mamba layer and the cross-attention layer. The mamba layer stores historical contextual information, while the cross-attention layer integrates this information into the current visual features of each backbone block. This module enhances the model's ability to capture and utilize contextual information at multiple levels through deep integration with the backbone. Experiments demonstrate that MCITrack achieves competitive performance across numerous benchmarks. For instance, it gets 76.6% AUC on LaSOT and 80.0% AO on GOT-10k, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance. Code and models are available at https://github.com/kangben258/MCITrack.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical comparison of diffusion and flow matching under the Generator Matching framework. Despite their apparent differences, both diffusion and flow matching can be viewed under the unified framework of Generator Matching. By recasting both diffusion and flow matching under the same generative Markov framework, we provide theoretical insights into why flow matching models can be more robust empirically and how novel model classes can be constructed by mixing deterministic and stochastic components. Our analysis offers a fresh perspective on the relationships between state-of-the-art generative modeling paradigms.

- **Summary**: Dynamic scenes contain intricate spatio-temporal information, crucial for mobile robots, UAVs, and autonomous driving systems to make informed decisions. Parsing these scenes into semantic triplets <Subject-Predicate-Object> for accurate Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is highly challenging due to the fluctuating spatio-temporal complexity. Inspired by the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose SceneLLM, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as powerful scene analyzers for dynamic SGG. Our framework introduces a Video-to-Language (V2L) mapping module that transforms video frames into linguistic signals (scene tokens), making the input more comprehensible for LLMs. To better encode spatial information, we devise a Spatial Information Aggregation (SIA) scheme, inspired by the structure of Chinese characters, which encodes spatial data into tokens. Using Optimal Transport (OT), we generate an implicit language signal from the frame-level token sequence that captures the video's spatio-temporal information. To further improve the LLM's ability to process this implicit linguistic input, we apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model. Finally, we use a transformer-based SGG predictor to decode the LLM's reasoning and predict semantic triplets. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Action Genome (AG) benchmark, and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of SceneLLM in understanding and generating accurate dynamic scene graphs.

- **Summary**: Creating realistic VR experiences is challenging due to the labor-intensive process of accurately replicating real-world details into virtual scenes, highlighting the need for automated methods that maintain spatial accuracy and provide design flexibility. In this paper, we propose AURORA, a novel method that leverages RGB-D images to automatically generate both purely virtual reality (VR) scenes and VR scenes combined with real-world elements. This approach can benefit designers by streamlining the process of converting real-world details into virtual scenes. AURORA integrates advanced techniques in image processing, segmentation, and 3D reconstruction to efficiently create realistic and detailed interior designs from real-world environments. The design of this integration ensures optimal performance and precision, addressing key challenges in automated indoor design generation by uniquely combining and leveraging the strengths of foundation models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments, both on self-captured data and public datasets, showcasing its potential to enhance virtual reality (VR) applications by providing interior designs that conform to real-world positioning.

- **Summary**: We propose SAM-IF, a novel method for incremental few-shot instance segmentation leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM). SAM-IF addresses the challenges of class-agnostic instance segmentation by introducing a multi-class classifier and fine-tuning SAM to focus on specific target objects. To enhance few-shot learning capabilities, SAM-IF employs a cosine-similarity-based classifier, enabling efficient adaptation to novel classes with minimal data. Additionally, SAM-IF supports incremental learning by updating classifier weights without retraining the decoder. Our method achieves competitive but more reasonable results compared to existing approaches, particularly in scenarios requiring specific object segmentation with limited labeled data.

We also demonstrated that AirwaySign is a powerful tool for correlation analysis on pulmonary diseases.

- **Summary**: Orthognathic surgery consultation is essential to help patients understand the changes to their facial appearance after surgery. However, current visualization methods are often inefficient and inaccurate due to limited pre- and post-treatment data and the complexity of the treatment. To overcome these challenges, this study aims to develop a fully automated pipeline that generates accurate and efficient 3D previews of postsurgical facial appearances for patients with orthognathic treatment without requiring additional medical images. The study introduces novel aesthetic losses, such as mouth-convexity and asymmetry losses, to improve the accuracy of facial surgery prediction. Additionally, it proposes a specialized parametric model for 3D reconstruction of the patient, medical-related losses to guide latent code prediction network optimization, and a data augmentation scheme to address insufficient data. The study additionally employs FLAME, a parametric model, to enhance the quality of facial appearance previews by extracting facial latent codes and establishing dense correspondences between pre- and post-surgery geometries. Quantitative comparisons showed the algorithm's effectiveness, and qualitative results highlighted accurate facial contour and detail predictions. A user study confirmed that doctors and the public could not distinguish between machine learning predictions and actual postoperative results. This study aims to offer a practical, effective solution for orthognathic surgery consultations, benefiting doctors and patients.

- **Summary**: Understanding and addressing corner cases is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) play a crucial role in enhancing scenario comprehension, yet they face significant challenges, such as hallucination and insufficient real-world grounding, which compromise their performance in critical driving scenarios. In this work, we propose RAC3, a novel framework designed to improve VLMs' ability to handle corner cases effectively. The framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to mitigate hallucination by dynamically incorporating context-specific external knowledge. A cornerstone of RAC3 is its cross-modal alignment fine-tuning, which utilizes contrastive learning to embed image-text pairs into a unified semantic space, enabling robust retrieval of similar scenarios. We evaluate RAC3 through extensive experiments using a curated dataset of corner case scenarios, demonstrating its ability to enhance semantic alignment, improve hallucination mitigation, and achieve superior performance metrics, such as Cosine Similarity and ROUGE-L scores. For example, for the LLaVA-v1.6-34B VLM, the cosine similarity between the generated text and the reference text has increased by 5.22\%. The F1-score in ROUGE-L has increased by 39.91\%, the Precision has increased by 55.80\%, and the Recall has increased by 13.74\%. This work underscores the potential of retrieval-augmented VLMs to advance the robustness and safety of autonomous driving in complex environments.

- **Summary**: One of the key goals of artificial intelligence (AI) is the development of a multimodal system that facilitates communication with the visual world (image and video) using a natural language query. Earlier works on medical question answering primarily focused on textual and visual (image) modalities, which may be inefficient in answering questions requiring demonstration. In recent years, significant progress has been achieved due to the introduction of large-scale language-vision datasets and the development of efficient deep neural techniques that bridge the gap between language and visual understanding. Improvements have been made in numerous vision-and-language tasks, such as visual captioning visual question answering, and natural language video localization. Most of the existing work on language vision focused on creating datasets and developing solutions for open-domain applications. We believe medical videos may provide the best possible answers to many first aid, medical emergency, and medical education questions. With increasing interest in AI to support clinical decision-making and improve patient engagement, there is a need to explore such challenges and develop efficient algorithms for medical language-video understanding and generation. Toward this, we introduced new tasks to foster research toward designing systems that can understand medical videos to provide visual answers to natural language questions, and are equipped with multimodal capability to generate instruction steps from the medical video. These tasks have the potential to support the development of sophisticated downstream applications that can benefit the public and medical professionals.

- **Summary**: This paper studies the challenging task of makeup transfer, which aims to apply diverse makeup styles precisely and naturally to a given facial image. Due to the absence of paired data, current methods typically synthesize sub-optimal pseudo ground truths to guide the model training, resulting in low makeup fidelity. Additionally, different makeup styles generally have varying effects on the person face, but existing methods struggle to deal with this diversity. To address these issues, we propose a novel Self-supervised Hierarchical Makeup Transfer (SHMT) method via latent diffusion models. Following a "decoupling-and-reconstruction" paradigm, SHMT works in a self-supervised manner, freeing itself from the misguidance of imprecise pseudo-paired data. Furthermore, to accommodate a variety of makeup styles, hierarchical texture details are decomposed via a Laplacian pyramid and selectively introduced to the content representation. Finally, we design a novel Iterative Dual Alignment (IDA) module that dynamically adjusts the injection condition of the diffusion model, allowing the alignment errors caused by the domain gap between content and makeup representations to be corrected. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/Snowfallingplum/SHMT}.



### Making Bias Amplification in Balanced Datasets Directional and Interpretable

- **Summary**: Most of the ML datasets we use today are biased. When we train models on these biased datasets, they often not only learn dataset biases but can also amplify them -- a phenomenon known as bias amplification. Several co-occurrence-based metrics have been proposed to measure bias amplification between a protected attribute A (e.g., gender) and a task T (e.g., cooking). However, these metrics fail to measure biases when A is balanced with T. To measure bias amplification in balanced datasets, recent work proposed a predictability-based metric called leakage amplification. However, leakage amplification cannot identify the direction in which biases are amplified. In this work, we propose a new predictability-based metric called directional predictability amplification (DPA). DPA measures directional bias amplification, even for balanced datasets. Unlike leakage amplification, DPA is easier to interpret and less sensitive to attacker models (a hyperparameter in predictability-based metrics). Our experiments on tabular and image datasets show that DPA is an effective metric for measuring directional bias amplification. The code will be available soon.



### Classification Drives Geographic Bias in Street Scene Segmentation

- **Summary**: Previous studies showed that image datasets lacking geographic diversity can lead to biased performance in models trained on them. While earlier work studied general-purpose image datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and simple tasks like image recognition, we investigated geo-biases in real-world driving datasets on a more complex task: instance segmentation. We examined if instance segmentation models trained on European driving scenes (Eurocentric models) are geo-biased. Consistent with previous work, we found that Eurocentric models were geo-biased. Interestingly, we found that geo-biases came from classification errors rather than localization errors, with classification errors alone contributing 10-90% of the geo-biases in segmentation and 19-88% of the geo-biases in detection. This showed that while classification is geo-biased, localization (including detection and segmentation) is geographically robust. Our findings show that in region-specific models (e.g., Eurocentric models), geo-biases from classification errors can be significantly mitigated by using coarser classes (e.g., grouping car, bus, and truck as 4-wheeler).

- **Summary**: Human video synthesis aims to create lifelike characters in various environments, with wide applications in VR, storytelling, and content creation. While 2D diffusion-based methods have made significant progress, they struggle to generalize to complex 3D poses and varying scene backgrounds. To address these limitations, we introduce CFSynthesis, a novel framework for generating high-quality human videos with customizable attributes, including identity, motion, and scene configurations. Our method leverages a texture-SMPL-based representation to ensure consistent and stable character appearances across free viewpoints. Additionally, we introduce a novel foreground-background separation strategy that effectively decomposes the scene as foreground and background, enabling seamless integration of user-defined backgrounds. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that CFSynthesis not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in complex human animations but also adapts effectively to 3D motions in free-view and user-specified scenarios.

- **Summary**: Radiology report generation (RRG) models typically focus on individual exams, often overlooking the integration of historical visual or textual data, which is crucial for patient follow-ups. Traditional methods usually struggle with long sequence dependencies when incorporating historical information, but large language models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning, making them well-suited for analyzing longitudinal medical data. In light of this, we propose a novel Historical-Constrained Large Language Models (HC-LLM) framework for RRG, empowering LLMs with longitudinal report generation capabilities by constraining the consistency and differences between longitudinal images and their corresponding reports. Specifically, our approach extracts both time-shared and time-specific features from longitudinal chest X-rays and diagnostic reports to capture disease progression. Then, we ensure consistent representation by applying intra-modality similarity constraints and aligning various features across modalities with multimodal contrastive and structural constraints. These combined constraints effectively guide the LLMs in generating diagnostic reports that accurately reflect the progression of the disease, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Longitudinal-MIMIC dataset. Notably, our approach performs well even without historical data during testing and can be easily adapted to other multimodal large models, enhancing its versatility.

- **Summary**: Continual learning (CL) enables models to adapt to evolving data streams. A major challenge of CL is catastrophic forgetting, where new knowledge will overwrite previously acquired knowledge. Traditional methods usually retain the past data for replay or add additional branches in the model to learn new knowledge, which has high memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight CL framework, Adapter-Enhanced Semantic Prompting (AESP), which integrates prompt tuning and adapter techniques. Specifically, we design semantic-guided prompts to enhance the generalization ability of visual features and utilize adapters to efficiently fuse the semantic information, aiming to learn more adaptive features for the continual learning task. Furthermore, to choose the right task prompt for feature adaptation, we have developed a novel matching mechanism for prompt selection. Extensive experiments on three CL datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves favorable performance across multiple metrics, showing its potential for advancing CL.

- **Summary**: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels typically uses Class Activation Maps (CAM) to achieve dense predictions. Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) has provided an alternative to generate localization maps from class-patch attention. However, due to insufficient constraints on modeling such attention, we observe that the Localization Attention Maps (LAM) often struggle with the artifact issue, i.e., patch regions with minimal semantic relevance are falsely activated by class tokens. In this work, we propose MoRe to address this issue and further explore the potential of LAM. Our findings suggest that imposing additional regularization on class-patch attention is necessary. To this end, we first view the attention as a novel directed graph and propose the Graph Category Representation module to implicitly regularize the interaction among class-patch entities. It ensures that class tokens dynamically condense the related patch information and suppress unrelated artifacts at a graph level. Second, motivated by the observation that CAM from classification weights maintains smooth localization of objects, we devise the Localization-informed Regularization module to explicitly regularize the class-patch attention. It directly mines the token relations from CAM and further supervises the consistency between class and patch tokens in a learnable manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO, validating that MoRe effectively addresses the artifact issue and achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing recent single-stage and even multi-stage methods.

- **Summary**: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that closely resemble a reference image while integrating user-specified textual modifications, thereby capturing user intent more precisely. Existing training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) methods often employ a two-stage process: they first generate a caption for the reference image and then use Large Language Models for reasoning to obtain a target description. However, these methods suffer from missing critical visual details and limited reasoning capabilities, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel, training-free one-stage method, One-Stage Reflective Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for ZS-CIR (OSrCIR), which employs Multimodal Large Language Models to retain essential visual information in a single-stage reasoning process, eliminating the information loss seen in two-stage methods. Our Reflective Chain-of-Thought framework further improves interpretative accuracy by aligning manipulation intent with contextual cues from reference images. OSrCIR achieves performance gains of 1.80% to 6.44% over existing training-free methods across multiple tasks, setting new state-of-the-art results in ZS-CIR and enhancing its utility in vision-language applications.

- **Summary**: Spectral clustering is a popular clustering method. It first maps data into the spectral embedding space and then uses Kmeans to find clusters. However, the two decoupled steps prohibit joint optimization for the optimal solution. In addition, it needs to construct the similarity graph for samples, which suffers from the curse of dimensionality when the data are high-dimensional. To address these two challenges, we introduce \textbf{D}eep \textbf{S}pectral \textbf{C}lustering (\textbf{DSC}), which consists of two main modules: the spectral embedding module and the greedy Kmeans module. The former module learns to efficiently embed raw samples into the spectral embedding space using deep neural networks and power iteration. The latter module improves the cluster structures of Kmeans on the learned spectral embeddings by a greedy optimization strategy, which iteratively reveals the direction of the worst cluster structures and optimizes embeddings in this direction. To jointly optimize spectral embeddings and clustering, we seamlessly integrate the two modules and optimize them in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that DSC achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in generative AI systems have raised concerns about academic integrity among educators. Beyond excelling at solving programming problems and text-based multiple-choice questions, recent research has also found that large multimodal models (LMMs) can solve Parsons problems based only on an image. However, such problems are still inherently text-based and rely on the capabilities of the models to convert the images of code blocks to their corresponding text. In this paper, we further investigate the capabilities of LMMs to solve graph and tree data structure problems based only on images. To achieve this, we computationally construct and evaluate a novel benchmark dataset comprising 9,072 samples of diverse graph and tree data structure tasks to assess the performance of the GPT-4o, GPT-4v, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision, and Claude 3 model families. GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Flash performed best on trees and graphs respectively. GPT-4o achieved 87.6% accuracy on tree samples, while Gemini 1.5 Flash, achieved 56.2% accuracy on graph samples. Our findings highlight the influence of structural and visual variations on model performance. This research not only introduces an LMM benchmark to facilitate replication and further exploration but also underscores the potential of LMMs in solving complex computing problems, with important implications for pedagogy and assessment practices.

- **Summary**: The increasing demand for immersive AR/VR applications and spatial intelligence has heightened the need to generate high-quality scene-level and 360{\deg} panoramic video. However, most video diffusion models are constrained by limited resolution and aspect ratio, which restricts their applicability to scene-level dynamic content synthesis. In this work, we propose the DynamicScaler, addressing these challenges by enabling spatially scalable and panoramic dynamic scene synthesis that preserves coherence across panoramic scenes of arbitrary size. Specifically, we introduce a Offset Shifting Denoiser, facilitating efficient, synchronous, and coherent denoising panoramic dynamic scenes via a diffusion model with fixed resolution through a seamless rotating Window, which ensures seamless boundary transitions and consistency across the entire panoramic space, accommodating varying resolutions and aspect ratios. Additionally, we employ a Global Motion Guidance mechanism to ensure both local detail fidelity and global motion continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves superior content and motion quality in panoramic scene-level video generation, offering a training-free, efficient, and scalable solution for immersive dynamic scene creation with constant VRAM consumption regardless of the output video resolution.

- **Summary**: The unprecedented advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have profoundly impacted natural language processing but have yet to fully embrace the realm of scalable vector graphics (SVG) generation. While LLMs encode partial knowledge of SVG data from web pages during training, recent findings suggest that semantically ambiguous and tokenized representations within LLMs may result in hallucinations in vector primitive predictions. Additionally, LLM training typically lacks modeling and understanding of the rendering sequence of vector paths, which can lead to occlusion between output vector primitives. In this paper, we present LLM4SVG, an initial yet substantial step toward bridging this gap by enabling LLMs to better understand and generate vector graphics. LLM4SVG facilitates a deeper understanding of SVG components through learnable semantic tokens, which precisely encode these tokens and their corresponding properties to generate semantically aligned SVG outputs. Using a series of learnable semantic tokens, a structured dataset for instruction following is developed to support comprehension and generation across two primary tasks. Our method introduces a modular architecture to existing large language models, integrating semantic tags, vector instruction encoders, fine-tuned commands, and powerful LLMs to tightly combine geometric, appearance, and language information. To overcome the scarcity of SVG-text instruction data, we developed an automated data generation pipeline that collected a massive dataset of more than 250k SVG data and 580k SVG-text instructions, which facilitated the adoption of the two-stage training strategy popular in LLM development. By exploring various training strategies, we developed LLM4SVG, which significantly moves beyond optimized rendering-based approaches and language-model-based baselines to achieve remarkable results in human evaluation tasks.

- **Summary**: Virtual staining leverages computer-aided techniques to transfer the style of histochemically stained tissue samples to other staining types. In virtual staining of pathological images, maintaining strict structural consistency is crucial, as these images emphasize structural integrity more than natural images. Even slight structural alterations can lead to deviations in diagnostic semantic information. Furthermore, the unpaired characteristic of virtual staining data may compromise the preservation of pathological diagnostic content. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-path inversion virtual staining method using prompt learning, which optimizes visual prompts to control content and style, while preserving complete pathological diagnostic content. Our proposed inversion technique comprises two key components: (1) Dual Path Prompted Strategy, we utilize a feature adapter function to generate reference images for inversion, providing style templates for input image inversion, called Style Target Path. We utilize the inversion of the input image as the Structural Target path, employing visual prompt images to maintain structural consistency in this path while preserving style information from the style Target path. During the deterministic sampling process, we achieve complete content-style disentanglement through a plug-and-play embedding visual prompt approach. (2) StainPrompt Optimization, where we only optimize the null visual prompt as ``operator'' for dual path inversion, rather than fine-tune pre-trained model. We optimize null visual prompt for structual and style trajectory around pivotal noise on each timestep, ensuring accurate dual-path inversion reconstruction. Extensive evaluations on publicly available multi-domain unpaired staining datasets demonstrate high structural consistency and accurate style transfer results.

- **Summary**: Plug-and-play (PnP) methods are extensively used for solving imaging inverse problems by integrating physical measurement models with pre-trained deep denoisers as priors. Score-based diffusion models (SBMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for image generation by training deep denoisers to represent the score of the image prior. While both PnP and SBMs use deep denoisers, the score-based nature of PnP is unexplored in the literature due to its distinct origins rooted in proximal optimization. This letter introduces a novel view of PnP as a score-based method, a perspective that enables the re-use of powerful SBMs within classical PnP algorithms without retraining. We present a set of mathematical relationships for adapting popular SBMs as priors within PnP. We show that this approach enables a direct comparison between PnP and SBM-based reconstruction methods using the same neural network as the prior.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we investigate the impact of adversarial attacks on the explainability of deep learning models, which are commonly criticized for their black-box nature despite their capacity for autonomous feature extraction. This black-box nature can affect the perceived trustworthiness of these models. To address this, explainability techniques such as GradCAM, SmoothGrad, and LIME have been developed to clarify model decision-making processes. Our research focuses on the robustness of these explanations when models are subjected to adversarial attacks, specifically those involving subtle image perturbations that are imperceptible to humans but can significantly mislead models. For this, we utilize attack methods like the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and the Basic Iterative Method (BIM) and observe their effects on model accuracy and explanations. The results reveal a substantial decline in model accuracy, with accuracies dropping from 89.94% to 58.73% and 45.50% under FGSM and BIM attacks, respectively. Despite these declines in accuracy, the explanation of the models measured by metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) shows negligible changes, suggesting that these metrics may not be sensitive enough to detect the presence of adversarial perturbations.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown unprecedented capabilities in advancing various vision-language tasks. However, MLLMs face significant challenges with hallucinations, and misleading outputs that do not align with the input data. While existing efforts are paid to combat MLLM hallucinations, several pivotal challenges are still unsolved. First, while current approaches aggressively focus on addressing errors at the perception level, another important type at the cognition level requiring factual commonsense can be overlooked. In addition, existing methods might fall short in finding a more effective way to represent visual input, which is yet a key bottleneck that triggers visual hallucinations. Moreover, MLLMs can frequently be misled by faulty textual inputs and cause hallucinations, while unfortunately, this type of issue has long been overlooked by existing studies. Inspired by human intuition in handling hallucinations, this paper introduces a novel bottom-up reasoning framework. Our framework systematically addresses potential issues in both visual and textual inputs by verifying and integrating perception-level information with cognition-level commonsense knowledge, ensuring more reliable outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in multiple hallucination benchmarks after integrating MLLMs with the proposed framework. In-depth analyses reveal the great potential of our methods in addressing perception- and cognition-level hallucinations.

- **Summary**: In the realm of novelty detection, accurately identifying outliers in data without specific class information poses a significant challenge. While current methods excel in single-object scenarios, they struggle with multi-object situations due to their focus on individual objects. Our paper suggests a novel approach: redefining `normal' at the object level in training datasets. Rather than the usual image-level view, we consider the most dominant object in a dataset as the norm, offering a perspective that is more effective for real-world scenarios. Adapting to our object-level definition of `normal', we modify knowledge distillation frameworks, where a student network learns from a pre-trained teacher network. Our first contribution, DeFeND(Dense Feature Fine-tuning on Normal Data), integrates dense feature fine-tuning into the distillation process, allowing the teacher network to focus on object-level features with a self-supervised loss. The second is masked knowledge distillation, where the student network works with partially hidden inputs, honing its ability to deduce and generalize from incomplete data. This approach not only fares well in single-object novelty detection but also considerably surpasses existing methods in multi-object contexts.

- **Summary**: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) quantitatively evaluates the quality of human actions, providing automated assessments that reduce biases in human judgment. Its applications span domains such as sports analysis, skill assessment, and medical care. Recent advances in AQA have introduced innovative methodologies, but similar methods often intertwine across different domains, highlighting the fragmented nature that hinders systematic reviews. In addition, the lack of a unified benchmark and limited computational comparisons hinder consistent evaluation and fair assessment of AQA approaches. In this work, we address these gaps by systematically analyzing over 150 AQA-related papers to develop a hierarchical taxonomy, construct a unified benchmark, and provide an in-depth analysis of current trends, challenges, and future directions. Our hierarchical taxonomy categorizes AQA methods based on input modalities (video, skeleton, multi-modal) and their specific characteristics, highlighting the evolution and interrelations across various approaches. To promote standardization, we present a unified benchmark, integrating diverse datasets to evaluate the assessment precision and computational efficiency. Finally, we review emerging task-specific applications and identify under-explored challenges in AQA, providing actionable insights into future research directions. This survey aims to deepen understanding of AQA progress, facilitate method comparison, and guide future innovations. The project web page can be found at https://ZhouKanglei.github.io/AQA-Survey.

- **Summary**: Text-conditional image editing is a practical AIGC task that has recently emerged with great commercial and academic value. For real image editing, most diffusion model-based methods use DDIM Inversion as the first stage before editing. However, DDIM Inversion often results in reconstruction failure, leading to unsatisfactory performance for downstream editing. To address this problem, we first analyze why the reconstruction via DDIM Inversion fails. We then propose a new inversion and sampling method named Dual-Schedule Inversion. We also design a classifier to adaptively combine Dual-Schedule Inversion with different editing methods for user-friendly image editing. Our work can achieve superior reconstruction and editing performance with the following advantages: 1) It can reconstruct real images perfectly without fine-tuning, and its reversibility is guaranteed mathematically. 2) The edited object/scene conforms to the semantics of the text prompt. 3) The unedited parts of the object/scene retain the original identity.

- **Summary**: Recently, single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection with single point supervision has drawn wide-spread attention. However, the latest label evolution with single point supervision (LESPS) framework suffers from instability, excessive label evolution, and difficulty in exerting embedded network performance. Therefore, we construct a Progressive Active Learning (PAL) framework. Specifically, inspired by organisms gradually adapting to their environment and continuously accumulating knowledge, we propose an innovative progressive active learning idea, which emphasizes that the network progressively and actively recognizes and learns more hard samples to achieve continuous performance enhancement. Based on this, on the one hand, we propose a model pre-start concept, which focuses on selecting a portion of easy samples and can help models have basic task-specific learning capabilities. On the other hand, we propose a refined dual-update strategy, which can promote reasonable learning of harder samples and continuous refinement of pseudo-labels. In addition, to alleviate the risk of excessive label evolution, a decay factor is reasonably introduced, which helps to achieve a dynamic balance between the expansion and contraction of target annotations. Extensive experiments show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) equipped with our PAL framework have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple public datasets. Furthermore, our PAL framework can build a efficient and stable bridge between full supervision and point supervision tasks. Our code are available at https://github.com/YuChuang1205/PAL.

- **Summary**: Recently, cross-spectral image patch matching based on feature relation learning has attracted extensive attention. However, performance bottleneck problems have gradually emerged in existing methods. To address this challenge, we make the first attempt to explore a stable and efficient bridge between descriptor learning and metric learning, and construct a knowledge-guided learning network (KGL-Net), which achieves amazing performance improvements while abandoning complex network structures. Specifically, we find that there is feature extraction consistency between metric learning based on feature difference learning and descriptor learning based on Euclidean distance. This provides the foundation for bridge building. To ensure the stability and efficiency of the constructed bridge, on the one hand, we conduct an in-depth exploration of 20 combined network architectures. On the other hand, a feature-guided loss is constructed to achieve mutual guidance of features. In addition, unlike existing methods, we consider that the feature mapping ability of the metric branch should receive more attention. Therefore, a hard negative sample mining for metric learning (HNSM-M) strategy is constructed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that hard negative sample mining for metric networks has been implemented and brings significant performance gains. Extensive experimental results show that our KGL-Net achieves SOTA performance in three different cross-spectral image patch matching scenarios.

- **Summary**: In real-world scenarios, complex data such as multispectral images and multi-frame videos inherently exhibit robust low-rank property. This property is vital for multi-dimensional inverse problems, such as tensor completion, spectral imaging reconstruction, and multispectral image denoising. Existing tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) definitions rely on hand-designed or pre-given transforms, which lack flexibility for defining tensor nuclear norm (TNN). The TNN-regularized optimization problem is solved by the singular value thresholding (SVT) operator, which leverages the t-SVD framework to obtain the low-rank tensor. However, it is quite complicated to introduce SVT into deep neural networks due to the numerical instability problem in solving the derivatives of the eigenvectors. In this paper, we introduce a novel data-driven generative low-rank t-SVD model based on the learnable orthogonal transform, which can be naturally solved under its representation. Prompted by the linear algebra theorem of the Householder transformation, our learnable orthogonal transform is achieved by constructing an endogenously orthogonal matrix adaptable to neural networks, optimizing it as arbitrary orthogonal matrices. Additionally, we propose a low-rank solver as a generalization of SVT, which utilizes an efficient representation of generative networks to obtain low-rank structures. Extensive experiments highlight its significant restoration enhancements.

- **Summary**: Text-to-3D generation has achieved remarkable progress in recent years, yet evaluating these methods remains challenging for two reasons: i) Existing benchmarks lack fine-grained evaluation on different prompt categories and evaluation dimensions. ii) Previous evaluation metrics only focus on a single aspect (e.g., text-3D alignment) and fail to perform multi-dimensional quality assessment. To address these problems, we first propose a comprehensive benchmark named MATE-3D. The benchmark contains eight well-designed prompt categories that cover single and multiple object generation, resulting in 1,280 generated textured meshes. We have conducted a large-scale subjective experiment from four different evaluation dimensions and collected 107,520 annotations, followed by detailed analyses of the results. Based on MATE-3D, we propose a novel quality evaluator named HyperScore. Utilizing hypernetwork to generate specified mapping functions for each evaluation dimension, our metric can effectively perform multi-dimensional quality assessment. HyperScore presents superior performance over existing metrics on MATE-3D, making it a promising metric for assessing and improving text-to-3D generation.

- **Summary**: Recent diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in both 3D scene generation and perception tasks. Nevertheless, existing methods typically separate these two processes, acting as a data augmenter to generate synthetic data for downstream perception tasks. In this work, we propose OccScene, a novel mutual learning paradigm that integrates fine-grained 3D perception and high-quality generation in a unified framework, achieving a cross-task win-win effect. OccScene generates new and consistent 3D realistic scenes only depending on text prompts, guided with semantic occupancy in a joint-training diffusion framework. To align the occupancy with the diffusion latent, a Mamba-based Dual Alignment module is introduced to incorporate fine-grained semantics and geometry as perception priors. Within OccScene, the perception module can be effectively improved with customized and diverse generated scenes, while the perception priors in return enhance the generation performance for mutual benefits. Extensive experiments show that OccScene achieves realistic 3D scene generation in broad indoor and outdoor scenarios, while concurrently boosting the perception models to achieve substantial performance improvements in the 3D perception task of semantic occupancy prediction.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation is a critical component of clinical practice, and the state-of-the-art MedSAM model has significantly advanced this field. Nevertheless, critiques highlight that MedSAM demands substantial computational resources during inference. To address this issue, the CVPR 2024 MedSAM on Laptop Challenge was established to find an optimal balance between accuracy and processing speed. In this paper, we introduce a quantization-aware training pipeline designed to efficiently quantize the Segment Anything Model for medical images and deploy it using the OpenVINO inference engine. This pipeline optimizes both training time and disk storage. Our experimental results confirm that this approach considerably enhances processing speed over the baseline, while still achieving an acceptable accuracy level. The training script, inference script, and quantized model are publicly accessible at https://github.com/AVC2-UESTC/QMedSAM.

- **Summary**: Despite the significant role text-to-motion (T2M) generation plays across various applications, current methods involve a large number of parameters and suffer from slow inference speeds, leading to high usage costs. To address this, we aim to design a lightweight model to reduce usage costs. First, unlike existing works that focus solely on global information modeling, we recognize the importance of local information modeling in the T2M task by reconsidering the intrinsic properties of human motion, leading us to propose a lightweight Local Information Modeling Module. Second, we introduce Mamba to the T2M task, reducing the number of parameters and GPU memory demands, and we have designed a novel Pseudo-bidirectional Scan to replicate the effects of a bidirectional scan without increasing parameter count. Moreover, we propose a novel Adaptive Textual Information Injector that more effectively integrates textual information into the motion during generation. By integrating the aforementioned designs, we propose a lightweight and fast model named Light-T2M. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, MoMask, our Light-T2M model features just 10\% of the parameters (4.48M vs 44.85M) and achieves a 16\% faster inference time (0.152s vs 0.180s), while surpassing MoMask with an FID of \textbf{0.040} (vs. 0.045) on HumanML3D dataset and 0.161 (vs. 0.228) on KIT-ML dataset.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at multimodal perception and understanding, yet their tendency to generate hallucinated or inaccurate responses undermines their trustworthiness. Existing methods have largely overlooked the importance of refusal responses as a means of enhancing MLLMs reliability. To bridge this gap, we present the Information Boundary-aware Learning Framework (InBoL), a novel approach that empowers MLLMs to refuse to answer user queries when encountering insufficient information. To the best of our knowledge, InBoL is the first framework that systematically defines the conditions under which refusal is appropriate for MLLMs using the concept of information boundaries proposed in our paper. This framework introduces a comprehensive data generation pipeline and tailored training strategies to improve the model's ability to deliver appropriate refusal responses. To evaluate the trustworthiness of MLLMs, we further propose a user-centric alignment goal along with corresponding metrics. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in refusal accuracy without noticeably compromising the model's helpfulness, establishing InBoL as a pivotal advancement in building more trustworthy MLLMs.

- **Summary**: We present GEM, a Generalizable Ego-vision Multimodal world model that predicts future frames using a reference frame, sparse features, human poses, and ego-trajectories. Hence, our model has precise control over object dynamics, ego-agent motion and human poses. GEM generates paired RGB and depth outputs for richer spatial understanding. We introduce autoregressive noise schedules to enable stable long-horizon generations. Our dataset is comprised of 4000+ hours of multimodal data across domains like autonomous driving, egocentric human activities, and drone flights. Pseudo-labels are used to get depth maps, ego-trajectories, and human poses. We use a comprehensive evaluation framework, including a new Control of Object Manipulation (COM) metric, to assess controllability. Experiments show GEM excels at generating diverse, controllable scenarios and temporal consistency over long generations. Code, models, and datasets are fully open-sourced.

- **Summary**: Inferring the 3D structure of a scene from a single image is an ill-posed and challenging problem in the field of vision-centric autonomous driving. Existing methods usually employ neural radiance fields to produce voxelized 3D occupancy, lacking instance-level semantic reasoning and temporal photometric consistency. In this paper, we propose ViPOcc, which leverages the visual priors from vision foundation models (VFMs) for fine-grained 3D occupancy prediction. Unlike previous works that solely employ volume rendering for RGB and depth image reconstruction, we introduce a metric depth estimation branch, in which an inverse depth alignment module is proposed to bridge the domain gap in depth distribution between VFM predictions and the ground truth. The recovered metric depth is then utilized in temporal photometric alignment and spatial geometric alignment to ensure accurate and consistent 3D occupancy prediction. Additionally, we also propose a semantic-guided non-overlapping Gaussian mixture sampler for efficient, instance-aware ray sampling, which addresses the redundant and imbalanced sampling issue that still exists in previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of ViPOcc in both 3D occupancy prediction and depth estimation tasks on the KITTI-360 and KITTI Raw datasets.

- **Summary**: Pixel dependency modeling from tampered images is pivotal for image forgery localization. Current approaches predominantly rely on convolutional neural network (CNN) or Transformer-based models, which often either lack sufficient receptive fields or entail significant computational overheads. In this paper, we propose LoMa, a novel image forgery localization method that leverages the Selective State Space (S6) model for global pixel dependency modeling and inverted residual CNN for local pixel dependency modeling. Our method introduces the Mixed-SSM Block, which initially employs atrous selective scan to traverse the spatial domain and convert the tampered image into order patch sequences, and subsequently applies multidirectional S6 modeling. In addition, an auxiliary convolutional branch is introduced to enhance local feature extraction. This design facilitates the efficient extraction of global dependencies while upholding linear complexity. Upon modeling the pixel dependency with the SSM and CNN blocks, the pixel-wise forgery localization results are obtained by a simple MLP decoder. Extensive experimental results validate the superiority of LoMa over CNN-based and Transformer-based state-of-the-arts.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal hashing methods have gained popularity due to their fast speed and low storage requirements. Among them, the supervised methods demonstrate better performance by utilizing labels as supervisory signals compared with unsupervised methods. Currently, for almost all supervised multi-modal hashing methods, there is a hidden assumption that training sets have no noisy labels. However, labels are often annotated incorrectly due to manual labeling in real-world scenarios, which will greatly harm the retrieval performance. To address this issue, we first discover a significant distribution consistency pattern through experiments, i.e., the 1-0 distribution of the presence or absence of each category in the label is consistent with the high-low distribution of similarity scores of the hash codes relative to category centers. Then, inspired by this pattern, we propose a novel Distribution-Consistency-Guided Multi-modal Hashing (DCGMH), which aims to filter and reconstruct noisy labels to enhance retrieval performance. Specifically, the proposed method first randomly initializes several category centers, which are used to compute the high-low distribution of similarity scores; Noisy and clean labels are then separately filtered out via the discovered distribution consistency pattern to mitigate the impact of noisy labels; Subsequently, a correction strategy, which is indirectly designed via the distribution consistency pattern, is applied to the filtered noisy labels, correcting high-confidence ones while treating low-confidence ones as unlabeled for unsupervised learning, thereby further enhancing the model's performance. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art baselines in multi-modal retrieval tasks.

- **Summary**: Manipulating the illumination within a single image represents a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. This problem has been traditionally addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which require explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray tracing simulations. Meanwhile, recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm could soon be practical and possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with networks that are trained on massive amounts of image and video data. In this paper, we explore the potential of exploiting video diffusion models, and in particular Stable Video Diffusion (SVD), in understanding the physical world to perform relighting tasks given a single image. Specifically, we introduce GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform light manipulation into a video generation model, enabling users to directly insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image and generate the results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned on only a small synthetic dataset (270 objects) is able to generalize to real images, enabling single-image relighting with realistic ray tracing effects and cast shadows. These results reveal the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information about lighting, material, and shape. Our findings suggest that such models, with minimal training, can be used for physically-based rendering without explicit physically asset reconstruction and complex ray tracing. This further suggests the potential of such models for controllable and physically accurate image synthesis tasks.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the phenomenon of data redundancy in video understanding, with the aim to improve computational efficiency. Our investigation commences with an examination of spatial redundancy, which refers to the observation that the most informative region in each video frame usually corresponds to a small image patch, whose shape, size and location shift smoothly across frames. Motivated by this phenomenon, we formulate the patch localization problem as a dynamic decision task, and introduce a spatially adaptive video recognition approach, termed AdaFocus. In specific, a lightweight encoder is first employed to quickly process the full video sequence, whose features are then utilized by a policy network to identify the most task-relevant regions. Subsequently, the selected patches are inferred by a high-capacity deep network for the final prediction. The full model can be trained in end-to-end conveniently. Furthermore, AdaFocus can be extended by further considering temporal and sample-wise redundancies, i.e., allocating the majority of computation to the most task-relevant frames, and minimizing the computation spent on relatively "easier" videos. Our resulting approach, Uni-AdaFocus, establishes a comprehensive framework that seamlessly integrates spatial, temporal, and sample-wise dynamic computation, while it preserves the merits of AdaFocus in terms of efficient end-to-end training and hardware friendliness. In addition, Uni-AdaFocus is general and flexible as it is compatible with off-the-shelf efficient backbones (e.g., TSM and X3D), which can be readily deployed as our feature extractor, yielding a significantly improved computational efficiency. Empirically, extensive experiments based on seven benchmark datasets and three application scenarios substantiate that Uni-AdaFocus is considerably more efficient than the competitive baselines.

- **Summary**: Classifying large images with small or tiny regions of interest (ROI) is challenging due to computational and memory constraints. Weakly supervised memory-efficient patch selectors have achieved results comparable with strongly supervised methods. However, low signal-to-noise ratios and low entropy attention still cause overfitting. We explore these issues using a novel testbed on a memory-efficient cross-attention transformer with Iterative Patch Selection (IPS) as the patch selection module. Our testbed extends the megapixel MNIST benchmark to four smaller O2I (object-to-image) ratios ranging from 0.01% to 0.14% while keeping the canvas size fixed and introducing a noise generation component based on B\'ezier curves. Experimental results generalize the observations made on CNNs to IPS whereby the O2I threshold below which the classifier fails to generalize is affected by the training dataset size. We further observe that the magnitude of this interaction differs for each task of the Megapixel MNIST. For tasks "Maj" and "Top", the rate is at its highest, followed by tasks "Max" and "Multi" where in the latter, this rate is almost at 0. Moreover, results show that in a low data setting, tuning the patch size to be smaller relative to the ROI improves generalization, resulting in an improvement of + 15% for the megapixel MNIST and + 5% for the Swedish traffic signs dataset compared to the original object-to-patch ratios in IPS. Further outcomes indicate that the similarity between the thickness of the noise component and the digits in the megapixel MNIST gradually causes IPS to fail to generalize, contributing to previous suspicions.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) scenes with semantic understanding is vital in many robotic applications. Robots need to identify which objects, along with their positions and shapes, to manipulate them precisely with given tasks. Mobile robots, especially, usually use lightweight networks to segment objects on RGB images and then localize them via depth maps; however, they often encounter out-of-distribution scenarios where masks over-cover the objects. In this paper, we address the problem of panoptic segmentation quality in 3D scene reconstruction by refining segmentation errors using non-parametric statistical methods. To enhance mask precision, we map the predicted masks into a depth frame to estimate their distribution via kernel densities. The outliers in depth perception are then rejected without the need for additional parameters in an adaptive manner to out-of-distribution scenarios, followed by 3D reconstruction using projective signed distance functions (SDFs). We validate our method on a synthetic dataset, which shows improvements in both quantitative and qualitative results for panoptic mapping. Through real-world testing, the results furthermore show our method's capability to be deployed on a real-robot system.

- **Summary**: The Audio-Visual Video Parsing task aims to recognize and temporally localize all events occurring in either the audio or visual stream, or both. Capturing accurate event semantics for each audio/visual segment is vital. Prior works directly utilize the extracted holistic audio and visual features for intra- and cross-modal temporal interactions. However, each segment may contain multiple events, resulting in semantically mixed holistic features that can lead to semantic interference during intra- or cross-modal interactions: the event semantics of one segment may incorporate semantics of unrelated events from other segments. To address this issue, our method begins with a Class-Aware Feature Decoupling (CAFD) module, which explicitly decouples the semantically mixed features into distinct class-wise features, including multiple event-specific features and a dedicated background feature. The decoupled class-wise features enable our model to selectively aggregate useful semantics for each segment from clearly matched classes contained in other segments, preventing semantic interference from irrelevant classes. Specifically, we further design a Fine-Grained Semantic Enhancement module for encoding intra- and cross-modal relations. It comprises a Segment-wise Event Co-occurrence Modeling (SECM) block and a Local-Global Semantic Fusion (LGSF) block. The SECM exploits inter-class dependencies of concurrent events within the same timestamp with the aid of a new event co-occurrence loss. The LGSF further enhances the event semantics of each segment by incorporating relevant semantics from more informative global video features. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules and loss functions, resulting in a new state-of-the-art parsing performance.

- **Summary**: Estimating physical properties for visual data is a crucial task in computer vision, graphics, and robotics, underpinning applications such as augmented reality, physical simulation, and robotic grasping. However, this area remains under-explored due to the inherent ambiguities in physical property estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianProperty, a training-free framework that assigns physical properties of materials to 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we integrate the segmentation capability of SAM with the recognition capability of GPT-4V(ision) to formulate a global-local physical property reasoning module for 2D images. Then we project the physical properties from multi-view 2D images to 3D Gaussians using a voting strategy. We demonstrate that 3D Gaussians with physical property annotations enable applications in physics-based dynamic simulation and robotic grasping. For physics-based dynamic simulation, we leverage the Material Point Method (MPM) for realistic dynamic simulation. For robot grasping, we develop a grasping force prediction strategy that estimates a safe force range required for object grasping based on the estimated physical properties. Extensive experiments on material segmentation, physics-based dynamic simulation, and robotic grasping validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, highlighting its crucial role in understanding physical properties from visual data.

- **Summary**: Spanning multiple scales-from macroscopic anatomy down to intricate microscopic architecture-the human brain exemplifies a complex system that demands integrated approaches to fully understand its complexity. Yet, mapping nonlinear relationships between these scales remains challenging due to technical limitations and the high cost of multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquisition. Here, we introduce Macro2Micro, a deep learning framework that predicts brain microstructure from macrostructure using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Grounded in the scale-free, self-similar nature of brain organization-where microscale information can be inferred from macroscale patterns-Macro2Micro explicitly encodes multiscale brain representations into distinct processing branches. To further enhance image fidelity and suppress artifacts, we propose a simple yet effective auxiliary discriminator and learning objective. Our results show that Macro2Micro faithfully translates T1-weighted MRIs into corresponding Fractional Anisotropy (FA) images, achieving a 6.8% improvement in the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) compared to previous methods, while preserving the individual neurobiological characteristics.

- **Summary**: Video face swapping is becoming increasingly popular across various applications, yet existing methods primarily focus on static images and struggle with video face swapping because of temporal consistency and complex scenarios. In this paper, we present the first diffusion-based framework specifically designed for video face swapping. Our approach introduces a novel image-video hybrid training framework that leverages both abundant static image data and temporal video sequences, addressing the inherent limitations of video-only training. The framework incorporates a specially designed diffusion model coupled with a VidFaceVAE that effectively processes both types of data to better maintain temporal coherence of the generated videos. To further disentangle identity and pose features, we construct the Attribute-Identity Disentanglement Triplet (AIDT) Dataset, where each triplet has three face images, with two images sharing the same pose and two sharing the same identity. Enhanced with a comprehensive occlusion augmentation, this dataset also improves robustness against occlusions. Additionally, we integrate 3D reconstruction techniques as input conditioning to our network for handling large pose variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance in identity preservation, temporal consistency, and visual quality compared to existing methods, while requiring fewer inference steps. Our approach effectively mitigates key challenges in video face swapping, including temporal flickering, identity preservation, and robustness to occlusions and pose variations.

- **Summary**: Event-based motion field estimation is an important task. However, current optical flow methods face challenges: learning-based approaches, often frame-based and relying on CNNs, lack cross-domain transferability, while model-based methods, though more robust, are less accurate. To address the limitations of optical flow estimation, recent works have focused on normal flow, which can be more reliably measured in regions with limited texture or strong edges. However, existing normal flow estimators are predominantly model-based and suffer from high errors.   In this paper, we propose a novel supervised point-based method for normal flow estimation that overcomes the limitations of existing event learning-based approaches. Using a local point cloud encoder, our method directly estimates per-event normal flow from raw events, offering multiple unique advantages: 1) It produces temporally and spatially sharp predictions. 2) It supports more diverse data augmentation, such as random rotation, to improve robustness across various domains. 3) It naturally supports uncertainty quantification via ensemble inference, which benefits downstream tasks. 4) It enables training and inference on undistorted data in normalized camera coordinates, improving transferability across cameras. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves better and more consistent performance than state-of-the-art methods when transferred across different datasets. Leveraging this transferability, we train our model on the union of datasets and release it for public use. Finally, we introduce an egomotion solver based on a maximum-margin problem that uses normal flow and IMU to achieve strong performance in challenging scenarios.

- **Summary**: Wearable sensors offer a non-invasive way to collect physical activity (PA) data, with walking as a key component. Existing models often struggle to detect gait bouts in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) involving involuntary movements. We developed J-Net, a deep learning model inspired by U-Net, which uses a pre-trained self-supervised foundation model fine-tuned with Huntington`s disease (HD) in-lab data and paired with a segmentation head for gait detection. J-Net processes wrist-worn accelerometer data to detect gait during daily living. We evaluated J-Net on in-lab and daily-living data from HD, Parkinson`s disease (PD), and controls. J-Net achieved a 10-percentage point improvement in ROC-AUC for HD over existing methods, reaching 0.97 for in-lab data. In daily-living environments, J-Net estimates showed no significant differences in median daily walking time between HD and controls (p = 0.23), in contrast to other models, which indicated counterintuitive results (p < 0.005). Walking time measured by J-Net correlated with the UHDRS-TMS clinical severity score (r=-0.52; p=0.02), confirming its clinical relevance. Fine-tuning J-Net on PD data also improved gait detection over current methods. J-Net`s architecture effectively addresses the challenges of gait detection in severe chorea and offers robust performance in daily living. The dataset and J-Net model are publicly available, providing a resource for further research into NDD-related gait impairments.

- **Summary**: In this study, we explored the potential of utilizing Facial Expression Activations (FEAs) captured via the Meta Quest Pro Virtual Reality (VR) headset for Facial Expression Recognition (FER) in VR settings. Leveraging the EmojiHeroVR Database (EmoHeVRDB), we compared several unimodal approaches and achieved up to 73.02% accuracy for the static FER task with seven emotion categories. Furthermore, we integrated FEA and image data in multimodal approaches, observing significant improvements in recognition accuracy. An intermediate fusion approach achieved the highest accuracy of 80.42%, significantly surpassing the baseline evaluation result of 69.84% reported for EmoHeVRDB's image data. Our study is the first to utilize EmoHeVRDB's unique FEA data for unimodal and multimodal static FER, establishing new benchmarks for FER in VR settings. Our findings highlight the potential of fusing complementary modalities to enhance FER accuracy in VR settings, where conventional image-based methods are severely limited by the occlusion caused by Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs).

- **Summary**: 3D Human Mesh Reconstruction (HMR) from 2D RGB images faces challenges in environments with poor lighting, privacy concerns, or occlusions. These weaknesses of RGB imaging can be complemented by acoustic signals, which are widely available, easy to deploy, and capable of penetrating obstacles. However, no existing methods effectively combine acoustic signals with RGB data for robust 3D HMR. The primary challenges include the low-resolution images generated by acoustic signals and the lack of dedicated processing backbones. We introduce SonicMesh, a novel approach combining acoustic signals with RGB images to reconstruct 3D human mesh. To address the challenges of low resolution and the absence of dedicated processing backbones in images generated by acoustic signals, we modify an existing method, HRNet, for effective feature extraction. We also integrate a universal feature embedding technique to enhance the precision of cross-dimensional feature alignment, enabling SonicMesh to achieve high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that SonicMesh accurately reconstructs 3D human mesh in challenging environments such as occlusions, non-line-of-sight scenarios, and poor lighting.

- **Summary**: Multi-step dexterous manipulation is a fundamental skill in household scenarios, yet remains an underexplored area in robotics. This paper proposes a modular approach, where each step of the manipulation process is addressed with dedicated policies based on effective modality input, rather than relying on a single end-to-end model. To demonstrate this, a dexterous robotic hand performs a manipulation task involving picking up and rotating a box. Guided by insights from neuroscience, the task is decomposed into three sub-skills, 1)reaching, 2)grasping and lifting, and 3)in-hand rotation, based on the dominant sensory modalities employed in the human brain. Each sub-skill is addressed using distinct methods from a practical perspective: a classical controller, a Vision-Language-Action model, and a reinforcement learning policy with force feedback, respectively. We tested the pipeline on a real robot to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. The key contribution of this study lies in presenting a neuroscience-inspired, modality-driven methodology for multi-step dexterous manipulation.

- **Summary**: Font design poses unique challenges for logographic languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK), where thousands of unique characters must be individually crafted. This paper introduces a novel Vision Transformer (ViT)-based model for multi-language font generation, effectively addressing the complexities of both logographic and alphabetic scripts. By leveraging ViT and pretraining with a strong visual pretext task (Masked Autoencoding, MAE), our model eliminates the need for complex design components in prior frameworks while achieving comprehensive results with enhanced generalizability. Remarkably, it can generate high-quality fonts across multiple languages for unseen, unknown, and even user-crafted characters. Additionally, we integrate a Retrieval-Augmented Guidance (RAG) module to dynamically retrieve and adapt style references, improving scalability and real-world applicability. We evaluated our approach in various font generation tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness, adaptability, and scalability.
