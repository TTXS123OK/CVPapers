- **Summary**: While open-source multi-modal language models perform well on simple question answering tasks, they often fail on complex questions that require multiple capabilities, such as fine-grained recognition, visual grounding, and reasoning, and that demand multi-step solutions. We present TACO, a family of multi-modal large action models designed to improve performance on such complex, multi-step, and multi-modal tasks. During inference, TACO produces chains-of-thought-and-action (CoTA), executes intermediate steps by invoking external tools such as OCR, depth estimation and calculator, then integrates both the thoughts and action outputs to produce coherent responses. To train TACO, we create a large dataset of over 1M synthetic CoTA traces generated with GPT-4o and Python programs. We then experiment with various data filtering and mixing techniques and obtain a final subset of 293K high-quality CoTA examples. This dataset enables TACO to learn complex reasoning and action paths, surpassing existing models trained on instruction tuning data with only direct answers. Our model TACO outperforms the instruction-tuned baseline across 8 benchmarks, achieving a 3.6% improvement on average, with gains of up to 15% in MMVet tasks involving OCR, mathematical reasoning, and spatial reasoning. Training on high-quality CoTA traces sets a new standard for complex multi-modal reasoning, highlighting the need for structured, multi-step instruction tuning in advancing open-source mutli-modal models' capabilities.

- **Summary**: Trust in social media is a growing concern due to its ability to influence significant societal changes. However, this space is increasingly compromised by various types of deepfake multimedia, which undermine the authenticity of shared content. Although substantial efforts have been made to address the challenge of deepfake content, existing detection techniques face a major limitation in generalization: they tend to perform well only on specific types of deepfakes they were trained on.This dependency on recognizing specific deepfake artifacts makes current methods vulnerable when applied to unseen or varied deepfakes, thereby compromising their performance in real-world applications such as social media platforms. To address the generalizability of deepfake detection, there is a need for a holistic approach that can capture a broader range of facial attributes and manipulations beyond isolated artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel deepfake detection framework featuring an effective feature descriptor that integrates Deep identity, Behavioral, and Geometric (DBaG) signatures, along with a classifier named DBaGNet. Specifically, the DBaGNet classifier utilizes the extracted DBaG signatures, leveraging a triplet loss objective to enhance generalized representation learning for improved classification. Specifically, the DBaGNet classifier utilizes the extracted DBaG signatures and applies a triplet loss objective to enhance generalized representation learning for improved classification. To test the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed approach, we conduct extensive experiments using six benchmark deepfake datasets: WLDR, CelebDF, DFDC, FaceForensics++, DFD, and NVFAIR. Specifically, to ensure the effectiveness of our approach, we perform cross-dataset evaluations, and the results demonstrate significant performance gains over several state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The denoising process of diffusion models can be interpreted as a projection of noisy samples onto the data manifold. Moreover, the noise level in these samples approximates their distance to the underlying manifold. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method to enhance sample generation by aligning the estimated noise level with the true distance of noisy samples to the manifold. Specifically, we introduce a noise level correction network, leveraging a pre-trained denoising network, to refine noise level estimates during the denoising process. Additionally, we extend this approach to various image restoration tasks by integrating task-specific constraints, including inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization, and compressed sensing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves sample quality in both unconstrained and constrained generation scenarios. Notably, the proposed noise level correction framework is compatible with existing denoising schedulers (e.g., DDIM), offering additional performance improvements.

- **Summary**: With the recent advancements in the field of information industry, critical data in the form of digital images is best understood by the human brain. Therefore, digital images play a significant part and backbone role in many areas such as image processing, vision computing, robotics, and bio-medical. Such use of digital images is practically implementable in various real-time scenarios like biological sciences, medicine, gaming technology, computer information and communication technology, data and statistical science, radiological sciences and medical imaging technology, and medical lab technology. However, when any digital image is sent electronically or captured via camera, it is likely to get corrupted or degraded by the available of degradation factors. To eradicate this problem, several image denoising algorithms have been proposed in the literature focusing on robust, low-cost and fast techniques to improve output performance. Consequently, in this research project, an earnest effort has been made to study various image denoising algorithms. A specific focus is given to the start-of-the-art techniques namely: NL-means, K-SVD, and BM3D. The standard images, natural images, texture images, synthetic images, and images from other datasets have been tested via these algorithms, and a detailed set of convincing results have been provided for efficient comparison.

- **Summary**: Robot description models are essential for simulation and control, yet their creation often requires significant manual effort. To streamline this modeling process, we introduce AutoURDF, an unsupervised approach for constructing description files for unseen robots from point cloud frames. Our method leverages a cluster-based point cloud registration model that tracks the 6-DoF transformations of point clusters. Through analyzing cluster movements, we hierarchically address the following challenges: (1) moving part segmentation, (2) body topology inference, and (3) joint parameter estimation. The complete pipeline produces robot description files that are fully compatible with existing simulators. We validate our method across a variety of robots, using both synthetic and real-world scan data. Results indicate that our approach outperforms previous methods in registration and body topology estimation accuracy, offering a scalable solution for automated robot modeling.

- **Summary**: Learning behavior in legged robots presents a significant challenge due to its inherent instability and complex constraints. Recent research has proposed the use of a large language model (LLM) to generate reward functions in reinforcement learning, thereby replacing the need for manually designed rewards by experts. However, this approach, which relies on textual descriptions to define learning objectives, fails to achieve controllable and precise behavior learning with clear directionality. In this paper, we introduce a new video2reward method, which directly generates reward functions from videos depicting the behaviors to be mimicked and learned. Specifically, we first process videos containing the target behaviors, converting the motion information of individuals in the videos into keypoint trajectories represented as coordinates through a video2text transforming module. These trajectories are then fed into an LLM to generate the reward function, which in turn is used to train the policy. To enhance the quality of the reward function, we develop a video-assisted iterative reward refinement scheme that visually assesses the learned behaviors and provides textual feedback to the LLM. This feedback guides the LLM to continually refine the reward function, ultimately facilitating more efficient behavior learning. Experimental results on tasks involving bipedal and quadrupedal robot motion control demonstrate that our method surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art LLM-based reward generation methods by over 37.6% in terms of human normalized score. More importantly, by switching video inputs, we find our method can rapidly learn diverse motion behaviors such as walking and running.

- **Summary**: Super-resolution (SR) with arbitrary scale factor and cost-and-quality controllability at test time is essential for various applications. While several arbitrary-scale SR methods have been proposed, these methods require us to modify the model structure and retrain it to control the computational cost and SR quality. To address this limitation, we propose a novel SR method using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the Fourier representation. In our method, the RNN sequentially estimates Fourier components, each consisting of frequency and amplitude, and aggregates these components to reconstruct an SR image. Since the RNN can adjust the number of recurrences at test time, we can control the computational cost and SR quality in a single model: fewer recurrences (i.e., fewer Fourier components) lead to lower cost but lower quality, while more recurrences (i.e., more Fourier components) lead to better quality but more cost. Experimental results prove that more Fourier components improve the PSNR score. Furthermore, even with fewer Fourier components, our method achieves a lower PSNR drop than other state-of-the-art arbitrary-scale SR methods.

- **Summary**: Thyroid nodule segmentation in ultrasound images is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. However, existing methods face challenges in segmentation accuracy, interpretability, and generalization, which hinder their performance. This letter proposes a novel framework, CLIP-TNseg, to address these issues by integrating a multimodal large model with a neural network architecture. CLIP-TNseg consists of two main branches: the Coarse-grained Branch, which extracts high-level semantic features from a frozen CLIP model, and the Fine-grained Branch, which captures fine-grained features using U-Net style residual blocks. These features are fused and processed by the prediction head to generate precise segmentation maps. CLIP-TNseg leverages the Coarse-grained Branch to enhance semantic understanding through textual and high-level visual features, while the Fine-grained Branch refines spatial details, enabling precise and robust segmentation. Extensive experiments on public and our newly collected datasets demonstrate its competitive performance. Our code and the original dataset are available at https://github.com/jayxjsun/CLIP-TNseg.

- **Summary**: Proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) can save the lives of industry workers and it is a widely used application of computer vision in the large manufacturing industries. However, most of the applications deployed generate a lot of false alarms (violations) because they tend to generalize the requirements of PPE across the industry and tasks. The key to resolving this issue is to understand the action being performed by the worker and customize the inference for the specific PPE requirements of that action. In this paper, we propose a system that employs activity recognition models to first understand the action being performed and then use object detection techniques to check for violations. This leads to a 23% improvement in the F1-score compared to the PPE-based approach on our test dataset of 109 videos.

- **Summary**: This study introduces an evaluation framework for multimodal models in medical imaging diagnostics. We developed a pipeline incorporating data preprocessing, model inference, and preference-based evaluation, expanding an initial set of 500 clinical cases to 3,000 through controlled augmentation. Our method combined medical images with clinical observations to generate assessments, using Claude 3.5 Sonnet for independent evaluation against physician-authored diagnoses. The results indicated varying performance across models, with Llama 3.2-90B outperforming human diagnoses in 85.27% of cases. In contrast, specialized vision models like BLIP2 and Llava showed preferences in 41.36% and 46.77% of cases, respectively. This framework highlights the potential of large multimodal models to outperform human diagnostics in certain tasks.

- **Summary**: Current image generation models can effortlessly produce high-quality, highly realistic images, but this also increases the risk of misuse. In various Text-to-Image or Image-to-Image tasks, attackers can generate a series of images containing inappropriate content by simply editing the language modality input. Currently, to prevent this security threat, the various guard or defense methods that are proposed also focus on defending the language modality. However, in practical applications, threats in the visual modality, particularly in tasks involving the editing of real-world images, pose greater security risks as they can easily infringe upon the rights of the image owner. Therefore, this paper uses a method named typographic attack to reveal that various image generation models also commonly face threats in the vision modality. Furthermore, we also evaluate the defense performance of various existing methods when facing threats in the vision modality and uncover their ineffectiveness. Finally, we propose the Vision Modal Threats in Image Generation Models (VMT-IGMs) dataset, which would serve as a baseline for evaluating the vision modality vulnerability of various image generation models.

- **Summary**: With the advancement of computer vision, the recently emerged 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has increasingly become a popular scene reconstruction algorithm due to its outstanding performance. Distributed 3DGS can efficiently utilize edge devices to directly train on the collected images, thereby offloading computational demands and enhancing efficiency. However, traditional distributed frameworks often overlook computational and communication challenges in real-world environments, hindering large-scale deployment and potentially posing privacy risks. In this paper, we propose Radiant, a hierarchical 3DGS algorithm designed for large-scale scene reconstruction that considers system heterogeneity, enhancing the model performance and training efficiency. Via extensive empirical study, we find that it is crucial to partition the regions for each edge appropriately and allocate varying camera positions to each device for image collection and training. The core of Radiant is partitioning regions based on heterogeneous environment information and allocating workloads to each device accordingly. Furthermore, we provide a 3DGS model aggregation algorithm that enhances the quality and ensures the continuity of models' boundaries. Finally, we develop a testbed, and experiments demonstrate that Radiant improved reconstruction quality by up to 25.7\% and reduced up to 79.6\% end-to-end latency.

- **Summary**: Realistic scene reconstruction in driving scenarios poses significant challenges due to fast-moving objects. Most existing methods rely on labor-intensive manual labeling of object poses to reconstruct dynamic objects in canonical space and move them based on these poses during rendering. While some approaches attempt to use 3D object trackers to replace manual annotations, the limited generalization of 3D trackers -- caused by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets -- results in inferior reconstructions in real-world settings. In contrast, 2D foundation models demonstrate strong generalization capabilities. To eliminate the reliance on 3D trackers and enhance robustness across diverse environments, we propose a stable object tracking module by leveraging associations from 2D deep trackers within a 3D object fusion strategy. We address inevitable tracking errors by further introducing a motion learning strategy in an implicit feature space that autonomously corrects trajectory errors and recovers missed detections. Experimental results on Waymo-NOTR datasets show we achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be made publicly available.



### GAQAT: gradient-adaptive quantization-aware training for domain generalization

- **Summary**: Research on loss surface geometry, such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), shows that flatter minima improve generalization. Recent studies further reveal that flatter minima can also reduce the domain generalization (DG) gap. However, existing flatness-based DG techniques predominantly operate within a full-precision training process, which is impractical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices that typically rely on lower bit-width representations (e.g., 4 bits, 3 bits). Consequently, low-precision quantization-aware training is critical for optimizing these techniques in real-world applications. In this paper, we observe a significant degradation in performance when applying state-of-the-art DG-SAM methods to quantized models, suggesting that current approaches fail to preserve generalizability during the low-precision training process. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Gradient-Adaptive Quantization-Aware Training (GAQAT) framework for DG. Our approach begins by identifying the scale-gradient conflict problem in low-precision quantization, where the task loss and smoothness loss induce conflicting gradients for the scaling factors of quantizers, with certain layers exhibiting opposing gradient directions. This conflict renders the optimization of quantized weights highly unstable. To mitigate this, we further introduce a mechanism to quantify gradient inconsistencies and selectively freeze the gradients of scaling factors, thereby stabilizing the training process and enhancing out-of-domain generalization. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed GAQAT framework. On PACS, our 3-bit and 4-bit models outperform direct DG-QAT integration by up to 4.5%. On DomainNet, the 4-bit model achieves near-lossless performance compared to full precision, with improvements of 1.39% (4-bit) and 1.06% (3-bit) over the SOTA QAT baseline.

- **Summary**: The academic field of learning instruction-guided visual navigation can be generally categorized into high-level category-specific search and low-level language-guided navigation, depending on the granularity of language instruction, in which the former emphasizes the exploration process, while the latter concentrates on following detailed textual commands. Despite the differing focuses of these tasks, the underlying requirements of interpreting instructions, comprehending the surroundings, and inferring action decisions remain consistent. This paper consolidates diverse navigation tasks into a unified and generic framework -- we investigate the core difficulties of sharing general knowledge and exploiting task-specific capabilities in learning navigation and propose a novel State-Adaptive Mixture of Experts (SAME) model that effectively enables an agent to infer decisions based on different-granularity language and dynamic observations. Powered by SAME, we present a versatile agent capable of addressing seven navigation tasks simultaneously that outperforms or achieves highly comparable performance to task-specific agents.

- **Summary**: The success of Emergency Response (ER) scenarios, such as search and rescue, is often dependent upon the prompt location of a lost or injured person. With the increasing use of small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) as "eyes in the sky" during ER scenarios, efficient detection of persons from aerial views plays a crucial role in achieving a successful mission outcome. Fatigue of human operators during prolonged ER missions, coupled with limited human resources, highlights the need for sUAS equipped with Computer Vision (CV) capabilities to aid in finding the person from aerial views. However, the performance of CV models onboard sUAS substantially degrades under real-life rigorous conditions of a typical ER scenario, where person search is hampered by occlusion and low target resolution. To address these challenges, we extracted images from the NOMAD dataset and performed a crowdsource experiment to collect behavioural measurements when humans were asked to "find the person in the picture". We exemplify the use of our behavioral dataset, Psych-ER, by using its human accuracy data to adapt the loss function of a detection model. We tested our loss adaptation on a RetinaNet model evaluated on NOMAD against increasing distance and occlusion, with our psychophysical loss adaptation showing improvements over the baseline at higher distances across different levels of occlusion, without degrading performance at closer distances. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first human-guided approach to address the location task of a detection model, while addressing real-world challenges of aerial search and rescue.

- **Summary**: The interest in matching non-rigidly deformed shapes represented as raw point clouds is rising due to the proliferation of low-cost 3D sensors. Yet, the task is challenging since point clouds are irregular and there is a lack of intrinsic shape information. We propose to tackle these challenges by learning a new shape representation -- a per-point high dimensional embedding, in an embedding space where semantically similar points share similar embeddings. The learned embedding has multiple beneficial properties: it is aware of the underlying shape geometry and is robust to shape deformations and various shape artefacts, such as noise and partiality. Consequently, this embedding can be directly employed to retrieve high-quality dense correspondences through a simple nearest neighbor search in the embedding space. Extensive experiments demonstrate new state-of-the-art results and robustness in numerous challenging non-rigid shape matching benchmarks and show its great potential in other shape analysis tasks, such as segmentation.

- **Summary**: Speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging yet crucial task due to the inherent complexity and diversity of human emotions. To address this problem, researchers attempt to fuse information from other modalities via multimodal learning. However, existing multimodal fusion techniques often overlook the intricacies of cross-modal interactions, resulting in suboptimal feature representations. In this paper, we propose WavFusion, a multimodal speech emotion recognition framework that addresses critical research problems in effective multimodal fusion, heterogeneity among modalities, and discriminative representation learning. By leveraging a gated cross-modal attention mechanism and multimodal homogeneous feature discrepancy learning, WavFusion demonstrates improved performance over existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. Our work highlights the importance of capturing nuanced cross-modal interactions and learning discriminative representations for accurate multimodal SER. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets (IEMOCAP and MELD) demonstrate that WavFusion succeeds over the state-of-the-art strategies on emotion recognition.

- **Summary**: Text-to-3D generation is a valuable technology in virtual reality and digital content creation. While recent works have pushed the boundaries of text-to-3D generation, producing high-fidelity 3D objects with inefficient prompts and simulating their physics-grounded motion accurately still remain unsolved challenges. To address these challenges, we present an innovative framework that utilizes the Large Language Model (LLM)-refined prompts and diffusion priors-guided Gaussian Splatting (GS) for generating 3D models with accurate appearances and geometric structures. We also incorporate a continuum mechanics-based deformation map and color regularization to synthesize vivid physics-grounded motion for the generated 3D Gaussians, adhering to the conservation of mass and momentum. By integrating text-to-3D generation with physics-grounded motion synthesis, our framework renders photo-realistic 3D objects that exhibit physics-aware motion, accurately reflecting the behaviors of the objects under various forces and constraints across different materials. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality 3D generations with realistic physics-grounded motion.

- **Summary**: In the fast-fashion industry, overproduction and unsold inventory create significant environmental problems. Precise sales forecasts for unreleased items could drastically improve the efficiency and profits of industries. However, predicting the success of entirely new styles is difficult due to the absence of past data and ever-changing trends. Specifically, currently used deterministic models struggle with domain shifts when encountering items outside their training data. The recently proposed diffusion models address this issue using a continuous-time diffusion process. Specifically, these models enable us to predict the sales of new items, mitigating the domain shift challenges encountered by deterministic models. As a result, this paper proposes Dif4FF, a novel two-stage pipeline for New Fashion Product Performance Forecasting (NFPPF) that leverages the power of diffusion models conditioned on multimodal data related to specific clothes. Dif4FF first utilizes a multimodal score-based diffusion model to forecast multiple sales trajectories for various garments over time. The forecasts are refined using a powerful Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) architecture. By leveraging the GCN's capability to capture long-range dependencies within both the temporal and spatial data and seeking the optimal solution between these two dimensions, Dif4FF offers the most accurate and efficient forecasting system available in the literature for predicting the sales of new items. We tested Dif4FF on VISUELLE, the de facto standard for NFPPF, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: While novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes has made significant progress, capturing skeleton models of objects and re-posing them remains a challenging task. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatically discover the associated skeleton model for dynamic objects from videos without the need for object-specific templates. Our approach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting and superpoints to reconstruct dynamic objects. Treating superpoints as rigid parts, we can discover the underlying skeleton model through intuitive cues and optimize it using the kinematic model. Besides, an adaptive control strategy is applied to avoid the emergence of redundant superpoints. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in obtaining re-posable 3D objects. Not only can our approach achieve excellent visual fidelity, but it also allows for the real-time rendering of high-resolution images.

- **Summary**: Traditional domain generalization methods often rely on domain alignment to reduce inter-domain distribution differences and learn domain-invariant representations. However, domain shifts are inherently difficult to eliminate, which limits model generalization. To address this, we propose an innovative framework that enhances data representation quality through probabilistic modeling and contrastive learning, reducing dependence on domain alignment and improving robustness under domain variations. Specifically, we combine deterministic features with uncertainty modeling to capture comprehensive feature distributions. Contrastive learning enforces distribution-level alignment by aligning the mean and covariance of feature distributions, enabling the model to dynamically adapt to domain variations and mitigate distribution shifts. Additionally, we design a frequency-domain-based structural enhancement strategy using discrete wavelet transforms to preserve critical structural details and reduce visual distortions caused by style variations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves segmentation performance, providing a robust solution to domain generalization challenges in medical image segmentation.

- **Summary**: Continuous Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD) aims to continually discover novel classes from unlabelled image sets while maintaining performance on old classes. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework, dubbed Neighborhood Commonality-aware Evolution Network (NCENet) that conquers this task from the perspective of representation learning. Concretely, to learn discriminative representations for novel classes, a Neighborhood Commonality-aware Representation Learning (NCRL) is designed, which exploits local commonalities derived neighborhoods to guide the learning of representational differences between instances of different classes. To maintain the representation ability for old classes, a Bi-level Contrastive Knowledge Distillation (BCKD) module is designed, which leverages contrastive learning to perceive the learning and learned knowledge and conducts knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate the superior performance of NCENet compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. Particularly, in the last incremental learning session on CIFAR100, the clustering accuracy of NCENet outperforms the second-best method by a margin of 3.09\% on old classes and by a margin of 6.32\% on new classes. Our code will be publicly available at \href{https://github.com/xjtuYW/NCENet.git}{https://github.com/xjtuYW/NCENet.git}. \end{abstract}

- **Summary**: Three-dimensional (3D) point clouds are becoming more and more popular for representing 3D objects and scenes. Due to limited network bandwidth, efficient compression of 3D point clouds is crucial. To tackle this challenge, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) is actively developing the Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC) standard, incorporating innovative methods to optimize compression, such as the Region-Adaptive Hierarchical Transform (RAHT) nestled within a layer-by-layer octree-tree structure. Nevertheless, a notable problem still exists in RAHT, i.e., the proportion of zero residuals in the last few RAHT layers leads to unnecessary bitrate consumption. To address this problem, we propose an adaptive skip coding method for RAHT, which adaptively determines whether to encode the residuals of the last several layers or not, thereby improving the coding efficiency. In addition, we propose a rate-distortion cost calculation method associated with an adaptive Lagrange multiplier. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves average Bj{\o}ntegaard rate improvements of -3.50%, -5.56%, and -4.18% for the Luma, Cb, and Cr components, respectively, on dynamic point clouds, when compared with the state-of-the-art G-PCC reference software under the common test conditions recommended by MPEG.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised anomaly detection in brain imaging is challenging. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised masked mesh learning for unsupervised anomaly detection in 3D cortical surfaces. Our framework leverages the intrinsic geometry of the cortical surface to learn a self-supervised representation that captures the underlying structure of the brain. We introduce a masked mesh convolutional neural network (MMN) that learns to predict masked regions of the cortical surface. By training the MMN on a large dataset of healthy subjects, we learn a representation that captures the normal variation in the cortical surface. We then use this representation to detect anomalies in unseen individuals by calculating anomaly scores based on the reconstruction error of the MMN. We evaluate our framework by training on population-scale dataset UKB and HCP-Aging and testing on two datasets of Alzheimer's disease patients ADNI and OASIS3. Our results show that our framework can detect anomalies in cortical thickness, cortical volume, and cortical sulcus features, which are known to be sensitive biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. Our proposed framework provides a promising approach for unsupervised anomaly detection based on normative variation of cortical features.

- **Summary**: Spatial phase unwrapping is a key technique for extracting phase information to obtain 3D morphology and other features. Modern industrial measurement scenarios demand high precision, large image sizes, and high speed. However, conventional methods struggle with noise resistance and processing speed. Current deep learning methods are limited by the receptive field size and sparse semantic information, making them ineffective for large size images. To address this issue, we propose a mutual self-distillation (MSD) mechanism and adaptive boosting ensemble segmenters to construct a universal multi-size phase unwrapping network (UMSPU). MSD performs hierarchical attention refinement and achieves cross-layer collaborative learning through bidirectional distillation, ensuring fine-grained semantic representation across image sizes. The adaptive boosting ensemble segmenters combine weak segmenters with different receptive fields into a strong one, ensuring stable segmentation across spatial frequencies. Experimental results show that UMSPU overcomes image size limitations, achieving high precision across image sizes ranging from 256*256 to 2048*2048 (an 8 times increase). It also outperforms existing methods in speed, robustness, and generalization. Its practicality is further validated in structured light imaging and InSAR. We believe that UMSPU offers a universal solution for phase unwrapping, with broad potential for industrial applications.

- **Summary**: Breast cancer stands as a prevalent cause of fatality among females on a global scale, with prompt detection playing a pivotal role in diminishing mortality rates. The utilization of ultrasound scans in the BUSI dataset for medical imagery pertaining to breast cancer has exhibited commendable segmentation outcomes through the application of UNet and UNet++ networks. Nevertheless, a notable drawback of these models resides in their inattention towards the temporal aspects embedded within the images. This research endeavors to enrich the UNet++ architecture by integrating LSTM layers and self-attention mechanisms to exploit temporal characteristics for segmentation purposes. Furthermore, the incorporation of a Multiscale Feature Extraction Module aims to grasp varied scale features within the UNet++. Through the amalgamation of our proposed methodology with data augmentation on the BUSI with GT dataset, an accuracy rate of 98.88%, specificity of 99.53%, precision of 95.34%, sensitivity of 91.20%, F1-score of 93.74, and Dice coefficient of 92.74% are achieved. These findings demonstrate competitiveness with cutting-edge techniques outlined in existing literature.

- **Summary**: Object detection is a significant field in autonomous driving. Popular sensors for this task include cameras and LiDAR sensors. LiDAR sensors offer several advantages, such as insensitivity to light changes, like in a dark setting and the ability to provide 3D information in the form of point clouds, which include the ranges of objects. However, 3D detection methods, such as PointPillars, typically require high-power hardware. Additionally, most common spinning LiDARs are sparse and may not achieve the desired quality of object detection in front of the car. In this paper, we present the feasibility of performing real-time 3D object detection of cars using 3D point clouds from a LiDAR sensor, processed and deployed on a low-power Hailo-8 AI accelerator. The LiDAR sensor used in this study is the InnovizOne sensor, which captures objects in higher quality compared to spinning LiDAR techniques, especially for distant objects. We successfully achieved real-time inference at a rate of approximately 5Hz with a high accuracy of 0.91% F1 score, with only -0.2% degradation compared to running the same model on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. This work demonstrates that effective real-time 3D object detection can be achieved on low-cost, low-power hardware, representing a significant step towards more accessible autonomous driving technologies.

- **Summary**: The concept of function and affordance is a critical aspect of 3D scene understanding and supports task-oriented objectives. In this work, we develop a model that learns to structure and vary functional affordance across a 3D hierarchical scene graph representing the spatial organization of a scene. The varying functional affordance is designed to integrate with the varying spatial context of the graph. More specifically, we develop an algorithm that learns to construct a 3D hierarchical scene graph (3DHSG) that captures the spatial organization of the scene. Starting from segmented object point clouds and object semantic labels, we develop a 3DHSG with a top node that identifies the room label, child nodes that define local spatial regions inside the room with region-specific affordances, and grand-child nodes indicating object locations and object-specific affordances. To support this work, we create a custom 3DHSG dataset that provides ground truth data for local spatial regions with region-specific affordances and also object-specific affordances for each object. We employ a transformer-based model to learn the 3DHSG. We use a multi-task learning framework that learns both room classification and learns to define spatial regions within the room with region-specific affordances. Our work improves on the performance of state-of-the-art baseline models and shows one approach for applying transformer models to 3D scene understanding and the generation of 3DHSGs that capture the spatial organization of a room. The code and dataset are publicly available.

- **Summary**: With the ever-increasing volumes of the Earth observation data present in the archives of large programmes such as Copernicus, there is a growing need for efficient vector representations of the underlying raw data. The approach of extracting feature representations from pretrained deep neural networks is a powerful approach that can provide semantic abstractions of the input data. However, the way this is done for imagery archives containing geospatial data has not yet been defined. In this work, an extension is proposed to an existing community project, Major TOM, focused on the provision and standardization of open and free AI-ready datasets for Earth observation. Furthermore, four global and dense embedding datasets are released openly and for free along with the publication of this manuscript, resulting in the most comprehensive global open dataset of geospatial visual embeddings in terms of covered Earth's surface.

- **Summary**: Recent work has established the ecological importance of developing algorithms for identifying animals individually from images. Typically, a separate algorithm is trained for each species, a natural step but one that creates significant barriers to wide-spread use: (1) each effort is expensive, requiring data collection, data curation, and model training, deployment, and maintenance, (2) there is little training data for many species, and (3) commonalities in appearance across species are not exploited. We propose an alternative approach focused on training multi-species individual identification (re-id) models. We construct a dataset that includes 49 species, 37K individual animals, and 225K images, using this data to train a single embedding network for all species. Our model employs an EfficientNetV2 backbone and a sub-center ArcFace loss function with dynamic margins. We evaluate the performance of this multispecies model in several ways. Most notably, we demonstrate that it consistently outperforms models trained separately on each species, achieving an average gain of 12.5% in top-1 accuracy. Furthermore, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot performance and fine-tuning capabilities for new species with limited training data, enabling effective curation of new species through both incremental addition of data to the training set and fine-tuning without the original data. Additionally, our model surpasses the recent MegaDescriptor on unseen species, averaging an 19.2% top-1 improvement per species and showing gains across all 33 species tested. The fully-featured code repository is publicly available on GitHub, and the feature extractor model can be accessed on HuggingFace for seamless integration with wildlife re-identification pipelines. The model is already in production use for 60+ species in a large-scale wildlife monitoring system.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), originally built on a 2D Vision Transformer (ViT), excels at capturing global patterns in 2D natural images but struggles with 3D medical imaging modalities like CT and MRI. These modalities require capturing spatial information in volumetric space for tasks such as organ segmentation and tumor quantification. To address this challenge, we introduce RefSAM3D, which adapts SAM for 3D medical imaging by incorporating a 3D image adapter and cross-modal reference prompt generation. Our approach modifies the visual encoder to handle 3D inputs and enhances the mask decoder for direct 3D mask generation. We also integrate textual prompts to improve segmentation accuracy and consistency in complex anatomical scenarios. By employing a hierarchical attention mechanism, our model effectively captures and integrates information across different scales. Extensive evaluations on multiple medical imaging datasets demonstrate the superior performance of RefSAM3D over state-of-the-art methods. Our contributions advance the application of SAM in accurately segmenting complex anatomical structures in medical imaging.

- **Summary**: Detecting objects occupying only small areas in an image is difficult, even for humans. Therefore, annotating small-size object instances is hard and thus costly. This study questions common sense by asking the following: is annotating small-size instances worth its cost? We restate it as the following verifiable question: can we detect small-size instances with a detector trained using training data free of small-size instances? We evaluate a method that upscales input images at test time and a method that downscales images at training time. The experiments conducted using the COCO dataset show the following. The first method, together with a remedy to narrow the domain gap between training and test inputs, achieves at least comparable performance to the baseline detector trained using complete training data. Although the method needs to apply the same detector twice to an input image with different scaling, we show that its distillation yields a single-path detector that performs equally well to the same baseline detector. These results point to the necessity of rethinking the annotation of training data for object detection.

- **Summary**: Large pretrained diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generation capabilities and have been adapted to various downstream tasks. However, unlike Large Language Models (LLMs) that can learn multiple tasks in a single model based on instructed data, diffusion models always require additional branches, task-specific training strategies, and losses for effective adaptation to different downstream tasks. This task-specific fine-tuning approach brings two drawbacks. 1) The task-specific additional networks create gaps between pretraining and fine-tuning which hinders the transfer of pretrained knowledge. 2) It necessitates careful additional network design, raising the barrier to learning and implementation, and making it less user-friendly. Thus, a question arises: Can we achieve a simple, efficient, and general approach to fine-tune diffusion models? To this end, we propose ONE-PIC. It enhances the inherited generative ability in the pretrained diffusion models without introducing additional modules. Specifically, we propose In-Visual-Context Tuning, which constructs task-specific training data by arranging source images and target images into a single image. This approach makes downstream fine-tuning closer to the pertaining, allowing our model to adapt more quickly to various downstream tasks. Moreover, we propose a Masking Strategy to unify different generative tasks. This strategy transforms various downstream fine-tuning tasks into predictions of the masked portions. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method is simple and efficient which streamlines the adaptation process and achieves excellent performance with lower costs.

However, producing high-quality outputs typically necessitates large transformer models, which result in substantial training and inference overhead. In this work, we investigate an alternative approach involving multiple experts for denoising, and introduce Remix-DiT, a novel method designed to enhance output quality at a low cost. The goal of Remix-DiT is to craft N diffusion experts for different denoising timesteps, yet without the need for expensive training of N independent models. To achieve this, Remix-DiT employs K basis models (where K < N) and utilizes learnable mixing coefficients to adaptively craft expert models. This design offers two significant advantages: first, although the total model size is increased, the model produced by the mixing operation shares the same architecture as a plain model, making the overall model as efficient as a standard diffusion transformer. Second, the learnable mixing adaptively allocates model capacity across timesteps, thereby effectively improving generation quality. Experiments conducted on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that Remix-DiT achieves promising results compared to standard diffusion transformers and other multiple-expert methods.

- **Summary**: Brain aging involves structural and functional changes and therefore serves as a key biomarker for brain health. Combining structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has the potential to improve brain age estimation by leveraging complementary data. However, fMRI data, being noisier than sMRI, complicates multimodal fusion. Traditional fusion methods often introduce more noise than useful information, which can reduce accuracy compared to using sMRI alone. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal framework for biological brain age estimation, utilizing a sex-aware adversarial variational autoencoder (SA-AVAE). Our framework integrates adversarial and variational learning to effectively disentangle the latent features from both modalities. Specifically, we decompose the latent space into modality-specific codes and shared codes to represent complementary and common information across modalities, respectively. To enhance the disentanglement, we introduce cross-reconstruction and shared-distinct distance ratio loss as regularization terms. Importantly, we incorporate sex information into the learned latent code, enabling the model to capture sex-specific aging patterns for brain age estimation via an integrated regressor module. We evaluate our model using the publicly available OpenBHB dataset, a comprehensive multi-site dataset for brain age estimation. The results from ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing approaches and shows significant robustness across various age groups, highlighting its potential for real-time clinical applications in the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases.

- **Summary**: Multi-step prediction models, such as diffusion and rectified flow models, have emerged as state-of-the-art solutions for generation tasks. However, these models exhibit higher latency in sampling new frames compared to single-step methods. This latency issue becomes a significant bottleneck when adapting such methods for video prediction tasks, given that a typical 60-second video comprises approximately 1.5K frames. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to modeling the multi-step process, aimed at alleviating latency constraints and facilitating the adaptation of such processes for video prediction tasks. Our approach not only reduces the number of sample steps required to predict the next frame but also minimizes computational demands by reducing the model size to one-third of the original size. We evaluate our method on standard video prediction datasets, including KTH, BAIR action robot, Human3.6M and UCF101, demonstrating its efficacy in achieving state-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Camera-based photoplethysmography (PPG) obtained from smartphones has shown great promise for personalized healthcare and secure authentication. This paper presents a multimodal biometric system that integrates PPG signals extracted from videos with fingerprint data to enhance the accuracy of user verification. The system requires users to place their fingertip on the camera lens for a few seconds, allowing the capture and processing of unique biometric characteristics. Our approach employs a neural network with two structured state-space model (SSM) encoders to manage the distinct modalities. Fingerprint images are transformed into pixel sequences, and along with segmented PPG waveforms, they are input into the encoders. A cross-modal attention mechanism then extracts refined feature representations, and a distribution-oriented contrastive loss function aligns these features within a unified latent space. Experimental results demonstrate the system's superior performance across various evaluation metrics in both single-session and dual-session authentication scenarios.

- **Summary**: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that can result in significant cognitive impairment and dementia. Accurate and timely diagnosis is essential for effective treatment and management of this disease. In this study, we proposed two low-parameter Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), IR-BRAINNET and Modified-DEMNET, designed to detect the early stages of AD accurately. We also introduced an ensemble model that averages their outputs to reduce variance across the CNNs and enhance AD detection. Both CNNs are trained, and all models are evaluated using a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) dataset from the Kaggle database. The dataset includes images of four stages of dementia, with an uneven class distribution. To mitigate challenges stemming from the inherent imbalance in the dataset, we employed the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate additional instances for minority classes. In the NO-SMOTE scenario, despite the imbalanced distribution, the ensemble model achieved 98.28% accuracy, outperforming IR-BRAINNET (97.26%) and Modified-DEMNET (95.54%), with Wilcoxon p-values of 2.9e-3 and 5.20e-6, respectively, indicating significant improvement in correct predictions through the use of the average function. In the SMOTE scenario, the ensemble model achieved 99.92% accuracy (1.64% improvement over NO-SMOTE), IR-BRAINNET reached 99.80% (2.54% improvement), and Modified-DEMNET attained 99.72% (4.18% improvement). Based on the experimental findings, averaging the models' outputs enhanced AD diagnosis in both scenarios, while the diversity in the dataset introduced by SMOTE-generated instances significantly improved performance. Furthermore, the compact models we proposed outperformed those from previous studies, even in the presence of an imbalanced distribution.

- **Summary**: Deepfakes are on the rise, with increased sophistication and prevalence allowing for high-profile social engineering attacks. Detecting them in the wild is therefore important as ever, giving rise to new approaches breaking benchmark records in this task. In line with previous work, we show that recently developed state-of-the-art detectors are susceptible to classical adversarial attacks, even in a highly-realistic black-box setting, putting their usability in question. We argue that crucial 'robust features' of deepfakes are in their higher semantics, and follow that with evidence that a detector based on a semantic embedding model is less susceptible to black-box perturbation attacks. We show that large visuo-lingual models like GPT-4o can perform zero-shot deepfake detection better than current state-of-the-art methods, and introduce a novel attack based on high-level semantic manipulation. Finally, we argue that hybridising low- and high-level detectors can improve adversarial robustness, based on their complementary strengths and weaknesses.

- **Summary**: Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RS VLMs) have made much progress in the tasks of remote sensing (RS) image comprehension. While performing well in multi-modal reasoning and multi-turn conversations, the existing models lack pixel-level understanding and struggle with multi-image inputs. In this work, we propose RSUniVLM, a unified, end-to-end RS VLM designed for comprehensive vision understanding across multiple granularity, including image-level, region-level, and pixel-level tasks. RSUniVLM also performs effectively in multi-image analysis, with instances of change detection and change captioning. To enhance the model's ability to capture visual information at different levels without increasing model size, we design a novel architecture called Granularity-oriented Mixture of Experts to constraint the model to about 1 billion parameters. We also construct a large-scale RS instruction-following dataset based on a variety of existing datasets in both RS and general domain, encompassing various tasks such as object localization, visual question answering, and semantic segmentation. Substantial experiments have been conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed RSUniVLM up to state-of-the-art across various RS tasks. Code and model will be available at \href{https://github.com/xuliu-cyber/RSUniVLM}{here}.

- **Summary**: Visual-textual inconsistency (VTI) evaluation plays a crucial role in cleansing vision-language data. Its main challenges stem from the high variety of image captioning datasets, where differences in content can create a range of inconsistencies (\eg, inconsistencies in scene, entities, entity attributes, entity numbers, entity interactions). Moreover, variations in caption length can introduce inconsistencies at different levels of granularity as well. To tackle these challenges, we design an adaptive evaluation framework, called Hierarchical and Multi-Grained Inconsistency Evaluation (HMGIE), which can provide multi-grained evaluations covering both accuracy and completeness for various image-caption pairs. Specifically, the HMGIE framework is implemented by three consecutive modules. Firstly, the semantic graph generation module converts the image caption to a semantic graph for building a structural representation of all involved semantic items. Then, the hierarchical inconsistency evaluation module provides a progressive evaluation procedure with a dynamic question-answer generation and evaluation strategy guided by the semantic graph, producing a hierarchical inconsistency evaluation graph (HIEG). Finally, the quantitative evaluation module calculates the accuracy and completeness scores based on the HIEG, followed by a natural language explanation about the detection results. Moreover, to verify the efficacy and flexibility of the proposed framework on handling different image captioning datasets, we construct MVTID, an image-caption dataset with diverse types and granularities of inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on MVTID and other benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed HMGIE to current state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Interpreting complex neural networks is crucial for understanding their decision-making processes, particularly in applications where transparency and accountability are essential. This proposed method addresses this need by focusing on layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), a technique used in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to attribute neural network outputs to input features through backpropagated relevance scores. Existing LRP methods often struggle with precision in evaluating individual neuron contributions. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel approach that improves the parsing of selected neurons during LRP backward propagation, using the Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) architecture as a case study. Our method creates neural network graphs to highlight critical paths and visualizes these paths with heatmaps, optimizing neuron selection through accuracy metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). Additionally, we utilize a deconvolutional visualization technique to reconstruct feature maps, offering a comprehensive view of the network's inner workings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances interpretability and supports the development of more transparent artificial intelligence (AI) systems for computer vision applications. This advancement has the potential to improve the trustworthiness of AI models in real-world machine vision applications, thereby increasing their reliability and effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Remote Sensing (RS) image deblurring and Super-Resolution (SR) are common tasks in computer vision that aim at restoring RS image detail and spatial scale, respectively. However, real-world RS images often suffer from a complex combination of global low-resolution (LR) degeneration and local blurring degeneration. Although carefully designed deblurring and SR models perform well on these two tasks individually, a unified model that performs jointly RS image deblurring and super-resolution (JRSIDSR) task is still challenging due to the vital dilemma of reconstructing the global and local degeneration simultaneously. Additionally, existing methods struggle to capture the interrelationship between deblurring and SR processes, leading to suboptimal results. To tackle these issues, we give a unified theoretical analysis of RS images' spatial and blur degeneration processes and propose a dual-branch parallel network named AKMD-Net for the JRSIDSR task. AKMD-Net consists of two main branches: deblurring and super-resolution branches. In the deblurring branch, we design a pixel-adjustable kernel block (PAKB) to estimate the local and spatial-varying blur kernels. In the SR branch, a multi-domain attention block (MDAB) is proposed to capture the global contextual information enhanced with high-frequency details. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive feature fusion (AFF) module to model the contextual relationships between the deblurring and SR branches. Finally, we design an adaptive Wiener loss (AW Loss) to depress the prior noise in the reconstructed images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AKMD-Net achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) quantitative and qualitative performance on commonly used RS image datasets.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in high-fidelity dynamic scene reconstruction have leveraged dynamic 3D Gaussians and 4D Gaussian Splatting for realistic scene representation. However, to make these methods viable for real-time applications such as AR/VR, gaming, and rendering on low-power devices, substantial reductions in memory usage and improvements in rendering efficiency are required. While many state-of-the-art methods prioritize lightweight implementations, they struggle in handling scenes with complex motions or long sequences. In this work, we introduce Temporally Compressed 3D Gaussian Splatting (TC3DGS), a novel technique designed specifically to effectively compress dynamic 3D Gaussian representations. TC3DGS selectively prunes Gaussians based on their temporal relevance and employs gradient-aware mixed-precision quantization to dynamically compress Gaussian parameters. It additionally relies on a variation of the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm in a post-processing step to further reduce storage by interpolating Gaussian trajectories across frames. Our experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that TC3DGS achieves up to 67$\times$ compression with minimal or no degradation in visual quality.

- **Summary**: Detecting road obstacles is essential for autonomous vehicles to navigate dynamic and complex traffic environments safely. Current road obstacle detection methods typically assign a score to each pixel and apply a threshold to generate final predictions. However, selecting an appropriate threshold is challenging, and the per-pixel classification approach often leads to fragmented predictions with numerous false positives. In this work, we propose a novel method that leverages segment-level features from visual foundation models and likelihood ratios to predict road obstacles directly. By focusing on segments rather than individual pixels, our approach enhances detection accuracy, reduces false positives, and offers increased robustness to scene variability. We benchmark our approach against existing methods on the RoadObstacle and LostAndFound datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance without needing a predefined threshold.

- **Summary**: One-to-many facial identification is documented to achieve high accuracy in the case where both the probe and the gallery are `mugshot quality' images. However, an increasing number of documented instances of wrongful arrest following one-to-many facial identification have raised questions about its accuracy. Probe images used in one-to-many facial identification are often cropped from frames of surveillance video and deviate from `mugshot quality' in various ways. This paper systematically explores how the accuracy of one-to-many facial identification is degraded by the person in the probe image choosing to wear dark sunglasses. We show that sunglasses degrade accuracy for mugshot-quality images by an amount similar to strong blur or noticeably lower resolution. Further, we demonstrate that the combination of sunglasses with blur or lower resolution results in even more pronounced loss in accuracy. These results have important implications for developing objective criteria to qualify a probe image for the level of accuracy to be expected if it used for one-to-many identification. To ameliorate the accuracy degradation caused by dark sunglasses, we show that it is possible to recover about 38% of the lost accuracy by synthetically adding sunglasses to all the gallery images, without model re-training. We also show that increasing the representation of wearing-sunglasses images in the training set can largely reduce the error rate. The image set assembled for this research will be made available to support replication and further research into this problem.

- **Summary**: Contemporary Text-to-Image (T2I) models frequently depend on qualitative human evaluations to assess the consistency between synthesized images and the text prompts. There is a demand for quantitative and automatic evaluation tools, given that human evaluation lacks reproducibility. We believe that an effective T2I evaluation metric should accomplish the following: detect instances where the generated images do not align with the textual prompts, a discrepancy we define as the `hallucination problem' in T2I tasks; record the types and frequency of hallucination issues, aiding users in understanding the causes of errors; and provide a comprehensive and intuitive scoring that close to human standard. To achieve these objectives, we propose a method based on large language models (LLMs) for conducting question-answering with an extracted scene-graph and created a dataset with human-rated scores for generated images. From the methodology perspective, we combine knowledge-enhanced question-answering tasks with image evaluation tasks, making the evaluation metrics more controllable and easier to interpret. For the contribution on the dataset side, we generated 12,000 synthesized images based on 1,000 composited prompts using three advanced T2I models. Subsequently, we conduct human scoring on all synthesized images and prompt pairs to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of our method as an evaluation metric. All generated images and the human-labeled scores will be made publicly available in the future to facilitate ongoing research on this crucial issue. Extensive experiments show that our method aligns more closely with human scoring patterns than other evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proven to be a powerful tool in generating artistic images, capable of mimicking the styles of renowned painters, such as Claude Monet. This paper introduces a tiered GAN model to progressively refine image quality through a multi-stage process, enhancing the generated images at each step. The model transforms random noise into detailed artistic representations, addressing common challenges such as instability in training, mode collapse, and output quality. This approach combines downsampling and convolutional techniques, enabling the generation of high-quality Monet-style artwork while optimizing computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the architecture's ability to produce foundational artistic structures, though further refinements are necessary for achieving higher levels of realism and fidelity to Monet's style. Future work focuses on improving training methodologies and model complexity to bridge the gap between generated and true artistic images. Additionally, the limitations of traditional GANs in artistic generation are analyzed, and strategies to overcome these shortcomings are proposed.

- **Summary**: The commonsense reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), especially in abductive reasoning and defeasible reasoning, remain poorly understood. Most benchmarks focus on typical visual scenarios, making it difficult to discern whether model performance stems from keen perception and reasoning skills, or reliance on pure statistical recall. We argue that by focusing on atypical events in videos, clearer insights can be gained on the core capabilities of VLMs. Explaining and understanding such out-of-distribution events requires models to extend beyond basic pattern recognition and regurgitation of their prior knowledge. To this end, we introduce BlackSwanSuite, a benchmark for evaluating VLMs' ability to reason about unexpected events through abductive and defeasible tasks. Our tasks artificially limit the amount of visual information provided to models while questioning them about hidden unexpected events, or provide new visual information that could change an existing hypothesis about the event. We curate a comprehensive benchmark suite comprising over 3,800 MCQ, 4,900 generative and 6,700 yes/no tasks, spanning 1,655 videos. After extensively evaluating various state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, as well as open-source VLMs such as LLaVA-Video, we find significant performance gaps of up to 32% from humans on these tasks. Our findings reveal key limitations in current VLMs, emphasizing the need for enhanced model architectures and training strategies.

- **Summary**: In this study, we developed a customized instance segmentation model by integrating the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) with the YOLO11 architecture. This model, trained on a mixed dataset of dormant and canopy season apple orchard images, aimed to enhance the segmentation of tree trunks and branches under varying seasonal conditions throughout the year. The model was individually validated across dormant and canopy season images after training the YOLO11-CBAM on the mixed dataset collected over the two seasons. Additional testing of the model during pre-bloom, flower bloom, fruit thinning, and harvest season was performed. The highest recall and precision metrics were observed in the YOLO11x-seg-CBAM and YOLO11m-seg-CBAM respectively. Particularly, YOLO11m-seg with CBAM showed the highest precision of 0.83 as performed for the Trunk class in training, while without the CBAM, YOLO11m-seg achieved 0.80 precision score for the Trunk class. Likewise, for branch class, YOLO11m-seg with CBAM achieved the highest precision score value of 0.75 while without the CBAM, the YOLO11m-seg achieved a precision of 0.73. For dormant season validation, YOLO11x-seg exhibited the highest precision at 0.91. Canopy season validation highlighted YOLO11s-seg with superior precision across all classes, achieving 0.516 for Branch, and 0.64 for Trunk. The modeling approach, trained on two season datasets as dormant and canopy season images, demonstrated the potential of the YOLO11-CBAM integration to effectively detect and segment tree trunks and branches year-round across all seasonal variations.

- **Summary**: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) involves retrieving a target image based on a composed query of an image paired with text that specifies modifications or changes to the visual reference. CIR is inherently an instruction-following task, as the model needs to interpret and apply modifications to the image. In practice, due to the scarcity of annotated data in downstream tasks, Zero-Shot CIR (ZS-CIR) is desirable. While existing ZS-CIR models based on CLIP have shown promising results, their capability in interpreting and following modification instructions remains limited. Some research attempts to address this by incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these approaches still face challenges in effectively integrating multimodal information and instruction understanding. To tackle above challenges, we propose a novel embedding method utilizing an instruction-tuned Multimodal LLM (MLLM) to generate composed representation, which significantly enhance the instruction following capability for a comprehensive integration between images and instructions. Nevertheless, directly applying MLLMs introduces a new challenge since MLLMs are primarily designed for text generation rather than embedding extraction as required in CIR. To address this, we introduce a two-stage training strategy to efficiently learn a joint multimodal embedding space and further refining the ability to follow modification instructions by tuning the model in a triplet dataset similar to the CIR format. Extensive experiments on four public datasets: FashionIQ, CIRR, GeneCIS, and CIRCO demonstrates the superior performance of our model, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin.

- **Summary**: Research ultrasound scanners such as the Verasonics Vantage often lack the advanced image processing algorithms used by clinical systems. Image quality is even lower in plane wave imaging - often used for shear wave elasticity imaging (SWEI) - which sacrifices spatial resolution for temporal resolution. As a result, delay-and-summed images acquired from SWEI have limited interpretability. In this project, a two-stage machine learning model was trained to enhance single plane wave images of muscle acquired with a Verasonics Vantage system. The first stage of the model consists of a U-Net trained to emulate plane wave compounding, histogram matching, and unsharp masking using paired images. The second stage consists of a CycleGAN trained to emulate clinical muscle B-modes using unpaired images. This two-stage model was implemented on the Verasonics Vantage research ultrasound scanner, and its ability to provide high-speed image formation at a frame rate of 28.5 +/- 0.6 FPS from a single plane wave transmit was demonstrated. A reader study with two physicians demonstrated that these processed images had significantly greater structural fidelity and less speckle than the original plane wave images.
